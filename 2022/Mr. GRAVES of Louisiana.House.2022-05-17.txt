 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Texas for the recognition and the yielding of time today.   Mr. Speaker, I spent, like you, much time in Louisiana visiting small  businesses and visiting with people who are just trying to make ends  meet. It was National Small Business Week a few weeks ago. Visiting  businesses, I heard over and over and over again the pervasive impact,  the incredible impact, of high gasoline and high energy prices.   Stephanie Towns in Chicago said: I have got kids. I have got to get  them to school every day. The gas prices are just so high, I can't make  it.   Mr. Speaker, we have had people talk about the inability to visit and  take care of grandchildren, the inability to fuel their cars to go to  work, the inability to even buy groceries because of the profound cost  that we have seen related to energy and related to gasoline.                                time  1300    But this shouldn't have been a surprise to anybody. During the  campaign, President Biden said: ``We are going to phase out fossil  fuels.'' ``I guarantee you we are going to end fossil fuel.''   The Secretary of the Interior, the Cabinet official responsible for  producing American energy, said, ``I am wholeheartedly against fracking  and drilling on public lands.''   Incredible, incredible statements.   I will say it again. None of this stuff should be a surprise to  anybody. This is a post we put up on January 27 of last year, and we  said, ``As a result of President Biden's energy policies, this is  exactly what is going to happen.'' Let me say it again, January 27 of  last year, 6 days after some of these policies. We are going to have  higher electricity bills, higher prices at the gas pump, lost revenue  for hurricane protection and flood control and coastal restoration  because there is revenue sharing. That is where these dollars go--I  have no idea what the President is going to tell these communities  whenever we end up having another hurricane on the Gulf Coast--higher  delivery costs that would be passed on to consumers; more dependence on  foreign energy sources like Iran, Russia, China, and other countries  that don't share American values; and a net increase in global  emissions.   I remind you, Mr. Speaker, under President Trump, we saw emissions go  down an average of 2.5 percent per year. Under President Biden, we have  seen them go up 6.3 percent.   Why is this happening? We have seen this administration try to blame  price gouging, try to say that we are going to fix it through the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve releases. We have heard him even say that  we are going to come in, and this is a result of what is happening with  Ukraine and Russia.   But let me go back to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. As a result of  their announcement to release all of this oil, guess what has happened?  China has bought some of it and others. We have actually moved it from  one storage cavern to another, and they are paying to store it in the  other place. It doesn't make any sense.   Meanwhile, prices have only gone up. I have a feeling Bigfoot and the  Loch Ness Monster are going to be the next responsible entities for  higher energy prices.   Don't take my word for it. Look, the Blackstone CEO said we are going  to end up with a real shortage of energy. What happens when you have a  shortage of supply? Prices go up. If we have a shortage, it is just  going to cost more, and it is probably going to cost a lot more;  exactly what we have seen. The Blackstone CEO says if you try to raise  money to drill holes, it is almost impossible to get that money. They  have prevented access.   Here are the real reasons this administration came out and, on the  first day, issued an executive order saying that they were going to ban  new oil and gas production in the United States. Under this  administration, under the Biden administration, we have nearly tripled  dependence on Russian oil. They, through this House of Representatives,  passed a bill with up to a $10,000 a mile a year pipeline fee. They  have increased royalty rates through this House of Representatives by  up to 50 percent, and the administration unilaterally announced the  same thing.   Mr. Speaker, what happens when you impose higher costs? Do you think  the money just invents itself? No. They pass it on to consumers, and  boy, have they nailed it. They have nailed it.   Let me quote a former Treasury official for the Biden administration:  Lower gasoline prices ``undercuts the administration's climate change  goals--where really to care about fossil-fuel consumption, we don't  want lower prices for fossil-fuel buyers, we prefer higher prices.''  They nailed it. They nailed it.   The problem is the impact to the average American. We can't afford  this. It is undermining our ability--like I said, grandchildren,  groceries, energy bills, we can't even afford to live our lives.   Mr. Speaker, as noted by Mr. Burgess, there is a solution: the  American Energy Independence from Russia Act. If we defeat the previous  question, we are going to be able to bring up this legislation that  unlocks American energy, allows us to produce energy.   I don't know what these people have against Americans. Why are we  carrying out policies that benefit Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Saudi  Arabia? Do you know who I care about? I care about domestic energy  producers. I care about American workers. Why can't we meet our own  energy demands just as this bill does?    Congressman Westerman and Congresswoman  McMorris Rodgers have legislation that unlocks American energy, allows  liquefied natural gas terminals to be permanent, reduces the regulatory  burden. It ensures that the Keystone pipeline can be built, not the  policies that Democrats are advocating for where, in the United States  Senate, Senate Democrats said they want to urge Saudi Arabia to use  their swing capacity to increase world oil supplies or the current  runup of world oil prices is effectively a tax on American families'  energy discretionary budget, except that the money goes to the OPEC  cartel rather than the U.S. Treasury.    Actually, on this one, Mr. Speaker, I fully agree. I urge that we  defeat the previous question; we unlock America's energy resources; and  we lower energy prices for all Americans.    Madam Speaker, during the vote on the HTR, I  was in a meeting regarding amendments on the WRDA22 legislation markup.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 192.
