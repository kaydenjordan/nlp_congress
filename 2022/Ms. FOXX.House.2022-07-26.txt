 Madam Speaker, at the State and local levels, public  employees are often promised defined benefit pension plans that are  subsidized through the tax code and exempt from ERISA's funding,  notice, and disclosure requirements.   Too often, State and local governments have not kept their end of the  bargain and are failing to fund employee pensions adequately. The  numbers suggest public employee pensions are dangerously underfunded.  Economists estimate that State pension plans are collectively  underfunded by as much as $5.8 trillion.   According to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College,  public pension funds have on hand an average of just 75 cents for every  dollar expected to go to retirees in future benefits.   Simply put, there is not enough money set aside to meet retirement  obligations. This raises serious questions about the promises that  public employers make and the practices they use to address  underfunding.   I am especially concerned with recent news reports that some States  and localities, rather than making responsible decisions to manage  their plans, are adopting a risky practice: betting on the stock market  with borrowed money.   According to The Wall Street Journal, in 2021, more than 100 State,  city, and county governments borrowed money for their pension funds and  invested in stocks and other investments.   Nearly $13 billion in pension obligation bonds were sold last year,  which is more than in the prior 5 years combined. Here is the problem  with issuing pension obligation bonds: They can backfire.   Investing with borrowed money can increase returns when markets are  rising, but it makes losses more severe in down markets. This is  especially concerning given the recent struggles in the stock and bond  markets. According to recent reports, public pension funds have lost  10.4 percent, on average, in 2022.   When investments using borrowed money don't perform as hoped and  returns fall below the bond interest rate, the city, State, or county  winds up paying even more than if it hadn't borrowed in the first  place.   In light of recent multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailouts of private- sector pension plans, there is no question about where State and local  governments will turn when investments fall short and trillions in  pension plans come due.    Madam Speaker, I urge public employers to make decisions to fund  their pension plans responsibly. Plans should not be gambling with the  retirement savings of the hardworking men and women who depend on these  pensions.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize an impeccable family- owned company in North Carolina that is celebrating its 100th  anniversary this year: Pine Hall Brick.
