 Mr. President, American entrepreneurship  and innovation is the backbone of the American economy. American  entrepreneurs provide new job opportunities for millions, bring new  technologies to the marketplace, and drive forward our shared American  Dream. Small businesses account for half of our gross domestic product,  more than half our jobs, and three-fourths of new jobs created each  year. Contrary to popular belief, not all of America's entrepreneurs  are young tech-focused individuals starting companies in their garages.   In fact, millions of older Americans represent a powerful and growing  share of American entrepreneurs. Today, the average age of successful  entrepreneurs in America is 45, and in 2018, 3 in 10 entrepreneurs were  over the age of 50, an increase of 50 percent since 2007. Today,  entrepreneurs ages 55 and over represent 55 percent of all small  business employers. Not only do seniors represent the majority of small  business employers, but their life experiences help drive their  businesses to the top 0.1 percent of the highest growth startups in the  country based on growth in the first 5 years of operation.  [[Page S4903]]    In my conversations with older entrepreneurs in South Carolina. I  have learned how they combine their years of experience, networks. and  dreams to start countless successful small businesses. I have also  learned that older entrepreneurs often face unique challenges in  today's economy. Those challenges include the need for enhanced digital  and technical skills. mentorship opportunities, business growth and  hiring training; along with resources for estate and retirement  planning for their businesses. These obstacles can prevent small  businesses owned by older Americans from reaching their full growth  potential. This untapped business growth potential leaves capital on  the sidelines and slows innovation and job creation.   That is why today I am introducing the Golden-preneurship Act. The  Golden-preneurship Act would take a meaningful step in helping catapult  senior-owned small businesses into the next level of success by  establishing a new training program for ``Golden Entrepreneurs'' at the  Small Business Administration. The newly developed ``Golden  Entrepreneurs'' training program would equip proven senior  entrepreneurs with the necessary tools to increase their business's  market share and help bring jobs and capital to communities around the  country. ``Golden Entrepreneurs'' would be a 7-month training program  with two years of benchmark check-ins to fill the market gap and bridge  the knowledge divide in digital and technical skills, business growth  and hiring training, estate and retirement business planning, and  provide new mentorship opportunities. The Golden-preneurship Act also  requires the Small Business Administration to track the loans and  grants provided to older Americans, valuable information we need to  ensure America's older entrepreneurs are receiving the help they need.   With the Golden-preneurship Act we will ensure that today's Golden  Entrepreneurs have the tools and resources to create tomorrow's jobs,  new technologies, and opportunities.   Thank you.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Blumenthal, and Mr.          Whitehouse):   S. 2349.
