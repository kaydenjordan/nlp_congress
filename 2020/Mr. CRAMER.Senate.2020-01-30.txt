 I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself and  Senator Young.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Cramer and Young is for the counsel for  the President:         Manager Schiff regularly states that if the President is       innocent he would agree to all of the witnesses and documents       that the Managers want. Is the President the first innocent       defendant not to waive his rights?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question because the answer is, obviously, no. The President is not the  first innocent defendant who decided not to waive his rights, and I  think it is striking and shocking that it is one of the arguments that  has been repeatedly deployed by the House managers throughout these  proceedings.   You heard Manager Nadler say only the guilty hide evidence, only the  guilty don't respond to subpoenas, and Manager Schiff say that this is  not the way innocent people act. Well, of course, that is contrary to  the very spirit of our American justice system, where people have  rights, and asserting those rights cannot be interpreted as an  indication of guilt. That is expressly forbidden by the laws and by the  Constitution.   The Supreme Court explained in Bordenkircher v. Hayes--a case that is  cited in our trial memorandum--that the very idea of punishing someone,  which is what the House managers are attempting to do here with their  obstruction of Congress charge--they said that if the President insists  on the constitutional prerogatives of his office; if the President  insists that, like virtually every President--at least since Nixon and  some going further back than that--he is going to assert the immunity  of his senior advisers to compel congressional testimony; if he is  going to assert those rights grounded in the separation of powers and  essential for protecting constitutionally based executive branch  confidentiality interests, we are going to call that obstruction of  Congress and impeach him.   It is this fundamental theme running throughout both their  obstruction charge and their arguments generally here that if the  President stands on his constitutional rights--if he tries to  [[Page S696]]  protect the institutional prerogatives of his office, which he is duty- bound to do for future occupants of that office--that it is somehow an  indication of guilt and shows that he ought to be impeached.   That is fundamentally antithetical to the American system of justice  and to our principles of due process, to our principles of  acknowledging that rights can be defended, that rights exist to be  defended, and that asserting those rights cannot be treated either as  something punishable or as evidence of guilt.   There would be a long line of past Presidents--as Professor  Dershowitz pointed out, there are a lot of Presidents who have been  accused of abuse of power. There would also be a long line of  Presidents who could have been impeached for ``obstruction of  Congress'' if every time a President insisted upon the prerogatives of  the office of the Presidency and insisted on defending the separation  of powers, it could be treated as something impeachable and as evidence  of guilt.   President Obama himself refused to turn over a lot of documents to  the House in the Fast and Furious investigation, and his Attorney  General was held in contempt, but no one thought that it was an  impeachable offense.   So the concept of saying that when the President asserts the  constitutionally grounded prerogatives of his office, that it is  evidence of guilt is a completely bogus assertion. It is contrary to  all of the principles of our American justice system and to the  fundamental principles of fairness, and it ought to be rejected by this  body.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Alabama.
