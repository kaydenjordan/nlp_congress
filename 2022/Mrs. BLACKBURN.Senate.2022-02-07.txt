 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, here in the United States, the  mobile app market represents a reliable multibillion-dollar payday for  Big Tech. In 2020, Americans downloaded 13.4 billion apps onto their  mobile devices.   Needless to say, mobile apps are a key component of our digital  economy, so it may be surprising to learn that this market is largely  unregulated, unless you count the influence of the two mega  corporations that created it.   Apple and Google have abused their power and used their status as  gatekeepers to stifle innovation and penalize developers who want to  work alongside them rather than ceding control over their products.  This is bad for the industry. It is bad for consumers. It is bad for  the country.   These gatekeeping tendencies aren't just a bump in the road for  developers; they are a roadblock that completely closes off avenues of  competition. Apple, for example, forces developers to use their  exorbitantly expensive App Store payment system, which funnels profits  away from the creators, and it raises prices for consumers. It is a  take-it-or-leave-it arrangement. Of course, when developers do take the  deal, they leave their relationship with their customers behind because  the terms prohibit them from dealing directly with the people who use  their products. They also have to accept that Apple and Google will not  only prioritize native applications, but they will take their  competitors' confidential business information and use it against them.   Last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed my Open App Markets  Act, which is a bill we have worked some very long hours on. Finally,  we are addressing the stranglehold Big Tech has on the digital app  market. I really do thank Senator Blumenthal and his staff, as well as  our cosponsors, Senators Klobuchar, Rubio, Lummis, Booker, Graham,  Kennedy, Hirono, Hawley, and Chairman Durbin, for putting in so much  time and effort to create this bipartisan piece of legislation.   This bill will reset the rules of the road to protect competition and  consumers by allowing consumers to access third-party apps and app  stores, by prohibiting app store owners from locking developers into  in-app payment arrangements, by ensuring that app developers are  allowed to offer competitive pricing, and by preventing app stores from  misusing confidential business information or app store rankings to  disadvantage developers. If app store gatekeepers violate these rules  of the road, the bill allows for developer lawsuits. It also includes  safeguards to allow app stores to protect the privacy, security, and  safety of consumers, as well as their own intellectual property rights.   It is bipartisan, and it is a good, solid, strong first step. But,  remember, our tradition of maintaining competitive marketplaces isn't  the only thing at stake here.   This weekend, the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games in Beijing  drew in 16 million viewers. That is down from the last Winter Games in  2018, so hopefully, this means that the various campaigns exposing the  crimes and manipulation of the Chinese Communist Party are making a  difference.   But, still, those 16 million people and their families are taking in  Chinese propaganda. The Games' corporate sponsors weren't worried about  that; they were happy to take advantage of all those eyeballs. And we  know NBC hopes to surpass the nearly $2 billion in revenue they pulled  in during the Tokyo Games.   Protecting that competitiveness is important, but I would argue that  protecting the human rights of people those sponsors and broadcasters  are happy to sweep under the rug is even more important. And right at  this very moment, Big Tech is facilitating crimes against humanity in  China.   Beijing is notorious for censoring speech critical of the communist  government, but part of their grand strategy to silence dissent  involves strong-arming corporations seeking access to the very  lucrative Chinese market. It is not enough to offer an exciting  product; you have to play nice with the CCP or else you are out. You  can't be in their market. That means staying quiet about genocide in  Xinjiang or violent repression in Hong Kong and doing everything in  your power to make sure your customers stay silent too.   The Open App Markets Act has received an outpouring of support from  human rights activists who see firsthand how corporate gatekeeping  actively endangers the lives of dissidents, activists, Uighur Muslims,  Mongols, Tibetans, Hong Kong freedom fighters, and other innocent  people the CCP has chosen to brutalize. We received a letter of support  for the Open App Markets Act signed by many of these individuals that I  would like to share. They wrote, in part:         China suppresses nearly all dissent using its notorious       ``Great Firewall'' internet filtering system and through the       cooperation of domestic and foreign companies that are       willing to block and remove accounts, content, and       applications at the unchallenged request of Chinese       authorities.        Few American companies are as subservient to the Chinese       government as Apple. Apple willingly censors dissenting       voices and independent media for all in China and Hong Kong       using its control over the App Store.    We received another letter from the human rights organization  GreatFire that details specific examples of Apple doing the bidding of  the Chinese Communist Party. They wrote in part:         GreatFire, an organization dedicated to fighting internet       censorship, started monitoring Apple's censorship in November       2013, when Apple decided to remove our ``Free Weibo''       application from the Chinese App Store. Apple did not even       wait for the intervention of any Chinese judicial authority       to determine if our app had actually broken any Chinese law.       It collaborated with the Chinese authorities and dealt with       our app the same way it has continued to deal with many more       apps: by enforcing arbitrary and politically motivated       censorship to ensure its financial interest.    I ask unanimous consent to have these two letters printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   January 31, 2022.      Senator Dick Durbin,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.      Senator Chuck Grassley,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Durbin, Ranking Member Grassley, and Members of       the Senate Judiciary Committee: We write as Chinese human       rights activists, pro-democracy movements, national security       experts, and members of persecuted religious communities to       share our deep concerns with Apple's use of its monopolistic       dominance and its collusion with the Chinese government to       stifle freedom of expression in China. As the Committee       considers legislation to rein in the abuses of tech firms, we       encourage it to help dissenting voices and efforts to offer       privacy and security tools in China through protecting the       right to sideload, as included in the Open App Markets Act.  [[Page S536]]         The Chinese Communist Party maintains its grip on power and       its regional expansionism through operating the most       sophisticated censorship and surveillance apparatus in       history. China suppresses nearly all dissent using its       notorious `Great Firewall' internet filtering system and       through the cooperation of domestic and foreign companies       that are willing to block and remove accounts, content, and       applications at the unchallenged request of Chinese       authorities.        Few American companies are as subservient to the Chinese       government as Apple. Apple willingly censors dissenting       voices and independent media for all in China and Hong Kong       using its control over App Store. As the New York Times,       human rights organizations, and members of this Committee       have thoroughly documented, Apple has blocked thousands of       applications for iOS users in China and Hong Kong at the       request of Chinese censors. Apple's decade-long track record       cooperation with Chinese censorship is sweeping and stunning,       including through its blocking of:        HKmap.live, a coordination tool used by protestors bravely       standing up to China's attempts to destroy Hong Kong's       independence and democracy;        Bible and Quranic apps, including the Olive Tree Bible       study guide;        Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, Congressionally-      funded independent media organizations that provides news in       Chinese, Uyghur, and Tibetan languages; and,        Anti-censorship services, including apps funded by       Congress, designed to bypass the Great Firewall to provide       unfiltered and secure access to information, social media,       and news.        While Apple claims to be a defender of human rights in the       West, Apple has deliberately placed Chinese citizen's lives       in the hands of the Chinese government for profit, knowing       the grave consequences. As the Congressional-Executive       Commission on China and others have warned, Apple hosts the       private data of its Chinese users in data centers controlled       by the Chinese government without the safeguards that would       prevent spying, including weakening its access controls and       encryption. As a result, Chinese citizens are unable to       access independent news, practice their faith, or express       themselves freely without real fear of the brutal repression       of the state.        While our organizations have decades of expertise fight       back against China's repression, Apple's complete dominance       over iOS blocks us from offering tools to bypass censorship,       prevent spying, and promote democracy. Our pleas and       campaigns for Apple to do the right thing have been ignored       by Apple's leadership. If we were allowed to provide apps       outside of the censored App Store, also known as sideloading,       we would be able finally offer Chinese communities with tools       to defeat the Great Firewall, such as Ultrasurf, Psiphon, and       FreeGate. The Open App Markets Act's protections for       sideloading would help us open up the world to hundreds of       millions more Chinese people living under repression aided by       Apple.        As the Senate Judiciary Committee considers the Open App       Markets Act, we encourage it stand firm on behalf of freedom       of expression and human rights in China through protecting       our right to offer a lifeline to dissidents, religious       communities, and all those banned by the Chinese Communist       Party.

Subject: Censorship by Apple.         Dear Chair Durbin, Ranking Member Grassley, and Members of       the Senate Judiciary Committee: As the Committee considers       legislation to address the power of Big Tech, we write to       share our research and longstanding concerns regarding       Apple's censorship on behalf of the People's Republic of       China and other repressive regimes.        GreatFire, an organization dedicated to fighting internet       censorship, started monitoring Apple's censorship in November       2013, when Apple decided to remove our ``FreeWeibo''       application from the Chinese App Store. Apple did not even       wait for the intervention of any Chinese judicial authority       to determine if our app had actually broken any Chinese law.       It collaborated with the Chinese authorities and dealt with       our app the same way it has continued to deal with many more       apps: by enforcing arbitrary and politically motivated       censorship to ensure its financial interests.        In 2019, we launched AppleCensorship.com, a website       monitoring Apple's removal of apps on its App Stores around       the world. Over the last three years, we have uncovered       numerous cases of app removals, particularly in China, where       Apple collaborates with the Chinese authorities by enforcing       arbitrary and politically motivated censorship to protect its       financial interests.        Our research has produced the following key findings:        Apple proactively removes apps that allow Chinese citizens       to circumvent censorship, all without the need for the       authorities to intervene. None of the top 100 ``virtual       private network services'' (VPNs) in the United States App       Store are available in China.        In October 2019, during the Hong Kong protests violently       suppressed by the police, Apple removed HKmap.live, an app       used by protesters to report aggressive police movements and       the use of tear gas.        AppleCensorship.com counts 191 ``News'' apps currently       unavailable in China's App Store. The New York Times app was       removed in January 2017. Quartz was removed during the Hong       Kong protests in 2019.        More than 26% of all apps tested were found to be       unavailable in China, when the average for other countries is       around 11% and when less than 5% of all apps that we tested       in the U.S. App Store were unavailable.        A study that we conducted with Tibetan human rights groups       and released in June 2019 revealed that at least 29 Tibetan-      themed apps dealing with news, religious study, tourism and       even games are being censored by Apple.        In September 2021, we detected the removal of Bible and       Quran apps in China.        In June 2020, Apple removed two podcast apps, Pocket Casts       and Castro, after the developers refused to censor content on       their platforms.        Two RSS reader apps, Reeder and Fiery Feeds, were removed       in September 2020 for content deemed ``illegal in China''.        Apple's censorship is not limited to China and affects all       countries where Apple operates:        In November 2021, Apple's removed the ``Smart Voting'' app       developed by the team associated with Russian political       opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The app, which informed its       users about candidates for the Parliamentary elections and       their political affiliation, was removed just as polls       opened. Apple went further by contacting private messaging       app Telegram to request the removal of content (i.e. a chat       bot) related to Navalny's campaign. Telegram published a       statement condemning the move but stating it had to comply       with Apple in order to avoid being removed from the App       Store.        In June 2021, our research on LGBTQ+ related apps revealed       that, out of approximately 150 LGBTQ+ apps identified, 61       apps were partially unavailable. China came second in terms       of unavailability, with 27 LGBTQ+ apps unavailable in the       country, just behind Saudi Arabia (28 apps unavailable) and       before United Arab Emirates (25 apps unavailable). In total,       1377 instances of LGBTQ+ app's unavailability were found in       152 countries (only Australia's, Canada's and US' App Store       contained all the tested apps).        In addition to targeted removal, that is to say removals of       apps in the App Store of the requesting country, which result       from alleged ``legal violations'', Apple also responds to       governments' requests made on the basis of alleged violations       of Apple's own ``Platform Policy''. Such takedown requests,       mostly originating from authoritarian regimes like China and       Russia, led to approximately 30,000 removals in 175 countries       between January 2019 and December 2020.        The list of compromises by Apple over the last five years       is not limited to censorship on  [[Page S537]]       the App Store. For example, Apple's own podcasting app       remains available in China, as Apple proactively removes       ``sensitive'' podcasts. Although there are too many       compromises that threaten human rights to be fully listed       here, in 2021 only, Apple:        facilitated access by the Chinese authorities to iCloud       data for Chinese users;        decided not to release its new ``Private Relay'' feature in       China and other countries; and        censored Chinese consumers by preventing them from       engraving ``sensitive'' content on their Apple products       (iPads or Airtags).        Apple discloses almost no information on app removals,       hiding the full scope of compliance with Chinese censorship.       In some cases, apps' developers or publishers were not aware       of their app's unavailability until we contacted them. In       October, 2017, Senators Cruz and Leahy wrote to Apple asking       questions about censorship in its China App Store. In Apple's       response, the company admitted to having removed 674 VPNs       from the China App Store at the request of the Chinese       government. These VPNs would have allowed Chinese citizens to       skirt censorship restrictions.        Apple was widely condemned after this revelation--yet five       years later Apple has only increased its censorship efforts       in China and has continued to proactively work to restrict       freedom of expression for its Chinese customers.        Apple has even hosted apps on its App Store run by a China       Paramilitary Group (the Xinjiang Production and Construction       Corps) accused of participating in forced labor of Uyghurs       and under U.S. Magnitsky sanctions.        Apple's so-called Transparency Reports do not reveal which       apps have been censored, and remain questionably vague on the       reasons, legal or not, behind this censorship.        The resulting opacity has become Apple's true trademark:       from how it curates content on the App Store; to how it       implements its arbitrary ``App Store Guidelines''; to what       data it communicates to governments; to the deals the company       makes with even the most repressive regimes in the world.       Apple conceals almost everything about its operations.        Apple's record-high financial results are the result of a       strategy that has relied significantly on Apple's alliance       with the Chinese authoritarian government. This alliance       comes with a cost. In order to do business in China, Apple       has abandoned its values, ethical standards, and principles.       Apple has actively worked to suppress the rights and freedoms       of their customers, even when the company was not pressured       to do so by Beijing. We believe that the time is overdue for       Apple to put a halt to such unethical and immoral behavior.        We remain at your disposal should you have any additional       questions.            With warmest regards,      Benjamin Ismail,        Project Director, AppleCensorship.com.      Charlie Smith,        Co-Founder, GreatFire.org.     It makes no sense to make a name for yourself  creating secure devices for Western users but to then turn around and  go out of your way to make the devices in the hands of the world's most  vulnerable people less secure.   The time has come for us as a country to decide what matters more:  preserving this toxic entanglement with China or preserving life and  liberty and the democratic ideals that make us so fortunate to begin  with.   I ask my colleagues to consider joining me and Senator Blumenthal in  support of the Open App Markets Act to protect competition, to protect  consumers, and to protect those basic human rights that the world's  most powerful corporations have decided should take a backseat to  access and profit.   I yield the floor.
