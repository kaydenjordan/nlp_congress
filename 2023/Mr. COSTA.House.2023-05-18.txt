 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on National  Infrastructure Week.   For far too long, we have been living off the investments our parents  and grandparents made a generation or two ago.   Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law which we passed in the  last Congress and President Biden signed into law, we now have moved  from infrastructure week to infrastructure decade.   In California it has created over 48,000 jobs in this short time with  an investment of $42 billion. In my district, we are seeing progress.  Some of the examples here are reinvestment in San Luis Reservoir dam,  another 130,000 acre-feet of additional water storage, upgrading and  expanding miles of highway improvements, funding clean school buses for  communities like in Cutler and Orosi, and we will be breaking ground  for the expansion of the Yosemite International Airport to provide  greater service.   These are just some examples, and we are just getting started in my  district.   Three years of funding remain, and now we have an opportunity to move  from infrastructure decade throughout America. It is about time.                            ____________________
