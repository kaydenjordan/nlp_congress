 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5736) to direct the Under Secretary for Intelligence and  Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security to develop and  disseminate a threat assessment regarding threats to the United States  associated with foreign violent white supremacist extremist  organizations, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5736         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Transnational White       Supremacist Extremism Review Act''.       SEC. 2. THREAT ASSESSMENT.         (a) In General.--The Under Secretary for Intelligence and       Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security shall, in       coordination with appropriate Federal partners, develop a       terrorism threat assessment and reference aid regarding       threats to the United States associated with foreign violent       white supremacist extremist organizations. Consistent with       the protection of classified and confidential unclassified       information, the Under Secretary shall share the threat       assessment developed under this section with State, local,       and Tribal law enforcement officials, including officials who       operate within State, local, and regional fusion centers       through the Department of Homeland Security State, Local, and       Regional Fusion Center Initiative established in accordance       with section 210A of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6       U.S.C. 124h).

(2) Appropriate owners and operators of online platforms to       assist in identifying content that may be associated with a       foreign violent white supremacist extremist organization that       may violate the terms of service of such online platforms,       upon request from such online platforms and in consultation       with the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties of the       Department.        (e) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Foreign violent white supremacist extremist       organization.--The term ``foreign violent white supremacist       extremist organization'' means an organization based outside       the United States that seeks, wholly or in part, through       unlawful acts of force or violence, to support a belief in       the intellectual and moral superiority of the white race over       other races.        (2) Online platform.--The term ``online platform'' means       internet-based information services consisting of the storage       and processing of information by and at the request of a       content provider and the dissemination of such content to       third parties.        (f) Limitation.--The Under Secretary for Intelligence and       Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security shall ensure       that the threat assessment and reference aid does not contain       the name or other identifiable information of any individual       or organization engaged in lawful political or public       discourse in the United States protected under the United       States Constitution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the government's latest reports describe violence by  white supremacists as a significant terrorist threat to the homeland.   In fact, it was recently reported that DHS analysts assessed ``the  threat from white supremacists as the deadliest domestic terror threat  facing the U.S.''   Further, this past week, a DHS official testified before a Senate  committee that attacks by white supremacists are on average the most  lethal of domestic terrorist actors.   This statement came on the heels of testimony before the Senate  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee by FBI Director  Christopher Wray, who stated that racially-motivated violent extremists  are ``the most lethal of all domestic extremists,'' and that white  supremacists are the number one threat within that group.   We have also seen evidence that this threat is increasingly linked to  individuals and groups abroad.   Last year, the perpetrators of terror attacks in El Paso, Texas, and  Poway, California, drew inspiration from the deadly white supremacist  attack in Christchurch, New Zealand.   There are indications that the links go beyond mere inspiration.   Reports have documented that white supremacists have traveled  internationally to train with neo-Nazi militant groups in war zone  environments.   By some accounts, white supremacist groups are drawing on jihadist  tactics to organize, and the threat they pose is no less deadly.   The Transnational White Supremacist Extremism Review Act would  require the Department of Homeland Security to disseminate a terrorist  threat assessment regarding foreign, violent white supremacist  extremist groups to State and local law enforcement partners.   The bill also authorizes DHS to share information regarding symbols  used by such groups with social media companies to assist in efforts to  identify content that may violate their terms of service.  [[Page H5078]]    The bill includes vital civil rights and civil liberties safeguards  to protect First Amendment rights.   The first step in confronting a threat is making sure that the people  on the front lines have the information they need to understand it.   When it comes to the white supremacist threat, that is exactly what  this bill would do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rose), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As the surge in white supremacist extremist attacks in the United  States and around world puts all of us at risk, I commend my committee  colleague Mr. Rose for introducing this legislation, and I urge  passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5780) to enhance stakeholder outreach to and operational  engagement with owners and operators of critical infrastructure and  other relevant stakeholders by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  Security Agency to bolster security against acts of terrorism and other  homeland security threats, including by maintaining a clearinghouse of  security guidance, best practices, and other voluntary content  developed by the Agency or aggregated from trusted sources, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5780         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Communities Act of       2020''.       SEC. 2.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5780, the Safe  Communities Act.   Last month, a teenager from my district in Antioch, Illinois, went to  Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he allegedly killed two people with an AR-15- style rifle.   The next day, I heard from another constituent, a mother who lives in  the alleged shooter's hometown. She wrote: ``There is a militia cell in  Antioch that is becoming more and more emboldened to take the law into  their own hands. I am becoming fearful to send my children to the same  schools at white supremacist militia members.''   I share my constituents' concerns with the rise of domestic violent  extremism in this country. FBI Director Wray recently testified before  the House Homeland Security Committee that white supremacist extremists  are a leading threat to our Nation.   I believe we must do more to address the root causes of violent  behavior, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues  in Congress to make America a place where racism, misogyny, and other  forms of hate can no longer flourish.   Meanwhile, in the face of extremist threats like these, we must take  immediate action to secure our critical infrastructure and make soft  targets less vulnerable to attack.   In addition to domestic extremists, our suburban and rural  communities face too many other threats of mass violence. Just last  year, five of our neighbors, four of whom were my constituents, were  killed by an act of gun violence at the Henry Pratt Company in Aurora,  Illinois. Our workplaces, schools, and places of worship are far too  vulnerable to mass shootings and other forms of targeted violence. This  bill seeks to fix that.   Rural and suburban communities like mine in northern Illinois are  increasingly targets of violence but often don't have access to the  Federal resources they need to protect themselves. That is why I  introduced H.R. 5780, the Safe Communities Act of 2020, bipartisan  legislation to help better protect soft targets in communities like  mine.  [[Page H5080]]    The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's protective  security advisers help improve security at schools, places of worship,  and other soft targets, but there are too few of them to meet the  demand of their services.   H.R. 5780 would require CISA to maintain an online security resources  clearinghouse to provide security guidance and best practices, serving  as a one-stop shop for school districts, religious organizations, and  local officials to find the information they need to keep their  communities safe.   The bill would also require CISA to develop a stakeholder outreach  and operational engagement strategy and implementation plan to ensure  that the Agency is delivering infrastructure security services across  sectors and throughout regions.   Finally, H.R. 5780 would authorize a PSA force multiplier pilot  program, which would require CISA PSAs to train State, local, Tribal,  and territorial officials to perform security vulnerability and  terrorism risk assessments. These risk assessments are an important  part of qualifying for FEMA's security grants; the force multiplier  program will help expand access to them.   I am proud that the Safe Communities Act of 2020 has been endorsed by  the Jewish Federations of North America and the Anti-Defamation League.   I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Katko, for joining me in  introducing this measure. I am grateful for his collaboration and  leadership as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity,  Infrastructure Protection, and Innovation.   I want to extend my sincere appreciation to the Homeland Security  Committee staff for their work on this legislation.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  legislation today to make sure every community in America has the  resources it needs to keep people safe.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5780, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Last week, I was appointed as the new chair of the Subcommittee on  Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Innovation of the  Homeland Security Committee. It is a great honor and opportunity for me  to amplify the homeland security concerns of the people of Illinois'  14th Congressional District here in Washington.                                time  1330    My constituents are concerned about the vulnerability of so-called  soft targets to violence. CISA, which is overseen by my subcommittee,  has a critical role to play to empower communities to be more secure  and resilient against ever-increasing lists of homeland security  threats.   I am committed to ensuring the success of the PSA program, and I look  forward to working with CISA to make sure that every community can  benefit from it. Enactment of the Safe Communities Act of 2020 will  help CISA think more strategically about how it deploys PSAs and other  services and do so in a way that will scale.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5823) to establish a program to make grants to States to  address cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity threats to information  systems of State, local, Tribal, or territorial governments, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I don't need to tell anyone here that cyberattacks  against State and local governments are growing more frequent and more  sophisticated. In 2019, there were over 100 ransomware attacks on State  and local governments.   From major cities like New Orleans and Baltimore to small towns  across Texas, cyberattacks sought to cripple the ability of governments  across the country to carry out basic functions, from processing real  estate transactions to collecting payments for services.   The cost is more than just a mere inconvenience. A ransomware attack  against a State and local government can disrupt lifeline services,  like 911 call centers and public hospitals, and extort money those  governments do not have.   Last summer, the mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms, testified  before my subcommittee that the ransomware attack that hit her city in  2018 cost city taxpayers $7.2 million to recover from, but experts  expect that cost to grow to as much as $17 million.   The COVID-19 pandemic, by dramatically expanding the threat landscape  and making government networks more attractive targets for hackers, has  made the situation more dire. More Americans than ever before are  working from home. That includes State and local government workers who  may be less accustomed to teleworking and less prepared to do it  securely.   At the same time, the cyber risk to State and local networks has  increased dramatically due to unprecedented demand for online services,  including unemployment compensation and human services applications.   The transition to online learning that COVID-19 has forced many  schools to undertake has also not been without incident. According to  Education Week, there have been 220 cyberattacks against schools so far  this year. And while the pandemic is bringing the vulnerability of our  school districts' networks into focus, it is worth noting that there  have been over 1,000 cyberattacks against school districts since 2016,  according to the K-12 Research Center.   Despite the urgent need to address their cyber vulnerabilities, many  State and local governments are not in a position to do so without  outside assistance, as they are overwhelmed by the challenges of  maintaining basic services in the face of steep COVID-19-related  revenue losses.   It is time for the Federal Government to step up and help. Passing  H.R. 5823, the State and Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act, which I  am proud to cosponsor, is an important first step.   The bill would establish a $400 million targeted grant program to  help States and local governments develop robust cybersecurity  capabilities. Importantly, it requires States to pay a graduated match  to incentivize them to budget better for cybersecurity.   And it requires the Department of Homeland Security to create a plan  to improve the cybersecurity posture of State and local governments to  ensure that Federal resources align with State goals and objectives.  The smart investments we make in the cybersecurity of our State and  local governments now will pay for themselves in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5823, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Ruppersberger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maryland an  additional 2 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I am  prepared to close after the gentleman from Pennsylvania closes. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, over the past decade and a half, Congress  has redoubled efforts to secure Federal networks. This legislation will  continue that work by supporting State and local cybersecurity  improvements. It was approved on a bipartisan basis in committee and  has broad and deep support within stakeholder communities.   I would like to congratulate Congressman Cedric Richmond, the former  chairman of the Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and  Innovation Subcommittee, on this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5822) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish an acquisition professional career program, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5822         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 710 the       following new item: ``Sec. 711. Acquisition professional career program.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5822, the Homeland Security  Acquisition Professional Career Program Act.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5822 authorizes an existing program within the  Department of Homeland Security focused on strengthening its  acquisition workforce. DHS established the Acquisition Professional  Career Program in 2008 to create a pipeline for hard-to-fill  acquisition workforce positions, such as contract specialists.   Since its inception, the program has had over 300 program graduates  join the ranks of DHS' acquisition workforce, which oversees billions  of dollars of transactions to procure what DHS needs to carry out its  diverse missions.   They are charged with purchasing everything from cybersecurity  software for protecting Federal networks, to disaster response  supplies, to sophisticated security screening equipment. And when it  comes to COVID-19, they have been responsible for spending over $1.7  billion on a wide range of response activities.   Unfortunately, the Government Accountability Office has highlighted  workforce shortages as a persistent challenge for DHS acquisition  programs--one that can negatively affect their ability to deliver vital  capabilities on time and on budget.   H.R. 5822 will help address this challenge by authorizing DHS'  rigorous development program, which provides participants with  acquisition training, mentorship, department-wide rotations, and other  career development opportunities.   H.R. 5822, if enacted, will help DHS maintain a pipeline for its  acquisition workforce that directly supports the Department's frontline  officers with the tools that they need to perform their jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentlewoman from Nevada, Representative  Titus, for introducing this measure, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, enactment of H.R. 5822 would help ensure that DHS  maintains a pipeline for hard-to-fill acquisition positions throughout  the Department. Given the critical nature of DHS' mission, it is  essential that it have a robust acquisition workforce in place.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5822, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5811) to require the Transportation Security Administration  to provide nursing facilities and paid parental leave for  Administration personnel, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5811         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``TSA Personnel Workplace       Improvement Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. NURSING FACILITIES FOR TRANSPORTATION SECURITY                     ADMINISTRATION PERSONNEL.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the       Transportation Security Administration shall ensure that all       Administration personnel have adequate access to facilities       designated for use by nursing mothers in the workplace. Such       facilities shall be--        (1) assessed for cleanliness, safety, and accessibility to       personnel duty stations;        (2) free of charge;        (3) located in a place, other than a bathroom, that is       shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and       the public; and        (4) available for personnel to use with a reasonable break       time to express breast milk for a child of such personnel       each time such personnel has a need to express milk.        (b) Duration.--The Administrator of the Transportation       Security Administration shall ensure that the availability to       Administration personnel described in subsection (a)(4) is       for a period of time equal to at least one year from the       birth of a child of an Administration employee.        (c) Coordination With Stakeholders.--In carrying out the       requirements in subsection (a), the Administrator of the       Transportation Security Administration shall coordinate with       the National Institutes for Health and the labor organization       representing Administration screening personnel.        (d) Notification.--The Administrator of the Transportation       Security Administration  [[Page H5086]]       shall inform Administration personnel about the availability       under subsection (a) of facilities designed for use by       nursing mothers in the workplace.       SEC. 3. PAID PARENTAL LEAVE.         Section 114(n)(1) of title 49, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) by striking ``The personnel management'' and inserting       ``(A) Consistent with subparagraph (B), the personnel       management''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(B) The Administrator shall ensure that all       Administration personnel not provided paid parental leave       under subparagraph (B) of section 111(d)(2) (as added by       section 7606 of the National Defense Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116-92)) are provided at least       12 weeks of such leave, consistent with the requirements of       such subparagraph.''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 5811, the TSA Personnel  Workforce Improvement Act of 2020. The country recently observed the  19th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks, a day that  shook the Nation to its core and changed it forever. The federalization  of the aviation screening workforce was one of the most important steps  taken as a Nation to restore America's confidence in flying again.   Today, with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we find ourselves  at another moment when many Americans are not comfortable flying.  Still, we have a dedicated workforce in our Nation's airports that  stand ready to protect America's flying public. Yet, this cadre of  frontline workers, transportation security officers--also known as  TSOs--continues to be among the lowest paid Federal employees.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5811, the TSA Personnel Workplace Improvement Act  of 2020, seeks to ease some of the burden on TSOs who are also juggling  the care of small children. The legislation directs TSA to provide  lactation facilities for nursing mothers and 12 weeks of paid parental  leave for all TSA personnel.   Under H.R. 5811, these lactation facilities must be assessed for  cleanliness, safety, and accessibility to personnel duty stations, and  TSA must coordinate implementation of the bill with relevant  stakeholders, including the union representing frontline TSA officers.  Given TSA's complex and challenging mission, the agency must explore  all options to retain talent, which includes parents and nursing  mothers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 5811, a bill that seeks to  improve conditions for working parents in TSA's frontline workforce.  These improvements may increase morale and retention, which is critical  to ensure the effectiveness of aviation security in the face of  evolving threats.   I thank the gentleman from New York for introducing this bill, and I  urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5804) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance  the Blue Campaign of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5804         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Blue Campaign       Enhancement Act''.       SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY BLUE CAMPAIGN                     ENHANCEMENT.         Section 434 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       242) is amended--        (1) in subsection (e)(6), by striking ``utilizing       resources,'' and inserting ``developing and utilizing, in       consultation with the Advisory Board established pursuant to       subsection (g), resources''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new subsections:        ``(f) Web-Based Training Programs.--To enhance training       opportunities, the Director of the Blue Campaign shall       develop web-based interactive training videos that utilize a       learning management system to provide online training       opportunities that shall be made available to the following       individuals:        ``(1) Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial law       enforcement officers.        ``(2) Non-Federal correction system personnel.        ``(3) Such other individuals as the Director determines       appropriate.        ``(g) Blue Campaign Advisory Board.--        ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish within the       Department a Blue Campaign Advisory Board and shall assign to       such Board a representative from each of the following       components:        ``(A) The Transportation Security Administration.        ``(B) U.S. Customs and Border Protection.        ``(C) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.        ``(D) The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.        ``(E) The United States Secret Service.        ``(F) Any other components or offices the Secretary       determines appropriate.        ``(2) Consultation.--The Director shall consult the Board       established pursuant to paragraph (1) regarding the       following:        ``(A) Recruitment tactics used by human traffickers to       inform the development of training and materials by the Blue       Campaign.        ``(B) The development of effective awareness tools for       distribution to Federal and non-Federal officials to identify       and prevent instances of human trafficking.        ``(C) Identification of additional persons or entities that       may be uniquely positioned to recognize signs of human       trafficking and the development of materials for such       persons.

App.) does not apply to--        ``(A) the Board; or        ``(B) consultations under paragraph (2).        ``(h) Consultation.--With regard to the development of       programs under the Blue Campaign and the implementation of       such programs, the Director is authorized to consult with       State, local, Tribal, and territorial agencies, non-      governmental organizations, private sector organizations, and       experts. Such consultation shall be exempt from the Federal       Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security's Blue Campaign is  dedicated to raising awareness about how to identify and prevent human  trafficking.   Last year, over 4,000 self-reported victims and survivors from all  over the country contacted the U.S. national hotline for help with a  human trafficking situation, an increase of almost 20 percent over the  previous year.   Traffickers subject their victims to forced labor, debt bondage, or  sexual exploitation using violence, manipulation, and false promises.   This DHS campaign works to combat trafficking by educating law  enforcement and the public on how to recognize the signs of human  trafficking. To effectively identify trafficking victims and keep their  community safe, local and State law enforcement need to have timely  information about the tactics and techniques these criminals use.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5804, the Blue Campaign Enhancement Act, seeks to  do just that by, among other things, expanding human trafficking  prevention training opportunities. Importantly, it would also create  new, web-based training programs for State and local partners to ensure  these education tools can reach the widest possible audience. H.R. 5804  has bipartisan support and was reported out of committee by unanimous  consent.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, September 4, 2020.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 5804, the ``DHS Blue Campaign       Enhancement Act,'' that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction.       I appreciate your consulting with us on those provisions. The       Judiciary Committee has no objection to your including them       in the bill for consideration on the House floor, and to       expedite that consideration is willing to forgo action on       H.R. 5804, with the understanding that we do not thereby       waive any future jurisdictional claim over those provisions       or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                 Washington, DC, September 16, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 5804, the ``DHS Blue Campaign Act.'' The Committee on       Homeland Security recognizes that the Committee on the       Judiciary has a jurisdictional interest in H.R. 5804, and I       appreciate your effort to allow this bill to be considered on       the House floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on the Judiciary with       respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or       similar legislation in the future, and I would support your       effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House--Senate conference involving this       legislation.        I will include our letters on H.R. 5804 in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.       I look forward to working with you on this legislation and       other matters of great importance to this nation.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers, I am prepared to  [[Page H5088]]  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  5804, which seeks to build upon the success of the DHS Blue Campaign's  human trafficking awareness campaign to make it more accessible and  effective.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
