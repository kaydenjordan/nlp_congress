 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendments that  would strike all potential wilderness designations from this bill. A  wilderness designation is one of the most restrictive designations that  the Federal Government can put on a piece of land. They put limits on  forest management activities, access for emergency and military  personnel, and limit access for the general public.   As we have seen across the West, areas designated as potential  wilderness or wilderness study areas sit in limbo for decades. Criteria  for what constitutes a wilderness area is very clear and  straightforward. Keeping lands under potential wilderness or wilderness  study area designations for extended periods of time is unnecessary and  greatly handicaps rural communities in the West.   Mr. Speaker, let me emphasize: Many of the counties affected by these  potential wilderness designations are already living in lands with over  80 percent publicly managed lands. Many of my Eastern colleagues may  not appreciate what that means for local governments in the affected  counties when I say a county is over 80 percent public land. Public  lands are not taxable, meaning that the local tax base for counties  that have high amounts of Federal lands is extremely small, therefore,  their multiple use on these lands prevented by this legislation is  crucial for economic success.
