 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Missouri for yielding  to me.   Mr. Speaker, in 2012, Ashley and Toribio Cardenas got the best news  parents can hear: they are going to have a baby girl.   They got an ultrasound at 16 weeks. They saw the outlines of their  new daughter, Audrina. She was gorgeous. They had pure joy.   Right after they left, the sonographer rushes to call the  obstetrician. This little gift from God has ectopia cordis. Her heart  is outside of her body. Sixteen human beings out of 1 million have this  condition, and it is usually fatal.   The doctors tell Ashley she has two choices: either abort Audrina or  keep going and pray for the best.   Ashley had to act quickly, because Texas law prohibited abortion  after 20 weeks. This happened at 17 weeks.   She felt Audrina in her womb kicking and thriving, and she thought:  ``Who wants to take a life away? Who wants to stop a beating heart?''   That is true love.   Audrina was born alive. Ashley saw her, gave her a kiss, and then she  was rushed off to the cardiac intensive care room for babies, the ICU.  Little Audrina had surgery the very next day.   Here is a picture of her I printed out in the hospital; that  beautiful young girl, her heart behind that plate.   Her first year of life, there are wires everywhere. She was on oxygen  and had to eat through a feeding tube.   But here that beautiful girl is today with a sign that says:  ``#speaknowforkids.''  [[Page H1566]]    This is a sign for Audrina and for every kid facing abortion.   Congress, American people, speak now for the kids. Support the bill,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Don't kill babies.
