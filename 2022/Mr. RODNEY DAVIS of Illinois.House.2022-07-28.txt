 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend  Mr. Reschenthaler from Pennsylvania for yielding. He is right that it  is disinformation. It is disinformation. We should defeat the previous  question so that we can go back to what defined a recession and what  has defined a recession for decades.   Democrats have to stop playing games, playing games with  misinformation and disinformation. Now, we have got another game being  played with this rule today.   This is a rule, as my good friend from New York talked about, that is  going to allow a bill to come to the floor that has some very good  bipartisan provisions. I think many Republicans would support a lot of  the provisions in this CHIPS bill.   The problem is, why in the world does the majority have to continue  to play games instead of actually working with us and doing anything in  a bipartisan manner?   Tucked into this rule is a provision that will completely eviscerate  the intent of a rule that was negotiated in a bipartisan way by  Republicans and Democrats that if a Member of Congress was able to  secure 290 cosponsors on a bill, he or she would have then been given  the right, as a Member of this institution, to have that bill debated  and voted on, on the floor of the House of Representatives.   I remember Democrats and Republicans standing up and touting this  provision, that this is going to bring power back to every Member of  Congress. Until today--until today when the Rules Committee decides to  turn this provision off, to deny the 294 cosponsors of the Social  Security Fairness Act that is in place because all 294 of us want  fairness for our retired teachers, our retired firefighters, and our  retired police officers. They are turning off this rule for one reason  and one reason only, to not have a vote on the floor like they promised  us they would do.   We followed their rules. And what did Democrats do? They changed the  rules in the process.   Do you want Republicans to vote for legislation in a bipartisan way  when you play games like this? Well, don't be surprised when there are  a lot of noes popping up on the board today for a piece of legislation  that I think a lot of Republicans would normally support.   It is games like this that hurt the retirees the most. Democrats for  decades have promised retired teachers, firefighters, police officers,  and other public employees--they promised those individuals that they  would do something to fix these egregious provisions, the Government  Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination Provision in the Social  Security Code.   This is their shot--this is your shot, Madam Speaker, to get the  majority----    Madam Speaker, this is the majority's  [[Page H7270]]  shot to live up to the promises the Democrats have made for decades to  those who have been begging for a solution. All you have got to do is  take this rule back, remove this turn-off provision, allow the  consensus calendar to continue as it was intended to continue when this  rule change was negotiated.   If I was a bipartisan member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, I would  be coming to the floor screaming. What I want to do is I want every  single cosponsor of H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness Act, to  consider--all 293 others besides me--I want you to consider voting  against this rule. Because if they can turn this off and they can  change the rules midgame, then why celebrate a bipartisan success story  that was put in place in 2019? Stop playing politics.   Madam Speaker, Members of the majority, quit playing games, vote down  this rule, and change this provision.    Madam Speaker, I have the utmost  respect for my friend and colleague from New York, but he is dead wrong  in the information and advice that he got from the Committee on Rules.   The sheer fact that this so-called turn-off provision is nonchalantly  just used as--well, it wasn't part of the consensus process, but let's  pound our chest and say we created the consensus calendar process to  begin with, so we are great. Well, when you disrupt the consensus  process, you are not great. You are actually changing the rules  midgame.   Really, here is the kicker: There is talk about us having to come  back to do a few votes while we are in the midst of August. The way  this rule is written, those days won't even count toward the consensus  calendar.   Rest assured, there is no other reason that the Democrats and the  majority on the Committee on Rules are doing this than to stop the  progress of actually addressing the Social Security Fairness Act.   We have 294 cosponsors. We played by the rules. Democrats changed the  rules midgame. And you trust this majority to actually put a bill  together that is going to stop China from dominating the chip  production industry in the globe when they play games like this?   That is what the American people are sick and tired of. That is why  that is an outgoing majority. That is why we are going to have a new  majority. It is games like this that have to stop being played when you  talk about bipartisanship, but you don't actually govern in a  bipartisan way.                                time  1145    Today is another shining example of that. Again, 294 cosponsors. We  play by your rules, we play by the majority's provisions, and you  change the rules midgame. I certainly hope our umpires tonight at the  Congressional Baseball Game are better at actually codifying the rules  that exist.
