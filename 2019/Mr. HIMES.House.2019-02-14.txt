 Madam Speaker, it is Valentine's Day, and we have all  spent the evening together, which is kind of funny. We did it in the  service of keeping the government open with a bill that funds the  government in a strong, bipartisan vote, and that is a good thing.   But, Madam Speaker, Valentine's Day will never again be a truly happy  day because, of course, it is the 1-year anniversary of the Douglas  shootings in Florida in which 17 young people, with their lives ahead  of them, had those lives snuffed out at the end of a gun.   It is a particularly poignant moment for me and for those of us from  Connecticut because we still can't forget, of course, the 20 children,  6 to 7 years old, and six adult staff who lost their lives in December  of 2012 at the Sandy Hook Elementary School.   So, Madam Speaker, I just rise to point out that we are hearing a lot  tonight about an emergency declaration; and if 30,000 to 40,000  Americans, including these young angels, losing their lives every  single year is not an emergency, I don't know what is.   This House, after 8 years of inaction and pathetic moments of  silence, moved a bill, H.R. 8, for universal background checks out of  committee yesterday. The least we can do as an institution is to take  the small step of passing that bill into law to keep young and all  Americans safe.                            ____________________
