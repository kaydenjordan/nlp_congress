 Mr. Speaker, I rise to again bring attention to the  impending crisis in Idlib province, Syria.   Last week I spoke in the well of the House about the great work our  Kansans and Americans are doing in support of the innocent Syrian  people, many of them with no connection to Syria other than seeing  years of pointless death and mayhem and wanting to help the Syrian  people cope with their country's destruction and return to their  families, their villages, their work.   I learned today that many of those Syrians that my fellow Americans  support are now only a few kilometers away from the frontlines of the  Assad-backed war machine.  [[Page H8163]]    The U.S. must continue to support Turkey's push to achieve a  diplomatic solution to at least delay an assault on Idlib.   I believe the use of chemical weapons should not be the only trigger  for an American response, but that we can no longer stand by as scores  of innocents are massacred by the brutal dictator and his Russian  agents.   I call on the President to strengthen his resolve against Assad's  barbarous acts and to continue to support the innocent Syrian people.                            ____________________
