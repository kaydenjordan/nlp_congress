 Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in speaking out  against the Democrats' very reckless $3.5 trillion--that is with a  ``t''--tax-and-spending spree that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are  rushing through Congress. They are going to make history if they get  this passed. This will be the largest spending bill in our Nation's  history. Let me say that again. This will be the largest spending bill  in our Nation's history.    Through this bill, Congressional Democrats are trying to reshape the  very foundation of our great Nation. They are trying to pass their far- left policies and push the United States of America down the path of  socialism. I don't say that lightly. I don't like to use a lot of  hyperbole, but that is what is going on.   This reckless tax-and-spending spree bill is packed full of tax  increases and new spending programs that will kill hundreds of  thousands of jobs; it will reduce economic growth; and it is throwing  more fuel on the inflation fire that we see burning right now across  this economy. In fact, according to the Tax Foundation, it would reduce  take-home pay for low- and middle-income Americans.   It will expand and insert the Federal Government into every aspect of  Montanans' and Americans' lives, and it is going to bankrupt our  country. You know, I am not actually sure the congressional Democrats  understand the impacts of their efforts and what a burden this tax and  spending will put on Montana families, Montana small businesses,  Montana farmers and ranchers, and the future generations of Montanans.   In fact, a few weeks ago, I heard one House Democrat actually say:         We can't go bankrupt because we have the power to create as       much money as we need to spend.    These are the actual words of a Democrat in the U.S. House of  Representatives who will soon be voting on this legislation.   It is baffling. Montanans and the American people know that money  doesn't grow on trees, and I would hope the congressional Democrats  know that as well.   Frankly, this mindset is terrifying as I think about the future of  our country. The Democrats' reckless spending bill comes at a time when  Montanans are already facing skyrocketing prices on everything from gas  to groceries. Montanans are feeling the pain in their pocketbooks every  day because of these record-high inflation numbers. That is a direct  result of the Democrats' and President Biden's tax-and-spending  problem. You see, the Democrats already flooded the economy with nearly  $2 trillion in new spending earlier this year on a purely partisan  basis, and now we see inflation at a 13-year high.   Think about it. Even if we experience no--in other words, zero  additional rise in inflation for the rest of the year, Montanans would  still be hit with an almost 5-percent increase in costs for the year.   It is interesting. A few months ago, we heard the words: Well, this  is all transitory. It is all transitory. This is going to go away in a  few months. Many of us were skeptical and didn't believe it. You are  not hearing the word ``transitory'' anymore coming from the Democrats  because if we take a look at the position the Federal Reserve has been  talking about, they are telling us inflation is here to stay at north  of 5 percent, certainly, this year and at numbers certainly greater  than that ``2 percent threshold'' that was talked about--probably in  the 4 percent to 5 percent in the outyears.   If you spend any time at all speaking to leaders in this country,  where they are every day looking at the supply chain price of goods,  they are telling you there are inflationary pressures in every part of  this economy. The absolute last thing we should be doing is spending  trillions more taxpayer dollars on top of that $2 trillion partisan  spending package the Democrats embarked on just this past March.   We know that doing so will send inflation much, much higher. You see,  inflation is a tax on all Montanans, on all Americans because as prices  go up, paychecks shrink. And Democrats have many more tax hikes planned  as they look to pay for this spending spree by asking Montana families,  Montana small businesses, our farmers and ranchers to foot the bill.   Now, I have heard my Democratic colleagues suggest this bill must be  ``paid for.'' But what does ``paid for'' mean? What does that mean? It  is very simple. It means that Democrats' reckless taxing and spending  spree will be paid for by massive tax increases.   Let's go over a few of these tax hikes that Montanans will face if  Democrats continue down this reckless path. For starters, this bill is  absolutely an assault on small businesses. By the way, small businesses  create most of the jobs in this economy. It would gut the 20-percent  small business tax deduction, placing small businesses at a  disadvantage. This deduction benefited more than 21 million small  businesses in 2019, and it generated $66 billion in tax savings that  these businesses could then reinvest and grow their business, create  more jobs, pay their employees more.   These savings help small businesses expand, allows them to compete in  this global market, to offer raises as well as bonuses. Removing this  tax benefit would make it harder--make it harder--for them to expand  and succeed against larger competitors.   The Democrats' reckless tax-and-spending spree bill would also  increase the top income tax rate to nearly 40 percent and drastically  lower the income thresholds for the top tax bracket.   Some ask: What is fair? What is fair share? Paying 40 percent of your  income to the Federal Government is where the Democrats want to take  the top rate. Since most small businesses are structured in what is  known as a passthrough, meaning business profits are taxed as income,  this tax hike would devastate our small business owners. In fact, these  two provisions alone would hurt Montana's small businesses drastically.   Over 99 percent--listen to this again. Over 99 percent of Montana  businesses are small businesses. We can't let this happen. This would  destroy livelihoods, harm local communities and local economies. In  fact, the combined tax rate for passthrough businesses would rise above  50 percent in 40 out of 50 States, including the State of Montana.   This reckless spending bill will also supercharge marriage penalties  in the Tax Code. You heard that right. You see, buried in the  Democrats' massive tax-and-spending spree is also an attack on  marriage. Married couples could be facing higher taxes simply because  they are married.   Democrats have also proposed the elimination of what is known as  stepped-up basis. This is a backdoor death tax that will hit Montana  family farms and ranchers particularly hard. You see, in Montana,  agriculture is our way of life. Our farmers and our ranchers work hard  to put food on the table for their families, for our great State, for  the country, and the entire world. The last thing that Montana farmers  and ranchers need are more taxes, and that is what the Democrats are  trying to do.   In fact, Senator Thune and I led a letter to President Biden, which  was signed by every Member of the Republican conference, urging the  President to reconsider this proposal. As of now, this is not currently  in the House Democrats' bill. But, unfortunately, the President and  many of my colleagues here in this Chamber, on the other side of the  aisle, continue to insist that this be included in their bill.   This reckless proposal will also damage our international  competitiveness. This is about a global economy. This is about winning  the global race because they want to raise the corporate tax rate to  26.5 percent. If you combine  [[Page S6572]]  that with State corporate tax rates, the average corporate tax burden  would rise to about 31 percent. And there is a startling piece of  information here. You take 31 percent and guess what. That rate would  be higher than communist China. In fact, it would be one of the highest  corporate tax rates in the entire world.   The Democrats don't understand why jobs leave our shores. I will tell  you one reason why is because of tax policy. When you raise the rates  higher than communist China, it is going to have a direct effect on  jobs here in the United States.   Do you know who is cheering about this tax increase in this  provision? I will tell you who is cheering about it. China is. They  know the Democrats' tax increase will force American businesses to send  American jobs overseas. That is the last thing we need because we need  to be supporting American businesses, supporting the American worker,  the American family, the American farmer, the American rancher and the  hard work they do every day.   Sadly, the Democrats' reckless tax-and-spending spree does exactly  the opposite. Sadly, it will put China and our global competitors  first.   For all these reasons and many more, I am very concerned about what  will happen if this dangerous proposal becomes law. I intend to fight  vigorously, along with many of my colleagues here, against it every  step of the way.   I yield back my time.
