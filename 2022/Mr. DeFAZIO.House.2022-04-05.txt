SEC. 10. GAO REPORT TO CONGRESS ON CHALLENGES UNDER PUBLIC                     ASSISTANCE ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES.         (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United       States shall conduct a study on the challenges to States and       Territories of the United States in obtaining assistance       under section 428 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief       and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5189f).        (b) Contents.--In conducting the study described in       subsection (a), the Comptroller General shall study the       challenges for assistance described in subsection (a) faced       by the following:        (1) Rural areas, as such term is defined in section 423 of       the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency       Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5189a).        (2) Small impoverished communities, as such term is defined       in section 203 of such Act.

(c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall       submit to Congress a report describing the results of the       study required under subsection (a).       SEC. 11. APPLICABILITY.         The amendments made by sections 2, 4(a), 8, and 9, and the       provisions under section 6, shall only apply to amounts       appropriated on or after the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5689, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5689, the Resilient AMERICA  Act. This bill reflects a bipartisan agreement that will significantly  enhance U.S. mitigation and resilience efforts.   Federal policy that focuses on investment in mitigation and  bolstering resilience is basic good governance and will lessen the  impacts of future disasters. For years, studies have demonstrated that  taxpayers save up to $11 for every single dollar invested in mitigation  before a disaster strikes. There is no better investment.   This legislation builds on existing mitigation efforts and will make  our Nation more resilient.   First, this legislation increases the amount of mitigation funding  FEMA may make available to States through the Pre-Disaster Mitigation  program, also known as BRIC, and makes nonprofits eligible recipients  of these funds.   Second, it expands the kind of projects eligible for mitigation  assistance through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. This includes  enhancing the resilience of utilities to risks from wildfire, which  will be of great benefit in the Western States.   Third, this legislation sets aside funds for the implementation and  enforcement of the latest building codes and standards. Building codes  make our buildings safer and more resilient. Proper building codes that  account for climate change can mean the difference between saving a  family's home and a total loss during a disaster. I strongly support  efforts to prepare buildings for actual hazard risks and climate change  with updated codes.   Lastly, this legislation creates a pilot program to fund resilience  projects at private homes. Often, homeowners cannot implement  recommended mitigation efforts, such as creating defensible space to  protect against wildfires or removing overhanging branches to remove  the risk of damage from severe storms, because they are too expensive.   This pilot program will create the first Federal grant program that  allows homeowners to proactively take mitigation into their own hands.  I am confident that empowering individuals through this program will  make families and their homes more resilient and, again, in the end,  save taxpayers money.   Representing a district that was impacted by catastrophic wildfires,  particularly in 2020, has made me painfully aware of the importance of  the provisions within this legislation. I wish that this bill and the  mitigation investments it authorizes could have been enacted prior to  the 2020 fires. It may have saved some of my constituents from the  trauma of losing their homes.   I thank Ranking Member Graves, as well as Subcommittee on Economic  Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management Chair Titus and  Ranking Member Webster for their support and for working with us on  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides to join us and  support the Resilient AMERICA Act, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters of  support for H.R. 5689, one from the Build Strong Coalition and one from  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.                                            Buildstong Coalition,                                      Washington, DC, March 1, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Dina Titus,      Subcommittee Chair, House T&I Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Daniel Webster,      Subcommittee Ranking Member,      House T&I Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: The BuildStrong       Coalition writes to express our strong support for H.R. 5689,       the Resilient Assistance for Mitigation for Environmentally       Resilient Infrastructure and Construction by Americans       (AMERICA) Act, which was passed out of the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure on October 27, 2021, with       almost unanimous backing. The undersigned organizations, as       part of the BuildStrong Coalition, urge you to schedule       consideration of the bipartisan legislation on the House       floor as soon as possible.        This legislation builds on the resilience initiatives       contained in the bipartisan infrastructure package and       provides additional tools for families, businesses, and       communities to reduce climate risks ahead of the next crisis.       As our nation's disaster profile becomes increasingly       volatile and the instances of severe climate events grow, it       is critical that Congress act on this issue.        Important mitigation measures like those included in the       Resilient AMERICA Act save lives, property, and taxpayer       money, and are crucial for reducing environmental disaster       impacts. Multiple studies have demonstrated that for every $1       spent on preventative pre-disaster mitigation and resilient       construction, there is a return of as much as $11 in savings.       Such policies are good for the environment and the economy.        This comprehensive bill contains a host of provisions       designed to create a significant number of new resources for       communities to better protect themselves ahead of natural       catastrophes. This includes policies that would increase       funding for the National Public Infrastructure Pre-Disaster       Mitigation fund (commonly known as Building Resilient       Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, Program) created by       the Disaster Recovery Reform Act to provide grants to local       governments for risk-reducing mitigation projects that make       homes and infrastructure more resilient in advance of severe       climate events, as well as those that would harden       communities by creating new resources and incentives for       states and localities to adopt and enforce modern       constructions standards and building codes. Importantly, the       bill will also establish a new pilot program under the       Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide resources to       communities and homeowners for the purpose of retrofitting       existing homes and buildings.        The BuildStrong Coalition, formed in 2011 to respond to an       increasing number of severe disasters, is made up of a       diverse group of members representing firefighters, emergency       responders, emergency managers, insurers, engineers,       architects, contractors, and manufacturers, as well as       consumer organizations, code specialists, and many others       committed to building a more disaster resilient nation. The       BuildStrong Coalition has been a partner to Congress's work       to investigate causes of, and devise the solutions to, the       rising costs and impacts of disasters in the United States.        Our organization represents the broad, bipartisan, public-      private, and nonprofit stakeholder support for H.R. 5689.       Therefore, the BuildStrong Coalition and its allied partners       again ask that it be brought to House floor for consideration       under suspension of the rules. We look forward to working       with you and are prepared to offer our institutional       expertise throughout the process.            Sincerely,                                         Natalie F. Enclade, Ph.D.,      Executive Director, BuildStrong Coalition.                                   ____                                                  December 22, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: The undersigned       organizations support H.R. 5689, the ``Resilient Assistance       for Mitigation for Environmentally Resilient Infrastructure       and Construction by Americans Act'' or ``Resilient AMERICA       Act,'' and urge you to schedule consideration of this       legislation, perhaps under suspension of the rules. This       legislation, which was reported from the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure with strong bipartisan       support, would build on the resilience initiatives contained       in the recent bipartisan infrastructure law and provide       additional tools to reduce risks posed by a changing climate.        For every dollar invested in resilience and predisaster       mitigation, the taxpayer receives anywhere from $3.00 to       $11.00 in return. Such policies are good for the environment       and the economy. This bill would:        Increase the annual spending for the new National Public       Infrastructure Predisaster Mitigation fund from up to 6% to       up to 15% of postdisaster funding.        Require unspent funds to be recaptured for mitigation and       resilience projects.        Extend eligibility for Building Resilient Infrastructure       and Communities (BRIC) program grant funding to private non-      profit organizations.        Provide a 10% set-aside within BRIC to enforce the adoption       of newer building codes.        Add wildfires and tsunamis, including strengthening       utilities against wind, ice, and wildfire risks as eligible       hazards to receive funding.        Establish a 10% set-aside within BRIC to fund residential       resilience retrofit grants--upgrades to strengthen homes       resilience and comply with consensus-based codes and       standards, including wind and roof retrofits, floodproofing,       and constructing saferooms.        We strongly support H.R. 5689 and urge that it be brought       to the House floor for expeditious consideration. We stand       ready to assist you in this process.            Sincerely,        American Council of Engineering Companies, American       Institute of Architect, American Planning Association,       American Society of Civil Engineers; American Society of       Landscape Architects; Build Strong Coalition; City Parks       Alliance; Ecological Restoration Business Association;       Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative; National       Association of Clean Water Agencies; National Association of       Counties; National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies;       National League of Cities; National Recreation and Park       Association; National Rural Electric Cooperative Association;       Rural Community Assistance Partnership; U.S. Chamber of       Commerce.   [[Page H4174]]          Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   We have just heard very telling testimony from the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves) about the issues with the frequent problems they  have had with hurricanes down there, and then the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa) talking about wildfires, which have become  more and more intense and widespread and persistent in the West.   On both sides of the aisle, I think almost any Member who has had a  disaster, a natural disaster in their district, can attest to the fact  that if his or her community had been better prepared, if they had  taken steps toward resilience, if the Federal Government had given them  that guidance and perhaps some funding incentives to put in place those  mitigation measures, that lives would have been saved, property would  have been saved, and ultimately the Federal taxpayers would save a lot  of money.   This legislation has tremendous merit, and I urge my colleagues to  support it unanimously; although, of course, we will have someone on  that side of the aisle who will call for a vote even though they might  even vote for it. Hopefully, the Senate, in its total dysfunction, will  look favorably upon this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5641) to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and  Emergency Assistance Act to increase the threshold for eligibility for  assistance under sections 403, 406, 407, and 502 of such Act, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5641         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Project Efficient and       Effective Disaster Recovery Act'' or the ``SPEED Recovery       Act''.       SEC. 2. SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURE.         (a) In General.--Section 422 of the Robert T. Stafford       Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5189)       is amended--        (1) in subsection (a) by striking ``$35,000'' each place it       appears and inserting ``$1,000,000''; and        (2) in subsection (b)(3)--        (A) in the heading by inserting ``AND REPORT'' after       ``REVIEW''; and        (B) by inserting ``and submit to the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report regarding such       review, including any recommendations developed pursuant to       such review'' after ``under this section''.        (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by subsection (a)       shall apply with respect to any amounts appropriated after       the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5641, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5641, the SPEED Recovery Act.  This bill will expedite the approval process for FEMA's small projects  within the public assistance program.   The public assistance process is often slow and impeded by  bureaucratic red tape, so FEMA offers a simplified approval procedure  for small projects that cost $139,000 or less. When this program was  implemented over 40 years ago, it was intended to capture 95 percent of  public assistance project worksheets. There has been a little inflation  since then.   Today, as we noted earlier, many disasters are more widespread and  more expensive. Today only 75 percent of projects are being captured by  the $139,000 threshold. This legislation will ensure that, once again,  95 percent of project worksheets are eligible for expedited review by  raising the qualifying project threshold to $1 million.   By updating the threshold for what qualifies as a small project,  barriers to relief and recovery will be alleviated and so will the time  it takes communities to get back on their feet post-disaster, and it  will allow the limited staff at FEMA to turn their attention to more  difficult, expensive, and problematic programs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join with me and support  this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus), the chair of the subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This is a needed adjustment in the cap, very long overdue. It will  expedite assistance to individuals, but it also will free up FEMA staff  for more meaningful chores and work on ongoing and future disasters,  mitigation, recovery, et cetera.   It has tremendous merit, and I urge that all of my colleagues support  this legislation.   It will pass by voice vote, and then someone on that side will jump  up and call for a recorded vote because that is why they think they are  supposed to be here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
