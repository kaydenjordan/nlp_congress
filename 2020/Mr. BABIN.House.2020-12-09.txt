 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. Lamborn from  Colorado, for having this Special Order Hour.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the 79th annual National  Bible Week. Since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941, every President has  set aside a time of reflection and a time of gratitude for the Good  Book in acknowledgment of its profound influence on humankind.   The Bible was perhaps the most accessible book to our Founding  Fathers, and its principles gave them valuable insights about human  nature, civic virtue, political authority, and the rights of our  citizens. Many of our founding documents contained references to the  great truths found in Scripture.   As stated in the Declaration of Independence, ``That all men are  created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain  unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness.''   Mr. Speaker, much like the early days of this great country, we are  at a critical time in our history in America. The decisions we make now  will set our course for years to come. It is my fervent prayer that we,  as Americans, turn to the Scriptures for healing and for direction. Its  principles are timeless, and its wisdom is trustworthy.   The Bible has been my comfort in sorrow, my counsel in  decisionmaking, my companion in day-to-day life. Whether conducting my  business as a dentist in Woodville, Texas, raising my family, or  serving the good people of the 36th District of Texas here in Congress,  the Good Book continually shapes the way that I try to live my life.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that the Bible is more than a book of  inspiration and comfort or simply a compilation of moral teachings. I  believe it is the Holy Word of God that contains the truth of his love  for us and his plan of redemption through faith in Jesus Christ alone.   One of the most well-known verses in the Bible, John 3:16, tells us  that:         God so loved the world that he gave His only begotten Son,       that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have       everlasting life.    There, in the pages of Scripture, God describes His great love for  us, a love that was exhibited through the gift of His only Son sent to  redeem us. And we are about to celebrate His birth.   Mr. Speaker, I will leave you with a passage of Scripture from the  Book of Job in the Old Testament that has been an encouragement for me  with its promise of eternal life. I hope that it will be for you as  well:         For I know that my Redeemer lives, and He shall stand at       last on the Earth; and after my skin is decayed, this I know,       that in my flesh I shall see God, whom I shall see for myself       and my eyes shall behold, and not another. How my heart       yearns within me.
