 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today marks the start of National Park  Week.   As a fifth-generation Montanan and as someone who grew up in  Bozeman--in fact, Mom and Dad moved there in 1964, just a short drive  from America's first national park, Yellowstone--I am very excited to  take this opportunity to celebrate the parks that are so very special  to so many because, in Montana, hiking, backpacking, fishing, and white  water rafting are a way of life.   I grew up spending as much time outdoors as possible, and I continue  that tradition with my children today. In fact, my idea of a great time  in August is to take our dogs, as many of our kids as we can get  together--according to their schedules anymore--and take our backpacks  and spend several days together in enjoying Montana's outdoors. As a  father, I am grateful to share these experiences with our four children  and instill in them a love for the outdoors. Frankly, what better place  to do that and enjoy the outdoors than in our national parks.    While Montana is privileged to have two world-famous national parks  in Glacier and Yellowstone, national parks are the pride of so many  States from Florida to Colorado, to Maine.   Speaking of Maine, I am very glad to have partnered with my colleague  from Maine in leading this week, as well as with an additional 26 of  our colleagues around the country, supporting this resolution. I am  pleased we will have the opportunity to recognize the tremendous value  our national parks bring to so many.   As this week begins, I have one challenge for everyone. I challenge  you to find time in your schedules and visit a national park. Our  national parks are what make us distinctly American. In fact, you can  go to findyourpark.com and find the closest park to you. I hope to see  all of you out there sometime this year.   With that, I would like to turn it over to my colleague and my  friend, the former Governor of Maine and now the Senator of Maine,  Angus King, who joins me in leading National Park Week.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th  birthday of Mary Kay Forsyth, originally of Bozeman, MT. She was born  in the middle of Main Street under a firetruck on April 24, 1918, and  she has been setting off alarms ever since.   Mary Kay spent her formative years in Missoula where her father,  Clyde P. Fickes, was the head the U.S. Forest Service Region 1 office.  Soon after graduating from the University of Montana in 1941 with a  double major in journalism and pre-medicine, Mary Kay married  professional hockey player, Albert J.C. Forsyth of Wainwright, Alberta.  They soon moved to Seattle to help the war effort. At the conclusion of  the war, Mr. and Mrs. Forsyth and their growing family settled in  Coronado, CA.   Mary Kay spent her life dedicated to the improvement of her  community. Her public service and spirit is an example to others and is  admired by all who know her.   Mary Kay has a loving family of four children, six grandchildren, and  four great-grandchildren. I, along with her family and friends, wish  Mary Kay a very happy 100th birthday.                            ____________________
