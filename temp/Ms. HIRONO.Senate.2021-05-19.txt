 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2  minutes.    Madam President, I would like to thank Senator Tillis for  working with me on this amendment, amendment No. 1517, to the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act, which comes from our work on the IDEA  Act, a bill that passed the Judiciary Committee last month with  bipartisan support.   Promoting innovation is key to ensuring the United States remains  competitive in an increasingly competitive global economy.  Unfortunately, the limited data that is available suggests large  segments of American society are not engaging with a key component of  the innovation economy, the U.S. patent system.   Women make up only 13 percent of inventors. Black and Hispanic  college graduates patent at approximately half the rate of their White  counterparts. Closing these patent gaps would turbocharge the U.S.  economy.   One study found that including more women and Black Americans in the  early stages of innovation could grow our economy by 3.3 percent. Hold  that thought. Another found that eliminating the patent gap for women  with science and engineering degrees alone would grow the economy by  another 2.7 percent. We are talking about hundreds of billions of  dollars of growth to our economy.   But if we have any hope of closing these patent gaps, we must first  get a firm grasp on who is and who is not using the patent system.  Unfortunately, the PTO--Patent and Trademark Office--does not collect  demographic data on applicants. As a result, researchers are forced to  guess an applicant's gender based on his or her name, determine an  applicant's race by cross-referencing census data, or explore other  options that are time-consuming, unreliable, or both.   Our amendment solves this problem. It would enable the PTO to collect  demographic data from patent applicants on a volunteer basis. I want to  repeat that. This is on a volunteer basis. Nobody is forcing anyone to  provide this kind of information. This data could then be analyzed by  the PTO and outside researchers to identify where patent gaps exist and  how to address them.   Let me be clear. Simply providing researchers more data would not  solve  [[Page S2769]]  the patent gaps facing women, racial minorities, and so many others,  but it is a critical first step. We need to have data with which to  make decisions.   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Filipino  Veterans Family Reunification Act of 2021. This important legislation  would expedite the visa process for adult children of Filipino World  War II veterans, so they can reunite with their relatives in the United  States. Today, fewer than 6,000 Filipino World War II veterans remain.  Many of these veterans are now in their late 80s and 90s, and have been  separated from their loved ones for far too long.   During World War II, more than 250,000 Filipino soldiers fought under  the American flag to protect and defend the United States in the  Pacific  [[Page S2784]]  theater. These Filipino soldiers fought shoulder to shoulder with U.S.  servicemembers, and approximately 60,000 died in battle. The U.S.  government promised these veterans compensation and benefits in  exchange for their loyal service to our country. However, after the  war, Congress passed the Rescission Act of 1946, denying Filipino  veterans many of the benefits conferred to other World War II veterans.   Filipino World War II veterans were not awarded U.S. citizenship  until 1990, more than 40 years after they risked their lives for our  Nation. Although the Immigration Act of 1990 granted U.S. citizenship  to approximately 26,000 Filipino nationals who served during World War  II, the law did not confer citizenship or residency to their children.  Therefore, the children of the Filipino veterans are required to apply  for family-based green cards which are subject to an annual limitation  as well as a country cap. Under the cap, only seven percent of  recipients are permitted to come from a single country. These  limitations have created a large backlog of people trying to reunite  with family from the Philippines and as a result, some Filipino  applicants must wait nearly two decades before their petitions can be  considered.   In an attempt to partially resolve this issue, in 2016 under the  Obama Administration, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)  established the Filipino World War II Veterans Parole (FWVP) program to  reunite veterans and their surviving spouses with their adult children  and siblings. Under FWVP, USCIS can grant parole on a discretionary,  case-by-case basis, to a veteran's family member so that they may come  to the United States as they wait for their immigrant visa to become  available. This policy recognizes the extraordinary contributions and  sacrifices of Filipino veterans while also allowing these elderly  veterans to be cared for by family. Despite the value of this program,  the Trump Administration announced its intention to terminate FWVP and  in December 2020, published final steps to end this program in the  Federal Register. I joined Rep. Ed Case in sending a bicameral and  bipartisan letter with colleagues to President Biden in February,  urging the new administration to rescind the termination efforts and  renew FWVP.   The threat to end FWVP persists to this day. The legislation that I  am introducing, the Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act of 2021,  would resolve this issue permanently and fulfill our nation's promise  to honor the Filipino World War II veterans' service to our country.  This bill would help to reunite these families by exempting the sons  and daughters of Filipino World War II veterans from immigration  limitations in the Immigration and Nationality Act. This change in law  would benefit only a few thousand surviving Filipino World War II  veterans who desperately want to be reunited with their children in  their last years.   I call on my Senate colleagues to quickly pass this bill.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Rubio, Mrs. Shaheen,          Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Blunt, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Burr,          Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Sasse, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Cotton, Mr. King,          and Mr. Risch):   S. 1714. A bill to amend the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949  to authorize the provision of payment to personnel of the Central  Intelligence Agency who incur qualifying injuries to the brain, to  authorize the provision of payment to personnel of the Department of  State who incur similar injuries, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
