 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in recognition  of National Gun Violence Survivors Week.   Last month, with the leadership of my House colleagues and Senator  Elizabeth Warren, I was proud to introduce the Gun Violence Prevention  and Community Safety Act, the most comprehensive piece of gun reform  legislation this Chamber has ever seen.   We will mandate universal background checks, which will help keep  guns out of the hands of those who should not have them. We will crack  down on gun trafficking. And we will hold the gun industry accountable  for putting profits over the safety of the American people.   I promise today to fight so that not one more American is burdened  with living as a gun violence survivor because of irresponsible,  outdated, and morally bankrupt Federal gun policies.                            ____________________
