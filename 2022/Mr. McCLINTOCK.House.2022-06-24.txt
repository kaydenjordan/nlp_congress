 Mr. Speaker, instead of treating law-abiding citizens  as if they were criminals, maybe we should start treating criminals as  if they were criminals. Stop the plea bargains, put gun predators  behind bars until they are old and gray, and execute the murderers.   Those measures worked until a generation of soft-on-crime judges,  woke district attorneys, and politically correct police commissioners  made a mockery of our laws.   If someone is dangerously mentally ill, then, of course, they should  not have access to firearms. They shouldn't have access to any kind of  weapons. We once confined them so we could treat them and prevent them  from doing harm during the course of their illness. We had a commitment  process that respected due process. They could come before a judge to  challenge the findings in open court, submit evidence on their behalf,  and face their accuser, but not under the red flag laws this bill  promotes.   An anonymous accuser can trigger a secret proceeding against you that  you don't even know is happening until the police bang on your door in  the dead of night, ransack your house, and strip you of your right of  self-defense. The burden then falls on you to try to restore it.   This bill also targets young adults for special restrictions. We  trust them to vote, to start families, to enter into legally binding  agreements, but we don't trust them with firearms because of what some  criminal or madman their age did?   Just laws hold people accountable for their own actions; unjust laws  hold them accountable for other people's actions. This is an unjust  law.   These atrocities will go on until we get the criminals and madmen off  our streets. How many more tragedies do we need to go through before  the Congress understands this self-evident truth?
