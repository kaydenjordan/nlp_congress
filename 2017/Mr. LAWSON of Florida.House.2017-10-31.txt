 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and  legacy of former Florida Senator Dr. Arnett Girardeau, who passed away  last Thursday.   Senator Girardeau represented Jacksonville in the Florida  Legislature. He was among the first African Americans to serve in the  Florida Senate, and the first African American to serve as a senate  president pro tempore.   During the 16 years that he served in the Florida Legislature, he  provided principled leadership and service to our State, to our  country, and he served as a role model of excellence to many of us who  would follow in his footsteps.   As a young legislator, Senator Girardeau helped to mentor me and many  of my other colleagues in north Florida. He was a founding member and  chairman of the Florida Conference of Black State Legislators.   We extend our condolences to not only his wife, Carolyn, but  especially to his family. He truly was an outstanding leader and a  trailblazer in the State of Florida.                            ____________________
