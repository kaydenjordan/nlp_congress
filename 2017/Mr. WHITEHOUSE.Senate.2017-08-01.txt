 Mr. President, I think we are waiting for Senator  Grassley to come, and then we will be ready to proceed.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    Mr. President, I think we are waiting for Senator  Grassley to come, and then we will be ready to proceed.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Mr.  Chairman.   Chairman Grassley has been a wonderful colleague in this effort. It  is the culmination of years of work, including multiple committee  hearings, briefings at home in Rhode Island and elsewhere, and really  working the regular order of the Senate to get this done. Chairman  Grassley has been both patient and persistent, and I really appreciate  his leadership.   I also thank our ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator  Feinstein, for her work. I thank Senator Rand Paul. He would have liked  to have seen a stronger bill, but it simply--as would we have, by the  way. He held on for a while, hoping we could strengthen it, but it  turned out there was objection to that--and he was gracious about  yielding--and now we are able to move forward bipartisanly and  unanimously.   The history of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act is  a noble history. It is because of this law that children aren't locked  up in adult prisons any longer. It is because of this law that children  don't get placed in solitary confinement for extended periods or  shackled when they are arrested for things like running away from home  or not coming to school, but it had been a while since this bill was  updated.   The last time it was reauthorized was 13 years ago, and we have  learned a lot about adolescent development and the best practices for  dealing with children in those 13 years. So we are moving forward  today.   I look forward to working with my chairman on the broad-based  criminal justice reform that he is championing in the committee, but  there is no reason we shouldn't go forward with getting juvenile  justice right while we move on to other areas.   I particularly want to thank him and recognize the groups involved  for the patient work that was done over many years with all sorts of  interested groups. We had to make this right. We wanted to minimize  conflict. We wanted to maximize what we were able to accomplish, and  the result is, we have over 150 organizations that have endorsed this  legislation, from the ACLU to the national association that supports  probation and parole officers, from Boys Town to the National  Association of Counties and the National Center for Victims of Crime.   The bill focuses the way it should, on evidence-based and trauma- informed programs that have emerged in the last 13 years. It focuses on  protecting juveniles who are held in adult facilities, making sure they  are fully separated in sight and sound from adult inmates. It limits  the narrow circumstances under which they may be confined in isolation,  and it requires data-driven approaches to reduce ethnic and racial  disparities.   We recognize that kids now are much more vulnerable to substance  abuse issues and that they, too, face mental health challenges, and we  try to bring this bill together so States have to provide appropriate  treatment and recognition when the cause of what is going on in that  child's life is substance abuse or a mental health challenge.   We make it a good deal harder to incarcerate for the status offenses.  A status offense is an offense that wouldn't even be an offense if an  adult did it. It is only because you are a child that it is even an  offense at all--skipping school or running away from home and so forth.  There are better ways to deal with those children than incarcerating  them, and we steer in this direction, promoting the community-based  alternatives to the tension.   For instance, we have community courts in Rhode Island that work  really well, where the family is engaged, the child is engaged, and the  community is engaged. They really learn a lesson from what they did.  They have to do something helpful in order to kind of remediate  themselves with their community. It has been very successful. So there  are real things that can be done. Of course, separating a child from  their family in order to try to improve their situation is usually  something that backfires. You need to have the family engaged.   Consistent with Senator Portman's remarks, we also recognize that  very often some of the times that children get in trouble is because  they have been traumatized. They have been either the victim of  violence themselves or witnessed violence in ways that have created  trauma and, in many cases, are sadly the victims of child sex  trafficking.   So we focus on States identifying and responding to those particular  children to make sure, if that is what is behind what is going on, that  those needs are met--simple things. We banned the use of shackles on  girls once they are pregnant. It shouldn't be asking too much, and it  is about time we stopped shackling girls, particularly pregnant girls.   Last, something near and dear to my chairman's heart, it improves the  accountability and the oversight of the Federal grants program. I know  that has been a goal he has pursued for a long time. The chairman is  one of the most determined Members of the Senate when it comes to  transparency and accountability, and so I am very pleased to be his  partner in that particular piece of the bill.   With that, I yield the floor back to Chairman Grassley so he may take  us through the formal steps of passing this law. It is a very happy  moment for me, and I extend my appreciation to Chairman Grassley.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.    Mr. President, I am here to speak about something  else, but let me take just a moment and thank my chairman for what he  has done. I had the experience of serving on the HELP Committee with  Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray when we did the Education  bill last year.   Education is nearly as fraught a topic politically around here as  healthcare is, and what we saw in a thoughtful, regular-order process  that was developed under Chairman Alexander's leadership was a very  considerable piece of work with real effect.   Sometimes we agree on something on both sides of the aisle in this  body because there is nothing to it. It is ``National Peaches Week'' or  something, and everyone votes for that. But when it is something big  and something consequential, that is where difficulties begin to  emerge, and what the chairman was able to work in the committee was  something big and something consequential on healthcare. To the end of  my days in the Senate, I am going to remember that closing vote, when  the clerk of the committee called the roll, and every single member of  the HELP Committee voted in favor of the measure. It came out of the  committee unanimously, and with that burst of energy, it came through  the floor fine, and it passed the House without too many changes. It  was just a remarkable piece of work. So I have seen what the HELP  Committee can do under Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray,  and I am filled with confidence that the process can be terrific there,  and I am filled with goodwill toward a successful outcome.   I just think what the chairman has said is terrific, and I wanted to  say a few words of appreciation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 17 minutes  in morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, what I would like to speak about is a  new form of fossil fuel-funded climate denial spin that has just  entered the climate debate. They are always up to something, and here  is their latest. The Trump administration's two great scientists, Scott  Pruitt and Rick Perry, the Frick and Frack of climate denial, have  called for a science showdown, where climate denial and climate science  can have it out for once and for all--red team versus blue team.  ``Fossil fuel man'' Pruitt has even called for the showdown to be peer  reviewed. Well, what is comical about that is that climate science has  been peer reviewed all along. That is how it gets to be science--by  going through and surviving the process of peer review by other  scientists.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a letter to Administrator Pruitt from a wide range of scientific  organizations pointing out to him this very fact, that climate science  is called climate science because it has been through scientific peer  review.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      July 31, 2017.      Hon. Scott Pruitt,      Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,           Washington, DC.        Dear Administrator Pruitt: As leaders of professional       scientific societies with our collective membership of       hundreds of thousands of scientists, we are writing in       response to reports that you are working to develop a ``red       team/blue team'' process that challenges climate science.        We write to remind you of the ongoing research, testing,       evaluations, and debates that happen on a regular basis in       every scientific discipline. The peer review process itself       is a constant means of scientists putting forth research       results, getting challenged, and revising them based on       evidence. Indeed, science is a multi-dimensional, competitive       ``red team/blue team'' process whereby scientists and       scientific teams are constantly challenging one another's       findings for robustness. The current scientific understanding       of climate change is based on decades of such work, along       with overarching, carefully evaluated assessments within the       United States and internationally.        As a reflection of that work, 31 scientific societies last       year released a letter, updated from 2009, to reflect the       current scientific consensus on climate change. We urge you       to give its text consideration, along with America's Climate       Choices, the work of our premier United States scientific       body, the National Academy of Sciences.        Of course, climate science, like all sciences, is an ever-      changing discipline: our knowledge is always advancing.       Robust discussion about data interpretation, methodology, and       findings are part of daily scientific discourse. That is how       science progresses. However, the integrity of the scientific       process cannot thrive when policymakers--regardless of party       affiliation--use policy disagreements as a pretext to       challenge scientific conclusions.        Given your interest in the state of climate science, we       would welcome the opportunity to meet with you to better       understand your perspective and rationale for the proposed       activity; and to discuss climate science, including which       areas are at the frontiers of scientific knowledge and which       are well-established because of thousands of studies from       multiple lines of evidence.        We look forward to hearing from you, and your office may       contact Lexi Shultz, Kasey White, or Joanne Carney to       coordinate a meeting.            Sincerely,          Rush D. Holt, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, American             Association for the Advancement of Sciences; Robert             Gropp, Ph.D., Co-Executive Director, American institute             of Biological Sciences; Chris McEntee, Executive             Director and CEO, American Geophysical Union; Ellen             Bergfeld, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, American             Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America,             Soil Science Society of America; Brian Crother, Ph.D.,             President Elect, American Society of Ichthyologists and             Herpetologists; Crispin B.

Climate denial, on the other hand, avoids peer review  as if it were Kryptonite, so this call for peer review of the contest  between climate science and climate denial is almost comical, except  for the evil intent behind it and, of course, the stakes. How very  risky and dangerous continuing to get this climate issue wrong is for  our country.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  an op-ed written by John Holdren, until recently the President's  climate adviser, called ``The perversity of `red-teaming' climate  science.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From bostonglobe.com, July 25, 2017]              The Perversity of `Red-Teaming' Climate Science                            (By John P. Holdren)         EPA administrator Scott Pruitt is reportedly giving serious       consideration to investing the taxpayers' money in a ``red       team-blue team'' effort to determine whether current       scientific understandings about climate change are actually       right. The idea is that a ``red team'' made up of officials       from government agencies with responsibilities related to       climate would try to poke holes in mainstream climate       science, while a similarly constituted ``blue team'' would       have the task of defending the mainstream consensus against       this critique. Supposedly, this process would shed new light       on what is known and what is not about human influence on the       global climate. But the argument that such a process would be       helpful is some combination of naive and disingenuous.        All of science works through the continuous application of       the skeptical scrutiny of key findings by essentially       everybody working in a given field. This happens in part  [[Page S4661]]       through the peer-review process that findings must survive       before being published in a scientific journal. It happens       far more widely through the scrutiny of the wider community       of experts in any given field once the findings have been       published. That scrutiny is intense, not least because       scientists make their reputations in substantial part by       providing corrections and refinements to the published       findings of others. This is the essence of the cumulative and       self-correcting nature of the scientific enterprise as a       whole.        Precisely because climate science has policy implications       that appear to challenge the status quo in global energy       supply, moreover, the degree of professional skeptical       scrutiny to which key climate-science findings have been       subjected has far exceeded even the already pervasive and       rigorous norm. Climate science has been repeatedly ``red-      teamed,'' both by groups of avowed contrarians sponsored by       right-wing groups and by the most qualified parts of the       world's scientific community. The right wing's ``red team''       efforts have consistently been characterized by brazen       cherry-picking, misrepresentation of the findings of others,       recycling of long-discredited hypotheses, and invention of       new ones destined to be discredited. Almost none of this       material has survived peer review to be published in the       respectable professional literature.        Of course, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change       itself, which works under the auspices of the UN Framework       Convention on Climate Change, can be regarded as a ``red       team-blue team'' operation, in which every conclusion must       pass muster with a huge team of expert authors and reviewers       from a wide variety of disciplines and nations (including       from Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers inclined to       be skeptical). The IPCC has produced five massive assessments       of climate science (in 1990, 1995, 2001, 2007, and 2013-14),       each more emphatic than the last in its conclusions that       human-produced greenhouses gases are changing global climate       with ongoing and growing impacts on human well-being.        Climate-change science has likewise been reviewed regularly       by committees of the US National Academy of Sciences, the       United Kingdom's Royal Society, the World Meteorological       Organization, the American Geophysical Union, and many other       reputable bodies, all of which have contributed to and       confirmed the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable       scientists on the five key points that really matter for       policy: (1) The Earth's climate is changing in ways not       explainable by the known natural influences; (2) the dominant       cause is the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere       that has resulted from burning coal, oil, and natural gas,       and from land-use change; (3) significant harm to humans and       ecosystems from these changes is already occurring; (4) the       harm will continue to grow for decades because of inertia in       the climate system and society's energy system; and (5) the       future harm will be much smaller if the world's nations take       concerted, aggressive evasive action than if they do not.        What, then, could explain the interest in a new ``red team-      blue team'' effort on climate science organized by the       federal government? Some proponents may believe, naively,       that such a rag-tag process could unearth flaws in mainstream       climate science that the rigorous, decades-long scrutiny of       the global climate-science community, through multiple layers       of formal and informal expert peer review, has somehow       missed. But I suspect that most of the advocates of the       scheme are disingenuous, aiming to get hand-picked non-      experts from federal agencies to dispute the key findings of       mainstream climate science and then assert that the verdict       of this kangaroo court has equal standing with the findings       of the most competent bodies in the national and       international scientific communities. The purpose of that, of       course, would be to create a sense of continuing uncertainty       about the science of climate change, as an underpinning of       the Trump administration's case for not addressing it. Sad.     Mr. President, let's go back to the basics here. The  basic fact is that the scientific truth of climate change threatens the  business model of enormous industries that spew carbon dioxide, and it  challenges the ideology of rightwing fanatics who spew hatred of  government. That is what the background is to all of this, and there  has been a scheme for years to protect the industry's business model  and the ideology of its associated cohort of fanatics. That scheme from  the industry and the rightwing fanatics has been to attack climate  science. They have been at it for years.   If you are a huge polluting industry or a rightwing fanatic, how do  you go about attacking science? Well, you can't win a real attack on  the science, precisely because the polluter nonsense could not make it  through peer review. Peer review is the most basic test to enter  scientific debate, but they fail at peer review because their argument  is bogus, phony, and it is a front. So the scheme has always been to  avoid peer review because it is a test they would fail.   If you are going to fail the peer review test, what do you do?  Instead of a direct attack through peer review journals, they attack  science from the side. They create a phony parallel science, a  simulacrum of science that doesn't have to face peer review. Their  phony science doesn't even have to be true. In fact, they don't care  whether it is true; indeed, I contend that some of them know it is not  true and are engaged in deliberate, knowing fraud. But, in any event,  getting to the truth is not the point of this phony parallel science.  The goal is political, not scientific.   What they want is for government--us--to let them keep polluting.  Polluting with their product makes them big, big money, and they don't  want to stop. So the goal is not to enter the scientific debate on  scientific terms. This is no quest for truth; this is a quest to  influence public opinion. So the polluter nonsense doesn't have to be  true; it just has to sound legitimate enough to influence an uninformed  public. The goal is to fool the public and mess with politics. That is  how they keep the political pressure off having to clean up their act.  Their battlefield is the public mind, and their goal is to pollute the  public mind with false doubts about the real science.   The climate denial apparatus that Pruitt and Perry serve just needs  to create the illusion that there is still scientific doubt, and it  just has to create that illusion in the minds of a nonscientific  audience--the average voter, people who don't know any better and  shouldn't be expected to. To do this, they have set up an elaborate con  game to help them foment this illusion that there is a real contest  here.   Their first trick, of course, is to hide the hand of the funders who  back this scheme behind innocent or respectable-sounding names. If  people saw the hand of ExxonMobil or Koch Industries behind this  scheme, well, the jig would be up, so they have to back front groups-- dozens, indeed, of front groups. The front groups take nice, cozy words  like ``heritage'' and ``heartland'' and ``prosperity,'' and they stick  them on the front of the front group.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  an article entitled ``EPA is asking a climate denier think tank for  help recruiting its `red team' '' in this effort at the conclusion of  my remarks.   This article points out that they are actually recruiting one of  these phony front groups, the Heartland Institute, comparing climate  scientists to the Unabomber, so you know that is going to be a fair  contest between climate science and climate deniers when the group  involved is a fossil-funded group that has compared climate scientists  to the Unabomber. Of course you want them in the debate, don't you? It  is laughable, except for the fact that it is really not.   The other thing these groups do is they go down the shelves of  American history and they grab the names of heroes and they slap these  great names onto other phony front groups. Even the great GEN George C.  Marshall has had his name slapped on a front group.   I am a big fan of General Marshall. He is a hero of mine. Winston  Churchill called him ``the organizer of victory'' in World War II. The  Marshall plan saved Europe after that war. He won a Nobel Prize,  deservedly. But in General Marshall's life of dedicated service to our  country, he had his share of sorrows, and one of those sorrows was that  he had no children. So today, there are no living children or  grandchildren to defend his name. Any rascal can put General Marshall's  name on a bogus enterprise, and these rascals did. It is beyond low.   So that is the first trick: Hide the polluters' hand behind an  innocent or respectable-sounding name.   The second trick is camouflage. They ape real science by setting up  groups with names that sound like scientific organizations. So when the  United Nations convenes the real Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change, they put up a Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate  Change.   They ape scientific activities. If scientific organizations have  conferences, they have conferences. If scientific organizations have  colloquiums, they have colloquiums. If scientific organizations publish  findings, they publish findings. The difference is, it is all phony.  None of it is peer reviewed. It is not real science; it is a masquerade  designed to give the appearance of science without any of the rigor of  peer  [[Page S4662]]  review and the other attributes of real science.   They even ape the publications of real science. I don't have the  chart with me, but there is a publication by the legitimate U.S. Global  Change Research Program that is entitled ``Global Climate Change  Impacts in the United States.'' That is for real. It is real science.  Then there is a look-alike publication called ``Addendum: Global  Climate Change Impacts in the United States,'' which was cooked up by  the Koch brothers-backed CATO Institute--same print, same text, same  color. It virtually is a masquerade of the real item.   The first thing is to hide industry's hand behind the front group,  and the second is to mask propaganda activities in camouflage that  resembles actual scientific activity without having to pass any tests  of scientific activity.   The last thing is to run the operation like a marketing campaign,  since, well, that is what it is. You wouldn't market soap in peer- reviewed scientific journals, would you? First of all, the journals  wouldn't publish it. Secondly, that is not your audience anyway. It is  the same here. It doesn't do these scoundrels any good to be publishing  in peer-reviewed scientific journals, even if they could get their  nonsense published there. The people who read scientific journals know  better. That is not their audience, and they know that they will lose  in front of a scientific audience. They would shrivel up like the  Wicked Witch. So they want to go right to the public with Madison  Avenue-quality salesmanship and glossy messaging, marketing their  dressed-up climate denial nonsense like you would market a new soap or  spaghetti sauce. Go straight to TV, straight to talk radio, straight  into the political debate.    The notion that the climate denial crowd now wants a scientific  showdown--some ``high noon'' for climate denial--is ridiculous. First,  they do not. We know they do not. They have been dodging away from peer  review for years. They want peer review like the Wicked Witch wanted  water.   So what are they up to?   Their gambit is yet another climate denial rhetorical trick to  misdirect people to the thought that maybe climate science has not been  peer reviewed either.   Climate science is nothing but peer reviewed--that is how it gets to  be science--but this bit of trickery sets up in the unknowing person's  mind the thought that climate science might not be peer reviewed. If  our Frick and Frack of climate denial, Pruitt and Perry, had said  outright that climate science is not peer reviewed, that would be a  flat lie, and they would be caught out. Instead, they performed this  rhetorical bank shot just to lay that suggestion out there, knowing  perfectly well that it is false. It is a little like the old ``when did  you stop beating your wife?'' trick. It lays out a false predicate by  insinuation where the fact, itself, could not be properly asserted.   The purpose here, like the purpose of all climate denial schemes, is  to buy more time for the polluters. Think how long this imaginary  process of preparing for climate denial ``high noon'' will take. Oh,  they could spin this out for years.   One thing you can bet is that game day will never come, but in the  meantime, they have the craftily embedded lie out there that climate  denial and climate science stand on an equal footing and just await  peer review to decide between them, and now that lie can just hang out  there, leaking its poison into the public debate.   I have to ask: Who thinks this stuff up? They have made a new art  form out of propaganda. Think what a schemer you have to be to think  this stuff up. That is the kind of people we are dealing with here, and  in this bizarro world, Frick and Frack hold high office.   The problem is that there actually is a judge here. A real ``high  noon'' will actually come. As the old saying goes, time will tell. When  it comes to climate change, the laws of physics and chemistry and  biology are at work. The things that CO2 concentrations do  in the atmosphere are going to happen no matter what we say or believe  about them. The laws of physics do not depend on political beliefs. The  chemistry of what happens when seawater is exposed to more and more  CO2 is going to happen, and it will follow the laws of  chemistry, not our opinions or beliefs.   What we humans say or what we believe or what we have been conned  into believing by the climate denial scheme will not matter at all. Our  views--our opinions--are not part of the equation. Fill one room with  climate deniers and fill another room with climate scientists, and the  same chemistry experiment will have the same results in both rooms.  Chemistry does not care about our opinions.   The way trees and animals and fish and insects and viruses and  bacteria react to new temperatures and new levels of acidity and new  environments we have no say in. The fossil fuel industry can cow  westerners into silence or even con them into believing the industry's  climate denial nonsense, and the bark beetle will not care. It will not  even know that the con game is being run. The bark beetle will just  keep eating its way up the warming latitudes and altitudes and killing  pine forests by the hundreds of square miles.   What science does for us is give us the ability, as humans, to  understand the laws of science so that we can predict what will and  will not happen. Science provides mankind with headlights so that we  can look ahead and see what the future portends, but turning off those  headlights by denying the science or trying to distract the driver so  that we are not even looking out the windshield will not change what is  ahead. Whatever is coming at us is still coming at us. We just will not  see it in time to steer around it in order to minimize the collision or  slow down and soften the impact. We will not have time because we will  have given that time to the polluters. Time is what they want--more  time for the polluters to make big money.   All of this lying, all of this science denial is actually, truly, an  evil thing, and the cleverer it gets with these bank shot, faux ``high  noon'' showdown, tricky lies, actually, the more evil it is. The people  who are behind this are doing a very grievous wrong. They are  dishonorable, dishonest, and disgraceful. Time will tell us just how  wicked they are.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    [From ThinkProgress, July 25, 2017]  EPA Is Asking a Climate Denier Think Tank for Help Recruiting Its `Red                                   Team'                               (By Erin Auel)         The Environmental Protection Agency has asked the Heartland       Institute, a D.C.-based rightwing think tank that denies the       human causes of climate change, to help identify scientists       to join the agency's so-called red team-blue team effort to       ``debate'' the science of climate change, according to the       Washington Examiner.        The move is part of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's       efforts to undercut established climate science within the       agency. In an interview with Reuters earlier this month,       Pruitt suggested the possibility of creating a red team to       provide ``a robust discussion'' on climate science and       determine whether humans ``are contributing to [warming].''        The Heartland Institute offers a model of what the EPA red       team might look like. Their contrarian Nongovernmental       International Panel on Climate Change--often referred to as a       red team--publishes regular volumes of a report called       ``Climate Change Reconsidered.''        Heartland communications director Jim Lakely told the       Washington Examiner the red team exercises to critique       climate science are necessary ``to critically examine what       has become alarmist dogma rather than a sober evaluation of       climate science for many years.'' But, as many scientists and       experts have noted, the peer review process for scientific       publications already requires and facilitates rigorous       examination.        For years, the Heartland Institute has spread       misinformation about climate change and attacked the       credibility of climate scientists. In 2012, the group       launched a billboard campaign with the photographs of Ted       Kaczynski (the Unabomber), Charles Manson, and Osama bin       Laden, saying those men ``still believe in global warming.''       Heartland's website at the time declared ``the most prominent       advocates of global warming aren't scientists. They are       murderers, tyrants, and madmen.''        More recently, the group announced plans to send a report       titled ``Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming'' to       every K-12 teacher and college professor in America. The       report incorrectly denies humans' contributions to rising       global temperatures.        Pruitt has adopted much of the misinformation that       Heartland promotes. Since being confirmed, Pruitt has       continued to question the science behind climate change and       repeated climate denier talking points claiming that humans       are not the main contributors to a warming planet.        And Heartland experts have already had an active role in       Trump's administration. Dan  [[Page S4663]]       Simmons, currently an assistant to Energy Secretary Rick       Perry, is still listed as an author on Heartland's website.       Myron Ebell, a noted climate denier, led Trump's EPA       transition team and has written several pieces opposing       climate policy for Heartland.        Heartland has received funding from several fossil fuel       companies, though it no longer publicly discloses its       funders. In 2012, leaked documents from the group showed the       group received contributions from the Charles G. Koch       Charitable Foundation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among       others. It has also received funding from ExxonMobil to       support work to refute the human causes of climate change.        Last month, Heartland announced former Kansas congressman       Tim Huelskamp will become president of the organization.       During his political career, Huelskamp's top donor was Koch       Industries, and he received more than $250,000 in campaign       contributions from the oil and gas industry. Koch Industries       and the Koch family foundations have been one of the biggest       funders of organizations that deny humans' role in causing       climate change and oppose policies to reduce greenhouse gas       emissions.        It remains to be seen who will staff the EPA's red team.       NYU professor Steve Koonin, a scientist who formerly worked       with both BP and the Obama administration, is reportedly the       top contender. In 2014, Koonin wrote a Wall Street Journal       op-ed detailing the ways in which climate science is not       settled, which included the extent to which humans are       causing climate change, a now-frequent talking point among       Trump administration officials.        In April, Koonin published another op-ed in the Wall Street       Journal, suggesting that a Red Team/Blue Team would be ``a       step toward resolving . . . differing perceptions of climate       science.''
