 Mr. President, yesterday I joined the fellow leaders of  the Environment and Public Works Committee to introduce America's  Transportation Infrastructure Act, a 5-year reauthorization bill that  would deliver resources to repair and maintain critical surface  transportation infrastructure.   Today the committee approved our comprehensive legislation with a  strong bipartisan vote of 21 to 0 this morning.   As the chair of the EPW's Transportation and Infrastructure  Subcommittee, I am incredibly proud of this legislation, which is the  result of months of serious negotiations with the full committee  chairman, Senator Barrasso, and Ranking Member Carper, my subcommittee,  and my ranking member, Senator Cardin of Maryland.   It was not always easy, but I think we have produced a bill that  achieves our priorities and secures needed investments in our Nation's  infrastructure. First and foremost, the bill provides additional  funding for highway investment. How many times do we hear: We don't  have enough money to complete this. We can't get it done.   This also maintains the States' shares through formula dollars. That  means a rising tide lifts all boats, whether a State is urban or rural,  like my home State of West Virginia.   The majority of these funds--90 percent--are distributed by the  formula to the States, providing maximum flexibility to our State  programs, and with a full 5-year reauthorization, State DOTs will have  the certainty they need to plan their investments without fear of  lapses in their contracting authority. After all, it is the States, not  the bureaucrats in Washington, that know their communities' needs the  best.   Our legislation would get rid of some of the obstacles the States  face as they work to start and finalize infrastructure plans. They take  forever, and they cost so much. The bill incorporates the Trump  administration's focus on One Federal Decision. Under that policy, the  U.S. Department of Transportation is in charge of leading the  regulatory review process--One Federal Decision--and it would  consolidate the review of other Federal agencies like the EPA, the  Corps of Engineers, and others who weigh in on these projects. That  means the States will not end up in a regulatory purgatory, going back  and forth from agency to agency seeking endless approvals.   DOT would also maintain a Federal dashboard system so the States can  see where they stand in the process.   America's Transportation Infrastructure Act directs the Department of  Transportation to work to complete its review process within 2 years  and to push other agencies to expedite their regulatory reviews.  Everything drags on so much, and it makes it so long and expensive.  This would push our agencies to expedite their regulatory reviews under  its own categorical exclusions. That is a fancy term for when the  Department doesn't think a full, costly, and time-consuming permitting  process is necessary for a straightforward infrastructure project such  as replacing a bridge from right where it is and putting a new bridge  right where it is. It takes forever. So we would eliminate that.   We also worked in a bipartisan way to promote natural infrastructure  that will help reduce costs and timelines, diminish environmental  impacts, and improve the resiliency of our infrastructure to natural  disasters such as floods that are so common in my part of the country.   West Virginia has the unfortunate title of being in the top five  States of structurally deficient bridges. That is why I am very proud  that America's Transportation and Infrastructure Act includes language  I cosponsored with Senator Brown implementing the new Bridge Investment  Program.   This program will infuse $6 billion over 5 years in additional  funding to fix bridges in poor condition--dedicated funding that is  essential to addressing this problem.   When faced with the decision on using scarce taxpayer dollars on a  new highway expansion or improving bridge safety, too often--it is too  tempting--States opt for the appeal of a ribbon-cutting on a new  stretch of highway. Now, hopefully, they won't have to make that choice  and we can reduce both congestion and the odds of a bridge failure-- something that not only threatens our lives but also cuts off a  community while they wait for a costly replacement.   The climate and resilience portion of America's Transportation  Infrastructure Act will reduce emissions from the transportation sector  and ensure that the taxpayers are not repeatedly replacing  infrastructure affected by natural disasters.   This portion of the bill also includes important bipartisan  legislation that I cosponsored. The first is called the USE IT Act.  This would facilitate the deployment of carbon capture, utilization,  and storage technologies by reducing regulatory obligations that the  project stakeholders would face. It also includes the Diesel Emissions  Reduction Act, which will provide funding to States and communities to  replace older, smog-producing vehicles--like obsolete schoolbuses--with  modern vehicles that use diesel, propane, natural gas, and electricity.   Most importantly for West Virginia and for broader Appalachia, this  legislation includes several provisions, which I wrote, to accelerate  the completion of the Appalachian Development Highway System and  reauthorize the economic development activities of the Appalachian  Regional Commission. The commission was first authorized in 1965. The  Appalachian Development Highway System was designed to better integrate  our region with the Midwest, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and South. For an  economically-distressed area with communities that are relatively  isolated, this infrastructure network is vital. It is vital for  attracting investment, creating new economic opportunities, and  improving quality of life.   The Appalachian Regional Commission has found that the highway system  has already created and supported more than 168,000 jobs and generated  $7.8 billion in wage income that otherwise would not have existed.  Those wages, in turn, drive local and Federal  [[Page S5173]]  tax bases. Completing this system would generate an additional $8.7  billion in annual economic activity. It would support another 46,000  jobs and lead to an additional $2.7 billion in worker income. These are  very significant numbers. I can't really overstate the impact this  additional economic activity would have in our region.   Unfortunately, the Appalachian Development Highway System is only 90  percent complete. The remaining 10 percent generally represents the  most challenging mountain terrain, and that means these are the  costliest and most environmentally complicated miles to complete. We  have to get this done.   The highway system was started almost 55 years ago. America is better  than letting an infrastructure priority just sit around for more than  half a century with no end in sight due to lack of funding or  regulatory uncertainty. This was also a promise made to the people of  Appalachia.   The Appalachian Development Highway System completion was identified  as being in our national interest in the last two highway bills. But it  is America's Transportation Infrastructure Act that will actually  provide a mechanism to move us toward the finish line.   Beyond the regulatory reforms I just spoke about, my language allows  States that for whatever reason have accrued significant Appalachian  Development Highway System balances to exchange those dollars with  States like West Virginia that are still working to complete projects,  like our Corridor H. But we lack the resources to engineer and  construct these challenging remaining miles. In return, those States  that turn their dollars back in to the Appalachian Development Highway  System will receive dollars that they could use for any project in  their State that would otherwise be eligible as a Federal highway  project. That means that States can respond to the changing  transportation needs in their particular area. They use excess dollars  from an undersubscribed Federal loan program, which has historically  not contributed to infrastructure investment in rural America.   This would be a win for all States involved. Those needing additional  funding will be able to continue to advance the Appalachian Development  Highway System, and States that have needed to shift their focus--say  on growing urban transportation needs--will have the added flexibility  to be able to do that.   I appreciate my fellow Appalachian Development Highway System State  committee colleagues for working with me to include this provision, as  well as Leader McConnell's support on this section of the bill and our  counterpart legislation, the Advancing Infrastructure Development in  Appalachia Act.   The committee also included language that I wrote and worked with  those individuals on to reauthorize the Appalachian Regional  Commission--a key economic development agency--at $180 million a year.  My provision also doubles to $20 million the funding available for  something that I care deeply about, and that is broadband deployment in  Appalachia, which is a critical tool for connecting our communities and  making and keeping our region more competitive.   I thank Leader McConnell and Ranking Member Cardin and Senator Wicker  for their support of this language and the stand-alone ARC  authorization bill.   Leader McConnell also joined me in authorizing the ARC to provide up  to $5 million in grants to support the development of a central  Appalachian natural gas liquids storage hub, along with the associated  downstream manufacturing sector for it. This infrastructure project  would be huge for the economies of West Virginia, Kentucky,  Pennsylvania, and Ohio. In fact, the American Chemistry Council  estimates that this regional market and downstream manufacturing would  generate $36 billion in capital investment and more than 100,000 jobs.  It would also help keep a much larger share of the economic value and  employment opportunity in our States where the resources are, compared  to just producing and then exporting the gas and associated natural gas  liquids to other parts of the country or abroad.   Secretary Perry and the Department of Energy have also endorsed the  concept of this project, as well as the significant economic and energy  security dividends that it would pay for Appalachia and the entire  United States.   This is somewhat of a modest investment given the significant private  sector capital needed to build this out, but it is essential that the  Federal Government send clear messages to potential investors that it  supports this driver of economic growth in an area that would greatly  benefit.    This legislation gives the ARC the power to lead the way.   Investment in our country's infrastructure is vital to the many  aspects of our American life, from keeping us competitive in the global  economy and keeping our drivers safe--there are a lot of safety aspects  in this bill--to reducing irritating congestion and minimizing impacts  to the economy.   America's Transportation Infrastructure Act delivers on all these  fronts and ensures that rural America will benefit equally from these  investments. Not only will our legislation help rebuild and repair our  infrastructure system, but it will also help us create new  infrastructure opportunities for generations to come.   I appreciate my colleagues' collaboration. My colleague from Rhode  Island is on the floor. He was on the committee this morning when we  both voted in favor of this legislation. It is a bipartisan bill  working to make sure that this country sees a 5-year highway  reauthorization and all the benefits it would provide.   I think all my Senate colleagues will find a lot to like in this  legislation. I am hoping we get it on the floor in the fall. I  encourage their support when it comes time for a vote.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize my  friend Larry Robertson, a dedicated servant to the great people of West  Virginia. After 20 years, Larry will be retiring from his post as  executive director of HospiceCare, in my hometown of Charleston, WV. As  a lifelong residence of the State capital city, Larry dedicated his  career to caring for those in his area. He hasn't moved around much,  with his office only a mile or two down the road from the fill station  his father worked at when he was just a boy.   After graduating from George Washington High School, Larry stuck  around the Kanawha River Valley and enrolled in Morris Harvey College,  which is now known as the University of Charleston. With his bachelor's  degree complete and after earning a master's in accounting from the  West Virginia College of Graduate Studies in 1976, he set his sights on  ways to give back to the community that had already given him so much.  This commitment led Larry to take a job as a controller for the Blue  Cross Medical Plan in Charleston.   From this point on, Larry would spend the entirety of his  professional life committed to providing financial support and  administrative services to not-for-profit organizations in the  healthcare field. In the past 20 years, HospiceCare has flourished  under Larry's leadership, providing over 300 jobs and services to 16  counties in West Virginia. Larry and HospiceCare also provide the  community with an avenue to give back to those in need, garnering  hundreds of volunteers throughout the years. There is an old saying  that says there is nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer, but  I believe Larry's ``Hospice Heart'' is even stronger.   Larry has also been instrumental in the foundation and the success of  West Virginias first inpatient hospice center, the Hubbard Hospice  House. This project started out with only enough space and staff to  accommodate 12 residents, but has grown exponentially under the vison  of Larry and his dedicated team. By the end of this year, the Hubbard  Hospice House operation will be able to house 56 beds in several  locations across central West Virginia. I became familiar with hospice  during the last stage of my parents lives. The support and dedication  they give to their patients is a wonderful lifeline for families and  caregivers. I am incredibly indebted to Larry and his staff for their  professional services. Hundreds of families in Kanawha County and the  surrounding area feel the same and share the same appreciation for the  care hospice gave their family members. Thank you, Larry, for your  dedication to building such a quality healthcare provider for end of  life care that is so highly regarded throughout the State and region.   Larry will now have more time to spend with his grandchildren, watch  the West Virginia Mountaineers, and work on his golf game, but the  lasting effects for what he did for our State will continue on for  generations to come. I wish Larry all the best in his retirement, as he  continues to make a difference in his community with his one-of-a-kind  attitude and generous heart. It is truly an honor to call you friend  and fellow West Virginian.                            ____________________
