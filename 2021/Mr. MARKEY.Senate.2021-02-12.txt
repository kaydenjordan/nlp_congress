 We have these battles on the floor of the       Senate. I'm going to go down and battle. I'm going to be down       there on the floor fighting.         Mr. President, I send a question for the House managers  to the desk because the President's counsel did not answer the question  which was posed to them.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will send the question. Debate  is not allowed.   The question is from Senator Markey, with Senator Duckworth, to the  managers on the part of the House of Representatives.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Exactly when did the Presiden     learn of the breach at the Capitol, and what steps did he take to          address the violence? Please be as detailed as possible.    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Do the House managers wish to respond?   Ms. Manager PLASKETT. Yes. Mr. President, Senators, this attack was  on live TV, on all major networks, in realtime. The President, as  President, has access to intelligence information, including reports  from inside the Capitol.   He knew the violence that was underway. He knew the severity of the  threats. And, most importantly, he knew that Capitol Police were  overwhelmingly outnumbered and in a fight for their lives against  thousands of insurgents with weapons. We know he knew that. We know  that he did not send any individuals. We did not hear any tweets. We  did not hear him tell those individuals: Stop. This is wrong. You must  go back. We did not hear that.   So what else did the President do? We are unclear. But we believe it  was a dereliction of his duty, and that was because he was the one who  had caused them to come to the Capitol, and they were doing what he  asked them to do. So there was no need for him to stop them from what  they were engaged in.   But one of the things I would like to ask is we still have not heard  and pose to you all the questions that were raised by Mr. Raskin,  Manager Raskin, in his closing argument: Why did President Trump not  tell the protesters to stop as soon as he learned about it? Why did  President Trump do nothing to stop the attack for 2 hours after the  attack began? Why did President Trump do nothing to help protect the  Capitol and law enforcement battling the insurgents?   You saw the body cam of a Capitol Police officer at 4:29, still  fighting--4:29 after since what time?--1, 2 in the afternoon. Why did  he not condemn the violent insurrection on January 6?   Those are the questions that we have, as well, and the reason this  question keeps coming up is because the answer is nothing.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Any further questions?
