 Mr. President, I am here to make one point crystal clear  [[Page S379]]  for those Montanans who are wondering what is going on with their  government. There have been a lot of speeches given today and last  night, and there have been a lot of interviews going on. Let me try to  sum it up as succinctly as possible.   The reason the government has shut down is because of a controversial  illegal immigration policy that was not included in a bill that funds  the government. If you don't know that, you are missing the facts.   We should not hold the country hostage for a controversial  immigration policy that impacts only .0007 percent of Montanans, but a  minority of the U.S. Senators want to shut down the government, and now  their leader is filibustering the U.S. Senate.   This is a huge mistake. We need to get the government back up and  running so the least amount of pain is felt by Montanans and the  American people.
