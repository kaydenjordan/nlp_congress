 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the  Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic and ask my  colleagues to oppose this amendment.   The Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic helps the  United States and its NATO allies counter Russia and China through the  accelerated development of innovative technologies to defend the U.S.  and our NATO allies.   These innovative technologies include artificial intelligence,  quantum computing, and hypersonic missiles and defense, all valuable  tools to give the U.S. and its NATO allies leverage over Russia and  China.   Continued U.S. leadership and collaboration with NATO allies on  emerging technologies will lead to greater innovation and ensure the  U.S. will have a direct influence on the modernization of the NATO  alliance.   Earlier this year, an American was elected chair of the board of the  Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, and two  Americans currently serve on the board. The U.S. will lead this new,  necessary NATO national security effort, and Americans will continue to  work alongside its allies to build a stronger alliance and a safer  world.   In addition, the language that is in the underlying bill is actually  the language to authorize the U.S. to begin funding its part. That is  why the U.S. doesn't currently fund its part. We had to write  legislation to get the U.S., the DOD, to get its authorization to fund  its part in DIANA.   In addition to that, in the next 5 years, the U.S. commitment is  about $47 million, while NATO allies will contribute about $1.1  billion, so I would say we are going to get our money's worth, Mr.  Chair.   The U.S. must continue to support the Defence Innovation Accelerator  for the North Atlantic. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  this effort, support U.S. participation in NATO, and to oppose this  amendment.
