 Mr. President, I rise today to pay one final tribute to  Gary Petersen, a close friend and devoted public servant who recently  passed away. Gary's devotion to the Tri-Cities was unparalleled, with  his work covering everything from our national security, to  environmental cleanup, to the growing and evolving missions of the  Hanford Site and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory--PNNL--in my  home State of Washington.   This certainly isn't the first time I have spoken in honor of Gary.  He was a Washingtonian through and through, raised in Okanogan County  before serving in the military and eventually attending my alma mater,  Washington State University. He went on to work for more than five  decades in the Tri-Cities before retiring in 2017, and over the years,  I had the great pleasure of working with Gary time and time again.   In 1965, Gary landed his first job out of college at Battelle, and he  couldn't have had better timing--Battelle had just won a contract to  operate a major research and development laboratory at the Hanford  Site, which is now known as PNNL. Gary was truly in on the ground  floor, working in communications and handling other tasks including  leading tours of the Hanford Site, which eventually became his  specialty. Whether he was showing around new employees, elected  officials, or foreign dignitaries, Gary gave a tour of the sprawling  580-square-mile site that is still unsurpassed.   Afterward, Gary briefly worked in Nevada for the Department of  Energy's--DOE--predecessor--the Atomic Energy Commission--before  returning to Washington to work for Westinghouse on the new Fast Flux  Test Facility project. Gary further honed his nuclear expertise later  working for the Washington Public Power Supply System, which is now  Energy Northwest. He went on to rejoin Battelle to work at PNNL,  eventually working on key international nuclear safety programs  established following the Chernobyl disaster. Eventually, Gary was  recruited to volunteer on a part-time basis at the Tri-City Development  Council. In true Gary fashion, this quickly became a full-time  commitment and he spent the rest of his career advocating on behalf of  the Tri-Cities--in Washington, DC, Olympia, and everywhere in between  until his retirement in 2017.   One project that Gary spearheaded before his retirement resulted in  DOE returning 1,614 acres of unused Hanford land just north of Richland  to the Tri-Cities for economic development. His advocacy--whether it  was for small local businesses, historical preservation efforts, or  Washington State interests in the Columbia River Treaty--was unmatched.  And the impact of his work has only become more evident in the last few  years: The progress on Hanford cleanup, the preservation of Hanford's B  reactor, the expansion of workforce safety programs at the Hanford  Site, and the Tri-Cities' growing role in the clean energy future are  all tied to Gary's decades of effort.   Gary was always quick with a story and a smile. He loved to share the  account of how Hanford came to be, from the beginning with Colonel  Franklin Matthias selecting a location north of Richland for the  Manhattan Project's plutonium plant, to the site's growth to meet our  country's needs during the Cold War, to the Hanford cleanup mission  today. He would explain how Hanford's growth transformed Richland and  the Tri-Cities, shaping everything from the region's architecture to  the day-to-day life of its residents. He loved getting into the nitty- gritty of the Federal budgeting and the appropriations process and  thrilled at telling anyone who would listen about the six research  alligators that were at one point kept at the Hanford Site and escaped  in the middle of a storm--five of them safely returned and one proudly  displayed at a sports shop in downtown Richland for years. Through it  all, Gary was as committed and passionate as they come. It is no wonder  that  [[Page S5741]]  Washington State University's Hanford History Project asked him to  contribute to its oral history collection; I am glad he did so that  generations to come can enjoy and learn from Gary's firsthand accounts.   Washington State has benefited tremendously from Gary's vision and  his drive to improve the Tri-Cities and the Hanford Site. He was an  important partner to me and one of the first to recognize all that the  region had to offer. Gary was a force of nature, whose vision and work  will be felt for generations. Whether he was walking the halls of  Congress or leading a tour of the B reactor, he was a fountain of  knowledge and energy. Gary leaves behind a tremendous legacy, and I am  among the countless individuals who are grateful for his mentorship and  friendship. His memory will be cherished, and he will be dearly missed.                            ____________________
