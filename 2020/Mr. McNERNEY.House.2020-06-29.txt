 Mr. Speaker, as a mathematician and a Member of  Congress sent here to represent the interests of my constituents, I am  baffled by the arguments made by my Republican colleagues regarding the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act. They don't seem  to understand simple math.   The facts are that one in four Americans report their prescriptions  are too expensive and brand name drug prices have jumped 60 percent in  just a year's time. At this rate, the majority of Americans are  becoming unable to afford their medications.   Meanwhile, the CBO has estimated that this bill would reduce drug  prices by up to 55 percent for the covered drugs. This would offset the  increase of those brand name prescriptions.   We are sent here to do what is right for the American people, not for  the pharmaceutical companies who raked in $5.1 billion in 1 year  through the price increases of just seven drugs.   It is time for my Republican colleagues to do the math and, more  importantly, listen to their constituents.                            ____________________
