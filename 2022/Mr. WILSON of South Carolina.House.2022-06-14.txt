 Madam Speaker, sadly, inflation has  increased to over 8 percent, the highest rate in over 40 years. Now  family budgets are draining at the pump.   The over $5 per gallon for gas is the highest ever, caused by failing  Biden policies. The American Energy Alliance with Stephen Moore on the  Unleash Prosperity Hotline has identified over 100 initiatives enacted  by Biden to restrict American oil and gas development.   When Biden took office, gas was $2.39 a gallon. Now it has doubled.  These extremist policies intentionally discourage gas usage without  alternatives available to families. Declaring war on American energy  subsidizes war criminal Putin's mass murder in Ukraine and allows Iran  to proceed with nuclear weapons to fulfill ``Death to Israel. Death to  America.''   America needs price relief through an all-of-the-above energy policy  achieved by President Donald Trump.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who have successfully protected  America for 20 years in the global war on terrorism as it continues  moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Happy birthday, Donald Trump.                            ____________________
