 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to oppose H.R. 3.   Every single person in our country deserves lower prescription drug  prices. Congress needs to act. But the bill on the floor today is not  the answer.   With this legislation, my colleagues across the aisle have decided  that, once again, government should be in the business of healthcare,  picking winners and losers, taxing lifesaving cures, and ignoring that  private innovation is the main driver in advancing healthcare.   House Republicans have a bipartisan solution, one which will deliver  the transparency, affordability, and predictability we need: H.R. 19,  the Lower Costs, More Cures Act.   With this bill, we can make sure that every person--the parents of a  newborn baby, a young adult with a chronic illness, a coal miner coping  with black lung disease, or a senior citizen taking their daily pills-- has access to the drugs they need at the affordable, predictable prices  they deserve.   We need the innovators to be at the forefront of creating new, better  drugs to improve quality of life for all Americans in need. H.R. 19  delivers this. We can have it all. That is why I oppose H.R. 3.
