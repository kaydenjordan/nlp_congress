 Mr. President, the current voting rights proposals or so- called voting rights proposals that the Democrats are proposing are not  about increasing access to the ballot box. According to the Washington  Post, the 2020 election saw the highest voter turnout in 120 years, and  94 percent of the voters said that voting was easy. These bills are  really a power grab that would circumvent and federalize our entire  elections process, stripping States of their constitutional  authorities.   These power grabs would force taxpayers to pay for political  campaigns, expand the practice of ballot harvesting, prohibit important  voter ID laws, keep deceased people and those who have moved out of the  area on voter registration rolls, and federalize election laws, which  would violate the U.S. Constitution's clear directive that States  administer the elections, to name just a few.   Article I, section 4 of the U.S. Constitution delegates the election  processes to the States. This is a Union of 50 States. States are the  best equipped to implement and enforce election policies that protect  the integrity of all future elections.   Although many who have spoken today would have you believe that  States across this Nation are seeking to violate the rights of American  citizens and restrict their access to voting, the laws that are being  proposed and adopted by the States are doing just the opposite. They  are helping to expand voter access and improve security at the polls.   There are a lot of myths and untruths running rampant because the  Democrats seem to want the public to think there is this widespread  voter suppression in Republican-led States, which there is not.   A couple of myths and the facts:   Myth: Republican State legislatures are enacting laws that will roll  back early voting.   The fact is that the States are expanding early voting. Georgia's  bill, for example, which has been attacked, allows for and provides  for--mandates 17 days of early voting with two additional optional  Sundays of early voting. The list goes on. Arizona allows 26 days. Iowa  allows 20 days. Texas, another State that has been attacked, allows 17  days. The fact is the States are expanding early voting.   Myth: States are implementing voter ID for vote-by-mail in order to  disenfranchise voters.   The fact: As vote-by-mail is increasing in the States, the States are  implementing some of the same safeguards--the same safeguards--that are  used for in-person voting to ensure a secure election, such as voter  ID, which the legislation before us seems to want to prohibit. Recent  polls show that 80 percent of the people support being required to show  ID in order to vote, including 62 percent of Democrats.   Myth: Prohibiting ballot harvesting and requiring people to vote in  their own correct precinct constitutes discrimination outlawed by the  Voting Rights Act.   Fact: In a recent Supreme Court case, the Court ruled 6 to 3 against  this claim. Arizona law mandates that voters must vote in their  assigned precinct, and those who vote early by mail cannot have anyone  other than a household member, a family member, a caregiver, a postal  worker, or an elections official collect their ballot; in other words,  supervised ballot collection. This law effectively bans the practice of  ballot harvesting.   The Democrats seem to want to expand, even mandate, ballot harvesting  in the legislation we are being asked to support tonight.   Myth: States are improperly purging eligible voters from their voter  rolls.   Fact: States are taking reasonable measures to ensure their voter  rolls are accurate, which makes elections more efficient and fair.  States are simply implementing a time-honored practice of cleaning up  voter lists, removing voters who have died or who have moved or who  have been declared incompetent by a court or convicted of a felony, a  time-honored practice in many of the States across this Nation.   Myth: Recent changes in Georgia to prevent people from giving bottles  of water is inhumane and targets minority communities.   Fact: The law allows poll workers to set up self-serve water stations  for voters to use. The statute prevents political organizations-- political organizations--from giving people in line things like meals,  water, or gifts. Once again, this is a longtime honored practice in  States. This law of anti-electioneering or anti-vote-buying is standard  practice in many States, including many of my colleagues' blue States  like New York, New Jersey, and President Biden's home State of  Delaware.   So let's get on to the filibuster. The argument is, since the  Republicans won't accept these long, directed, so-called reforms of our  election laws, that we should eliminate the filibuster in the Senate.  That is the last thing that should be done in the Senate. President  Biden himself has argued against eliminating the filibuster, and  according to a recent report, Democrats used that filibuster over 300  times in 2020.   In 2005, then-Senator Joe Biden gave a passionate floor speech  defending the Senate filibuster, saying that this is a key procedural  tool and ending it would ``eviscerate the Senate'' and do a  ``disservice to the country'' and would ``upset the constitutional  design.''    In another floor speech, then-Senator Biden further argued the reason  Republicans in Congress were attempting to end the filibuster was  because they controlled ``every level of government.'' He went on to  point out that the reason to have the filibuster rule was so that  ``when one party controls all levers of government, one man or [one]  woman can stand on the floor of the Senate and resist the passions of  the moment.''   Again, in 2005, Senator Chuck Schumer also said that eliminating the  filibuster would be a ``doomsday for democracy'' that would turn our  country into, in his words, a ``banana republic.''   Former Senator Robert Byrd wrote about preserving the filibuster. We  heard it many times today. He said:         We must never, ever, tear down the only wall--the necessary       fence--this nation has against the excesses of the Executive       Branch and the resultant haste and tyranny of the majority.    He went on to say:         The Senate has been the last fortress of minority rights       and freedom of speech in this Republic for more than two       centuries. I pray that Senators will pause and reflect before       ignoring that history and tradition in favor of the political       priority of the moment.    As Leader McConnell quoted on the floor yesterday, ``[T]he smallest  majority we have ever seen in our politics is trying to change the  rules for how people get elected in every State.''   You may recall, Republicans were asked to do this exact thing when we  controlled every lever of government, and we refused to make that  change because of the importance of the filibuster to this institution.  Eliminating or weakening the legislative filibuster would destroy the  intentional design of the Senate to be the world's most deliberative  body. It would allow any  [[Page S330]]  small majority in the Senate to strip the voice of millions of  Americans considered in the minority.   Removing the ability to filibuster legislation would reduce the  incentive for the Senate to forge broad agreements and force further  debate and would likely increase divisiveness rather than efficiency.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this Federal takeover of our  State's constitutional right to manage their own elections, and I urge  my colleagues to reject this unfounded assault on the Senate  filibuster.
