 Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler) my distinguished friend from the Rules Committee,  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1124, providing for consideration of  three measures:   First, H.R. 350, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, under a  closed rule. The rule self-executes a manager's management from  Chairman Nadler, provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  the Judiciary, and provides one motion to recommit.   Second, H.R. 7688, the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act,  under a structured rule. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment  from Chairman Pallone, provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce, makes in order two amendments, and provides one  motion to recommit.   Third, H.R. 7790, the Infant Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act,  under a closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Appropriations, and provides one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule provides the majority leader or his designee the  ability to en bloc requested roll call votes on certain suspension  bills. This authority lasts through May 19, 2022.   Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of several critical  measures, and I would like to begin by saying a few words about H.R.  350, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act.   Just this past weekend, the entire Nation watched in horror as a  white supremacist with a history of violent threats brutally  slaughtered 10 people, almost all of whom were Black, in the city of  Buffalo, New York. My heart breaks for the community still reeling from  this senseless tragedy only 75 miles down the road from my home in  Rochester.   The FBI is investigating the shooting as a hate crime, and the gunman  wrote a racist and anti-Semitic 180-page document outlining his  motivation for the attack. The gunman intentionally targeted a  predominantly Black neighborhood and had plans to attack multiple  locations afterward, including in Rochester, as has been widely  reported in the media.   Mr. Speaker, there has been an undeniable surge in domestic terrorism  and other forms of extremism across our Nation. An analysis performed  by the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies found  that domestic terrorism in 2020 was at the highest level of any year  since 1994, which is the earliest year the organization analyzed data.   Domestic terrorism is the most significant threat to our Nation in  generations. Events like the horrific slaughter of Black community  members in Buffalo have become common in our country, and it is time  for the Federal Government to step up and to save lives.   Before us today, we have legislation that helps to provide the tools  and resources law enforcement and our communities need to coordinate  and combat these threats.   The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act prioritizes the investigation  and prosecution of domestic terrorism at the Department of Justice, the  Department of Homeland Security, and the FBI, creating a new office in  all three  [[Page H5128]]  agencies dedicated to this issue, promoting information sharing among  public safety officials to better ensure an effective and organized  joint effort, and requiring Federal agencies to provide training and  resources to assist State and local law enforcement in detecting and  investigating acts of domestic terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, these are simple, commonsense actions that will help  protect our communities. They should be noncontroversial. In fact,  nearly identical legislation passed by voice vote last Congress. But so  far this year, it appears something has changed. Despite the rising  incidence of hate crimes and the urgent need to provide law enforcement  with what they need to combat vicious acts of domestic terrorism, every  Republican on the House Judiciary Committee voted against the bill in a  markup last month. While only three Republicans have cosponsored the  bill this year, I hope more of my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle will again support this bill when it comes to the floor for a  vote.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 7688, the Consumer  Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act, which will directly address the pain  that American families are feeling at the pump.   During a time of decreased oil production related to the pandemic and  global uncertainty around the global gas market due to Russia's  invasion of Ukraine, oil and gas companies are reporting historic  profits.   In the first 3 months of 2022 alone, ExxonMobil made $5.5 billion in  profits; Chevron made $6.3 billion; and Shell made a record-breaking  $9.1 billion.   Everyday Americans continue to see high gas prices, but Big Oil has  clearly decided to keep production low so their own profits can stay  high. Crude oil prices have declined around 20 percent from their peak  in early March, but retail prices have gone down by only 4 percent  during that same time. Oil companies are raking in record profits at  the expense of hardworking American families, who are struggling to  keep up with sky-high prices at the pump. Simply put, this is un- American.   In an effort to help working families, President Biden called on Big  Oil to ramp up supply instead of simply reaping profits without making  any additional investment in supply shortages. How did these companies  respond? They announced their intentions to use their record-high  profits for stock buybacks. ExxonMobil announced it would triple its  purchase of its own stock by spending up to $30 billion on stock  buybacks, and Chevron will purchase $10 billion of stock before the end  of this year.   The Biden administration has already taken steps to lower prices,  including by releasing 80 million barrels of oil from the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, with another 1 million barrels daily for the next 6  months.   Today, the House is taking further action by granting enhanced  authority to the FTC and State attorneys general to police excessive or  exploitative price increases of gasoline and home energy fuel during  a declared energy crisis. The penalties collected from these companies  will be deposited in a consumer relief trust fund administered by the  U.S. Treasury Department.    While some of my colleagues continue to merely talk about rising gas  prices, we are actually presenting a solution to the problem today.  House Democrats are taking action on behalf of working families to put  more money in their pockets instead of supporting stock buybacks and  exploitative price gouging by the oil and gas industry.   Lastly, this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 7790, the Infant  Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act. Working families living  paycheck to paycheck are struggling, and they need safe, affordable  baby formula to keep their children healthy.   Baby formula supplies are out of stock at stores across the country,  threatening the health of infants and creating panic among their  parents and caretakers. Ongoing supply chain issues and the Abbott  formula recall have led to the shortages.   On Monday, the FDA reached a deal with Abbott to reopen the  processing plant that had been closed due to the recall, and the Biden  administration also announced the FDA would issue new guidance to ease  import restrictions with the goal of bringing the most formula into the  country as possible.   But with 75 percent of families at least partially dependent on  formula to feed their young children, it is imperative that Congress  take additional action as well.   This legislation provides emergency funding to both address the  formula shortage and help prevent it from ever happening again. The  supplemental bill provides $28 million for additional staff at the FDA  to better address infant formula safety and supply issues, IT system  improvements to expand health fraud tools, and stronger supply chain  monitoring and assessments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying legislation taking critical action to bolster American  families and protect our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I will respond to my friend and colleague from the Rules Committee.   When we talk about the need to have bipartisanship and to work  together, I would again note that the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act  passed by a voice vote in the previous Congress just 2 years ago, yet  not only will it not pass by a voice vote, it won't pass under our  efforts to suspend the rules. It required going to the Rules Committee;  it will require a vote on the floor; and I daresay, based on the  Judiciary Committee and the Rules Committee, that we will have to pass  it with little Republican support, something I regret. We would not  only welcome their support, but this was a bipartisan bill.   I don't think that says anything about where we have gone. I think it  says a great deal, though, about where my colleagues have gone and how  far they have moved away from what is commonsense, thoughtful  legislation that reins in a growing threat in America that has been  recognized by society and recognized by our military, and that is the  growth of extremism in America.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee and my very good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I do want to be clear because the distinguished  gentlewoman mentioned hardworking Oklahomans, and we certainly  appreciate their hard work.   This isn't about the hardworking men and women in Oklahoma who work  for oil and gas companies. This is about the leadership of those  companies that make decisions about where their dollars are going to be  invested.   Just to reiterate what I said earlier, ExxonMobil made $5.5 billion  in profits just in the first three months of 2022; Chevron, $6.3  billion in profits; Shell made a record-breaking $9.1 billion. On top  of it, they are going to do their own buybacks of stocks.   ExxonMobil announced it would triple purchasing its own stock by  spending up to $30 billion on stock buybacks. Chevron will spend $10  billion on buying stock before the end of this year; they have  announced that.   Madam Speaker, this isn't about the hardworking men and women who we  respect. This is about corporate executives who decide to put their  interest before the interest of the American people, particularly at a  time when we are struggling to get them to increase production and we  are facing a global crisis in oil and gas because of activities around  the world by Vladimir Putin, and his unwanted aggression against the  people of Ukraine, which has disrupted the energy market worldwide.   Madam Speaker, just to be clear, I appreciate the gentlewoman's  sentiments, but we are not talking about hardworking men and women. We  are talking about CEOs who decided to put their profits ahead of  American interests. That is what we are talking about.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider), my great friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I do want to just respond briefly to my colleague, Mr.  Reschenthaler. I don't believe domestic terrorism in any form, by any  side--right, left, center--is acceptable in America. And so without  regard to that, I would say this bill would look at all domestic  terrorism.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a May 17, 2022, New York Times  article entitled, ``The Right's Violence Problem.''                  [From The New York Times, May 17, 2022]                        The Right's Violence Problem                            (By David Leonhardt)         Over the past decade, the Anti-Defamation League has       counted about 450 U.S. murders committed by political       extremists.  [[Page H5131]]         Of these 450 killings, right-wing extremists committed       about 75 percent. Islamic extremists were responsible for       about 20 percent, and left-wing extremists were responsible       for 4 percent.        Nearly half of the murders were specifically tied to white       supremacists.        As this data shows, the American political right has a       violence problem that has no equivalent on the left. And the       10 victims in Buffalo this past weekend are now part of this       toll. ``Right-wing extremist violence is our biggest       threat,'' Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the ADL, has       written. ``The numbers don't lie.''        The pattern extends to violence less severe than murder,       like the Jan. 6 attack on Congress. It also extends to the       language from some Republican politicians--including Donald       Trump--and conservative media figures that treats violence as       a legitimate form of political expression. A much larger       number of Republican officials do not use this language but       also do not denounce it or punish politicians who do use it;       Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican, is a leading       example.        It's important to emphasize that not all extremist violence       comes from the right--and that the precise explanation for       any one attack can be murky, involving a mixture of ideology,       mental illness, gun access and more. In the immediate       aftermath of an attack, people are sometimes too quick to       claim a direct cause and effect. But it is also incorrect to       pretend that right-wing violence and left-wing violence are       equivalent problems.                             Fears in Washington         If you talk to members of Congress and their aides these       days--especially off the record--you will often hear them       mention their fears of violence being committed against them.        Some Republican members of Congress have said that they       were reluctant to vote for Trump's impeachment or conviction       partly because of the threats against other members who had       already denounced him. House Republicans who voted for       President Biden's infrastructure bill also received threats.       Democrats say their offices receive a spike in phone calls       and online messages threatening violence after they are       criticized on conservative social media or cable television       shows.        People who oversee elections report similar problems. ``One       in six election officials have experienced threats because of       their job,'' the Brennan Center, a research group, reported       this year. ``Ranging from death threats that name officials'       young children to racist and gendered harassment, these       attacks have forced election officials across the country to       take steps like hiring personal security, fleeing their       homes, and putting their children into counseling.''        There is often overlap between these violent threats and       white supremacist beliefs. White supremacy tends to treat       people of color as un-American or even less than fully human,       views that can make violence seem justifiable. The suspect in       the Buffalo massacre evidently posted an online manifesto       that discussed replacement theory, a racial conspiracy theory       that Tucker Carlson promotes on his Fox News show.        ``History has taught us that what begins with words ends in       far worse,'' Representative Liz Cheney, one of the few       Republicans who have repeatedly and consistently denounced       violence and talk of violence from the right, wrote on       Twitter yesterday.        A few other Republicans, like Senator Mitt Romney, have       taken a similar stance. But many other prominent Republicans       have taken a more neutral stance or even embraced talk of       violence. Some have spoken openly about violence as a       legitimate political tool--and not just Trump, who has done       so frequently.        At the rally that preceded the Jan. 6 attack,       Representative Mo Brooks suggested the crowd should ``start       taking down names and kicking ass.''        Rick Perry, a former Texas governor, once called the       Federal Reserve ``treasonous'' and talked about treating its       chairman ``pretty ugly.'' During Greg Gianforte's campaign       for Montana's House seat, he went so far as to assault a       reporter who asked him a question he didn't like; Gianforte       won and has since become Montana's governor.        These Republicans have received no meaningful sanction from       their party.        This Republican comfort with violence is new. Republican       leaders from past decades, like Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole,       Howard Baker and the Bushes, did not evoke violence.        ``In a stable democracy,'' Steven Levitsky, a Harvard       political scientist, told me, ``politicians unambiguously       reject violence and unambiguously expel from their ranks       antidemocratic forces.'' https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/ briefing/right-wing-mass-shootings.htm.     Madam Speaker, sadly, the horrifying attack in Buffalo,  New York, this weekend is just the tip of the iceberg.   According to a 2021 report by the Anti-Defamation League, there have  been 450 murders committed by political extremists over the last 10  years, 75 percent attributed to rightwing groups, 55 percent of those  were tied to white supremacists, four percent in the report were tied  to leftwing supremacists--an amazing amount, 75 percent to 4 percent.   It is appalling to argue that some things are fine and there is no  need to address root causes of violence. I am calling on all my  colleagues to do something about white nationalism, calling on all my  colleagues to do something about domestic terrorism before another  domestic terror attack occurs fueled by hatred, as we witnessed in  Buffalo, New York.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I must say, and I have the highest regard for my colleague, anyone  who would equate the Black Lives Matter movement and the protests  organized over the murder of George Floyd with white supremacists like  the one who killed 10 people in Buffalo and targeted  [[Page H5132]]  Black Americans, equating that is irresponsible and reprehensible at  best.   Talk about false equivalence. I am nearly speechless that we would  even begin down that road. Maybe that says a lot about why the national  Republican effort has changed so dramatically in just 2 years, when  this Congress accepted by voice vote the Domestic Terrorism Act that we  have before us.   I also include in the Record an October 15, 2021, Washington Post  fact check article titled ``The false GOP claim that the Justice  Department is spying on parents at school board meetings.''                 [From the Washington Post, Oct. 15, 2021]    The False GOP Claim That the Justice Dept. Is Spying on Parents at                           School Board Meetings                            (By Salvador Rizzo)         ``Attorney General Garland is weaponizing the DOJ by using       the FBI to pursue concerned parents and silence them through       intimidation. Florida will defend the free speech rights of       its citizens and will not allow federal agents to squelch       dissent.''        --Florida Gov. Ron Desantis (R), in a tweet, Oct. 5        ``Now the FBI is trying to silence parents. That's wrong.''        --Glenn Youngkin, Republican nominee for Virginia governor,       in a campaign ad, Oct. 13        Because of a ``disturbing spike'' in threats directed at       public school officials, Attorney General Merrick Garland       issued a memorandum this month calling on the FBI and federal       prosecutors to meet with local law enforcement agencies and       set up ``dedicated lines of communication.''        Republicans are sounding the alarm over Garland's one-page       memo, claiming in interviews, congressional hearings,       campaign ads and social media that the Justice Department is       cracking down on parents simply for dissenting at their local       school board meetings.        These meetings, where the nation's almost 14,000 public       school districts debate and set their policies, can become       heated over questions such as how to teach race in the       classroom and whether coronavirus vaccinations and tests or       face masks should be required, among other issues. Some       school board members have grown concerned for their safety as       their forums have turned more vitriolic, and one recently       reported a death threat and resigned.        The bottom line is Republicans are reading much more into       Garland's memo than it says. The memo focuses strictly on       ``violence, threats of violence, and other forms of       intimidation and harassment''--all of which are crimes--not       on parents raising questions or complaints.                                  The Facts         The Oct. 4 memo, addressed to FBI Director Christopher A.       Wray and federal prosecutors, reads in part:        In recent months, there has been a disturbing spike in       harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against       school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff who       participate in the vital work of running our nation's public       schools. While spirited debate about policy matters is       protected under our Constitution, that protection does not       extend to threats of violence or efforts to intimidate       individuals based on their views.        Threats against public servants are not only illegal, they       run counter to our nation's core values . . . . The       Department takes these incidents seriously and is committed       to using its authority and resources to discourage these       threats, identify them when they occur, and prosecute them       when appropriate . . . .        Coordination and partnership with local low enforcement is       critical to implementing these measures for the benefit of       our notion's nearly 14,000 public school districts. To this       end, I am directing the Federal Bureau of Investigation,       working with each United States Attorney, to convene meetings       with federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial leaders       in each federal judicial district within 30 days of the       issuance of this memorandum. These meetings will facilitate       the discussion of strategies for addressing threats against       school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff,       and will open dedicated lines of communication for threat       reporting, assessment, and response . . . .        Garland's memo added, ``In the coming days, the Department       will announce a series of measures designed to address the       rise in criminal conduct directed toward school personnel.''        In an accompanying news release, the Justice Department       said, ``Those efforts are expected to include the creation of       a task force, consisting of representatives from the       department's Criminal Division, National Security Division,       Civil Rights Division, the Executive Office for U.S.       Attorneys, the FBI, the Community Relations Service and the       Office of Justice Programs, to determine how federal       enforcement tools can be used to prosecute these crimes, and       ways to assist state, Tribal, territorial and local law       enforcement where threats of violence may not constitute       federal crimes.''        And: ``The Justice Department will also create specialized       training and guidance for local school boards and school       administrators. This training will help school board members       and other potential victims understand the type of behavior       that constitutes threats, how to report threatening conduct       to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, and how to       capture and preserve evidence of threatening conduct to aid       in the investigation and prosecution of these crimes.''        Put it all together, and Garland is calling for 1) strategy       meetings between federal and local law enforcement, 2) a task       force, 3) dedicated lines of communication for addressing       threats, and 4) training and guidance for school officials.       The news release says the Justice Department will study ``how       federal enforcement tools can be used to prosecute these       crimes, and ways to assist state, Tribal, territorial and       local law enforcement where threats of violence may not       constitute federal crimes.'' (Most violent crimes are       investigated and prosecuted by state and local law       enforcement agencies, not federal authorities.)        Some of the Republican officials we asked for comment       pointed to a letter from the National School Boards       Association (NSBA) that asked President Biden for federal       resources to help monitor emerging threats. The letter was       dated Sept. 29, days before the attorney general's memo was       released, and made various requests of federal agencies       including the Justice Department.        ``While local and state law enforcement agencies are       working with public school officials in several communities       to prevent further disruptions to educational services and       school district operations, law enforcement officials in some       jurisdictions need assistance--including help with monitoring       the threat levels,'' NSBA officials wrote to Biden.        ``School board meetings have been disrupted in California,       Florida, Georgia, and other states because of local       directives for mask coverings to protect students and       educators from COVID-19,'' the group's letter says. ``An       individual was arrested in Illinois for aggravated battery       and disorderly conduct during a school board meeting. During       two separate school board meetings in Michigan, an individual       yelled a Nazi salute in protest to masking requirements, and       another individual prompted the board to call a recess       because of opposition to critical race theory.''        As noted in the letter, a school board member in Ohio       received hate mail that said: ``We are coming after you and       all the members on the . . . BoE [Board of Education] . . . .       You are forcing them to wear mask--for no reason in this       world other than control. And for that you will pay dearly.''       That correspondence is being investigated by police.        Days after the NSBA letter was sent, a school board       chairman in North Carolina resigned and disclosed that his       life had been threatened, WCCB Charlotte reported.        The NSBA letter said some ``acts of malice, violence, and       threats against public school officials . . . could be the       equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.''        ``Most disturbingly, on page 4, the NSBA letter references       Scott Smith--the Loudoun County, Virginia, parent who was       arrested for protesting at a school board meeting in June--      implying that his behavior was `extremist' and warranting       action from federal law enforcement,'' said Christina Pushaw,       a spokeswoman for DeSantis. ``Smith's supposed crime? He       attempted to protest a Loudoun school's coverup of his 14-      year-old daughter's sexual assault by a transgender classmate       in her school bathroom.''        According to the Loudoun County Sheriff's Department, in       July, more than a month after an alleged assault at Stone       Bridge High School on May 28, ``a 14-year-old male was       arrested in the case with two counts of forcible sodomy.''       The same teen reportedly was charged with sexually assaulting       another alleged female victim at a different high school last       week.        Smith, the father of the first alleged victim, was found       guilty of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest after an       altercation at his local school board meeting in June, which       Smith says he attended to protest how his daughter's case was       handled. ``Deputies dragged him to the ground, then outside,       where he continued struggling and arguing with them,       threatening to kick their teeth out,'' Loudoun Now reported.        ``In citing Mr. Smith's case as an example of behavior that       justifies a federal crackdown, the NSBA letter asked the       Biden administration to deploy federal law enforcement to       silence and intimidate parents who have grave concerns that       deserve to be heard,'' Pushaw said. ``The Loudoun County       School Board is not the victim in this case.''        The NSBA, a nonprofit, has no relationship to the Justice       Department. Garland's memo makes no mention of the group, its       letter to Biden or the examples it included.        Asked about DeSantis's vow that ``Florida will defend the       free speech rights of its citizens and will not allow federal       agents to squelch dissent,'' Pushaw said: ``At this time, it       is too soon to speculate about legal actions, because the DOJ       has not yet taken any legal action to infringe upon       Floridians' rights following this memo. As you know, the DOJ       memo directs the FBI to work with U.S. attorneys and `convene       meeting' in each federal judicial district . . . . To be       clear, Governor DeSantis is committed to protecting       Floridians' rights and will take legal action if future       developments warrant that.''        A spokesman for Jordan, Russell Dye, said in an email that       the only way the Justice Department could use ``its authority       and resources to discourage these threats, identify  [[Page H5133]]       them when they occur, and prosecute them when appropriate,''       as the memo says, was by monitoring parents at school board       meetings, as the congressman said.        ``The only reasonable explanation is to have the FBI/DOJ       watch what parents say at meetings and intimidate them into       silence,'' Dye said. ``Pretty easy to understand.'' (The FBI       simply could get tips from local officials, as Garland's memo       envisions.)        Mark Bednar, a spokesman for McCarthy, said existing laws       already establish criminal penalties for violence or threats       as outlined in the memo. Bednar said the Justice Department's       move was heavy-handed and could have a chilling effect on       parents who might otherwise speak up about their children's       education.        ``Localized threats of violence are appropriately handled       by local law enforcement,'' Bednar said. ``As such, the real       question is why the Biden administration used the power of       the federal government to publicly threaten `a series of       measures' aimed at addressing local school board meetings . .       . . The unnecessary, ominous rhetoric from the DOJ's memo       could have a chilling effect on parents' First Amendment       engagement with their local schools.''        Garland spokesman Anthony Coley referred us to this line in       the Justice Department memo: ``While spirited debate about       policy matters is protected under our Constitution, that       protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts       to intimidate individuals based on their views.''        Coley also pointed to recent Senate testimony by Deputy       Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco, the second-highest-ranking       official at the department, and Assistant Attorney General       Kristen M. Clarke, the head of the Civil Rights Division.        ``Frankly, I don't think we've ever seen anything like it       in American history . . . . Are you aware of any time in       American history when an attorney general has directed the       FBI to begin to intervene in school board meetings--local       school board meetings?'' Hawley asked Monaco at a Senate       Judiciary Committee hearing Oct. 5.        ``The memorandum is quite clear. It's one page,'' Monaco       said. ``And it asks the U.S. attorney community and the FBI       special agents-in-charge to convene state and local law       enforcement partners to ensure that there's an open line of       communication to address threats, to address violence--and       that's the appropriate role of the Department of Justice, to       make sure that we are addressing criminal conduct and       violence.'' (A spokesman for Hawley did not respond to our       questions on the record.)        When the same Senate committee met the next day for a       different hearing, Clarke said in response to questions from       Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) that parents ``have the right to       express their view, to challenge the school board, to ask for       reforms.''        ``The attorney general's memo deals with threats against       public servants and says the threats against public servants       are not only illegal, they run counter to our nation's core       values,'' Clarke said.        Youngkin, the Republican running for Virginia governor,       received a ``Pants on Fire'' rating from PolitiFact this week       for claiming his Democratic opponent, Terry McAuliffe,       ``calls in his friend Joe Biden to actually put the DOJ on       Virginia parents.'' No evidence indicates that Biden or       McAuliffe were involved in Garland's decision-making, and       both the White House and McAuliffe have denied the       allegation.        Nevertheless, Youngkin repeated the claim at an Oct. 13       rally in Culpeper, Va., after he had been fact-checked: ``He       calls his friend Joe Biden. Joe Biden calls the attorney       general. And the attorney general calls the FBI in to silence       parents.'' An abbreviated version of all this has made it       into a new Youngkin campaign ad.        Asked about the claim, Youngkin spokesman Matt Wolking said       in an email that McAuliffe had refused to take a position on       Garland's memo and therefore ``admitted he won't stand up for       Virginia parents being targeted and intimidated by his       party's DOJ.''                              The Pinocchio Test         These Republicans are turning a one-page memo on public       safety into a dystopian plot in which Big Brother erases       well-meaning parents for thinking freely.        The reality is school officials are reporting more concerns       for their safety--some attendees at their meetings have been       arrested for physical violence--and the Justice Department is       calling for strategy sessions between federal and local law       enforcement, a task force and dedicated lines of       communication to address the threats, and training for school       board members and others who might be targeted.        Dissenting parents would not be ``silenced'' by the feds       under the attorney general's memo, as DeSantis, and Youngkin       have said. Garland wrote, ``While spirited debate about       policy matters is protected under our Constitution, that       protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts       to intimidate individuals based on their views.''        These claims earn Four Pinocchios.     Madam Speaker, we have heard this argument time and time  again. It is blatantly incorrect. Attorney General Garland's October 4  one-page memo they keep referencing says: ``In the coming days, the  Department will announce a series of measures designed to address the  rise in criminal conduct directed toward school personnel.'' Let me  repeat it, ``criminal conduct directed toward school personnel.''  Criminal, not parents voicing opinions at a school board meeting.   We are talking about violent, credible threats being made to some of  our country's most important public servants and their families.   The reality is, school officials are reporting more concerns for  their safety, as some attendees at their meetings have been arrested  for physical violence. The Justice Department is calling for strategy  sessions between Federal and local law enforcement, a task force and  dedicated lines of communication to address the threats, and training  for school board members and others who might be targeted. No  intervention, no targeting free speech.   My wife retired after 30 years as a schoolteacher. I can't imagine  threats being directed toward schoolteachers and school personnel for  simply doing their jobs and carrying out the best interests of children  in this country.   They are being targeted in violent ways. It is as simple as that.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to  me.   I would say this: This is beyond absurd. Parents can speak out at  school board meetings. Free speech in the United States is not only  protected, we would be the first to protect it, on this side of the  aisle.   What is not acceptable at school board meetings or any other place  are direct threats made by people directed at school personnel, school  officials, teachers, or anyone else in our citizenry, our democracy,  and our community.    Madam Speaker, I think the bill which the gentleman  references was just introduced. We haven't had a markup or discussion,  but I do note he should read his own bill. It says ``up to $5,000,''  which can be anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000, so I think he  misunderstood the bill that he has introduced.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I suggest to the gentlewoman that she  support this bill, which provides training and resources to assist  State, local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies in understanding,  detecting, deterring, and investigating acts of domestic terrorism, as  we saw demonstrated just this past weekend in our State, a State that  she and I both live in, in Buffalo, New York, where members of the  Buffalo Police Department faced great danger.   These are the kind of resources we want to give, the kind of  resources embodied in this bill, the kind of resources that the bill  envisioned 2 years ago when Members of this House by voice vote  approved this bill.   We want and welcome their support for this bill. Let's get at it, and  let's make sure that we are really helping law enforcement at the local  level, at the State level, and at the Federal level deal with the  emerging threats of domestic violence and domestic terrorism.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Madam Speaker, I don't want to belabor what I have said  repeatedly. What we saw last week and what we continue to see around  the country as it relates to domestic terrorism deserves and demands  our attention, and the seriousness with which the American people have  trusted us, the responsibility of finding solutions to these problems.   I appreciate my colleagues may not support that. They may not want to  stand with us as we try to fight domestic terrorism and the rise of  white supremacy. They may not want to address members of the Black  community in Buffalo being targeted, and members of the Black community  in Rochester being targeted, and people around the country being  targeted.   But to continue to avoid the question and create misdirection, I  think people  [[Page H5135]]  tuning in would have a hard time understanding what it is we are doing.  Let's be clear. We are trying to address, in the most serious way we  possibly can, the rise of domestic terrorism. We are asking for support  for our Federal agencies to get them better coordinated. We are asking  for more resources for State and local law enforcement agencies to  confront these challenges.   If you don't want to stand with us; that is okay. If you want to go  back and tell people back home why you don't think domestic terrorism-- which rises--demands the attention of the Congress; that is okay. But  continuing to come and try to create misdirection, and to continue to  try to confuse people about what is going on is a disservice to the  millions of Americans who give us the awesome responsibility of  watching out for their communities and their families.   Let's just be clear about what we are doing today and what the  choices are and what the vote is and what the bill is before the House.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I find it incredibly insulting that  anyone would suggest that I would smirk about the rape of a 10-year-old  girl. I find it disgusting. I find the gentleman should offer an  apology.   This is a serious matter. That is why we are here. We have solemn  obligations. We should take them seriously. No ranting is necessary. No  accusations. And certainly not insults being thrown about on the floor  of the House of Representatives. I am incredibly dismayed that the  gentleman would say anything even remotely like that.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues for their words in  support of the rule before us today. As I mentioned earlier, we have  before us relatively simple measures that take action to both support  working families and protect our communities from domestic terrorism  and violent extremism.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle can attempt to misdirect  and confuse and make accusations and hurl insults all they want, but  the reality is we are presenting concrete proposals to address issues  facing our Nation that should be noncontroversial.   The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act will allow law enforcement to  better deter acts of domestic terrorism.   The Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act will ensure that Big  Oil cannot record historic profits at the expense of everyday  Americans.   The Infant Formula Supplemental Appropriations Act will help provide  much needed relief for parents struggling to find formula for their  children.   I look forward to supporting all three bills on the floor. I  appreciate my colleagues.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.                     Amendment to House Resolution 1124         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 7809) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe       Streets Act of 1968 to provide for law enforcement officer       bonuses. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 7809.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
