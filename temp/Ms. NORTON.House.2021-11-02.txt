 Mr. Speaker, Congress is close to delivering the Build  Back Better Act this week containing our most comprehensive social  provisions ever.   Build Back Better will afford a plethora of gains our country has  long sought--from our first significant action on climate change to  urgently addressing the 100,000 teacher shortage as our children are  returning to school.   Congress is in the end zone on this bill now, although many of us are  still trying to get prescription drug prices done. And Congress is  paying for Build Back Better without adding to the deficit--unlike the  last administration that gave tax breaks to those least in need.   Mr. Speaker, we will make history with passage of Build Back Better.                            ____________________
