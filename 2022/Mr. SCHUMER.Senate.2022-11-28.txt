 Madam President, first, let me welcome you and all of my  colleagues back to the Senate. I hope everyone had a wonderful  Thanksgiving surrounded by loved ones and a lot of good food.   For the Schumer household, the Thanksgiving holiday this year was a  bittersweet occasion. It was 1 year ago this past week that we said  goodbye to my father, Abe Schumer, after a very long and rich life. Not  a day goes by that I don't miss him, and to celebrate my first  Thanksgiving without him at the table is a reminder to never take the  blessings of life for granted. But life goes on, the circles of life go  on, and we also celebrated my 4-year-old grandson's birthday on the day  before  [[Page S6810]]  Thanksgiving as well. So the generations continue, but my father's  memory is with us.                                Anti-Semitism    Madam President, now on anti-Semitism, before I begin the substance  of my remarks on the floor, I want to say a few things about the  disgusting news that came out of Mar-a-Lago over the Thanksgiving  break.   Last week, it was reported that Donald Trump--the former President of  the United States and Republican standard bearer--had dinner at Mar-a- Lago with a notorious bigot who fancies himself a leading thinker on  the extreme edges of the hard right, embracing everything from White  nationalism, to anti-Semitism, to outright Holocaust denial.   For a former President to sit down and have dinner with a high- profile anti-Semite is disgusting and dangerous. To give an anti-Semite  even the smallest platform, much less an audience over dinner, is pure  evil. Even assuming the former President didn't realize Mr. Fuentes was  coming to Mar-a-Lago, for him to refuse to condemn Fuentes and his  bigoted words after the dinner is appalling, and it is dangerous.   Now, I am glad that some of the former President's friends and  allies, particularly those in the Jewish community, are pushing him to  do the right thing by condemning this vicious anti-Semite since the  former President does not seem to have the honor, the decency, the  humanity to do it on his own.   I vociferously condemn the former President's decision to meet with  this anti-Semite and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  do the same.                                  H.R. 8404    Madam President, on respect for marriage, as the Senate gavels back  into session for the final session of the 117th Congress, there is a  lot we must do before the end of the calendar year. Many of these  things will require Republican cooperation to get done.   First, the Senate begins this week by picking up where we left off on  the Respect for Marriage Act. As a reminder, this Chamber voted 62 to  37 before Thanksgiving to move forward on this bill, with 12  Republicans in favor. The Senate is scheduled to hold the next  procedural vote later this afternoon, and in the meantime, both sides  are continuing working together on an agreement to move this bill  quickly through the Chamber. I hope we can get it done with all due  speed because millions of Americans deserve equal justice under the law  and peace of mind, knowing their right to marry the person they love is  protected.   Taking a step back, it is notable that the Senate is having this  debate to begin with. A decade ago, it would have strained all our  imaginations to envision both sides talking about protecting the rights  of same-sex married couples. America does move forward, although  sometimes in difficult ways. Sometimes it is two steps forward, one  step back, but today is a big step forward.   We all know that, for all the progress we have made on same-sex  marriage, the rights of all married couples will never truly be safe  without the proper protections under Federal law, and that is why the  Respect for Marriage Act is necessary.    As I have said many times, this legislation is deeply personal to  many of us in this Chamber, myself included. Passing this bill is our  chance to send a message to Americans everywhere: No matter who you are  or whom you love, you, too, deserve dignity and equal treatment under  the law. That is about as American an ideal as it comes, and so I hope  the Senate can finish the work we have started and pass the Respect for  Marriage Act as soon as possible.                              Government Funding    Madam President, now on government funding, once the Senate passes  Respect for Marriage, there is a lot on the to-do list that we must  cross off before the end of the calendar year. Chief among them, of  course, is working together to fund the government by December 16.  Failure to act by then will result in a pointless and painful  government shutdown right as the holiday season kicks into high gear.   The best option for avoiding a shutdown, of course, is for  Republicans to work with us on an omnibus, ensuring the Federal  Government is fully prepared to serve the public in the next fiscal  year. A continuing resolution, on the other hand, is far less desirable  for many reasons. A CR would cause grave harm to our troops in uniform  at a time when national defense is critical. With Russian aggression in  Europe and China's aggression in the Indo-Pacific, the last thing we  can afford right now is to turn government funding into another  political tit-for-tat. Government funding should rise above politics  when the well-being of our troops and our national defense are on the  line.   Just this morning, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wrote to  congressional leaders explaining why a CR is the wrong solution for  national defense. It will not only cost our military billions every  month; it will also freeze new investments in critical military  infrastructure. It will mean many staffing and personnel decisions will  be put on hold.   When we see some of the advances some of our competitors--China and  Russia--have made in military equipment, we can't afford to sit still.  That is what a CR would do. We would just sit still as others gain on  us. As China continues to dial up its saber-rattling over Taiwan, a CR  will doom the Department of Defense's hopes of beginning new strategic  initiatives in the Indo-Pacific region. To quote Secretary Austin, ``We  can't outcompete China with our hands tied behind our back three, four,  five or six months of every fiscal year.'' He is absolutely right. I  hope my Republican colleagues are listening.   The best gift Congress can give our troops in uniform is certainty-- certainty of resources, certainty of purpose, and certainty that  Congress will act to give our military servicemembers the tools they  need to keep us safe. The only way that will happen is by Congress  working together to pass an omnibus bill in the coming weeks.                      National Defense Authorization Act    Madam President, now on the NDAA, as the U.S. Senate works on passing  government funding, we must also work on a bipartisan basis to pass our  national defense bill too. For more than six decades, Congress has  faithfully passed the NDAA on a bipartisan, bicameral basis, and I  expect this year will be no different. But today I want to highlight  one of the many reasons that passing the NDAA is especially important:  We need to stay tough on the Chinese Government and its actions.   Last month, I introduced an amendment to the NDAA with Senator Cornyn  that will prohibit the U.S. Government from doing business with  companies that rely on certain Chinese chipmakers that the Pentagon has  labeled Chinese Government military contractors. National security  leaders have weighed in in support of this amendment because they know  it keeps our country safe.   To this day, many Chinese companies have well-known ties to the  Chinese Communist Party and continue to sell microchips to U.S.  businesses that have contracts with the Federal Government. That poses  serious risks to Americans' privacy and national security.   The main idea here is simple: If American business wants the Federal  Government to buy their products or services, they shouldn't be using  the kinds of Chinese-made chips that, because of Chinese Government  involvement, put our national security at risk. We need our government  and our economy to rely on chips made right here in America--something  my amendment, along with Senator Cornyn, would encourage.   Many on both sides rightfully like to talk about staying tough on the  Chinese Government. Our amendment would do just that. I urge my  colleagues to support my amendment and urge all of us to work quickly  to pass the NDAA when the time comes next month.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 1148.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 1129.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, November 28, be  waived.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to consider the following amendments to the substitute: Lee, No.  6482; Lankford, No. 6496; and Rubio, No. 6493; that at 3:45 p.m. on  Tuesday, November 29, all postcloture time be considered expired, that  if any of these amendments are offered, the Senate vote in relation to  the amendments in the order listed, with 60 affirmative votes required  for the adoption of the Lee amendment; that there be 2 minutes for  debate equally divided prior to each vote; that any remaining  amendments except Senate amendment No. 6487 be withdrawn; that the  substitute amendment, as amended, if amended, be agreed to; that the  cloture motion with respect to H.R. 8404 be withdrawn; that the bill be  considered read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the  bill, as amended, with 60 affirmative votes required for passage, all  without further intervening action or debate; finally, that the  remaining cloture motions filed on November 17 ripen on disposition of  H.R. 8404.
