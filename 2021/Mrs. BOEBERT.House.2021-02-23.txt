 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding and for setting up this Special Order to honor Congressman- elect Luke Letlow.    Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Congressman- elect Luke Letlow, whose tireless work for his community, passion for  public service, and love for his constituents will long be an  inspiration to many Americans.   He spoke glowingly of the mighty Mississippi and his district's rich  Louisiana soil, both of which flowed freely through his veins as he  passionately advocated for the people who elected him to be their  voice.   His life of service working for Governor Bobby Jindal, serving as  chief of staff to Congressman Ralph Abraham, and then successfully  running for Congress himself, exemplified his commitment to win the  day.   Congressman-elect Letlow shared my great love for our Western States,  and he was a fierce advocate for the issues facing everyday Americans.  His calling to public service was only surpassed by his calling to be a  loving husband, father, brother, and son. He cared deeply for his  beloved wife, Julia; son, Jeremiah; and daughter, Jacqueline.   After he won his race, Congressman-elect Letlow's wife, Julia, spoke  of God's sovereignty over the life of her husband, quoting the words  from scripture: ``Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you; before  you were born, I set you apart.''   God set Luke apart with a calling, with an anointing, and that same  calling and anointing is now in that Godly heritage that he has left  behind. God's wraparound presence is surrounding the Letlow family.   God's plan for Luke's life was one of service, and his legacy will  live on through his family. His wife, Julia, is a woman of deep faith.  A calling to public service is on her life. She was his rock for all of  his years in public life. I am honored to call her my friend now.   May his family find comfort in the words of the scripture: ``The Lord  is close to the brokenhearted. . . .'' and in knowing that Congressman- elect Letlow fought the good fight, finished his race, and kept the  faith.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  time.   The Equality Act.   Madam Speaker, equality for who?   Where is the equality in this legislation for the young girls across  America who have to look behind their backs as they change in their  school locker rooms just to make sure there isn't a confused man trying  to catch a peek?   Where is the equality for women who have been sexually assaulted?    Under this legislation, their crisis counselor may be ``Alexis'' who  was actually born ``Alex.'' And they will have to talk to him about  their assault.   Where is the equality for parents who want and deserve the right to  raise their children, free from government overreach?   Under this proposal, Congress seeks to replace mom and dad with  bureaucrats. This isn't hyperbole. In Ohio, a mom and dad had their  child removed from their custody because they didn't allow their  daughter to undergo gender transition. Removed from their custody.   And so here we are. The left will lay down the rights and security of  millions of Americans, particularly young women, at the altar of gender  ideology.   Following the lead of liberal indoctrination camps, also called  colleges and universities, my colleagues on the left are committed to  advancing this radical ideology, the rights and sovereignty of  individual States be darned. So much for Federalism.   The power-hungry left will not slow down until every school, every  church, every workplace, every State, and every community adheres to  the left's definition of gender.   You disagree?   They will find you. They will imprison you. Or as we have seen, they  will even take your children. And let's make sure the American people  know this is only the beginning.   The Equality Act requires doctors to perform abortions, and they are  going to use your tax dollars to pay for them.   Once the left codifies their ideology, they will come for your  speech. It is already happening in Canada, where you can be fined and  imprisoned for misgendering someone.  [[Page H572]]                                     time  2030    Madam Speaker, they won't stop there. Nothing will ever satisfy the  left until there is complete and total compliance.   Madam Speaker, Scripture says, when speaking of those who have turned  their back on God, who have traded the truth for a lie: Professing to  be wise, they became fools.   I can think of no better description of the so-called Equality Act,  or inequality act, than this. The utter foolishness is astounding. Up  is down. Wrong is right. Left is right. Boys are girls and vice versa.   Madam Speaker, for the sake of our sons and daughters, for the sake  of parental rights, privacy, decency, and so much more, I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on this horrendous legislation.
