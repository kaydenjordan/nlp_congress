 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 132, as the gentleman from Florida just mentioned,  would allow a title transfer of two Federal buildings to the Arbuckle  Master Conservancy District in south-central Oklahoma. These are  buildings that were part of the Arbuckle Project, which is a water  project authorized by Congress back in 1962 to provide flood control,  recreational opportunities, and municipal water supply.   Nearly all the facilities within this project were already  transferred to the Arbuckle Master Conservancy District in 2012, after  the district finish repaying what it owed to the Federal Government for  construction. However, due to some overly narrow language in the  legislation authorizing this project, two buildings have yet to be  transferred.   Transferring them will save taxpayers money that would otherwise be  [[Page H1943]]  needed to operate and maintain these buildings. It will also relieve  the Federal Government of any potential future liability associated  with these buildings. It is a straightforward bill that should be  quickly passed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).                            Parliamentary Inquiry
