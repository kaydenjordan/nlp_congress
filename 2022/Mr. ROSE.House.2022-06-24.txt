 Madam Speaker, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has  confirmed what we knew all along: Inflation isn't because of Putin's  disgraceful invasion of Ukraine. It is because of President Biden's and  congressional Democrats' reckless spending.   Earlier this week, during a Senate Banking Committee hearing, my  friend and fellow Tennessean, Senator Bill Hagerty, pointed out that  inflation had already risen to 7 percent well before the war in  Ukraine.   He asked Chair Powell if the war in Ukraine is the primary driver of  inflation. Chair Powell responded, ``No. Inflation was high before,  certainly before the war in Ukraine broke out.''   This isn't a Putin price hike, it is Bidenflation, and the Biden  administration and congressional Democrats and their allies in the  mainstream media need to stop with the misdirection and misleading  excuses. Thankfully, Tennesseans are smart and can recognize the  difference.   Taking responsibility for mistakes followed by straight talk are  necessary prerequisites for getting us out of this  [[Page H5883]]  mess and are our minimum expectations for the President of the United  States. President Biden must do better.                            ____________________
