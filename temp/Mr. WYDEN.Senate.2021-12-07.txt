 Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on the nomination  of Chief Chris Magnus to lead the U.S. Customs and Border Protection  Office, and I was very pleased that the Senate Finance Committee could  advance this important nomination.   I want to give the Senate a brief assessment of why I think Chief  Magnus is going to handle his job very well.   He brings a unique combination of smarts, common sense, and fairness,  and that is really what this job is all about. For example, having  talked to the chief at some length, he understands that strongly  enforcing our immigration laws and treating immigrants and asylum  seekers humanely are not mutually exclusive. You can do both. They are  not incompatible. It is a perspective, in my view, on immigration that  is going to help our communities, help public safety, and help our  economy all at the same time.   Now, there is no doubt in my mind that Chief Magnus has the right  qualifications for this position. He is highly experienced. He started  out in Lansing, MI, and has headed up law enforcement agencies across  the country--East, West, North, and South.   Currently, he serves as the chief of police in Tucson, AZ. That means  we will have an individual leading Customs and Border Protection who  starts on day 1--day 1--with firsthand knowledge about the challenges  law enforcement on the southern border.   Even beyond that specific element of Customs and Border Protection's  work, his range of experience in law enforcement all over the country  makes him an ideal pick to lead an Agency with tens of thousands of  employees, staffing more than 300 points of entry to our country.   So I think that is the heart of why he is going to be such a positive  force with respect to border security, but I also want to note that on  the Finance Committee, we are acutely aware that Customs and Border  Protection is not just in the business of immigration; it is also on  the frontlines of enforcing American trade laws. And too often in the  past, that part of the mission has just gotten short shrift.   Today, Customs and Border Protection is the heart of the effort to  fight against immoral and unfair trade practices, including the use of  forced labor in China and elsewhere. Customs and Border Protection not  only investigates forced labor and demands remediation where  appropriate, it also enforces the ban on forced labor products entering  our country.   Staying a step ahead of trade cheats, whether they are involved in  forced labor or not, is key to protecting American jobs, our  businesses, and innovation. Workers and businesses depend on healthy,  functioning supply chains. We have certainly seen, since the beginning  of the pandemic, that when the supply chains break down, you have  enormous headaches throughout the economy, from the biggest businesses  right down to individual families who are shopping this holiday season  for typical holiday goods.   During his nomination hearing, Chief Magnus assured the Finance  Committee that Customs and Border Protection's trade mission is going  to get the focus and the resources it needs if he is confirmed. He has  committed to ensuring that there is adequate staffing at our ports, and  he is interested in improving the efficiency of our customs operations  in a way that maintains key protections for consumer safety.   He is a first-rate nominee. It is clear he has got the right  priorities when it comes to Customs and Border Protection challenges  that many of our Senators care about most--securing the border and  helping to get supply chains back to normal.   I believe that he is going to work with all of the Members of this  body on  [[Page S8950]]  immigration and trade-related issues going forward in a way that brings  Democrats and Republicans together. I am very happy to support him  today.   And as our committee has spent the most time with the chief, I would  like to say, as chairman of the committee, that I think he will reflect  great credit on our country in a vital position, a position that comes  up every day in activities across the land. He is the right person for  this important job at the right time.   I urge all Senators to vote for Chief Magnus later today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
