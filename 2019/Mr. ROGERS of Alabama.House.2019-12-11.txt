 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Thornberry and Chairman Smith for their leadership in bringing this  conference report to the floor.   I am very pleased that Space Force, an issue that my good friend,    Jim Cooper, and I have been working on for several years, is finally  becoming a reality. This report establishes the U.S. Space Force in  title 10 as the sixth Armed Service of the United States under the  Department of the Air Force. It is the first new branch of the military  since 1947.   It also recognizes space as a warfighting domain and authorizes the  transfer of Air Force personnel to the newly established Space Force.  This is an important step for our national security. Our adversaries  are moving quickly in space, and this new service will allow us to  quickly realign our resources and efforts towards countering them.   Finally, the original House-passed NDAA that every Republican  opposed, included a number of open border provisions that would have  undermined our efforts to secure our Southwest border. I am pleased  that those unreasonable border security restrictions have been removed.   Madam Speaker, this is a strong defense bill, and I urge the House to  support this legislation.
