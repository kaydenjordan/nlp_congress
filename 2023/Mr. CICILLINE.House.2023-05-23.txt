 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the House for the  last time as a Member of this esteemed body. It has been the honor of  my life to represent the people of the First Congressional District of  Rhode Island in Congress.   At the end of this month, I will be stepping down from this position  to become the president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, one of  the Nation's oldest and largest community foundations. I am excited to  begin this extraordinary opportunity to build upon the work that I have  been leading in Congress and to continue to make a meaningful impact on  the lives of Rhode Islanders.   I would not be standing here today if not for the people of Rhode  Island who placed their faith and trust in me to represent them in  Congress. Every day over the past 12 years, I have put my heart and  soul into the work we do here to improve the lives of every Rhode  Islander and to protect our great democracy.   I thank my current and former staff, especially my longtime chief of  staff Peter Karafotas and my district director Christopher Bizzacco. I  cannot thank them and the rest of our staff enough for all of their  hard work and dedication over the years.   I am particularly grateful for two people who have worked for me for  more than two decades: Rita Murphy and Roger Suchite.   I have been blessed with the most committed, passionate, and talented  staff on the Hill who have established a reputation for our office of  excellence and effectiveness. They allowed me to take the lead on many  more things than anyone thought possible.   Every day, they showed up and gave their all to help the people of  Rhode Island, even when their own personal safety was at risk. I am so  proud of everything we have accomplished together, and I know that  everyone on my staff will go on to do bigger and better things.   Mr. Speaker, it has been an incredible honor to work with my friends  and colleagues day in and day out to address the challenges facing our  country.   It has been a special honor to serve alongside my colleagues in the  Rhode Island delegation, Senators Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and  Congressmen Jim Langevin and Seth Magaziner. While our delegation may  be small, we never let that stop us from delivering big for our State.  Their collaboration and friendship have meant the world to me.   One of the hardest parts of leaving this job is leaving behind so  many dear friends: Hakeem, Joe, Terri, Jamie, Pramila, Robin,  Frederica, Bill, Mark, Lucy, Veronica, Maxine, Melanie, Eric, Deborah,  Grace--and the list goes on and on.   We have been through so much together over the years, and I will  always cherish our friendship. I know that we will continue to stay  close even after I leave Washington.   Let me say a special word about two colleagues, Speaker Emerita Nancy  Pelosi and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro.   I first came to know Speaker Pelosi while serving as mayor of  Providence. I will forever remain in awe of her genius and  extraordinary leadership and all the kindness she has shown me over the  years. She has been a powerful ally in all of my biggest priorities  during my time in Congress.   I thank Speaker Pelosi for the honor of serving as an impeachment  manager to defend our democracy.   Rosa DeLauro has been my most important mentor, my friend, and my  inspiration. She set a standard for all of us of hard work and deep  commitment on every important issue facing our country. At every single  moment I have turned to her for advice or support or help of any kind,  she has been there. She has been like a sister to me, and our  friendship will endure forever.   In fact, the only time she has ever been wrong is her claim that New  Haven pizza is better than pizza in Providence.   I was first elected to Congress in 2010 as one of only nine new  Democrats in the House. We modestly called ourselves the Noble 9. We  were one of the smallest freshman classes ever.   The country and Rhode Island were just starting to recover from the  Great Recession, and Democrats had lost the majority by 60 seats. Let's  just say, it wasn't the easiest time to be a freshman Democratic Member  of Congress.   Like most Americans, I was convinced that this place was completely  broken, but I was determined to try to change that.   I came to Washington with my eyes wide open. I knew there were  Members of Congress who were only interested in being combative and  making headlines, but then I realized there were some Members who were  interested in working together to get things done for the country.   Don't get me wrong, at times it could be incredibly frustrating and  even disheartening to work with people who may agree with you on one  issue but completely disagree with you on everything else, including  how you live your own life.   I think it is important for the American people to know that there  are a lot of people in Congress who put their country over party and  work hard every day to improve the lives of their constituents and all  Americans.   My first few years in Washington, I immersed myself in my committee  assignments, the Small Business, Budget and Foreign Affairs Committees.  I focused on trying to bring back American manufacturing jobs and help  Rhode Island get back on its feet after the recession.   In 2014, I left the Budget Committee and moved over to the House  Committee on the Judiciary to try to tackle some of the most pressing  issues facing our country, including immigration, gun safety, LGBTQ+  equality, and campaign finance and criminal justice reform.   During the committee organizing meeting in 2016, Chairman Nadler  convinced me to take the ranking member spot on the Administrative  State, Regulatory Reform, and Antitrust Subcommittee, which at the  time, to be honest, wasn't exactly the first choice for most committee  members.   Chairman Nadler gave me great advice. He told me that sometimes you  should take an assignment to stretch your mind and learn something new.  I took that to heart.   From that moment forward, I learned all I could about antitrust, and  I quickly realized just how important antitrust policies were in  promoting competition and innovation to protect workers, small  business, and our economy by providing consumers with more choices.   As the ranking member, I developed a great working relationship with  Chairman Sensenbrenner. Over dinner, we would discuss our work on the  subcommittee, and more importantly, we got to know each other better  outside the Capitol and without the partisan noise.   It showed me that Washington wasn't completely broken and that you  could get things done by developing productive working relationships  and even friendships with colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   In 2016, I was elected by my colleagues to serve in House Democratic  leadership as co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications  Committee, which was responsible for developing the long-term messaging  for House Democrats.   Working alongside now-Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former  Member Cheri Bustos, we developed the For the People agenda that helped  bring Democrats back into the majority in 2018.   It was during that time that I developed a real friendship and deep  respect for the remarkable talent of Hakeem Jeffries, who I know will  be the next Speaker of the House.   Even though I was responsible for the Democratic messaging in the  House, I stayed committed to finding Republican colleagues who I could  work with to get things done for the American people.   That is what I did, on some of the biggest issues facing our country,  from protecting our democracy to gun safety  [[Page H2541]]  to LGBTQ+ equality and antitrust reform.   I developed strong working relationships and friendships with some of  my Republican colleagues, including   Ken Buck and Brian Fitzpatrick,  as we found common ground on important issues.                                time  1800    Even when we didn't see eye to eye on other policies and priorities,  I respected their commitment and dedication to public service.   As chair of the Antitrust Subcommittee, I expanded on the bipartisan  work of Jim Sensenbrenner and I and started by launching a 16-month  bipartisan investigation into the digital marketplace.   In partnership with Ranking Member Buck, we examined Big Tech's  anticompetitive practices, documenting them in a 450-page report that  informed our bipartisan, six-bill package to rein in Big Tech and  finally modernize our antitrust laws.   For decades, our government failed to enforce antitrust laws on the  burgeoning tech industry for fear of stifling innovation, which led  directly to the problems we see in the industry today.   I am proud that some of our measures became law last Congress,  reviving antitrust law and drawing important attention to these issues.  I am especially thankful for the friendship and dedication   Ken Buck  brought to this effort at great political cost to him.   None of this would have been possible without the extraordinary work  of my chief counsel, Slade Bond.   While Democrats held the majority, I also tried to end discrimination  against LGBTQ+ Americans through the Equality Act. This bipartisan  bill, which would end discrimination against LGBTQ+ Americans in  employment, housing, credit, education, and public accommodations, is  the most extensive civil rights legislation to pass the House since the  1964 Civil Rights Act.   It passed out of the House twice, in large part because of the  extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi, with bipartisan support. It  is only a matter of time before it becomes law, especially with my dear  friend Mark Takano now leading the effort. I will be forever grateful  also for the early and really critical support of the late John Lewis  in this effort.   On the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have had the privilege of working  with the great Chairman   Gregory Meeks, and I have worked with  Republicans, including  Mike McCaul,   Joe Wilson, and Ann Wagner to  advance American national security interests abroad and promote  diplomacy throughout the world.   With some of these colleagues, I established the House Diplomacy  Caucus in the wake of attacks on U.S. diplomats in Ukraine following  the first impeachment.   I also led numerous efforts to promote international human rights.  Last Congress, we passed the Global Respect Act in the House to prevent  individuals who commit gross human rights violations against LGBTQ+  people from entering the United States.   In January, President Biden signed the Justice for Victims of War  Crimes Act into law, legislation I authored with Republican  Congresswoman Victoria Spartz and with a bipartisan group of Senators.   On the Judiciary Committee, I was able to continue the work I started  on gun violence prevention as mayor of Providence and as a founding  member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns.   Following the Pulse nightclub shooting in the summer of 2016, I  worked with the late John Lewis, now-Minority Whip Katherine Clark,  Congresswoman Robin Kelly, and Congressman   John Larson to organize  the first-ever sit-in on the House floor to demand that the Republican  majority take action to address gun violence in this country.   Over the past 12 years, I have sponsored numerous gun safety bills to  ban assault weapons, outlaw ghost guns, close the fire sale loophole,  ban bump stocks, prevent people convicted of violent hate crimes from  owning a gun, improving the background check system, and to create an  active shooter alert system.   Once again, I was able to find colleagues on the other side of the  aisle to work with me on some of these bills, including the assault  weapons ban and the active shooter alert. Last summer, we passed  legislation to reinstate the assault weapons ban with bipartisan votes  in the House for the first time in 30 years.   Even during the most difficult times, like January 6, two  impeachments, and a global pandemic, I have never lost faith in the  resiliency and strength of our democracy.   It is not always pretty or easy, but we have always come out stronger  on the other side because of the powerful heroes of democracy who serve  in this place and fight to preserve it every day. I still believe in  our democracy and the ability of Congress to tackle big challenges and  improve the lives of all Americans.   We did that with the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law, the Respect for Marriage Act, and the Bipartisan  Safer Communities Act.   I leave this body knowing that I left it all on the field and did  everything I could to keep Americans safe from gun violence, to end  legal discrimination against LGBTQ+ Americans, and to shine a bright  light on the antitrust issues posed by Big Tech.   Every day, I woke up and came to work with the goal of improving the  lives of Rhode Islanders and all Americans. That is what has motivated  me every day for the last 28 years in public office, and I have done my  very best to deliver on that promise.   While I may be leaving Congress, I will never stop fighting for what  I believe in, and I will always be proud of the work we have done  together.   I have taken this final opportunity to speak on the floor of this  historic institution to highlight some of what we have been able to  achieve over the past 12 years when we let understanding, integrity,  and the willingness to find common ground take the lead in our work.   I come from a State whose motto is ``hope.'' As I leave Congress, I  want to leave with this parting word, hope. Hope for our democracy and  for this institution. For centuries, the United States has been the  hope of the world. We are the Nation where freedom, equality,  opportunity for all, and unity have made us a beacon of hope in some of  the darkest times in human history.   For generations, men and women have fought to preserve our way of  life, and many have given their blood, sweat, and even their lives for  it. Yet today there are forces working to undermine our  democratic institutions and our shared values.    This institution has the sacred responsibility to honor the  sacrifices made by so many in the work we do every day, in the way we  treat one another as colleagues, and in our commitment to let truth,  not fear; reason, not extremism; and respect for all, not division;  lead our every effort.   Our unity as a Nation and the ability of our democracy to withstand  the test of time depends on the resolve of this institution, those who  serve in its Halls, and the people whose votes are their voice in this  government to keep that hope alive.   Mr. Speaker, I once again extend my deepest gratitude to the people  of Rhode Island for giving me the greatest honor of my life, the  opportunity to represent you for the past 12 years here in the Congress  of the United States.   May God bless you and protect you. May the spirit of hope forever  endure in this institution and the people who serve in it.   May God bless the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the final time to speak in this Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Magaziner).                            ____________________
