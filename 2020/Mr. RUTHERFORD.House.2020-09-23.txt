 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brain Aneurysm  Month, the time when we spread awareness of the signs and symptoms and  seek increased research into treatment and prevention.   This month has a very special connection to northeast Florida that I  would like to take just a moment to share.   Trinity Love Hoblit was born with a rare form of primordial dwarfism  and grew to be only 29 inches tall. Despite her small size, the love  and joy she brought into this world was larger than life. Throughout  her life, she battled brain aneurysms and underwent numerous surgeries  to help alleviate the symptoms.   Sadly, on June 30, 2015, Trinity passed away. She was only 14 years  of age.   To continue her life legacy, her parents, Olivia and Phil Hoblit,  established the Trinity Love Hoblit Foundation, headquartered in Amelia  Island, Florida. Its purpose is to support and fund neurological  research, training, and treatment for brain aneurysms, strokes, and  other cerebrovascular conditions at hospitals in northeast Florida and  around the country.    So in honor of Trinity and the foundation in her name, please listen  closely to the risk factors and signs and symptoms of brain aneurysms.   The risk factors include: Smoking, high blood pressure, older age,  alcohol and/or drug abuse, and family history.   The symptoms of a brain aneurysm include: Severe headache, pain above  one eye or behind one eye, blurred or double vision, difficulty  speaking or swallowing, numbness or weakness on one side of the body,  and seizures.   Please do not ignore these symptoms, and promptly seek medical care  if you experience any of them, especially if you are having the worst  headache of your life. When it comes to brain aneurysms, awareness is  the beginning of prevention and cure.   On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida, I offer my  heartfelt thanks to Olivia and Phil Hoblit, the Trinity Love Hoblit  Foundation, their board of directors, and advisory committee members  for the lives they are helping to save every day.   Through their important work, the loving memory of Trinity Love  Hoblit will live on forever.                            ____________________
