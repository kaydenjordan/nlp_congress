 Madam Speaker, the Build Back Better agenda is simple,  it tackles the biggest challenges facing working families by investing  in what Americans need, from physical infrastructure to education and  child care.   The feedback from my constituents has been clear, they need a hard  infrastructure bill, but we can't stop there. Pennsylvania has more  than 3,000 bridges and 7,500 miles of highway in poor condition. The  infrastructure bill includes $11 billion for our highways and the  largest bridge investment since we built the interstate highway system.  It will provide good jobs and lower costs to businesses.   But we can't stop with roads and bridges if we want America to  succeed in the 21st century. Most Pennsylvanians can't afford quality  child care. The budget resolution would provide access to safe,  reliable, high-quality care. We need to rebuild our public schools and  construct affordable housing. We need to lower prescription drug costs  and expand Medicare to include dental, hearing, and vision.   Each of these investments will help working families and allow  everyone, not just the rich, to participate in the 21st century  economy.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to passing this historic legislation.                            ____________________
