 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut for  yielding. I am just in awe of her virtuoso presentation of this  legislation for the people.   I thank the chairwoman for the mastery of the subject matter, for the  strategic plan that she had to bring it to the floor, for her  collaboration with her subcommittee chairs as well as the chairs of the  subcommittees of authorization. I congratulate and thank her. I thank  her for the children.   Mr. Speaker, this package puts working families first. It does so by  prioritizing jobs, laying the foundation to create hundreds of  thousands of good-paying jobs, including by rebuilding the  infrastructure, including surface transportation and water  infrastructure to get the lead out; advancing the clean energy economy  of the future; and launching workforce training for the 21st century.  And it puts working families first by investing in our children.   Again and again, when people ask me what the three most important  issues facing the Congress are, I always say the same thing, our  children, our children, our children, and their health; their  education; the economic security of their families; a clean, safe  environment in which they can thrive; a world at peace in which they  can reach their fulfillment.   This legislation addresses many of these priorities.   Mr. Speaker, children's health is protected with child nutrition  initiatives, including SNAP and WIC, serving tens of millions of hungry  kids.                                time  1900    I remember when the stories were written about the first community  health centers, the person who was the leader in all of that was  spending some health money on food, and the Federal Government said:  That is supposed to be for prescription drugs and not for food.   He responded: Food is what makes our children healthy.   So I thank the gentlewoman for the nutrition sections in here.   The health of the family is also protected by support for public  health initiatives for maternal and child health, as well as research  to fight future pandemics and to head off future pandemics.   Our children's education is advanced by ensuring that K-12 schools  have resources they need, including with historic investments in title  1, and higher education is advanced in Pell grants and other financial  assistance and funding for minority-serving institutions, our HBCUs,  our Hispanic-serving institutions, and our institutions that help our  Native-American institutions of higher learning.   I think it is really important to note--and I thank the chairwoman  for recognizing this--that when we talk about the investments we make  in an appropriations bill, it is important to note that this is not  increasing the national debt--nothing.   Mr. Speaker, economists will tell you nothing brings more money to  the Treasury than the education of the American people. Earliest  childhood, K-12, higher ed, post-grad, lifetime learning for our  workers--nothing brings more money. So I thank the gentlewoman for this  fiscally responsible initiative.   In terms of the economic security of our children and families, these  bills make strong investments in rental, homeowner, and other housing  initiatives, including low-income households, and in combating  homelessness, and they address economic disparities facing families.   Indeed, this appropriation package puts justice and equity front and  center. We are proud of its provisions to combat injustice and economic  opportunities, pollution and the environment, health and more.   This package is also about our children's future in another respect.  It confronts the climate crisis by expanding environmental enforcement  efforts, creating a Civilian Climate Corps and launching a renewed  focus on protecting our cherished scenic places and expanding local  parks in communities across the country for our families to enjoy. It  sets us on a course for an affordable, secure, and clean energy future  by investing over $14 billion in clean energy and science which will  also create thousands of green jobs.   Also, so importantly, this package honors our responsibility to our  veterans, their families, and their caregivers. These bills contain  robust funding for veterans' healthcare including women's health, women  veterans' health, mental health, and homelessness assistance. It will  help veterans transition to civilian life with economic opportunities  worthy of their service.   We always say that we owe so much to our men and women in uniform and  to our veterans. We owe them so much to meet their needs, but we also  owe them a debt of gratitude by building a future worthy of their  sacrifice. This bill also builds vital military infrastructure,  including military housing, childcare centers, and VA facilities.   This week, as we advance these appropriations bills, Congress will  continue our work to advance infrastructure and budget reconciliation  bills that meet the needs of the American people separate from the  appropriations bills. In all that we do, Democrats are for the people  and building back better by investing in America with jobs,  opportunity, and progress for families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong vote for this important and impactful  appropriations bill of which the Congress and the country can all be  proud with great gratitude to Madam Chair, Congresswoman DeLauro, for  her leadership and all the members of her team.
