 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the  gentleman from New York for yielding and for his leadership on this  issue.   You know, I have never appreciated being discriminated against, but I  have always been told that if you fool me once, shame on you; fool me  twice, shame on me.   And there is one thing that we do know. We know from evidence-based  research that tobacco products that are smoked, inhaled, or chewed,  have no measurable health benefits. Tobacco product usage is still one  of the leading causes of preventable death in the United States,  resulting in an estimated 480,000 lives each year.   Cigarette usage is still declining in the United States. Some  analysts have reported that 34 million American adults smoke cigarettes  on a regular basis, and there are 1.2 million American middle and high  school students who smoked cigarettes in the last 30 days. According to  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 8.1 million American  adults used e-cigarettes every day or some days in 2018, and about 5.4  million American middle and high school students have used an e- cigarette in the last 30 days.   I support H.R. 2339, Protecting American Lungs and Reversing the  Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2020. This bill would stop the  manufacturing and use of fruity and flavored tobacco products in all  electronic nicotine delivery systems that are battery operated  containing nicotine and other chemicals.   In addition, this legislation would provide grants to community  health workers and educational awareness to cessation programs for  tobacco.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.
