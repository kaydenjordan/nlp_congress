 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for his  leadership in bringing this bill to the floor.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 3684, the INVEST in America Act.  This bill authorizes a tremendous funding boost to our Nation's surface  transportation and infrastructure system, including a significant  amount for my State of Texas. Failing to invest now will cost much more  later.   The INVEST in America Act also makes significant investments in  transportation research, development, and demonstration to support of  safer and more resilient, equitable, and sustainable transportation  future.   I am pleased to have inserted numerous provisions in the bill before  us today, including one to establish a grants program in the Department  of Transportation to develop transportation workforce training programs  for workers adversely affected by industry automation; a sense of  Congress to emphasize that contractors participating in a federally  funded transportation contract with a minority-owned business must  ensure that it is fulfilled.    As well as an amendment to require the GAO to  analyze the DOT's performance of key DBE objectives, and a provision to  assist communities to retrofit transportation infrastructure.   Nothing in this bill is intended to build a wall in Texas, and I look  forward to supporting this legislation.
