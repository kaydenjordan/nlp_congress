 Madam President, this week, we will complete work on an  important bipartisan bill. Thanks to the leadership of the Senator from  Idaho, Mr. Crapo, who is chairman of the Banking Committee, they passed  it out of the Banking Committee, and now it is time for us to do our  job and pass it out of the Senate. Last week, we voted to proceed, and  we will vote to pass it out of the Senate in the next few days.   Senator Crapo explained why this work is so important. Since the  passage of the Dodd-Frank legislation in 2010--as we all recall, after  the great recession of 2008, when Wall Street melted down together with  our financial institutions, there were reform efforts undertaken known  as Dodd-Frank--Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank--which imposed  regulatory requirements on banks large and small. The problem is, the  small community banks--the ones that are disproportionately harmed by  this overregulation--weren't the cause of the great recession, the  financial meltdown of 2010 and 2009, but they are the collateral  damage. What has happened is, there has been a lot of consolidation.  Many small community banks and credit unions have simply had to close  or been consolidated with other larger banks and institutions. It has  taken a toll on our economy, and it has taken a toll on our communities  across the country. What happens is, these community banks have less  money to loan because they have had to use the money they would loan to  hire more people to help them comply with all the unnecessary redtape  because of the Dodd-Frank overregulation. Some have had to basically  defer that sort of investment in their communities and  [[Page S1620]]  others have had to shutter completely because of the financial burden.   The second-order effect is, some people don't have access to capital;  that is, to loans they need. They can't get credit they need in order  to start a small business, grow an existing business, or even get a  mortgage to buy their first home.   Let's be clear, though, about which financial institutions this bill  is tailored toward helping. It is small community banks, midsized  regional ones, as well as credit unions. The bill we are considering  somehow does not exempt large banks from those regulations, and saying  it does, which some have said, doesn't make it so. It is a claim too  eagerly peddled by those who want to maintain the status quo, to the  detriment of our smaller communities and small businesses. Large banks  are still subject to measures designed to protect the stability of the  overall economy, like rigorous stress testing.   After all, this bill is called the Economic Growth, Regulatory  Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. What it actually does is rightsize  those regulations. It does this by providing targeted exemptions from  risk-weighted capital requirements, for example, and the Volcker rule.  It also provides a qualified mortgage safe harbor for small banks and  raises the SIFI threshold so community banks are not lumped into the  same overall category as giant financial institutions operating on Wall  Street.   The majority leader recently said: ``In an era of online banking and  multinational corporations, smaller institutions remain uniquely able  to build community connections,'' and that is important to our civic  fabric as well as the economies in rural and smalltown America.   Based on research, community banks provide more than half of all  small business loans. That could translate into small banks getting to  know their customers on a personal level and then extending credit to  entrepreneurs and families who might not have access otherwise.   That is certainly the situation in parts of my State, the State of  Texas. I have heard from banks and communities there that are more than  ready to finally be freed of the shackles of Dodd-Frank.   As the chief executive officer of the Independent Bankers Association  of Texas put it, ``Congress holds the key to unchain community banks  from the burden pushing them toward consolidation''--in other words,  mergers, forcing them to become big banks, which seems to me to be an  odd way to deal with this problem, to be sure, or putting them out of  business altogether.   In the IBAT's view--Independent Bankers Association of Texas--rules  meant to curb the abuses of banks deemed too big to fail have instead  trickled down to harm their much smaller counterparts. Because of this  effect, in essence, community banks have become too small to survive as  mergers and acquisitions have occurred all over the map.   Independent bankers have reported that since 2009, Texas has lost  nearly one-third of its banks--one-third of its banks. They have said  that based on Federal data on rural counties, approximately one-third  don't have a local credit union or bank at all. This bill addresses  that situation. It enjoys wide bipartisan support, and I hope my  colleagues will join me in supporting passage before the end of the  week.                                Fix NICS Bill    Madam President, on another matter, I want to emphasize another point  and talk about a new milestone reached and announce some good news.   We have now reached 64 total cosponsors for a bill I have introduced  with the junior Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Murphy, called the Fix  NICS, which is the background check reform bill we cosponsored  together.   In an institution like this, during polarized times, it is pretty  remarkable that you have 64 Senators--32 Democrats and 32 Republicans-- coming together and saying: Yes, we have a problem, and, yes, we want  to work together to fix it.   This is the kind of legislation the Nation has been waiting for, as  people continue to be frustrated, frightened, and depressed by random  acts of violence that have broken out in and around some of our  churches, our cities, and our schools. I am talking about shootings  like those that occurred at Sutherland Springs, TX, outside of San  Antonio, in Las Vegas, and, of course, Parkland, FL. With Fix NICS, we  are saying the status quo is not acceptable.   I am happy to hear my friend the Democratic leader, Senator Schumer,  say there are other things he and his colleagues on the other side of  the aisle would like to do. I would just quote to him some ancient  wisdom; that ``the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single  step.'' We ought to take that first step and do what we can do today  and do what is achievable in order to make our communities safer.   I have talked about it before, but if the background check system had  been working the way Congress intended, the shooter who murdered 26  people as they worshiped on Sunday morning in Sutherland Springs,  outside of San Antonio, and injured 20 more would not have been able to  legally purchase firearms because the background check system would  have reflected the fact that he was a convicted felon, he had been  convicted of domestic violence, and he had been in a mental  institution. All three of those things are disqualifiers from being  able to legally purchase firearms under current law, but if the  background system isn't uploaded with the appropriate information for  the FBI to maintain, then those convictions will never be discovered,  and someone can merely lie their way into purchasing firearms and  committing atrocities like we saw in Sutherland Springs.   Fix NICS is designed to make sure convicted felons can't get access  to firearms because, under current law, they are disallowed from doing  so. It is designed to make sure people who commit domestic violence  can't buy a firearm because they are currently prohibited by law from  doing so. It is designed to make sure people who are dishonorably  discharged from the military can't legally get a firearm because the  current law prohibits them from doing so.   Sometimes criminals with domestic abuse convictions, records of  mental illness, and violent erratic behavior slip through the cracks  and get their hands on guns, despite what the law already prohibits.  That is why it is so important for us to pass this legislation now-- again, with 64 cosponsors of the legislation, evenly divided between  Republicans and Democrats.   The effectiveness of doing this sort of background check system has  been confirmed by academic research. A recent study by RAND Corporation  found evidence that dealer background checks may decrease firearm  homicides by as much as 20 percent or more. In other words, it saves  lives. One specific part of that study further suggested that enforcing  background checks for felony records may have a similar diminishing  effect. In other words, enforcement matters, and enforcement is what we  are trying to ensure.   We have learned from Sutherland Springs that the NICS system is not  operating as Congress intended and that the military, in this instance,  was not uploading certain records, but they are not alone. Recent news  reports out of places like Ohio have shown it is often the case at the  State level as well. We know, a few years back, the shooter at Virginia  Tech, near Washington, DC, had been adjudicated mentally ill by the  State of Virginia, but the State had never uploaded that information on  the background check system, so he was able to purchase a firearm.   This bill will save lives. I know my friend the Democratic leader,  the minority leader, has said: Well, it is not enough, but if it saves  lives, isn't it a good start? I am grateful to him for cosponsoring the  legislation. You couldn't tell he cosponsored the legislation by his  comments here, acting like this is somehow not a very important step,  but it is because it will save lives.   This bill has the backing of the President as well, whom I have  spoken to personally, and the minority and majority leaders in the  Senate and is supported by gun groups across the spectrum from--yes,  the National Rifle Association but also Everytown for Gun Safety. They  are at the opposite ends of the ideological spectrum when it comes to  the Second Amendment. It is not just them. It is others like the  National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, Sandy Hook Promise, the  National Shooting Sports Foundation, the  [[Page S1621]]  National Domestic Violence Hotline, and the National Sheriffs'  Association.   It really is remarkable when you have groups with such widely  divergent views, when it comes to the Second Amendment, come together  and say: Well, this is where we can find common ground. This is where  we can actually do something. That is reflected in the 64 bipartisan  cosponsors we have for the bill.   The bill would do this: First, it would require Federal agencies and  States to produce NICS implementation plans, in other words, to fix  what is broken, including measures to verify the accuracy of the  records.   It would hold Federal agencies accountable if they fail to upload the  relevant information.   I think it is accurate information, but I have heard that after the  shooting in Sutherland Springs, the military has now gone back and  uploaded 4,000 additional records into the NICS background check system  that weren't previously loaded. Those are 4,000 people now in the  system who, if they attempted to buy a firearm legally through a gun  store or Federal licensed firearm dealer, would not be able to do so  because there would be a hit on the FBI background check system.   I think if we provided similar incentives to the States, we would see  a similar increase in compliance and public safety continue to be  enhanced.   This bill would reward States that comply with their NICS  implementation plan through Federal grants incentives. It would  reauthorize and improve law enforcement programs to help State  governments share relevant criminal record information. Let's not  forget, this is not just a Federal problem.   Finally, the bill would provide important technical assistance to  Federal agencies and States that are working to comply with NICS  record-sharing requirements.   We have all the support we need. What we need is a vote. I know that  despite the minority leader's comments here today, he does not oppose  this bill. He says it is merely not enough, but why can't we pass this  bill that we all agree on and then build from there? I am not afraid of  having any debate or any vote on any matter related to the Second  Amendment. That is why our constituents sent us here, to debate and to  vote and to be held accountable for those votes.   I know there is pressure from those who want more controversial  measures to be added, but frankly they are ones that can't pass the  Senate, much less the House, or be signed into the law. I would hope we  focus--focus our attention on what is achievable, what is bipartisan,  what brings people together at the opposite ends of the ideological  spectrum and pass the Fix NICS bill. Again, NICS is the National  Instant Criminal Background Check System. It will improve our  background check system and in the process save lives.   If we did nothing else--and I am not advocating that for a moment,  but if we did nothing else in this space other than pass this  background check reform system, we would save lives. I don't know why  that is not compelling enough to everyone to actually get it done. I  hope it is, and I hope we do so without further delay.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr.  Paul).
