 Mr. Speaker, radical progressives will stop at nothing to  advance their agenda of murdering the unborn.   On July 15, on this very floor, the majority rushed through two  horrendous pieces of legislation that directly target the unborn: the  abortion on demand until birth act and the so-called Ensuring Access to  Abortion Act.   The right to life is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the  Constitution, and the majority continues to conveniently ignore this  fact. This shameful chapter of murdering the unborn should be consigned  to the ash heap of history.   Mr. Speaker, an outright denial of life for the most vulnerable, who  cannot speak for themselves, is in no way justified. I will always  serve as a voice for the unborn. They deserve nothing less than  unwavering advocates.                            ____________________
