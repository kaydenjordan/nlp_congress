 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our Nation's law  enforcement. Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called  children of God.   Mr. Speaker, since last summer, members of law enforcement have faced  attacks and dangerous rhetoric, even from Members of this body. As  officers put their lives on the line to protect all of us, our  communities, and our families, we have seen nothing but  [[Page H1059]]  dangerous attempts from the left to defund, dismantle, and disband the  police even as we stand here today, surrounded by razor wire, the  National Guard and increased police presence to protect you, but you  don't want them to protect our citizens.   Mr. Speaker, this bill would end qualified immunity. Qualified  immunity is only applicable when they follow their training and  protocol and protects officers from being personally sued for official  actions. If we repeal qualified immunity, we will not find anyone  willing to serve as police officers because they can be sued out of  everything they own for doing their jobs.   Mr. Speaker, if that is not enough, this bill would threaten our  officers' physical safety by denying them protective gear and  equipment. The Democrats and radical left are going to defund and  dismantle departments and take away officers' liability protection for  doing their job. Then they are going to take away their physical  protection from harm. We will be lucky to have a police force in  America in 10 years.
