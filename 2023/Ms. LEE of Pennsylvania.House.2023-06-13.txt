 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the  millions of victims of gun violence whose voices have been silenced.   We need to acknowledge what it means to be an American today. It  means checking where the exits are in a grocery store or being afraid  to drop your child off at an elementary school or always wondering when  and where the next shooting will happen.   What are we doing?   This bill is a slap in the face to the victims of mass shootings. It  ignores the realities of gun violence in our country, and it  demonstrates how Republicans choose the gun lobby over children and  families over and over again.   In fact, they planned to mark up this bill on March 28. They  postponed it after a shooter used a stabilizing brace to murder six  people at the Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee.   Instead, they choose the seventh anniversary of the Pulse nightclub  shooting.   All the while, in my district, the Tree of Life families are in court  fighting for justice, facing the gunman who killed their loved ones.  Mass shootings have become so commonplace that it would be hard to  schedule this on a day that is not a terrible anniversary.   This bill today is shameful. To my Republican colleagues, if you are  not with us, at least get out of the way. You owe it to the American  people.
