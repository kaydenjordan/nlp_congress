I ask unanimous consent that there be 6 minutes of  debate equally divided.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, everybody around here agrees that the  U.S. economy is getting better--there is no argument about that--and  that workers are needed. Yet, in this massive partisan spending bill, a  lot of which is not even about COVID-19, the Democrats are insisting on  a substantial increase to the already extraordinary Federal Government  add-on to State unemployment payments, making it harder to get people  who can go back to work.   Just this morning, we learned that the economy added 379,000 jobs in  February and that the unemployment rate dropped to 6.2 percent. The  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the consensus of economists  is that unemployment will continue to trend lower. It underscores what  the CBO has said recently, which is that, without any additional  stimulus, the economy will recover to prepandemic levels by midyear,  this year--that is June 30--not in September as the Democrats' approach  would suggest.   Look at your own States. Employers are looking to hire people. ``Help  wanted'' signs are up. As the economy starts to improve, we want to get  people back to work.   Adding to the good news, President Biden now tells us that vaccines  will be available by the end of May for all who will want them. That  will further kick-start the economy.   Despite the better news, as we understand it, the Democrats' approach  actually extends the generous Federal supplement currently in place  until September 6--by the way, even a little beyond what is in the $1.9  trillion underlying bill.   I was just told that it has a $31 billion tax increase that affects  the so-called passthrough, which is primarily small businesses, to pay  for a proposal to pay people more who are on unemployment insurance.   The Democrats' proposal makes it even more advantageous to be on  unemployment by changing retroactively a longstanding policy that says  UI benefits are taxed as income. You make up to 10,000 bucks in  benefits, tax-free, even if you have made up to $150,000 a year.  Remember, with that 600 bucks a week Federal supplement, which is what  it was for a lot of last year when this would have applied, about 70  percent of workers on UI made more than they would have at their jobs.  Even at 300 bucks a week, 42 percent of workers are making more on UI  than they would make at their jobs.   Of the essential workers, think of the truckdrivers who are making 25  bucks an hour. They are being told ``you have to pay your taxes,'' but  those who aren't working not only get the UI benefits, but now, for the  first time ever, some of that income is actually going to be tax-free.  So you have to pay your taxes, but they don't. That is not fair.   The underlying bill and the Democrats' alternative are going to hurt  the effort to get people back to work. Our amendment would extend UI  benefits in a responsible manner at the current low level of $300 per  week through July 18. According to the CBO, this will save over $90  billion in outlays and actually raise $600 million in revenue. Why?  Because people will be working. That is a good thing. We should want  that.   I urge my colleagues to oppose unnecessarily lengthening the time of  the Federal UI supplement that would make it even more advantageous to  be on unemployment and would slow the job creation we all want. Our  amendment strikes the right balance. It helps those who truly need it,  promotes better stewardship of our taxpayer dollars, and encourages  those who can return to work to do so. I urge its adoption.   (Applause.)    Mr. President.    Mr. President, let's be clear with what is going on  here. The Republicans have offered a very generous unemployment system,  including 300 bucks per week, as is the current law after March 15,  when it would otherwise expire, and taking it to July 18.   Now, there is nobody in this Chamber that doesn't see that the  economy is improving. And the Congressional Budget Office, which is a  nonpartisan group here, has told us that, actually, by the middle of  this year, we are going to be back to the prepandemic level in terms of  our economy. Every economist looks at this and says that unemployment  is going down.   I note that my colleague over there, from Oregon, said that claims  were higher last week in terms of unemployment. The 4-week average is  actually down, considerably.   Let me tell you what happened today, because I just looked it up. New  York opened its movie theaters; Virginia announced they are opening  their schools; West Virginia opened their bars, their restaurants, all  businesses; Connecticut is opening indoor dining. This is happening  every day. The economy is getting better.   And everybody says--including, by the way, Larry Summers, a famous  Democratic economist, who was Treasury Secretary under President  Obama--that when you look at what happens with regard to unemployment  insurance, if it is too high, it is a disincentive to work.   I don't think Larry Summers is saying people are lazy. I think what  Larry Summers is saying is that you want to have a system that is  balanced, where you are encouraging people to work. There are so many  employers in our States who are looking for people right now, and that  is going to continue to happen as we open up more.   Look, our unemployment provision is very reasonable; it is very  generous--taking it through July 18.   They are taking theirs through September 6. And then they are adding  this new element that has never been in unemployment before, where  suddenly if you are on unemployment insurance, you don't have to pay  taxes, but if you are working you do have to pay taxes.   How does that make sense? Don't we want to encourage people to work?  I think we do. I hope that my colleagues will vote down this amendment  and continue to keep the Portman amendment in place, which, by the way,  passed this Chamber only about an hour and a half ago.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 seconds to  respond, and then I will stop.    Mr. President, No. 1, the 4-week average on unemployment  claims are actually going the right way. Why? Because the economy is  opening up, folks. If you don't see that, you are not going home to  your States and talking to your employers.   Second, we have a situation here where the Republicans are saying we  want to continue the $300 per month--or per week after March 15, but  let's end it on July 18. If things turn south--which no one is  predicting, by the way, not a single economist--I know a lot of us  would be willing to work with the other side of the aisle to extend,  but there is no reason to do that at this point.   With regard to your tax cut, it is a tax increase. It is a tax  increase on small businesses.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1378     Mr. President, this amendment comes after about 24 hours  of discussion here as a surprise because we are just looking at it for  the first time.   But there are two things that are very disturbing about it. One is it  completely distorts workers' compensation for Federal employees, which  has substantially increased costs to taxpayers, of course. It also sets  a terrible precedent in terms of how workers' comp works.   Workers' comp, of course, is for people who are injured on the job,  and you have to show you have been injured on the job. That is how it  works. It is a basic principle for workers' comp.   In this case, this amendment changes the rules to require  compensation for COVID-19 lost wages no matter how risky the Federal  employees' behavior might have been outside of the workplace. In other  words, no questions asked. If you are a Federal worker and you get  COVID-19, you get this.   That is not the way workers' comp works. So this is a big change in  workforce policy and establishes, again, a dangerous new precedent in  workers' comp policy, generally.   It also creates a wrong incentive--think about it--for the employee  and for the employer. So we oppose this.   For Federal workers, the statute is very explicit. It says: Federal  workers' compensation ``for the disability or death . . . resulting  from personal injury sustained while in the performance of . . .  duty.''   Second--I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Second, we are just finding out there is another $10  billion added through this amendment to State and local governments. I  don't know if everybody was listening when Senator Romney gave his  explanation during his amendment of what is happening with regard to  our States, but a lot of our States don't need the money. Some do and  some don't. And there is no requirements here that if you have got a  surplus or if you otherwise don't have COVID-19 expenses that you don't  get the money, and yet we are adding another $10 billion to that pot  through this one amendment. So, of course, we object to this amendment,  and there may be other stuff in there too. I hope everybody gets a  chance to look at it because we have not had a chance to do so yet.   But I hope we do not create the wrong incentives. I hope we do not  create this situation where we are substantially increasing costs to  the taxpayer through changes in workers' comp and adding another $10  billion to a category where it has been shown, in many cases, not to be  needed.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.   The Senator from Vermont.
