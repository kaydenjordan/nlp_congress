 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for her  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this bill. We must  get flood insurance right, and that starts with affordability. If  families can't afford insurance, they simply will not buy it.  [[Page H9232]]    In my home State of Florida, the number of NFIP policies has dropped  15 percent since 2012, when Congress started raising premiums. If you  don't think the government should be involved in flood insurance, maybe  that is good news, maybe that is the goal here, but not for the good of  the taxpayer, when families who can't afford coverage must turn to FEMA  after a disaster.   The bottom line is that unaffordable insurance will fail. This bill  makes flood insurance less affordable, hiking premiums, surcharges, as  well as fees. Beyond that, this bill would decrease access to coverage  for vulnerable families, forcing them into a private market that does  not exist.   Yes, we absolutely need 21st century flood reform. Our climate is  changing, sea levels are rising, floods are getting worse, and sticking  our heads in the sand will only make solutions that much more  difficult.   This bill leaves behind the best reform ideas from both political  parties, like better mapping, as well as mitigation.   Those who have lived through natural disasters know you can't stop  the catastrophic force of Mother Nature, but you can prepare.   I urge my colleagues to reject this ideological exercise and put  people over politics. Let us come together and pass real, sustainable  reform for a strong, affordable National Flood Insurance Program.   Mr. Speaker, I include letters of opposition in the Record from the  Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners and the City of  Clearwater.                                                   Pinellas County,                                   Board of County Commissioners,                                   Clearwater, FL, November 8, 2017.      Hon. Charlie Crist,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Charlie: On behalf of Pinellas County, Florida, we       urge you to oppose the 21st Century Flood Reform Act, H.R.       2874. This bill, which is the compilation of the seven-bill       package approved by the House Financial Services Committee       this summer, is detrimental to Pinellas County residents and       local governments. Despite the minor changes proposed in the       amendment, the bill will increase costs for National Flood       Insurance Program (NFIP) policyholders, create unfunded       mandates by increasing regulatory burdens and       responsibilities for local governments, and lead to fewer       participants in the NFIP, which will undermine the integrity       of the program. We strongly urge you to oppose the bill.        The bill would increase premiums on homes built prior to       the first flood map by a minimum of 6.5% each year, with       properties that have made two or more claims subject to even       higher rate increases. In addition to this increase, all       policy holders would be assessed new and increased fees and       surcharges with some of these fees, such as the reserve fund       fee, increasing each year. As these increased costs are       passed on to policyholders, the bill acknowledges that an       affordability assistance program is needed, however it       delegates that authority to states and requires it to be       financed through additional charges on the other       policyholders in the state, creating an even greater       financial burden. These increased costs along with the new       restrictions in the bill on types of properties that can       obtain coverage through the NFIP will undermine participation       in the program, further destabilizing it. The bill does       nothing to invest in new flood mapping and technology, which       would result in more accurate maps and does not sufficiently       invest in mitigation. We ask for your continued assistance in       ensuring that this bill does not become law.        Additionally, we want to thank you for cosponsoring H.R.       3285, the Sustainable, Affordable, Fair and Efficient (SAFE)       NFIP Act. The legislation is significantly more consumer-      friendly than the House Financial Services Committee       approach. The SAFE NFIP Act includes provisions to limit       premium rate increases, create means-tested mitigation and       affordability provisions, expand the Increased Cost of       Compliance program, develop accurate flood maps, and       emphasize pre-disaster mitigation programs.        Again, thank you for your continued assistance in ensuring       that legislative efforts detrimental to Pinellas County's       over 130,000 policyholders are not enacted into law. We value       your support and thank you for cosponsoring H.R. 3285. Please       do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide additional       information or answer questions.            Sincerely,                                                     Janet C. Long,      Chair, Pinellas County Commission.                                   ____                                               City of Clearwater,                                   Clearwater, FL, November 7, 2017.      Hon. Charlie Crist,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.

Please do       not hesitate to contact the city should you need additional       information, and with warm, personal regards, I am            Sincerely,                                                George N.
