 Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, Attorney General Sessions  stated we won't be a better, healthier Nation if marijuana is sold at  every corner grocery store. His Justice Department also signaled that  it would raid a marijuana industry convention being held on tribal  lands in my State of Nevada.   While it is pretty clear that the Attorney General has some other  problems to worry about now, I would note that his statement and his  department's actions demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of  the legal marijuana industry.   The industry, which is highly regulated in States that have chosen to  legalize marijuana, does, indeed, face challenges in banking, taxes,  advertising, security, and working with veterans. These need to be  addressed by Congress.   But in the meantime, I invite Mr. Sessions: Come to Nevada. Meet with  members of the industry. Find out how it really works before you make  rash decisions about enforcement that will counter the votes of many  people across this country.                            ____________________
