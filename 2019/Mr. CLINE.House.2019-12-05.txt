 Madam Speaker, I rise today to memorialize Roanoke  businessman Mr. Bittle Porterfield, III,  [[Page H9264]]  who contributed greatly to the arts, education, and business community  throughout southwest Virginia.   Among the many civic leadership roles held during his lifetime, Mr.  Porterfield served on the Virginia Council on Higher Education, was  president of the Taubman Museum of Art, and the Roanoke Valley Chamber  of Commerce in addition to being chairman of both the Roanoke Valley  Business Council and the United Way of Roanoke Valley.   Mr. Porterfield believed in Roanoke's potential and knew that the  Star City could play a pivotal role in cultural development. As a  veteran, a Roanoke native, and an innate leader, Mr. Porterfield  believed that it was his life's purpose to serve others and his  community.   I am grateful for the commitment and passion Bittle Porterfield had  for the Roanoke Valley and wish to extend my deepest sympathies to his  family for their loss. May they find peace in knowing that his legacy  of service will live on through the countless lives he touched.                            ____________________
