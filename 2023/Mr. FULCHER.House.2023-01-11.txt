 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support H. Con. Res. 3.  This resolution condemns the recent attacks on pro-life facilities  across the country. Since the Supreme Court Dobbs decision, there have  been over 100 attacks on pro-life organizations and churches in the  U.S., causing life-affirming centers across the country to spend  hundreds of thousands of dollars in security--fearing they may be  targeted next.   In Idaho, life-affirming organizations provide critical services to  women. For example, Stanton Healthcare in Meridian, Idaho, recently  helped Leandra, a young mother facing an unexpected pregnancy, with  encouragement through pre- and post-natal care and education,  childbirth classes, material assistance, and mentorship resources.   This resolution shouldn't be controversial. It simply highlights that  acts of violence and intimidation are unacceptable and have no place in  our society. But it is important for all of us to call out this  violence and condemn it.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman   Mike Johnson for taking the lead  on this resolution and for his efforts to promote life.                            ____________________
