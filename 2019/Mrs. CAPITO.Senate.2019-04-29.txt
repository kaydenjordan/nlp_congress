 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Sergeant  Russell Herman Sines of Goshen, WV. Sergeant Sines bravely served in  the 80th Division, 317th Infantry of the United States Army from 1942  to 1945, during the height of American intervention in World War II.  Known as the Blue Ridge Division, Sergeant Sines and his comrades from  Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and our home State of West Virginia  were ordered into action on July 15, 1942, and eventually set sail for  Europe on Independence Day of 1944.   The 80th Division fought valiantly on the Allied front, first landing  on Utah Beach in Normandy and then quickly moving to Saint-Jores,  France. Later that fall, the 317th Infantry was forced to cross the  Moselle River to Pont-a-Mousson in the face of heavy Axis opposition.  During the ensuing battle at Mousson, Sergeant Sines was wounded by  shrapnel in his calf and ankle and taken to receive treatment at a  Paris hospital. Sergeant Sines would later receive a Purple Heart for  his wounds received during combat.   However, this injury would not stop Sergeant Sines from serving his  country. By the time the Axis forces began their Ardennes Offensive,  Sergeant Sines was already back with the 317th Infantry. His regiment  continued to move toward the southeast lines of Bastonge, where  fighting would continue for several months. While on the streets of  Bastonge, Sergeant Sines happened to run into his brother, Junior  Sines, proving how small the world is that we West Virginians enjoy.   Sergeant Sines and the 80th Division, 317th Infantry would go on to  capture the cities of Kassel, Erfurt, Wierman, Jena, and Gera. It was  during the fighting between Kassel and Erfurt that Sergeant Sines would  receive a bronze medal for his heroic and meritorious service on the  battlefield. By the end of the war, the Blue Ridge Division captured  over 200,000 enemy soldiers and endured 289 days of combat, fighting  courageously in places such as Ardennes, Luxembourg, and Argentan to  name a few.   I hold stories like that of Sergeant Russell Herman Sines close to my  heart, as my father, Governor Arch Moore, also fought in World War II.  As Americans, we have a duty to honor and remember the collective  sacrifice of all the men and women of the Greatest Generation. Because  of their service, America has continued to prosper and flourish,  serving as a pillar of hope and freedom for people across the world.   West Virginians understand the importance of community, patriotism,  and liberty. These values are alive in the Appalachian foothills due to  the service of brave men and woman like Sergeant Russell Herman Sines.  Again, I thank Sergeant Sines for his duty to his country, and it is an  honor to call him a fellow West Virginian.                            ____________________
