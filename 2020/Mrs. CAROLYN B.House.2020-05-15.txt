 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good  friend from New York for yielding.   I rise in strong support of the HEROES Act. This bill will provide  over $67 billion in emergency relief to New York State, emergency aid  that is desperately needed by a State that is on the front line of our  national fight against the coronavirus.   There is more than $17 billion that will flow directly to New York  City, whose people continue to inspire the country with their  resilience, courage, and compassion.   The act includes crucial support for renters, which is especially  important to my district. For people who have lost their jobs, the  Federal Government will pay their rent for them out of a $100 billion  fund.   As chair of the Oversight and Reform Committee, I helped lead a  bipartisan effort to save the Postal Service from financial ruin. This  bill will provide $25 billion to ensure that it can continue serving  the American public.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the numerous Members on both sides of the aisle  who have joined me in fighting for this and  [[Page H2224]]  supporting this funding. This emergency assistance will mean that we  can avoid drastic service cuts at a time when American lives depend on  the mail more and more every day.   Recognizing that Congress has a constitutional responsibility to  ensure a fair and accurate Census, this bill extends certain reporting  deadlines. The administration has asked for this delay as a result of  the coronavirus crisis, which caused key operations of the 2020 Census  to be postponed.   The bill would also enhance congressional oversight of Census  operations. This administration has fought legitimate oversight tooth  and nail, and the bill has added protections for this essential  function.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this crucial legislation.                                time  1515     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to  support H.R. 6800, the HEROES Act, an urgently needed response to the  COVID-19 pandemic designed to protect the lives and livelihoods of the  American people while preserving the integrity of our democratic  institutions on which our nation relies.   Among its provisions are those that will ensure our 2020 decennial  Census is full, fair, and accurate. This bill grants the  Administration's request to extend data delivery deadlines for  apportionment and redistricting, while requiring greater transparency  from the Census Bureau to Congress on the schedule and progress of 2020  Census operations.   These provisions also grant colleges and universities the flexibility  to respond on behalf of their students who have been sent home due to  the coronavirus. In addition, these provisions would ensure that in  preparing and releasing information related to the 2020 Census or  redistricting, the Bureau focuses its efforts on information that is  being collected in the 2020 Census, without distractions or unnecessary  diversion of resources from new, potentially inaccurate data products  that are not required by federal law.   These provisions would require the Bureau to maintain high standards  of data quality. To be clear, none of these provisions are intended to  impact or interfere with the Census Bureau's efforts to protect the  personally identifiable information of respondents, as required under  Title 13. These provisions are commonsense measures that reflect this  difficult and challenging period in our history with the narrowly  focused goal of achieving a full, fair and accurate count of all- American residents in the 2020 Census.   I urge my colleagues in the Senate to swiftly consider and pass the  HEROES Act so that American families and businesses receive the relief  they need while ensuring an accurate 2020 Census.
