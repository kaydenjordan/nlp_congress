 Mr. Speaker, America's national defense has historically  been a source of bipartisan agreement, not a battleground for divisive,  extreme partisan politics.   Unfortunately, House Republicans chose to use the NDAA to advance  controversial and harmful amendments rather than work in a bipartisan  way to bolster our national defense, strengthen our national security  interests, and protect our servicemembers.   Through the amendment process, House Republicans inserted extreme  anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ, and anti-DEI amendments that infringe upon  the rights of individuals, notably those who serve in our armed forces  and their families, threaten their liberties, and undermine their  principles of freedom and autonomy that they work every day to defend.   With these poison pills, I could not vote to advance this year's  NDAA, as amended.   I will work tirelessly with my Senate counterparts and reasonable  Republicans to ensure that damaging anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ, and  anti-DEI amendments are not included in the final text of this  legislation.                            ____________________
