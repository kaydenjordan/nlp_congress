 Mr. President, I was listening to the previous speaker  from Rhode Island, and I figure it is time to clarify a few things that  are said about our President.   I know that right now a lot of people are believing that we are going  to have a change; that we will have a Democratic President. A lot of  decisions are being made, talk is being made. But to show you that  there is a big difference of opinion, I want to say a few things about  our President just to remind people. They have forgotten what has  happened. Now, I know there are differing opinions on that, partisan  opinions and all that.   Right now, my very close friend from the Democratic aisle and I are  going to, hopefully, have a vote tomorrow that will take place, the  Defense authorization bill--the biggest bill of the year, the most  significant bill of the year. Senator Reed and I have an agreement on  almost every element of it. And we have both come to the conclusion  that it is a tremendous bill. It is one you really can't justify  opposing.   A lot of things have been said that are not true, but I want to just  mention a couple of things because this is a good time to do it.   We have a President who has done things that just have never been  done before in terms of accomplishments, positive accomplishments. I  remember 2 years ago, I wrote this little card because I was keeping  track of all these goods things that have happened. I remember showing  it to the President at that time. He read that, and he was very excited  about the way that we had composed them. Keep in mind, this was 2 years  ago.   Look at these 10 things that this President has done: First of all,  the big tax cut that he had. By the way, when we look at the fact that  he did such great things for the economy--prior to the pandemic, we had  the best economy we have had in my lifetime. The pandemic changed all  of that. But he did this by looking back at history--and it was not a  Republican; it was a Democrat. It was President Kennedy who had the  wisdom to say, when he was working on the Great Society programs that  were going to cost so much money: Well, we have to raise our revenue,  and the best way to increase revenue is to decrease tax rates. So he  decreased tax rates. We all remember that. While it worked,  unfortunately, the President died before he could really take advantage  and enjoy the benefits of the work he had done by his tax cuts. It has  been tried since that time, and it has worked.   But what this President did in addition to that, he didn't have just  tax cuts; he had regulation cuts. I call it the golden day of  regulation relief, the best economy we have had in that period of time.  They say that full employment is 4 percent unemployment, when, in fact,  we actually got down below 3 percent. That was something that has not  been done in my memory, and all these things happened and good benefits  came from that.   There is a difference of opinion between Democrats and Republicans,  and we understand that. I have always felt the best thing and indicator  of success in the economy is to see how many people you get off of food  stamps, and a lot of liberal friends say that they measure it by how  many people get on food stamps. Nonetheless, we have 5 million people  off of food stamps. That is what happened, and that is why we had the  economy that we had. I hate to think of where we would be today if we  had started with an average economy. We started with the best economy  we had in my lifetime, and that was because of the President and the  support he had from our party.   The second thing I hold up--now, keep in mind, I am from Oklahoma. We  are an oil State. We renewed--during the Obama administration, there  was a war on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are coal, oil, and gas, and it  was an effort to try to get it back into renewables. Someday we may  have the development of renewables. They are not there now. In spite of  what the previous speaker said, they are not there and available now.  So what this President did was he stopped the war on fossil fuels.   As a result of that, we had--and this is in the first 2 years--a 277- percent growth in crude exports, 132-percent increase in coal exports,  and a 52-percent increase in natural gas exports. A lot of that  translated into the economy that we were enjoying.   In terms of illegal immigration--I know this became very  controversial--the wall. People didn't like the idea of the wall. I can  remember a conversation I had with Netanyahu when I was in Israel once,  and he said he didn't understand how a modern State can have borders  that are not secured. He said: You can't do that. That doesn't work.  Well, he has now gotten that done against a lot of opposition--we all  know that--in Israel.   How many Presidents--every President I can think of in my career here  in Washington has said we need to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to  Jerusalem, but they don't do it. So this President just went ahead and  did it. He is a little abrupt--we understand that--but he got these  things done.   The WRDA bill--the Water Resources Development Act--right now and,  actually, the FAA reauthorization were both booming successes. They  were his efforts.   And then the judges. I don't know that it is a record, but in the  period of time, the 4 years that this President has been in office, we  have had about 220 judges who have been confirmed. These are all judges  who have one thing in common: They really believe in the Constitution.  They are Constitutionalists. In addition to that, he has three of the  U.S. Supreme Court Justices.   Then, on the repeal, if you talk to anyone in business in America-- this was a couple of years ago--about the biggest problem they had was  the Dodd-Frank effort. That was the overregulation of business and  industry. And so he relaxed those rules, and that created a lot of  prosperity, a reason for the economy that we have today, and the record  employment that he has given us of 157 million jobs.   This is back 2 years ago.  [[Page S7321]]    Now, I would say, if you single out one thing--I don't say this  critically of the Obama administration. We all have different  priorities, and I have considered President Obama to be a friend.  However, his top priority was not a strong national defense. He had  other priorities. We all know that.   As a result of that, if you will take the last 5 years--that would  have been from the year 2010 to 2015--in the last 5 years, he reduced  the funding of the military by 25 percent. It has never been done  before.   But that is something that this President came in and immediately-- and I chair the committee, so I was very much involved in this. But we  ended up with all these things that--the lifting of that and putting it  back in the position that it should be.   Now, this is interesting because somebody reminded me--John Bonsell  reminded me this morning. He said: What you ought to do is get a list  of these things that have happened since 2 years ago. So real quickly,  just to say, identifying China as the No. 1 adversary in the NDS--that  is the National Defense System, which has worked very successfully.  That is a program that is put together by six Republicans and six  Democrats, all experts in the field.   I talked about national defense, and he stuck with that and has  identified China for the problems that they are giving us right now.   He had new investments in the future. Hypersonics is a good example.  After the last administration, China and Russia both surged ahead of us  in the research on hypersonics. That is one of the most recent  developments of modern equipment. That has worked, and we are not quite  there yet, but we are catching up in the cyber world. He is advancing  it in that area.   Then as far as the terrorist leaders Baghdadi and Soleimani, both of  them were considered to be the worst terrorists on the planet, and he  has taken both of them out.   He established the Space Force. The Space Force is something that we  really needed to do not because so much that we were behind in anything  but the fact that our competition--Russia and China--were in their  particular space forces, and we wanted to make sure everybody knew and  our partners knew that we were right there with them.   Then, of course, he eliminated the widow's tax. We remember that.   And the Abraham accords--this is really interesting. We have Arab  countries right now that are working closely with Israel. This hasn't  happened before. The UAE is right now working with them. And the  Israelis didn't have to give up anything, so that is a major  advancement that we are enjoying.   Then, of course, one of the issues we are working on right now is on  the arms sales. We feel that we need to be selling arms to our allies,  and we want to make sure that the whole world knows that, as a loyal  friend of ours, we want to make sure that we do for them what we should  be doing for them.   During that timeframe he rescued 55 hostages in 24 countries. That is  a big deal.   So, anyway, all these things have been going on--and getting tough. I  know people are upset with his attitude toward NATO. He believes in  NATO, but he believes that the partners in NATO need to start carrying  their fair share. And it worked. It increased their share by about $130  billion.   That is something that, when you talk to real people--when you get  out of Washington and you talk to the people on the street, they say:  Why are we in NATO when they are not carrying their end of it? Well,  that is all changing.   Anyway, that is what this President has done. But there is one thing  that is happening that I think is maybe the most significant thing that  this President has accomplished. He came out with something. I don't  know who thought of the words ``Warp Speed'' because I have had a hard  time remembering that. I have to write it down because I forget it.   But he came out with something where--General Perna is a real expert  and has been monitoring what is going on and getting the medical  equipment necessary to defeat this thing that we have been under now  for almost a year. And he said--keep in mind, this is back in June. In  June, he said, by year-end--by December, maybe as early as November,  but by December we are going to have the decision made and have a way  to stop the pandemic that has been plaguing us for so long.   We had a hearing--and the Presiding Officer knows this because he was  in attendance at that hearing--and we looked at the things that General  Perna was coming up with that showed us conclusively that we were going  to have a vaccine that was going to work by year-end and then it would  take about 3 months after that to get the distribution going.   So we are talking about having this thing over by April. Now, the  interesting thing--that happened in June, yet that is still, today--we  are right on schedule for that to happen.   My fellow Senator from Oklahoma, James Lankford, gave a speech  yesterday. It was fascinating. He took a long time to do it, but he  went into all the indicators that were out there, and you come to the  conclusion that this plague is going to be over and we are going to be  able to get back to normal. And that will be certainly good.   So I just want to mention that those things are happening, and those  things are things that were on behalf of our President. There are, out  there, a lot of people--I have never seen the media turn against  someone like they have our President. So people don't even know these  good things, but I am hoping we can get this out so that people will be  aware of it.   Now, back to the bill that we are going to have. I know that my  partner, who is the ranking member on the Armed Services Committee, is  going to want to be heard concerning some of the great things that we  are going to be doing in that bill. I will be doing the same thing  tomorrow morning.   So this is a bill that we can all be proud of. I have never seen it  misrepresented as much as this bill has been misrepresented.   With that, I am anxious to hear my partner talking.   I will yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Let me first of all say that my colleague, ranking member  of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Reed, is absolutely right. I  think about the people that he was praising, the staff people.   You don't very often hear people back in the real world really  appreciating the time and effort that comes from the staff. In this  case, the two individuals that Senator Reed talked about, John Bonsell,  Liz King--I don't remember one weekend that they have had off during  this whole thing.   They are just workaholics. They know how significant this is. They  know we had a defense authorization bill for the last 60 years, and the  worst thing we could do to our kids in the field who are risking their  lives is not send them the resources necessary that are in this bill to  defend America                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
