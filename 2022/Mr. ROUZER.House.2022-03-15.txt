 Madam Speaker, what has been taking place in Ukraine is  pure genocide and evil. President Putin's invasion of Ukraine is no  different than when Germany invaded Poland. Just as Hitler did not stop  with Poland, we should not expect that Putin will stop with Ukraine,  unless he is resoundingly defeated.   While much has been done to help Ukraine's defenses since Russia  invaded and much has been donated in humanitarian assistance, it is not  enough. We must do more. We must send more weapons, more planes, more  missiles, whatever is needed.   The Ukrainians are going to fight to the very end. We must provide  them every resource they need to win this war in whatever way that we  possibly can. For if freedom is defeated in Ukraine, where her people  fight eagerly and will to the very end, it will surely have no safe  harbor elsewhere.                      Unleash American Energy Dominance     Madam Speaker, President Biden's decision to ban the  importation of Russian oil is a good step, albeit late and only after  mounting bipartisan pressure to do so. There was no good reason for the  United States to ever subsidize the Russian economy and President  Putin's military by buying oil from Russia, a source of Putin's  leverage with the West for years. Now, he wages an unprovoked and  violent assault on Ukraine.   On a separate issue, nor is it a good idea for the U.S. to be sitting  alongside Russia negotiating with Iran on a deal that paves Iran's path  to a nuclear weapon, another pot of trouble brewing for the world, as  evidenced by their missiles launched at Israelis and Americans in Iraq  this past weekend.   Given all the challenges we face in the world today, we must  immediately unleash American energy production so that we in the United  States and our allies around the world can have access to affordable  and reliable energy.   We should be authorizing new leases and permits for oil and gas  projects, expediting the approval of all pipelines, and stopping the  self-inflicted regulatory assault on American energy development and  financing. In short, President Biden must reverse, with the  [[Page H3718]]  stroke of a pen, every anti-fossil fuel policy he has put in place  during the past year.   If the President wants to lower gas prices at the pump and protect  the environment, he is the one person who can do it, who can unleash  American energy dominance. The world is going to meet its energy needs  with oil and gas one way or the other. It is just a question of from  where it comes. We can do it better and cleaner than anyone else, so  why not do it here and serve the call of freedom.                           Honoring Deborah Johnson     Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Deborah  Johnson, who recently received the Paulson-Whitmore State Executive  Award from the National Pork Producers Council and the National Pork  Board.   Deborah received the award for relentless advocacy on behalf of pork  producers in North Carolina and across the country. As one of many who  count her as a friend, I can think of no one more deserving of this  honor.   Deborah grew up on her family's multi-generation farm in Johnston  County. It is no exaggeration to say she has been involved in  agriculture her entire lifetime, including as CEO of the North Carolina  Pork Council.   In addition to serving in that post for 11 years, Deborah has been an  influential leader in the North Carolina agriculture industry  throughout her career. Additionally, she has also been involved in  several organizations that contribute to the betterment of southeastern  North Carolina's rural communities, many of which are the backbone of  our State and Nation's pork industry.   Words cannot properly express all that Deborah Johnson has  accomplished, but suffice it to say she is one of the most influential  women in agriculture. She cares deeply about the State of North  Carolina, about producing the world's best food and fiber, and about  protecting the livelihoods of the many farm families who feed and  clothe us all. Her dedication and leadership are unmatched, and I  congratulate her on receiving this well-deserved award.                            ____________________
