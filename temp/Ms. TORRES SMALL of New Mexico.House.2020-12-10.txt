 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 5273) to require the  Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a plan to increase to 100  percent the rates of scanning of commercial and passenger vehicles  entering the United States at land ports of entry along the border  using large-scale non-intrusive inspection systems to enhance border  security, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendments thereto,  and concur in the Senate amendments.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Homeland Security be authorized to file a  supplemental report on the bill, H.R. 5828.
