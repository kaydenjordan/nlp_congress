 Madam Speaker, under the Affordable Care  Act, contraception is covered as an essential benefit, recognizing its  importance to overall healthcare. Yet, this essential health component  is one of the many rights under attack by an extreme, politicized  Supreme Court.   Congress must act now to protect the freedom of individuals to make  their own decisions about reproductive health and family planning.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Right to  Contraception Act and ensure this fundamental healthcare benefit isn't  the latest right stolen from the millions of Americans who rely on it.                            ____________________
