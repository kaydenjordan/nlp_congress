 Mr. President, last week marked the 45th anniversary of  Roe v. Wade, but many of us were not celebrating because last week gave  us another opportunity to consider the real damage caused by the  Supreme Court decision, which even liberal scholars have now said is  flawed in the type of damage it has done to the social fabric of our  Nation over the last four and a half decades.   During this period of time, more than 50 million unborn children in  America have been denied the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness--50 million. In other parts of the world, unborn children  have been killed by the sheer fact that they happen to be girls instead  of boys or because one has a disability like Down syndrome.   For me, Roe v. Wade hits close to home because I come from the State  where the lead plaintiff was living at the time of that now famous  lawsuit. Her name is Norma McCorvey, or Jane Roe in the case. She was  from Dallas, TX. What is unknown, generally, but interesting, is what  is left out of this story when you hear about Jane Roe in Roe v. Wade.  Mrs. McCorvey, actually, never went forward with the abortion. She gave  birth instead, and her child was adopted. She later became an  influential pro-life advocate.   Her story should give us cause for hope that change is possible-- change of the human heart, change in the direction of the country--when  it comes to unborn children, as should events like the March for Life  that happened earlier this month here in Washington, where more than  100,000 pro-life men and women, young and old, descended on our  Nation's Capital.   I want to applaud President Trump for becoming our Nation's first  sitting President to address the march.   Hope is increasingly being provided by advances in science that have  dispelled some of the mythology associated with abortion. Advancing  technology is making it easier for many to see the humanity of a  growing child and to realize that it does have moral status.   One physician at Northwestern University recounted recently:         The more advanced in my field of neonatology, the more it       just became the logical choice to recognize the developing       fetus for what it is. . . . It just became so obvious that       these were just developing humans.    Testimony like that lends credence to the bill that we are voting on  today. It is called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. I  don't doubt that some of our colleagues would just prefer to remain  silent and to hope this vote passes without many people paying much  attention, but I hope that doesn't happen. It is an entirely  appropriate occasion for us to talk about abortion and its role in our  society and how it is increasingly out of step with modern science and  people's recognition that these are indeed unborn human beings.   This legislation protects unborn children at 20 weeks, or 5 months.  Who among us thinks that it is appropriate to have an elective abortion  after 5 months in the womb? That is what we are talking about. We are  specifically talking about the child's ability to feel pain at this  stage of development. It doesn't apply in cases where the mother's life  is at risk or in cases of rape or incest. It does have those  exceptions.   Advances in modern medicine help babies born at 21 and 22 weeks to  survive. In other words, we are talking about unborn children who could  survive outside the womb, who are still subject to elective abortion in  this country. So babies roughly the same age are clearly alive and need  our protection before they are born as well, and this bill will help  provide that protection.   Incredibly, the United States is only one of seven countries that  allow elective abortions past 20 weeks. It is not exactly an honor to  be in the same category as North Korea, Vietnam, and China when it  comes to allowing elective abortions after 5 months.   I am glad that the pain-capable bill has passed in 20 States,  including my  [[Page S530]]  home State of Texas. It has been estimated that the law we are voting  on today will save approximately 12,000 to 18,000 babies annually. That  is 12,000 to 18,000 lives saved were this bill to pass. That is hopeful  news.   Polls have shown that a majority of Americans support a prohibition  on abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. This is one thing that brings  people who consider themselves to be pro-life and people who consider  themselves to be pro-choice together, common ground recognizing that at  some point you are talking about a human being capable of living  outside the womb.   As my colleague from Oklahoma, the junior Senator, told us on the  floor recently, people all across the country are waking up. They are  beginning to say, as he put it:         Wait a minute, that child has 10 fingers and 10 toes,       unique DNA that is different from his or her mom and dad,       [and] the child feels pain in the womb and has a beating       heart. . . . That sounds like a child.    He is absolutely right. It sounds like a child because it is one.   I wish to close by quoting Winston Churchill, who I realize is  perhaps an unlikely figure to bring up at a time like this. That great  leader once said that ``a nation that has forgotten its past has no  future.''   Here in the United States, we have forgotten our past when it comes  to abortion. We have forgotten, for example, that some of the original  advocates of abortion had ties to the eugenics movement. They believed  that you could eliminate people who had disabilities or who were  frowned upon for one reason or another by virtue of their gender or  other characteristics they had no control over. They often promoted  forced sterilization because some people, in their view, simply  shouldn't be allowed to reproduce. One example is Margaret Sanger, the  founder of Planned Parenthood, who is known to have spoken with the Ku  Klux Klan and other disreputable organizations about her views.   We have forgotten, as well, the activists advocating on behalf of  racial minorities in the 1960s and 1970s who once emphasized abortion's  civil rights connection--that protecting the unborn represented an  effort to protect the weak and the disenfranchised.   Respectfully, I call on all of our colleagues to remember these  connections and to see how far we have come--and not in a positive way.  These colleagues of mine often describe themselves as pro-choice, but  they actually are not unique in that regard. We all attach value to  choices. As others have said before, we all know that choices have  consequences and that some are better than others.   Each of us represents the sum of his or her choices, too. As a  society, we should choose to offer pregnant mothers who are worried,  financially insecure, or alone options other than abortion. We not only  should do this, but we must.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the pain-capable  legislation we will be voting on in just a couple of hours.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
