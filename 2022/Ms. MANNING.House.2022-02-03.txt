 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  America COMPETES Act, which includes two of my amendments.   This bill includes important provisions that enhance our ability to  attract the best talent from around the world, such as scientists and  engineers  [[Page H923]]  with doctoral degrees. My amendment would extend this program to STEM  graduates with master's degrees who work in fields that are critical to  our national and economic security.   The bill also includes funding for scholarships for low-income  Americans to study in the STEM fields.   The bill also includes my amendment to ensure our Nation's HBCUs,  Tribal colleges and universities, and other minority-serving  institutions or active members of Manufacturing USA institutes.   These and other provisions in the America COMPETES Act will help us  create more jobs, sharpen our technological edge, and make critical  investments in our future.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                            ____________________
