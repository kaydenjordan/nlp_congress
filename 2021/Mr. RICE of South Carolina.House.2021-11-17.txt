 Madam Speaker, with so many real problems  facing Americans created by the Biden administration--open borders,  soaring gas prices, sky-high grocery bills, and our embarrassment in  Afghanistan--my friends across the aisle assemble us here today to  debate a cartoon.   Political cartoons routinely depict violence. It is not new. Cartoons  have depicted violence since there were cartoons.   If you don't believe me, google ``political cartoons 2021.'' You will  see a depiction of Joe Biden killing a Republican with a steamroller  and a Republican elephant trampling voters, among many others.   Now, I will ask all of you out there to watch the Gosar cartoon that  is occupying the floor of the United States Congress for over an hour  today. Is it inappropriate? Yes. Childish? Of course. Stupid? Without  question. But is it a threat? Absolutely not.   Now, I know some Members may need to seek therapy because they saw  this cartoon. But is it a threat? Absolutely not.
