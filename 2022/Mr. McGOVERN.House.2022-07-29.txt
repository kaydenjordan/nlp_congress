 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 1300 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1300         Resolved, That the requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII       for a two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee       on Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is       waived with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of July 29, 2022.        Sec. 2. (a) Section 7 of House Resolution 1289 shall have       no force or effect.        (b) Clause 7(a)(1) of rule XV shall not apply through the       legislative day of Friday, September 16, 2022.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time  as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time  yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, the Committee on Rules met and reported  a rule, House Resolution 1300, waiving clause 6(a) of rule XIII  requiring a two-thirds vote to consider a rule on the same day it is  reported from the Committee on Rules against any resolution reported  through the legislative day of July 29, 2022.   The rule also allows certain legislation to qualify for the Consensus  Calendar before the end of Congress.   Madam Speaker, we are here on a same-day rule, which I hope will give  us the opportunity to address a critical and urgent issue: gun violence  in America.   We are here because gun violence is destroying communities, tearing  apart families, and making our streets less safe. This majority is  going to try to do every single thing we possibly can to stop it. I  don't know whether we will succeed, but we are going to try.   Democrats actually passed the Safer Communities Act, the first piece  of major gun safety legislation in decades, and we sent it to President  Biden's desk. We are taking action. We are getting things done, and we  are trying to save lives.   Contrast that with what Republicans did to address gun violence and  crime the last time they were in charge, which is absolutely nothing.  Their answer to gun violence is more guns, and if that is not enough,  even more guns. For God's sake, America already has more guns than  people. How many guns do we need until everybody is safe?   I get it. My Republican friends are going to complain about the  process. They are going to complain about same-day authority, even  though they used it themselves, but let's not go there because we want  to have a productive debate here.   The reality is this: This is the last day before the district work  period, and this is urgent work.   Now, let me tell you, as chairman of the House Committee on Rules, I  want to do whatever I can to get us to vote on and pass an assault  weapons ban because I am sick and tired of the mass shootings and the  terror and the fear. I am sick and tired of shattered families having  to grieve.   Enough is enough. I am going to do everything I can to get this bill  passed, and I am not going to apologize for that. This rule preserves  that option. If it means that we stay here a little bit longer today,  so be it. We need to act with urgency.   Let me just say, for the record, the assault weapons bill that we may  possibly consider today went through regular order. The Committee on  the Judiciary had a hearing; it was marked up. If we decide to bring it  to the floor today, which I hope we will, the Committee on Rules will  meet, and we will debate this, and we will vote on this. But let me  just say to everybody: We have an obligation to act with urgency. We  have a responsibility to address this crisis.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the gentleman used the words that we are opening the  door. Opening the door to what? My friends used this all the time when  they were in charge. We learned this from you. I just want to say that,  for the record.   As I have said, I am not the biggest fan of same-day authority, but  it exists for a reason.   In December 2018, when the Democrats were in the minority, I actually  voted for a rule providing for same-day authority. I stood here and  urged my Democrat colleagues to support the rule. More Republicans  voted ``no'' on that rule than Democrats, believe it or not.   Madam Speaker, we are about to break for a, hopefully, productive  district work period, and this rule provides us with a little extra  time and flexibility to be able to consider measures that are critical  to our public safety.   I hope that this rule paves the way for us to bring up an assault  weapons ban. That is what I hope this rule does, and I think that is  urgent. I want to do everything I possibly can to get that bill to the  floor and get it passed.   The gentleman quoted me, and let me quote me, too. With regard to the  same-day authority, I said on the House floor: ``This House needs to  move quickly and responsibly. Everyone understands that, so I will  simply say that I will be voting for this rule. I urge my colleagues to  do the same, so we can finish our business and prevent another  government shutdown.''   That was when you were in charge. That was what I said in response to  when you brought up a same-day rule.   So, nobody is opening the door. You opened that door a long time ago.  But I am going to say, again, if this paves the way for us to be able  to bring up an assault weapons ban, I am not apologizing at all. I want  to get that legislation to the floor. I want to have that debate. I  want to have a vote on it.   People are dying all over this country. They are sick of our  inaction. It is time to act. Enough is enough.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, let me just say that I think as everybody knows,  Democrats are focused on inflation. Tackling inflation is certainly our  top priority.   Let's take a look at the facts.   We passed the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act to bring down costs to  families, and almost every Republican voted no.   We passed the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act, but not a  single Republican voted with us.   What is the Republican solution on inflation?   Who the hell knows?   They haven't offered any policy ideas. They seem content cheering for  President Biden to fail and for inflation to go up. In fact, Leader  McConnell is holding hostage a bill to lower costs for families and to  deal with the issue of prescription drugs.   The only plan I have seen from the GOP is from Senator Rick Scott,  Republican, which would raise taxes on the middle class--raise taxes on  the middle class--and put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping  block.   That is the same old same old from my friends on the other side.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an MSNBC opinion article  titled: ``The GOP keeps slamming Biden over inflation, but it has no  solutions to offer.''                        [From MSNBC, June 21, 2022]  The GOP Keeps Slamming Biden Over Inflation, But It Has No Solutions To                                   Offer                            (By Dean Obeidallah)         Republicans want you to believe that inflation in the       United States is not part of a global problem but is 100       percent, President Joe Biden's fault.        Just check out their recent over-the-top rhetoric. House       Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has blamed Biden       for ``creating raging inflation.'' In a tweet, Sen. Ted Cruz,       R-Texas, called inflation ``#BidenFlation,'' saying it was       caused by Biden's policies. Senate Minority Leader Mitch       McConnell, R-Ky., even made a speech on the Senate floor last       week focused on inflation, in which he detailed the rising       prices of goods, gas, etc., all leading to the crescendo that       it was Biden and the Democrats' fault.        What the GOP has left out of all its speeches, television       appearances and tweets slamming Biden is even a hint of a       proposal to reduce prices.        But what the GOP has left out of all its speeches,       television appearances and tweets slamming Biden is even a       hint of a proposal to reduce prices. Even worse than the GOP       not having a plan of its own, though, is Republicans'       determination to block Biden's efforts to help Americans.       They've opposed his agenda to lower child care costs, create       affordable housing and more. Biden made that very point in       his June 14 speech about his plans to address inflation, in       which he declared that ``Republicans in Congress are doing       everything they can to stop my plans to bring down costs on       ordinary families.''        There's no disputing that prices in our nation rose 8.6       percent in May since last year at that time, the highest rate       since 1981. Food prices have risen over 10 percent since May       2021, and gas prices have skyrocketed. Just about everything       we use on a daily basis costs more.        Biden candidly acknowledged this reality in last week's       speech, noting that inflation is ``sapping the strength of a       lot of families.'' He said he understands firsthand what this       is like, noting that when he was a child growing up in a       blue-collar family, ``it mattered if the price of food went       up.''        A convergence of issues has caused this spike in inflation.       The well-documented supply chain issues that followed Covid       shutdowns drove up prices. Some of it was fueled by us,       consumers who unleashed our pent-up demand to travel and buy       goods after things reopened. More demand equals higher       prices.  [[Page H7414]]       Russia's attack on Ukraine added to higher gas prices, which       contribute to higher prices for goods, since it costs more to       transport them.        This is in no way a Biden-caused problem--unless       Republicans are telling us he caused inflation worldwide,       which they very well might say before November. A Pew       Research Center report released just last week documented       that in 37 of the 44 nations with ``advanced economies,'' the       ``average annual inflation rate in the first quarter of this       year was at least twice what it was in the first quarter of       2020.'' In fact, the United States during the first quarter       of this year was 13 of 44 in terms of inflation, far eclipsed       by countries such as Italy, Israel, Spain, Greece and Turkey.        This leads us to the hard reality that there's no easy       solution for inflation; if there were, Biden would've flipped       that switch months ago. And cynical Republicans know that.        At least Biden does have a plan, which, like the causes of       inflation, is multifaceted.        With respect to gas prices, in addition to releasing oil       from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to increase supplies,       the president last week sent a letter to U.S. oil companies       demanding that they increase the production of oil and to       stop unfairly profiting on Americans' need for gas. He even       threatened to ``use all reasonable and appropriate Federal       Government tools and emergency authorities to increase       refinery capacity and output in the near term.'' In his       speech last week, Biden noted that on food costs, he was       ``working closely with our European partners to get 20       million tons of grains locked in Ukraine out onto the market       to help bring down food prices.'' The president also       explained his efforts to reduce other household costs to       offset the higher gas and food prices, such as capping the       cost of insulin at $35--a bill for which passed the House in       March but still has not passed the Senate due to lack of       Republican support.        So where is the GOP plan to address inflation? Republicans       have had plenty of time to come up with one, given that they       have been screaming since last summer that Biden caused       inflation.        Here's the best I can find: In May, Sen. Rick Scott, R-      Fla., the chair of the National Republican Senatorial       Committee, laid out his plan. ``The most effective thing Joe       Biden can do to solve the inflation crisis he created is       resign,'' Scott said. Then there's McCarthy, who earlier this       month offered the following proposal as his ``solution'' to       rising costs: ``I call on Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats       to hold a prime-time hearing on the out-of-control inflation       their policies have created.''        Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., the third-ranking member of       the House GOP, isn't even pretending her party has a plan.       She recently said of inflation, ``House Republicans will       address these crises when we earn back control of the House       this November.'' Sure, America, let's trust the party of tax       cuts for the wealthy to look out for the rest of us.        We all get how politics works. The party out of power       blames the party in power for everything that's bad. But in       this case, inflation is directly impacting the lives of all       Americans. It's time Democrats and the media press every       Republican who blames Biden for inflation to answer this       simple question: What is the GOP plan to reduce it? Americans       deserve an answer.     Madam Speaker, since my friends want to change the  subject, let's change the subject.   Republicans right now, as we are meeting here, over in the Senate are  trying to kill the PACT Act, a bill to guarantee healthcare to veterans  with service-related cancers. This is a bill that passed the Senate  originally 84-14, and it passed the House with a majority vote of 342.  Many of my Republican colleagues supported that. I appreciate that. But  now Republicans are trying to kill it and play politics with it over in  the Senate. They are putting politics ahead of people when, in fact, we  should be putting people ahead of politics.   So while we are here having this conversation, I would urge my  Republican friends to pick up the phone and call your counterparts in  the Senate and say: Get out of the way and do what is right for our  veterans.   My office is getting calls from veterans who were exposed to burn  pits when they were overseas. I am sure my Republican friends are  getting calls in their offices. You don't have to agree on everything,  but I thought we all agreed on this.   Can we please tell Mitch McConnell and tell the Republicans to get  out of the way and allow this bill to go forward?   That might be a good use of time right now while we are having this  conversation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, let me just say that I really enjoyed listening to my  friends on the other side of the aisle. They are opposed to this rule  because the process will expedite progress on behalf of the American  people. Yet they are not outraged over using process to block progress  for the American people.   Again, since we are changing the subject, I didn't hear anything  about the veterans who right now are desperately pleading with  Republicans in the Senate to pass the PACT Act. The gentleman even got  extra time and didn't mention that at all.   Again, I would urge my Republicans, as we are still here today,  before you leave, call Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, call  your Republican counterparts in the Senate, and say: please pass the  PACT Act. Please do that now.   Our veterans who are suffering from cancer as a result of their  service and being exposed to burn pits are desperately pleading with my  Republican friends to stop blocking it.   Do you want to be outraged about something today?   Be outraged about that.   So, again, I would urge that they do something.   Many of my colleagues on the Republican side supported the PACT Act  when it came before the House.                                time  0945    A majority of Republicans in the Senate voted to support it; but now  they are putting politics ahead of people. It should be reversed. Put  people ahead of politics.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   So, Madam Speaker, I don't know who that guy who was yelling is, but  I would refer him to my earlier comments on all the things that we are  doing to combat inflation and the stuff that we will be rolling out in  the days ahead.   But I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to go  over to  [[Page H7416]]  the Senate and yell at Mitch McConnell so that we can help our  veterans. I mean, it is unconscionable that, as we are gathering here  right now, Republicans in the Senate are blocking a bill to provide  care for veterans exposed to burn pits who have cancer.   I mean, what is going on here? I mean, people who are responsible for  that are unfit to serve in the United States Congress, quite frankly.   Do you want to be outraged about something? Be outraged about that at  this moment. And we also should be outraged at the alarming rate of gun  violence in this country. And my hope is that this same-day rule will  pave the way for the Rules Committee to meet and to bring forward a ban  on assault weapons so we can save lives in this country. So that is  what this is all about today.   But, again, with all of the yelling and screaming, please go over to  the other Chamber and yell and scream at them because right now a lot  of our veterans are concerned that they will succeed in killing a bill  that will provide them healthcare that they desperately need.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   So, Madam Speaker, the gentleman who just spoke was yielded time  again, and again, didn't say anything about the veterans who are  getting screwed by Senate Republicans right now in the other Chamber.   Right now, we should take our outrage and we should demand that  Republicans get out of the way.   And, by the way, to my friend from Pennsylvania, I just went back and  I read the transcript of what our exchange was in the Rules Committee,  and I think I was pretty clear.   When I am looking at the transcript, I was asked last night, you  know, why we needed this authority, and I said it was to consider  public safety bills.   I was further asked if we would use it to consider gun legislation,  and I said, yes, potentially.   Now, I don't know whether it is my Massachusetts accent or what, but  I think I was pretty clear about what we were going to bring to the  floor today. And, again, I hope that we will follow through with what I  said yesterday.   So this idea that, oh, I didn't know--and by the way, there are  times, as I said at the opening, when same-day authority is, to me,  necessary. There are other times when it is not. And when the  Republicans were in charge and they used it for frivolous things, yeah,  I objected to it. But when they used it in an attempt to try to keep  government open, I favored it.   So I don't know what the gentleman is talking about, hypocrisy. I  mean, I have been in favor of it when I was in the minority, and I have  been opposed to it when I was in the minority. So it all depends on the  circumstances.   I think maybe my Republican friends have trouble with nuance and  trying to understand the complexities of the system here. But I am  totally comfortable with my position, past, and present.   And by the way, if this same-day authority means that we can bring up  an assault weapons ban, I don't apologize to anybody. I don't apologize  to anybody. I think it is the right thing to do.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1000     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The gentleman said we should let the Senate do its work. Exactly. The  Senate Republicans are blocking the Senate from doing its work. What do  my friends not understand?  [[Page H7417]]    Veterans with cancer are depending on Republicans to get out of the  way so they can get the care that they, quite frankly, are entitled to,  that they deserve.   It passed overwhelmingly originally in the Senate. It passed  overwhelmingly in the House. But Senate Republicans are playing  politics with the lives of our veterans.   I am outraged by that. Maybe my friends on the other side are not,  but we ought to be demanding that they move immediately.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I don't think it is appropriate for my Republican  friends to lecture us on hypocrisy. The last time the Republicans were  in charge of this place, they ran it into the ground.   When Republicans were in charge, they broke the record for the most  closed Congress in the history of the United States of America.   When Republicans were in charge and our country was on the brink of a  shutdown, the Rules Committee, under Republican control, held an  emergency meeting. Do you know what that emergency meeting was on? Not  on emergency funding but on cheese, actually, as we were about to shut  the government down. We had a major crisis, and they did an emergency  meeting on cheese.   They couldn't even get their act together to keep the lights on. They  literally lost the majority because of how badly they ran this place,  and then they handed us a shutdown of government, the longest shutdown  in history, by the way. That cost American taxpayers $11 billion.   When Republicans were in charge, I voted to give them same-day  authority. I stood on this floor and urged my Democratic colleagues to  support the rule because I wanted to give us extra flexibility to do  the work the American people had asked us to do.   Republicans ran this place like a dictatorship, and then they tried  to turn our country into one on January 6, 2021, a day that will live  forever in history as a date that a twice-impeached ex-President and  Republicans tried to unconstitutionally overturn a free and fair  election and subvert the will of the American people in an attempted  coup.   So, please do not lecture us about Democratic process or any process  at all. Do not lecture us on hypocrisy.   I said last night in the Rules Committee what I hoped we would bring  forward today, and I still hope we will move forward on an assault  weapons ban.   Do you know why? Because people in this country are being massacred,  and they are tired of thoughts and prayers. They are tired of press  releases in which we say that our hearts are with the families of those  who were killed.   They want action. The question is whether or not we can deliver on  what the American people want.   Do you want to talk about outrage? I am outraged by the gun violence  in this country. I am outraged that an 18-year-old who can't legally  have a sip of beer can go into a gun store and buy an AR-15 and then go  out and kill people, massacre people. Enough of this.   This rule preserves the option, if we decide to move forward, to be  able to move forward. That is what this is all about. We can talk about  whatever you want to talk about, but the bottom line is that is what  this rule does.   We have an obligation to act with urgency. We have a responsibility  to address this crisis.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1300         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 8589) to prohibit the Securities and Exchange       Commission from finalizing the proposed rule titled ``The       Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related       Disclosures for Investors''. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Financial Services; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 8589.    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote. I yield back the  balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.    Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 1302 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1302         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1808) to       regulate assault weapons, to ensure that the right to keep       and bear arms is not unlimited, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary now printed in       the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 117-60,       modified by the amendment printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their respective       designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), pending which I  [[Page H7492]]  yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today the Rules Committee met and reported a rule,  House Resolution 1302, providing for consideration of H.R. 1808, the  Assault Weapons Ban of 2022, under a closed rule.   The rule self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Nadler. It  provides 1 hour of debate equally divided by the chair and ranking  member of the Committee on the Judiciary and provides one motion to  recommit.                                time  1400    Madam Speaker, we have a gun violence crisis in this country, 23  years after Columbine High School, 10 years after Sandy Hook Elementary  School, 4 years after Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and 2  months after Uvalde and Buffalo. The American people are tired of  living in fear. They are tired of thoughts and prayers. They are tired  of press releases offering sympathy but no solutions.   Last month, the decades-long logjam on passing commonsense gun safety  bills was broken. President Biden signed into law the bipartisan Safer  Communities Act to help keep guns out of the hands of criminals.   Why?   Because the American people want to see us act. For decades, that  hasn't happened. The gun lobby has had an iron grip on this place. But  now, finally, that is changing. It is changing because the American  people are demanding change, and it is time for all of us to listen.   We can and must do more, which is why, today, we are considering H.R.  1808, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2022.   Now, I want to be crystal clear for everyone who is watching.   This bill is not taking away anybody's guns.   This bill is not about taking away anybody's constitutional rights.  The Second Amendment gives Americans the right to own guns, but no  right is unconditional or unlimited.   You have the right to free speech, but you don't have the right to  shout ``fire'' in a crowded movie theater. You have the right to keep  and bear arms, but you don't have the right to own weapons being used  to mow people down indiscriminately.   Rights come with responsibilities, and we have a responsibility to  try and stop mass shootings.   As Members of Congress, we have a duty to weigh the rights of gun  owners with the very first right mentioned in the Declaration of  Independence: the right to live; the right to not get shot at school or  at a place of worship or at a concert.   It takes zero courage to hide behind the Second Amendment and not  debate the merits here.   You know what takes courage?   Standing up to the gun lobby, putting people over politics. That  takes courage, and that is what we are doing here today.   Rounds that come out of assault weapons are traveling up to four  times faster than out of a handgun. They are traveling at incredible  speed and inflict immense damage on people's bodies. When combined with  high-capacity magazines, they are designed to kill as many people as  possible, as quickly as possible.   Assault weapons do not belong on our streets, plain and simple.   An assault weapon was used in Las Vegas to kill 60 people.   An assault weapon was used at the Pulse Nightclub to kill 49 people.   An assault weapon was used at Sandy Hook to kill 26 people, including  20 children.   Assault weapons slaughter people. They decimate bodies. Physicians  say that an AR-15 can actually ``liquefy your organs'' because the  projectile is traveling so fast. This does not happen with a typical  handgun. This is something unique to assault weapons.   Sixty-seven percent of Americans, including half of all Republicans,  support a ban on assault weapons.   This is not a radical idea. We are not in uncharted territory. The  Government already bans automatic weapons.   Why?   Because they have no place in our communities.   You don't need an automatic weapon to defend yourself. What we are  proposing today is simply addressing another class of weapons that have  no place in our communities: assault weapons.   The 1994 assault weapons ban was associated with a 25 percent drop in  gun massacres and a 40 percent drop in fatalities. This should not be a  difficult vote. Let's come together and advance this commonsense  legislation that could save thousands of lives.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman talks about statistics.  Let's talk about statistics.   Thirty percent of shootings in recent history have involved guns that  were banned under the now-expired 1994 assault weapons ban.   Thirteen killed and 23 injured at Columbine High School in Littleton,  Colorado. The attackers used an assault weapon.   Twenty-seven killed and one injured at an elementary school in  Newtown, Connecticut. That was in December of 2012. The attacker used  an assault weapon.   Forty-nine killed and 53 injured at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando,  Florida, June 2016. The attacker used an assault weapon.   Fifty-eight killed and 887 injured at a country music festival in Las  Vegas in October of 2017. The attacker used an assault weapon.   Seventeen killed and 17 injured at a high school in Parkland,  Florida, in  [[Page H7493]]  February 2018. The alleged attacker used an assault weapon.   I could go on and on.

Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Ross), a distinguished member of the Committee  on Rules.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just respond to the gentlewoman by saying that the manager's  amendment adds language to make clear that devices used to make hunting  accessible to everyone, especially our disabled veterans, are not  affected by this legislation.   This provision also makes sure the gun industry cannot exploit  legitimate accessibility devices to make firearms especially deadly for  mass shooters as has occurred in the past when bump stocks were claimed  to be an accessibility accessory but used to inflict horrible mass  violence in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting that killed 60 and injured more  than 400 people.                                time  1415    And I say to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, I didn't use the words  ``weapon of war'' in my opening statement, and I certainly know the  difference between an automatic and a semiautomatic weapon, but if that  is the argument you want to have, bring that to the parents whose  children were lost in Uvalde, you know, who were mowed down by an AR- 15. As I pointed out in my opening statement, these weapons actually  decimate bodies. Physicians say that an AR-15 can actually liquify your  organs because the projectile is traveling so fast.   As the gentleman may recall, DNA samples had to be gathered from  those children who were murdered because their bodies were  unrecognizable. So, I mean, come on.   This is about saving lives.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just say something to my friend from Pennsylvania. You know,  maybe it is true that the military doesn't use AR-15s, but I will say  to the gentleman that mass shooters do. We saw what an AR-15 can do in  Uvalde. We saw what it can do in Buffalo.   I just remind people when you have these kind of debates that people  are watching. You know, the parents who lost their children in Uvalde,  they are watching. People who have lost ones to mass shootings all  around this country are watching. You know, to try to parse words over,  well, you know, it is not a military-style weapon or this or that or  whatever when we know what these weapons can do, that little children  had to be identified with DNA samples because their bodies were blown  apart.   You know, you want to talk about extreme positions? We just had a  Rules Committee meeting, and Mr. Massie testified before the Rules  Committee. You may recall the back and forth between him and Mr. Raskin  when Mr. Raskin essentially asked him whether or not machine guns  should be legal, and Mr. Massie responded by saying, well, I think  States should make that determination.   So that means that if a State wanted to make machine guns legal, it  is somehow okay? So you want to talk about extremism? We have seen what  extremism is all about from many of my friends on the other side of the  aisle, and we have seen the power of the gun lobby, the blood money  that has poured into campaigns that has resulted in people coming to  the floor and making these ridiculous arguments for us to do nothing.  So this is a moment when people have to stand up and be counted.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, very briefly. Maybe the gentleman hasn't  been paying attention to what has been going on around here, but this  bill actually had a hearing and a markup, 14 hours in the Committee on  the Judiciary.   Madam Speaker, the text has been available 72 hours in advance. The  manager's amendment was made available on Tuesday night. I don't know  what the heck he is talking about.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have great respect for my friend from  Pennsylvania and all of my colleagues on the Committee on Rules, and I  know they feel strongly about this issue. I believe that many of the  concerns that they have raised are unwarranted, and this bill deals  with many of them.   As has been said repeatedly, this is not about taking away anybody's  guns. It is dealing with the future. It is dealing with ways that we  can better protect the people of this country.   So, it is frustrating when we hear arguments about, ``Oh, you said  military-style. This, technically, isn't a military weapon,'' or we  have all these numbers that have been kind of manipulated and presented  as reasons for us to do nothing. I find that really disconcerting.  Maybe it is because so many people are dying. Maybe it is because so  many people are being murdered by these weapons.   The sheer number is incomprehensible. Maybe some of my colleagues  [[Page H7497]]  have lost the human ability to feel what that really means. I mean, I  have talked to parents, and I have talked to brothers and sisters, to  grandparents, who have lost loved ones in these massacres, who have  lost loved ones to assault weapons. I mean, it is painful.   We can do something to make it possible that fewer people are victims  of mass shootings, that fewer children die, that fewer churchgoers die,  fewer people shopping in the grocery store or going to a concert or  just minding their own business.    I mean, the gun violence in this country has reached epidemic  proportions. It is unbelievable.   The American people are sick and tired of being scared. I mean, when  my own kids go to the movies, I worry about them. I am worried that  there might be somebody with an AR-15 that will be in that movie  theater, or if they go to a concert. I think my anxiety is similar to  the anxiety of most parents when their kids go out. This doesn't have  to be.   All I am pleading with my colleagues to do is to think long and hard  on how they vote on this.   Madam Speaker, we should all be sick to our stomachs about what is  happening. The idea that somehow we can't do anything about it I don't  think anybody buys.   I get it. The gun lobby plays a big role with many of my friends on  the other side of the aisle. Follow the money; you will see what I am  talking about. I don't want you to do anything, but I am pleading with  my colleagues, especially on the Republican side of the aisle. I mean,  this is the right thing to do.   The previous assault weapons ban had an impact. Unfortunately, it was  left to expire. I mean, we need to pass this. This is the right thing  to do. Talk to the families. Talk to those who lost loved ones in one  of these massacres.   As I said, to defend AR-15s that can destroy the bodies of people--I  remind you that the children in Uvalde, many of them had to be  identified by DNA.   I mean, at some point, we have to say enough is enough. At some  point, we have to turn our words into action.   Madam Speaker, I am hoping and praying that this is the day. I urge  all of my colleagues to vote for the rule and vote for the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1302         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 471) to prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human       Services from lessening the stringency of, and to prohibit       the Secretary of Homeland Security from ceasing or lessening       implementation of, the COVID-19 border health provisions       through the end of the COV1D-19 pandemic, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 471.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
