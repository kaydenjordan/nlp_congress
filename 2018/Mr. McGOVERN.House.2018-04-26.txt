 Mr. Speaker, last week after turning their backs on  bipartisanship, Republicans on the Agriculture Committee advanced a  highly partisan farm bill that hurts our most vulnerable constituents.  The farm bill cuts the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known  as SNAP, by over $23 billion. It eliminates State flexibility. It  erects new barriers to assessing the program and creates a massive new  untested and underfunded bureaucracy.   Most troubling, the bill reduces or eliminates benefits for nearly 2  million kids, veterans, working families, and other vulnerable adults.  The bill was drafted in secret and is not reflective of the 23 hearings  that our committee held on SNAP over the past 2\1/2\ years. In fact, I  am having a difficult time determining where some of these  controversial provisions originated.   Were they cooked up at some far-rightwing think tank? Did they come  from some outlier in the Trump administration? Were they the creation  of Speaker Ryan, who is desperate to pass his extreme welfare reform  agenda before he retires at the end of this Congress? This secretive,  closed process has left me with more questions than I have answers, Mr.  Speaker. It is awful. And it is not the way the people's House should  operate. It is not fair to our constituents.   Mr. Speaker, last week I came to the House floor and outlined some of  the most troubling provisions Chairman Conaway and House Republicans  insisted on including in this bill. Today I would like to take a few  minutes to share with my colleagues who will be harmed if this reckless  proposal is allowed to advance.   Provisions in the Republican farm bill specifically target millions  of older adults, over the age of 50, who rely on SNAP to put food on  the table when times are tough. While SNAP law already includes strict  work requirements and time limits, House Republicans are now seeking to  completely cut off assistance for people who are unable to find work or  a suitable job training program, and they are doing this without a  serious plan that would actually help them find work. It is a rotten  thing to do.   To make matters worse, Republicans are extending these mandatory work  requirements to people up to the age of 60. The AARP, our country's  leading voice for those over 50, has cautioned Chairman Conaway and  Republicans in Congress that it is particularly difficult for  individuals over 50 to find  [[Page H3580]]  consistent work. In a letter to our committee, AARP's senior vice  president for government affairs, Joyce Rogers, said this bill could  ``increase food insecurity and likely have negative consequences on  health.''   Mr. Speaker, this damaging mandatory work proposal does not just  impact older Americans; it extends to other groups as well. For  example, under this bill, thousands of veterans would lose access to  SNAP benefits if they can't find work or a job training program.  Veterans, Mr. Speaker, men and women who have put their lives on the  line for us. The least we could do--the very least--is ensure that they  have access to modest food benefits when they fall upon hard times.   Among the other vulnerable adults who will be subjected to mandatory  work requirements are teenagers just aging out of foster care, people  with underlying mental health issues, chronically homeless individuals,  and ex-offenders with nowhere else to turn. Are these the people we  want to be turning our backs on, Mr. Speaker? Their lives are already  challenging. This Republican Congress should not be making it more  difficult for them to survive.   Other provisions in this terrible bill target working families with  kids. The bill eliminates an important provision that provides States  with the flexibility to raise income cutoffs and ease asset limits.  Taking away this State option cuts 400,000 eligible households--900,000  adults and kids--off of SNAP and takes free school meals away from  265,000 kids.   Sadly, this bill also limits access to benefits for people with  disabilities. It imposes new paperwork requirements on SNAP recipients  with out-of-pocket utility costs, placing more burdens on those living  with disabilities. While there appear to be some exceptions to the  burdensome work requirements I noted earlier for people with  disabilities, many others who may not meet the statutory definition,  who have not yet been identified, would be cut off of assistance.   That is why the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities sent our  committee a letter strongly opposing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letters from AARP and the  Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities.                                        AARP Real Possibilities,                                     Washington, DC, April 17, 2018.      Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, House of Representatives, Committee on Agriculture,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Collin C. Peterson,      Ranking Member, House of Representatives, Committee on           Agriculture, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway & Ranking Member Peterson: On behalf       of our members and all Americans age 50 and older, I am       writing to urge you to modify H.R. 2, the Agriculture and       Nutrition Act of 2018, to avoid the negative impact the       current bill would have on the millions of Americans,       including older Americans, who rely on the Supplementation       Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). AARP, with its nearly 38       million members in all 50 states, the District of Columbia,       and the U.S. territories, is a nonpartisan, nonprofit,       nationwide organization that strengthens communities and       fights for the issues that matter most to families such as       health care, employment and income security, retirement       planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial       abuse.        The changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance       Program (SNAP) included in H.R. 2 will put at risk the       critical food and nutrition assistance for 43 million       Americans who depend on this program. In 2016, 8.7 million       SNAP households had at least one adult age 50 or older. As we       stated in a letter sent to the Chairman and Ranking Member of       the Committee on April 10, 2018, the Supplemental Nutrition       Assistance Program (SNAP) is a critical part of the safety       net available to low-income families, including many older       Americans and people with disabilities. It has been shown       that participating in SNAP can lead to improvements in a       household's food security status, especially for those with       very low food security.        Categorical eligibility is essential to improving access to       SNAP for low-income Americans of all ages and must be       protected, as was done in the last farm bill. Categorical       eligibility advances the goals of simplifying administration,       easing entry to the program for eligible households,       emphasizing coordination among low-income assistance       programs, and reducing the potential for errors in       establishing eligibility for benefits. Individuals who have       already undergone determinations for programs such as       Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TAN F) and       Supplemental Security Income (SSI) bypass the income and       resource tests and have their SNAP benefits approved. This       streamlined process leads to individuals receiving their SNAP       benefits faster and reduces the number of individuals who may       be facing hunger.        Most individuals who receive SNAP benefits and are required       to work already do work. Unfortunately, those individuals who       are not working are likely to have chronic health conditions,       which prevent them from holding employment. Over 1.7 million       low-income older workers have a health difficulty. Expanding       work requirements for SNAP would be especially burdensome for       older workers ages 50-59. Workers ages 50 and older typically       take longer than younger workers to find employment after       being unemployed. Denying individual's access to SNAP       benefits for up to three years for not being able to comply       with tougher work requirements could increase food insecurity       and likely have negative consequences on health. One recent       study showed how healthcare and food insecurity causes are       inexorably linked, finding the risk for hospital admissions       for low blood sugar spike 27 percent in the last week of the       month as compared to the first week of the month when food       and SNAP budgets of low-income populations have often been       exhausted.        We urge you, as this bill heads into mark-up, to protect       the critical assistance that SNAP provides and preserve the       program's ability to carry out its important mission in       providing nutrition to America's vulnerable populations. We       ask you to work in a bipartisan manner, bringing all       perspectives to the table, and prioritizing the needs of the       individuals being served. If you have any questions, please       feel free to reach out to me.            Sincerely,                                                   Joyce A. Rogers,      Senior Vice President, Government Affairs.                                   ____                                             Consortium for Citizens                                               with Disabilities,                                     Washington, DC, April 17, 2018.      Re H.R. 2, Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (Farm Bill)       Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, House Committee on Agriculture, Washington, DC.      Hon. Collin C. Peterson,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Agriculture, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway and Ranking Member Peterson: On       behalf of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD)       Poverty Ad Hoc Task Force, we urge you to continue the       longstanding bipartisan commitment to protect and strengthen       the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by       rejecting proposals to restrict eligibility, reduce benefits,       cap or reduce funding, or make harmful structural changes to       SNAP in the Farm Bill.        CCD is the largest coalition of national organizations       working together to advocate for federal public policy that       ensures the self-determination, independence, empowerment,       integration and inclusion of children and adults with       disabilities in all aspects of society.        In the United States, all too often food insecurity and       disability go together. Families that include people with       disabilities are two to three more likely to experience food       insecurity than families that have no members with       disabilities. Similarly, people experiencing food insecurity       have increased likelihood of chronic illness and disability.        SNAP is vitally important for people with disabilities and       their families. By increasing access to adequate, nutritious       food SNAP plays a key role in reducing hunger and helping       people with disabilities to maximize their health and       participate in their communities.        Using an inclusive definition of ``disability,'' in 2015 an       estimated 11 million people with disabilities of all ages       received SNAP, representing roughly one in four SNAP       participants.        Roughly 4.4 million households with non-elderly adults with       disabilities received SNAP in 2016.        Non-elderly adults with disabilities who receive SNAP have       very low incomes, averaging only about $12,000 per year in       2016.        SNAP benefits are extremely modest, averaging $187 per       month for non-elderly people with disabilities in 2016--or       just $6 per day.        Existing SNAP time limits are harsh, unfair, and harm many       people with disabilities and their families by cutting off       essential food assistance. Federal law currently limits SNAP       eligibility for adults between the ages of 18 to 49 without       dependents to just three months out of every three years--      unless they can engage in work or job training activities at       least half time, or qualify for an exemption. These       provisions cut off food assistance at a time when people need       it most and do not result in increased employment and       earnings. At least 500,000 low-income individuals nationwide       lost SNAP in 2016 due to this time limit.        Many people with disabilities are already hurt by SNAP time       limits, despite existing exemptions for people who receive       governmental or private benefits on the basis of a disability       or are able to document that they are ``physically or       mentally unfit for employment.'' For example, in a study of       SNAP participants subject to time limits referred to       participate in work activities in Franklin County, Ohio, one-      third reported a ``physical or mental limitation''.        Cutting off food assistance from SNAP would only make it       harder for people to work and increase their economic self-      sufficiency. We strongly oppose any action that  [[Page H3581]]       would cut off or reduce SNAP benefits, narrow eligibility, or       force more people to navigate harsh and unnecessary program       rules, including people with disabilities and their families.        In particular, we are concerned that the draft Farm Bill       released last week includes a number of provisions that would       harm people with disabilities and their families. Small       increases in the proposed bill are insufficient to make up       for significant benefit reductions.        New work requirements with highly punitive rules would cut       off SNAP benefits for many people--including in families with       children, adults, and seniors with disabilities. It may seem       simple to assert that ``people with disabilities will be       exempt,'' but converting such a statement into an effective       policy process is complicated, expensive, and fundamentally       flawed. Many people with disabilities receive SNAP, but do       not meet SNAP's statutory definitions of ``disability'' or       have not been so identified. Under SNAP, states have no       obligation to help people prove they are exempt, even if they       have difficulty obtaining the necessary records or       verification from a doctor. In addition, states are under no       obligation to ensure that people with disabilities have       access to the full array of services they might need to       work--such as accessible transportation, supported       employment, and personal care aid services. People with       disabilities often want to work, but need additional supports       and services to obtain and keep jobs, in addition to facing       discrimination and misconceptions about their ability to       work.        Underfunded work programs would be woefully inadequate to       meet training needs. Proposed new investments in SNAP       employment and training programs--funded in large part by       benefit cuts--amount to only about $30 per person per month.       This amount would be grossly insufficient to provide adequate       employment services for people subject to proposed new work       requirements, including jobseekers with disabilities.        New reporting requirements would create major hurdles to       benefits. Proposed new reporting requirements related to       eligibility, employment and training, and time limits would       be extremely difficult for many people with disabilities to       navigate and comply with. For example, ending a decades-old       simplification measure and instead requiring people to share       utility bills with the SNAP office--or else, see their       benefits reduced--is harsh, unnecessary, and burdensome both       for SNAP participants and states.        If Congress wishes to explore meaningful opportunities for       SNAP participants to increase self-sufficiency through       employment, we recommend awaiting the results of the       Employment & Training pilot projects authorized under the       2014 Farm Bill. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)       awarded pilot grants in 2015, all 10 state programs are       operational, and evaluation activities will operate through       2021. Already, a number of pilot states have cited multiple       barriers faced by participants, including ``health issues.''       It will be important for USDA and the evaluators to carefully       explore the experiences and outcomes of people with       disabilities and their families in these pilot programs.       Congress should await the final pilot evaluations before       considering any changes in these areas.        We call on you to reconsider proposals that would weaken       SNAP's effectiveness as our nation's foremost anti-hunger       program by limiting access, reducing benefits, and creating       administrative hurdles. We urge all Members to vote no on the       draft Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 released last       week, and instead to work on a bipartisan basis to strengthen       and protect SNAP as part of the Farm Bill.            Sincerely,      CCD Poverty Ad Hoc Task Force Co-Chairs:      Lisa Ekman,        National Organization of Social Security Claimants'       Representatives.      Chris Rodriguez,        National Disability Institute.      T.J. Sutcliffe,        The Arc of the United States.     Mr. Speaker, I could spend hours pointing out the bad  provisions in this bill, but I'll close by once again urging this  Republican leadership to stop their attacks on those living in poverty.  Pull this bill. Pull this awful bill.   Let's work together to craft a bipartisan farm bill that supports our  farmers and our nutrition programs. Let's advance a bill that we can  all be proud of. Negotiate a bipartisan bill. Stop insisting on this  $23 billion cut to SNAP benefits. Let's pass a good farm bill, not this  partisan nightmare.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Republican leadership in this Congress to  join with us to end hunger now. Stop trying to make hunger worse. Let's  join together and end hunger now. It is our moral imperative.                            ____________________
