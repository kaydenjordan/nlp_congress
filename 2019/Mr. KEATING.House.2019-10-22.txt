 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and chairman for  yielding.   Georgia has a long and rich history as an important U.S. partner and  a key player in the region. Unfortunately, Georgia most dramatically  came onto  [[Page H8362]]  the world stage with news in 2008 that Russia had invaded and occupied  regions within its territory. Since that time, Russia has continued to  illegally occupy the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.   Today, Georgia stands on the front lines of Russian aggression, along  with Ukraine, and it is imperative that the United States assist  Georgia in its effort to stand up against Russia--to address the  humanitarian concerns in those areas, to fight against Russian  disinformation, and to keep moving Georgia towards its goal of a strong  and sovereign democracy.   I am proud that we are here today to continue to support the  development of democratic values as well as the sovereignty,  independence, and territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia.                                time  1715    Georgia is a strong partner and friend to the United States, and I am  proud that we are showing our support by moving this legislation  forward today. I urge my colleagues to support the Georgia Support Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Nearly 10 months ago on December 28, 2018, the Government of the  Russian Federation arrested U.S. citizen Paul Whelan. In those 10  months, the Russian Government has refused to provide any evidence to  substantiate the espionage charges against Paul.   Instead, in those 10 months, the Russian Government has subjected  Paul to physical and psychological pressure. In those 10 months, the  Russian Government has repeatedly prevented Paul from speaking freely  with the U.S. embassy or with his family; rights that are afforded to  Russian prisoners here in the U.S.   In those 10 months, the Russian Government has denied Paul's request  to be examined or treated by a private physician. And I say, Russian  Government. I say government, because I believe the Russian people,  particularly those that are speaking up and demonstrating for an open  and democratic government there, they would be standing with us today.                                time  1730    For 10 months, the Russian Government has refused to respond to the  concerns of the Governments of the United States, U.K., Canada, and  Ireland.   For 10 months, Paul's continued detention has caused indescribable  pain and torment not only for Paul but for his parents, his two  brothers, and his sisters.   Ten months of injustice is 10 months too long.   In our committee, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we look for areas  of common ground to work with Russia, but actions like this, depriving  a U.S. citizen of the most basic rights, makes that all the more  difficult.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Paul, on behalf of his family, I hope all  Members will join me in supporting H. Res. 552 and calling on the  Government of Russia to allow a fair and transparent judicial process  without delay, facilitate Paul's medical care, and allow for  unrestricted visits with the U.S. Embassy.   Mr. Speaker, above all, I hope Members will all join with me in  calling on the Government of Russia to release Paul and send him back  home to his family.  [[Page H8364]]
