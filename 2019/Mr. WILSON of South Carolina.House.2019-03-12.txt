 Madam Speaker, in honor of National  Vending Day, it is appropriate to celebrate the millions of Americans  who get beverages, snacks, and unlimited items from vending machines.   Crane Merchandising Systems of Williston, South Carolina, managed by  Rich Tucker, is a leading full-service vending solutions provider and  employs over 700 associates. Crane is one of the largest employers of  the Barnwell County region, and I am grateful for their success  creating jobs.   The automatic merchandising industry in America promotes an economic  impact of nearly $25 billion with 150,000 employees. Not only does the  industry meet the needs of consumers around the world, it also  contributes $7.21 billion in wages to the economy and pays $3.5 billion  in taxes.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
