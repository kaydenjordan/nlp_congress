 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland for giving me this  opportunity to present the right way to help historically Black  colleges and universities, and I intend to do that when he is finished  speaking about this and explain what we can do together.   Unfortunately, the bill he proposes is a shortcut the House took,  which has no way to pass the Senate. It is based upon a budget gimmick  and uses a method of funding that many Senators object to. It creates a  new funding cliff within 23 months, and it is unnecessary because the  Secretary of Education has written all of the heads of historically  Black colleges and universities to say that there are sufficient funds  until next September so there is no funding problem.   This gives me an opportunity--which I will do in a just a moment--to  suggest the right way to do it. The right way to do it is to do  permanent funding of historically Black colleges and universities in a  package of bills I have introduced. That package includes other  legislation--which I will discuss when my time comes--which include  simplifying the FAFSA.   It is a bill Senator Jones and I have introduced which will help 20  million families, including almost every student at a historically  Black college or minority-serving institution. The bill package also  includes grants for prisoners and short-term Pell grants, and it  simplifies the student aid letters.   This package is ready. It includes short-term Pell grants, as I  mentioned. This package has been put together by a number of Democratic  and Republican Senators. It is ready to pass the Senate and ready for  the President to sign it. It permanently funds Black colleges and  universities instead of this shortcut.   In a moment, I will talk more about that, but in the meantime, I  object.    Mr. President, why would we hold hostage bipartisan  legislation that would simplify the FAFSA from 108 questions to 18 to  30--the Federal aid that 20 million families fill out every year in  this country--unnecessarily? Why are we holding that hostage? Why are  we holding hostage the legislation introduced by Senator Portman and  Senator Kaine and cosponsored by Cardin, Gillibrand, Hassan, Klobuchar,  Stabenow, Baldwin, Brown--these are all Democrats--here is a  Republican, Capito, Coons, Ernst, Jones, Moran, Shaheen, Sinema, Smith,  Wicker, and Braun.   This is legislation we all agree on--or at least that many agree on-- on short-term Pell grants. Then we have Senators Grassley, Smith,  Cassidy, Ernst, Hassan, Jones, Klobuchar, Manchin, and Rubio, who would  like to simplify the Federal aid letters so you don't get a letter in  the mail, if you are living in Maryland or Tennessee, and think you  have a grant you don't have to pay back, when in fact it is a loan you  do have to pay back.   We also agree on increasing the maximum Pell grant. We also agree on  how to pay for it. We also agree on permanent funding for the  historically Black colleges and institutions in a way that the Budget  Committee can easily approve, and it can pass the Senate.   If we can agree on all that and it all helps students at historically  Black colleges and minority-serving institutions, then why don't we  pass it? Why don't we do that? Why do we come up with a short-term,  gimmick-supported, House-passed bill that sets up a new cliff? Why  don't we take a permanent funding, with a Budget Committee-approved way  of paying for it, and do some other things that we have been working on  for 5 years in a bipartisan way? This is not an Alexander proposal.  This is a package of proposals by 29 Senators--17 Democrats and 12  Republicans. It is ready to pass the Senate; it is ready to be worked  on with the House of Representatives; and it is ready to be signed by  the President of the United States.   Let me add to this. The Secretary of Education, and people seem to  ignore this, has written all the presidents of the historically Black  colleges and said there is enough money in the bank to pay for all  their funding until next September. So we have nearly a year to do this  the right way instead of the wrong way. We are not on vacation. I know  everybody is talking about impeachment, but we have lots of students  around this country who would like to have a simpler way to go to  college. We have lots of historically Black institutions and minority- serving institutions that would like to have a permanent method of  funding. We have lots of employers and potential employees who want a  short-term Pell grant.   Simplifying FAFSA would actually add, according to the Congressional  Budget Office, 250,000 Pell grants, and it would increase the number of  Americans who are eligible for the maximum Pell grant. All that is  ready to go. All that is ready to go so why don't we do that instead?   I thank the Senator from Maryland for giving me an opportunity and a  reason to bring up my package of bills with permanent funding of the  historically Black colleges and universities paid for, not by a  gimmick, but by a Budget Committee-approved method that President Trump  and President Obama both had in their budgets.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2557    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from further consideration  of S. 2557--that is my bill--and that the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration. I ask unanimous consent that the bill  providing permanent funding for historically Black colleges and  universities and other matters be considered read a third time and  passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Mr. President, we have been working for 5 years, for  example, on simplifying the Federal aid form that students fill out to  go to college--5 years. We have bipartisan support for it in the Senate  and in the House. We have families who, in my State, will be  discouraged from going to college because of this complex form.   Why don't we pass it? It is important to fund historically Black  colleges; that is true. They have funding for another year. So why  don't we add to that the simplifying of the FAFSA form, which, I would  imagine, 95 percent of the students in historically Black colleges have  to fill out every year? In addition to that, they have this  verification process that they go through during which somebody catches  them telling the IRS one thing and the Department of Education another  so that they jerk their aid. They think that is important.  [[Page S6371]]    I have the president of a community college in Memphis who tells me  he loses 1,500 students a year because of the burdensome nature of the  application.   Former Governor Bill Haslam, of Tennessee--our State--has the highest  percentage of students who fill out the FAFSA, which is the Federal aid  form for grants and loans. He says the single biggest impediment toward  there being free tuition for 2 years of college in our State is the  complex FAFSA.   I don't think it is unreasonable to say, while we help students at  historically Black colleges, that we help those same students by  simplifying their FAFSAs. Why don't we give them the short-term Pell  grant that Senator Kaine and Senator Portman and a dozen other  Senators, including the Senator from Maryland, have introduced? Why  don't we increase the size of the Pell grant in a way that we agree in  a bipartisan way?   In other words, we don't have to discuss something until we find  something we can't agree on. Why don't we take the things we do agree  on, which are considered in the package that the Senator just objected  to, and pass them?   There are 29 Senators--more Democrats than Republicans--who have  formed these bills. If we can add to that other pieces of legislation,  let's do it. Yet let's take the permanent funding for historically  Black colleges--the simplification of the FAFSA, the short-term Pell  grants, and the Pell grants for prisoners--and pass that.   As I said, we are not on vacation. We should be able to do this in  the next few weeks or in the next few months. I mean, how long does it  take just to pass something we already agree on? It shouldn't take us  very long.   I am disappointed that the Senator has objected. I hope to keep  coming to the floor and asking for the Senate to approve it. More  importantly, I hope to keep working with the distinguished Senator from  Washington State on our Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions. We have often been able to work these matters out even when  they are contentious and offered to the Senate a bipartisan package. I  hope we can do that.   I yield the floor.
