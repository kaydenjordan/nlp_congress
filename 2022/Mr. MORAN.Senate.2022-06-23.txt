 Mr. President, I would like to recognize Dale W.  Moore for dedicating more than 40 years of his professional life to  being a champion for agriculture in the public and private sector.   For the past 10 years, Dale has served farmers and ranchers as a  leader at the American Farm Bureau Federation, first as executive  director, public policy, then vice president, public affairs, and  finally spending the past 4 years of his career serving as the  executive vice president.   Dale served as chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Agriculture  under four Secretaries of Agriculture, served as legislative director  for the House Agriculture Committee, and as a legislative assistant for  then-Representative Pat Roberts, who represented the ``Big First''  district of Kansas.   Dale's Kansas roots run deep. He is a native of Copeland, KS, with a  population of approximately 250 people. Dale grew up on a livestock,  hay, and grain farm, where he learned firsthand the intricacies of  agriculture, the value of hard work, and fostered an appreciation of  rural America that he carried with him throughout his entire career.   Dale received a bachelor of science in animal science and biology  from Fort Hays State University, located in Hays, KS, where he  participated in activities such as Rodeo Club, Block and Bridle Club,  and Delta Tau Alpha.   In all of his roles throughout his illustrious career, Dale earned a  reputation that continues with him today as a mentor, problem solver,  counselor, and storyteller whose commitment sets a shining example for  policymakers across the political spectrum. Dale has not only been an  advocate for farmers and ranchers, but has contributed to the strength  of American farm and ranch families, serving as a trusted friend and  advisor to many.   On behalf of this body, the U.S. Senate, it my honor to recognize and  thank Dale W. Moore for his dedication to agriculture and service to  the American Farm Bureau Federation, U.S. Department of Agriculture,  and Congress and to congratulate him on his retirement.                            ____________________
