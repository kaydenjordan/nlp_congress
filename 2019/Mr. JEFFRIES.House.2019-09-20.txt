 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and distinguished  gentleman from Georgia for his tremendous leadership.   Women have a right not to be sexually harassed; people of color have  a right not to be discriminated against; workers have a right not to be  exploited; consumers have a right not to be defrauded; and the American  people have a right to liberty and justice for all. Unfortunately, the  malignant practice of forced arbitration takes these rights away.   The American people are being hoodwinked, bamboozled, and led astray.  The practice of forced arbitration effectively makes rights available  without a remedy. This practice is unconscionable, unacceptable, and  un-American.   Vote ``yes'' on the FAIR Act so we can end this practice of forced  arbitration once and for all.
