 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my  support for the Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act, which I  was proud to reintroduce earlier this afternoon with Senators Smith,  Gillibrand and Merkley, and Congressman Deutch--who introduced the bill  in the House.   Social Security serves as a critical lifeline for millions of  individuals and families in Hawaii and throughout the United States.  For seniors, the program is fundamental to retirement security, and for  families, it provides economic security. Countless individuals rely on  Social Security as a key source of income, so we must continue fighting  to protect the program and make sure beneficiaries receive the hard- earned benefits they deserve. The Protecting and Preserving Social  Security Act does two things.   First, the bill restores fairness in Social Security payroll taxes by  eliminating the contribution cap on taxable income--gradually, over  seven years.   What does this mean? Currently, most Americans contribute 6.2 percent  of their incomes toward Social Security payroll taxes. However, because  of the contribution cap on taxable income, higher income earners will  stop contributing to Social Security after their first $132,900 of  income for 2019. This means that many working and middle class families  will contribute more of their income toward Social Security, while  wealthy families will contribute less.   In fact, for the highest income earners, those in the ``top 1  percent'', this week marks the point in the year when they will stop  contributing to the program altogether for 2019. That does not seem  fair, so our bill makes sure that everyone contributes their fair share  to Social Security for the entire year, and that the wealthiest  individuals and families in our country do not receive a tax break at  the expense of working and middle class families.   Second, the bill provides an updated measure of inflation to reflect  what seniors and other beneficiaries actually pay for things like  medical care, prescription drugs, and energy costs, and increases their  benefits based on this measure. The Social Security Administration has  indicated that these changes, taken together, would increase Social  Security benefits and extend the life of the combined Social Security  trust fund by another 19 years--from 2034 to 2053.   These are modest but important steps that we can take to improve the  program for current and future beneficiaries.   Locally in Hawaii, we recognize that whatever hurts the most  vulnerable in our communities, hurts all of us. We each have a role to  play in supporting our communities. That is why my colleagues and I  have reintroduced this legislation to strengthen Social Security. We  will continue fighting for working and middle class families who rely  on Social Security and similar programs, and we will continue to oppose  cuts to Social Security--which would be devastating for millions of  Americans. We will continue fighting to make sure everyone contributes  their fair share so that Social Security can deliver on its promise to  the American people.   I thank my colleagues for joining me in reintroducing this important  legislation as we continue our work to strengthen Social Security. I  yield the floor.

[[Page S2390]]                                ____________________    Mr. President, time and again over the past 2 years, we  have seen a clear pattern in the types of people Donald Trump nominates  to serve in his Cabinet.   They have extensive conflicts of interest. If confirmed, they work to  advance the interest of former clients and special interests, and in  doing so, they are often hostile to the very mission of the very  Department they have been nominated to lead.   We have seen this time and again with the same disastrous results-- from Scott Pruitt at the Environmental Protection Agency and Ryan Zinke  at the Department of Interior to Andy Puzder at the Department of Labor  and Tom Price at Health and Human Services.   Today, the majority leader and Senate Republicans are forcing through  the nomination of David Bernhardt to serve as Secretary of the  Interior--another person who fits Trump's pattern for conflicted,  unethical Cabinet nominees.   Bernhardt brings so many conflicts of interest to the job that he has  to carry a list around in his pocket to remind himself of what they  are. I am putting up this graphic poster that shows a card he carries  around in his pocket to remind himself of the people he is not supposed  to be interacting with or helping.   In normal times, a President would not nominate someone with David  Bernhardt's background as a superlobbyist who represented interests  before the Department he was nominated to lead. In normal times, the  majority party would push back against a nominee who brings so many  obvious conflicts of interest to the job. But these are not normal  times, and the Senate is moving in an all-fired rush to confirm someone  who shouldn't have been nominated in the first place.   During his tenure as Deputy Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Bernhardt  was well-placed to deliver results for the special interests who paid  his firm millions of dollars to lobby on their behalf over the past  decade.   Mr. Bernhardt, for example, spent years lobbying on behalf of an  organization with a misleading name--the Center for Environmental  Science, Accuracy & Reliability, or CESAR. Far from being a nonpartisan  group, CESAR is an industry front group dedicated to, among other  things, attacking and weakening the Endangered Species Act, the ESA.   As a lobbyist at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, Bernhardt  spearheaded CESAR's efforts to gut the ESA through a disingenuous shell  campaign to list the American eel as a threatened or endangered  species.   Here is what they did. First, CESAR petitioned the Fish and Wildlife  Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to designate the American  eel--a species whose habitat spans the entire east coast of the United  States--as a threatened or endangered species. These Agencies are  required to complete their review of such a position within 90 days.  Both Agencies were unable to complete their review on such a short  timeline, and CESAR filed a lawsuit in DC District Court.   CESAR did not undertake this campaign with the objective of  protecting a threatened or endangered species. Instead, as an E&E News  report made clear, CESAR tried to undermine the law by making it nearly  impossible to enforce.   Why was this the case? Because the American eel has habitat all along  the eastern seaboard and to make a listing and to conduct critical  habitat designations would be a paralyzing undertaking that might force  Congress to undergo a rewrite of the ESA.   Mr. Bernhardt did not just represent CESAR, but he has also served on  their board for many years. It was reasonable to conclude, therefore,  that his sustained personal advocacy on behalf of his client to  undermine the ESA would carry over to his work at the Department of the  Interior, and, indeed, it has.   Last summer, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and  [[Page S2398]]  Wildlife Service proposed some of the most drastic changes to the ESA  in 30 years. These changes include allowing economic estimates during  the listing process, changing the definition of ``foreseeable future''  to not allow for the consideration of climate change when determining  whether to list a species and removing a blanket rule that protects  threatened species.   It certainly doesn't seem like a coincidence that the Department is  considering such radical changes to the ESA under the leadership of Mr.  Bernhardt--someone who was paid by his clients to challenge it.   Over the past few weeks, we have also learned from reporting in the  New York Times about Mr. Bernhardt's efforts to suppress a Fish and  Wildlife Service report on the impacts of certain pesticides on  endangered species. This report was due to be released more than 1\1/2\  years ago, and despite documents indicating that the Department had  completed the report on time, it has yet to be released.   Last week, I, along with several of my colleagues, sent a letter to  the Department's deputy inspector general, requesting that she open an  investigation into these allegations. Based on Mr. Bernhardt's industry  priorities and past attempts to weaken the ESA, I think it is prudent  that we get to the bottom of what is going on at the Department before  confirming him.   If the Department of the Interior's mission is to ``provide  scientific and other information about natural resources,'' then isn't  it Mr. Bernhardt's job to ensure that scientific reports on the impacts  of chemicals on endangered species are released in a timely manner,  especially knowing that these species are threatened or endangered? Yet  this report has been kept back for over 1 year.   Unfortunately, I don't think he considers that a priority of his job.  Instead, he seems to prioritize moving the levers within the Department  that he was unsuccessful in moving while representing his clients as a  lobbyist.   This pattern of activity also extends to his former clients in the  oil and gas industry. During the government shutdown, for example, Mr.  Bernhardt recalled furloughed DOI employees in order to have them  process and approve 267 offshore oil drilling permits and 16 leases for  drilling on public land. His decisive action on behalf of oil and gas  interests came as thousands of employees went without pay and critical  Federal services were shuttered for over 1 month.   Is it really any wonder that executives from the Independent  Petroleum Association of America were caught on tape bragging about the  unprecedented access they have to Mr. Bernhardt at the Department?   The American people deserve an Interior Secretary devoted to the  mission of the Department, not the narrow special interests of his  former lobbyist clients.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination and await the IG  report before voting on this nomination.   One would hope that with all of these conflicts he has to carry  around in his pocket, surely we can come up with someone to lead this  Department who actually has the mission of the Department as his  calling. That is not the case with Mr. Bernhardt.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
