 Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Strengthening  American Communities (SAC) Act of 2019. My bill seeks to expand access  to debt-free public service career pathways for Americans who want to  serve their communities, States, or our Nation. No one should be denied  the opportunity to serve their community as a law enforcement officer,  public health practitioner, social worker, or educator based on his or  her ability to afford the rising cost of an undergraduate education. As  Congress moves towards reauthorizing the Higher Education Act this  year, I intend for my bill to be a first step towards correcting public  sector workforce disparities by enabling people to serve their  communities without being hobbled by massive student loan debt, and by  providing current public servants with the financial freedom to  continue to heed their calling to service.   Every city, town, and rural community in the United States relies on  individuals who choose to utilize their talents for the betterment of  others while accepting the lower pay of public service careers. The  very foundation of our civil society is based on these public servants  making such sacrifices. Far too many individuals who feel drawn to  public service do not pursue such careers--or they are forced to  abandon such careers prematurely--due to the high cost of obtaining  their college educations. When I had the opportunity to hear directly  from a student at an Historically Black College and University (HBCU)  in my home State of Maryland, I was saddened to hear from an  academically successful sophomore who was planning to drop out of  school because she feared further indebting herself and her family. She  said that while she appreciated the financial assistance she did  receive, it simply wasn't sufficient to cover her cost of attendance.  While this student had aspirations to serve in her own community, she  could not bear to burden her family with the cost of her education. As  a result, my home City of Baltimore missed out on the talents of an  engaged and aspiring public servant.   Our current system of indebting individuals at the onset of their  careers has led to minority underrepresentation in the public sector  workforce. First generation college students and students from low- income families cannot afford to take on student loan debt and enter  into lower-paying public service careers. As a result, our Nation is  deprived of the talents and perspectives of individuals who want to  serve their communities but simply cannot afford to do so. As a result,  our workforce is less representative of the people it serves. We must  find new ways for people to earn the degrees they need to meet our  community needs. I believe that students who make a commitment to  public service should be afforded a debt-free pathway to the  baccalaureate degree they need to start their public service career  just as those individuals who have already made the decision to choose  service over salary should not have to wait for ten years in a lower- paying public service career before seeing any reward in the form of  federal student loan forgiveness.   The Strengthening American Communities Act I am introducing today  offers a new path for future public servants to earn their  baccalaureate degree. Through a new partnership between the Federal  Government, States, and public and private, non-profit institutions of  higher education, students will have the ability to receive the first  two years of their education at a community college, Minority Serving  Institution, or Historically Black College or University tuition- and  fee-free. Colleges would be required to commit to ensuring student  success, and students would have to meet certain academic standards and  complete their education within two years. Once students start their  junior or senior years or transfer into a four-year institution, those  who commit themselves to at least three years of public service and  meet certain academic standards will receive a National Public Service  Education Grant to pay a significant portion of their college's  tuition, fees, and room and board costs. Universities must provide  students with opportunities to engage in public service commitments,  academic counseling and student support services, and the opportunity  to earn to finish their degree in fewer than two years. Depending on a  student's financial need, under the Strengthening American Communities  Act, they may be able to graduate with a baccalaureate degree debt-free  before embarking on their chosen path to become a public servant.   For those individuals who have already answered their calling to  public service, my legislation would assist more public servants  continue serving their communities by accelerating the existing Public  Service Loan Forgiveness program. Under current law, these dedicated  workers must work for 10 years in a public service career and make 120  monthly payments on their federal student loans before they see a dime  of federal student loan forgiveness. Economic, family, and other  reasons can cause individuals to leave the public sector workforce and  despite their years of service, the service these workers provided are  not taken into consideration. I propose to accelerate the Public  Service Loan Forgiveness program to provide more immediate student loan  relief. For every two years of employment and corresponding monthly  Federal student loan payments, hard-working public sector employees  will receive a percentage of their federal student loans forgiven, with  100 percent of the federal student loan balance being forgiven at the  end of 10 years of service. With 99 percent of the initial round of  PSLF applicants being rejected last year for loan forgiveness due to  administrative barriers and misunderstanding of the rules of the  program, Congress should work to accelerating Public Service Loan  Forgiveness, therefore encouraging additional individuals to stay in  the public sector workforce despite the lower-paying salaries, reduce  their cost of borrowing for home and auto loans, and set aside  additional money for their own retirement.   As Congress moves forward with an overdue reauthorization of the  Higher Education Act, I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to  help individuals who are wholly committed to public service by  supporting the Strengthening American Communities Act. No individual  willing to serve his or her community in a public service career should  be held back from that calling due to the high cost of obtaining a  college education. No individual willing to serve his or her community  should be forced to leave public service because of financial hardship.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Young):   S.J.
