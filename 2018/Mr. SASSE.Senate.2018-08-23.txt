 Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the issue of the  leadership of the Department of Justice.   It has been a strange couple of hours around this building with lots  of talk about firing the Attorney General. I would just like to say in  public what I have been saying to my colleagues in a message that I  just communicated to the President of the United States; that is, that  it would be a very, very, very bad idea to fire the Attorney General  because he is not executing his job as a political hack. That is not  the job of the Attorney General. The Attorney General's job is to be  faithful to the Constitution and to the rule of law.   Jeff Sessions just had to issue a statement about 2 hours ago that I  would like to read. The Attorney General says:         While I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department       of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political       considerations. I demand the highest standards, and where       they are not met, I take action. However, no nation has a       more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement       investigators and prosecutors than the United States.        I am proud to serve with them and proud of the work we have       done in successfully advancing the rule of law.    That is his job. The Attorney General is a man who, when he served in  this body, would have policy disputes with probably all 99 of us or 100  of us now, but the 99 people he served alongside. There are a bunch of  issues where I agree with Jeff Sessions on policy, and there are some  issues where I disagree with Jeff Sessions on policy.   The Democrats disagree with Jeff Sessions on lots of policy, but I  think everybody in this body knows that Jeff Sessions has been  executing his job in a way faithful to his oath of office, to the  Constitution, and to trying to defend the rule of law. I think Jeff  Sessions' statement today that the U.S. Department of Justice is filled  with honorable, dispassionate, career prosecutors who execute their job  in ways that the American people should be proud of is indisputably  true. What he said is something that basically everybody in this body  knows and agrees with. Yet, bizarrely, there are people in this body  now talking like the Attorney General will be fired, should be fired. I  am not sure how to interpret the comments of the last couple of hours.   I guess I would just like to say, as a member of the Judiciary  Committee and as a Member of this body, that I find it really difficult  to envision any circumstance where I would vote to confirm a successor  to Jeff Sessions if he is fired because he is executing his job rather  than choosing to act as a partisan hack.   I think everybody in this body knows that Jeff Sessions is doing his  job honorably, and the Attorney General of the United States should not  be fired for acting honorably and for being faithful to the rule of  law.   I yield the floor.
