 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of  this resolution sponsored by my good friend from Michigan,  Congresswoman Slotkin.   The Trump administration's foreign policy failures have brought us to  the brink of war. The administration has provided no evidence to  demonstrate what imminent threat made Qasem Soleimani's assassination  and the perilous, predictable fallout necessary. But they have  demonstrated a shocking dismissiveness as to what is at stake.   On the threat of retaliation from Iran, Secretary Pompeo said it may  be that there is a little noise here in the interim. President Trump  said, if it happens, it happens.   To the parents who are worried sick about their kids serving in the  Middle East, it isn't a little noise. Their children's lives are at  stake. Those stakes make today's vote necessary.   The question before us is simple. Can we let this President drag us  into another war that will cost billions of taxpayer dollars and, most  importantly,  [[Page H100]]  American lives? Will we at long last stand up and fulfill our  constitutional duty to make decisions on war and peace?   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution.
