 Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize a  wonderful member of my team who, after 9 years, will be leaving us at  the end of this week.   For more than 9 years, Jodi Niehoff has been the heart and soul of  our operation. She has been our administration and correspondence  manager. She has been our intern coordinator and our unofficial planner  for party events celebrating legislative victories or comings and  goings of staff or birthdays. She has been the hostess and MC of our  annual holiday gift swap and so many other things, adding to the esprit  de corps of our team.   My team has pulled together a few stats, and these statistics  indicate just some of the work she has done over these years during  which I have had the privilege to work with her.   She has been a staunch believer not just in communicating with  constituents but doing so quickly and in a meaningful and heartfelt  way. Under her leadership, we have worked to have a substantive  response to every single letter that comes into our office and try to  get out that response, whenever possible, on the same day or the next  day and when more research is needed, to do so within a few days. It is  a huge challenge because so many people now are communicating via  email, and we have weeks in which we can receive 10,000 or 12,000 or  14,000 letters. So in the course of responding to all those diverse  issues that constituents have raised, Jodi has guided our team in  producing 5,774 unique letters that are now in our constituent  correspondence library. That averages out to nearly two letters a day  365 days a year for more than 9 years.   During her time on our team, she has mentored 227 interns, and 14 of  those interns have gone on to join our team as staff members. So  helping to enable them to have a significant experience here on Capitol  Hill is a real contribution to the public.   I first came here as an intern--a summer intern for Senator Mark  Hatfield from Oregon--and at that time, you only had a few interns. You  didn't have that much mail. There were three of us over the course of  the summer. I was the last to arrive, so it was my job to come in  early, run all the letters--of course they were all paper letters--run  the envelopes through the cutter, take out the sheets of information,  the letters, and stack them into one of four stacks for the different  correspondence.   Well, that now sounds like such a simple task compared to that which  Jodi has guided with more than 200 interns and more than 5,000--almost  6,000--unique letters being drafted to respond.   Thank you so much. Jodi, you will be dearly missed by everybody here  in Washington, DC, who has had the pleasure to know you, to work  alongside with you, to partner with you over nearly a decade. I wish  you all the best as you head back home to Minnesota to begin the next  chapter of your life and the next chapter of your family's life. I know  that the next chapter will be one in which a new set of individuals  will have the pleasure, the delight, to be able to work with you.   We invite you back here anytime. We wish you and your family all the  best. Thank you, Jodi, for your service to our team and your service to  our Nation.                        Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh    Mr. President, today I filed a lawsuit related to a violation of the  separation of powers.   Our Constitution lays out a very clear framework in which the  President of the United States nominates and the Senate proceeds to  review the record of an individual in order to determine if that  individual is of fit character to serve. This strategy came as our  Founders struggled with how to enable staff to fill key positions in  the executive branch and key positions in the judiciary, and it is  something that Hamilton wrote about extensively in his Federalist  Papers.   No. 76 was written in 1788 as a letter to the people of the State of  New York. In it, he addressed this separation of powers at length. He  said that the Founders had considered giving the assembly--that is a  large group--the ability to choose those who would fill posts in the  executive branch as a check and balance to the President but that they  had considered the fact that Senators would probably horse trade, that  one Senator from one State would want their friend in one position and  another Senator from another State  [[Page S6328]]  would want a different person, and that that horse trading would not  produce the best set of individuals to populate the executive branch or  to serve as judges. So they came to rest on the idea of having one  individual--the President--nominate individuals to serve.   Here is a short piece of his longer discussion. He said: ``The sole  and undivided responsibility of one man will naturally beget a livelier  sense of duty and a more exact regard to reputation. He will, on this  account, feel himself under stronger obligations and more interested to  investigate with care the qualities requisite to the stations to be  filled, and to prefer with impartiality the persons who may have the  fairest pretensions to them.''   He goes on to applaud the many merits of having one individual bear  the burden of making these nominations.   But then, of course, it is a nomination; it is not an appointment.  And to be appointed, the Senate must confirm.   He addresses this question of the role of the Senate. Alexander  Hamilton, writing to explain the action and the design of the  Constitution in his letter to the people of New York in 1788, says:         To what purpose then require the co-operation of the       Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence       would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent       operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of       favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to       prevent the appointment of unfit characters. . . .    He goes on to say that a President might be influenced by favoritism  to people in his own State or favoritism to people in his family or  family connections or favoritism because he had a friendship or a  pursuit of popularity triumphing over professional skills. So for all  of these reasons, the Senate process exists to review the record of the  individual and to determine, as Hamilton put it: Is that individual a  fit character or an unfit character?   Now, we all in the Senate took an oath of office to uphold the  Constitution, and, certainly, that means defending and exercising our  responsibility under the advice and consent clause of the Constitution.  We cannot interfere in the ability of the President to nominate. That  is the President's responsibility. We can give our suggestions, but in  the end, whatever the President says in regard to an office, whatever  person the President identifies, that is the nominee, and we cannot  interfere with that. But so, too, then, the President cannot interfere  in the exercise of the Senate in reviewing the record of the  individual. Certainly, the President can share his or her insights on  the individual and his or her encouragement to speed up the process but  cannot interfere in the underlying exercise of reviewing the record.   But here we are in this extraordinary moment where the President of  the United States has crossed the boundary between the separation of  powers and has proceeded to interfere with the deliberations of the  Senate, and he has done so not once and not twice but at least on three  significant occasions. I will proceed to share those occasions.   The first was the President's team intervening to stop the Senate  from accessing Nominee Kavanaugh's records when he served as Staff  Secretary to President George W. Bush.   Senator Leahy, the longest serving Member of the Senate and a  longtime member of the Judiciary Committee notes in a letter that the  committee has a ``longstanding, bipartisan expectation . . . that any  materials produced while a nominee was a public servant that could shed  light on his or her views, thinking, or temperament, that are not  privileged, should be subject to public scrutiny and carefully  considered by the Senate prior to confirmation.''   Now, this was a view that was a bipartisan view. It is a view that  was expressed by a senior member of the Judiciary Committee--a  Republican Member. That individual, Senator Cornyn, proceeded to note  that the documents that Judge Kavanaugh had ``generated . . . authored  . . . or contributed to'' during his tenure as White House Staff  Secretary should be conveyed to the Committee. This ``just seems like  common sense,'' he added.   In other words, it just seems fundamental to our responsibility here  in the Senate to review the record of Judge Kavanaugh, but just days  after the senior Republican member of the Judiciary Committee expressed  those sentiments, Republican Senators were summoned to the White House  by the White House Counsel, Donald McGahn, and immediately following  that summoning and those instructions--those directions from the White  House--suddenly, Senators were being denied the opportunity to see  those documents. In fact, it went so far as the chair of the Committee  proceeding not to ask for the documents after this direction from the  White House. So, certainly, that intervention did directly compromise  our ability as Senators to review the record of the nominee and,  therefore, violated the separation of powers and violated each of our  abilities to fulfill our constitutional responsibilities.   The second occasion is that Defendant William Burck, who has a series  of close connections to the White House, proceeded to exercise the  power of executive privilege on behalf of the President to deny the  Senate access to 100,000 pages of White House Counsel documents. What  did this individual say when he was exercising this power of censoring  the documents that would be obtained by the Senate? He said: ``The  White House . . . has directed that we not provide these documents. . .  .''   That is a direct interference in the advice and consent deliberations  of the Senate, and all of us together--Democrats and Republicans,  northern Senators and southern Senators, eastern coast, western coast,  heartland--should defend our responsibility under the Constitution to  provide advice and consent, which means the ability to review the  record of the nominee.   Then there is a third occasion where Defendant Burck proceeded to  label documents being presented to the Senate as ``committee  confidential.'' In fact, the Committee consulted with him during the  process to see what the extent of this was and why they were done.   There is no index that provides information to the Senate on why so  many documents were blocked by Burck from ever getting to us. That log  or that index doesn't exist saying: Yes, we looked at this, document  and here is why executive power prevails. There is no record or log for  why more than 141,000 pages of documents were labeled ``committee  confidential,'' preventing Senators from proceeding to talk about the  contents, to have the contents examined by experts, to have the  contents examined by the public, to take feedback from the citizens of  the United States, to have staff be able to look at these documents and  to be able to review them, and to be able to get feedback on them to  fulfill our responsibility as Senators to examine the record of the  nominee.   Thus we are in uncharted territory. Never before have we seen this  direct, substantial, and extensive intervention by the President in  violation of the separation of powers under the advice and consent  clause of the Constitution. Thus, it is important that we ask for  judicial intervention.   There is no more important document to us than the Constitution--our  ``we the people'' Constitution--of the United States of America. We  will be failing if we do not aggressively pursue our responsibility to  review the record of a nominee. So let us do that. Let us ask the  courts for intervention to ensure that we have access to this record.   We have had over the past few days new information regarding the  nominee--new information from women who have shared their difficult,  difficult experiences. What would be the appropriate conduct here in  the Senate? It would be for the FBI to investigate--not a criminal  investigation but a background investigation. That was accorded to  Anita Hill in 1991, a reopening of the background investigation to get  the facts.   How is it that a Senate and a President that could support the proper  role of the FBI in 1991 will not stand up today for fairness for women  who are coming forward?   Why is it that the nominee, steeped in the law, who has said he wants  a fair hearing--he wants a fair hearing--does not demand an FBI  investigation so it is fair to him and fair to these three women--Dr.  Ford, Deborah Ramirez, and Ms. Swetnick--who are coming forward? They  are being treated very poorly by this institution. They are being  treated as if they are a problem,  [[Page S6329]]  when they are, in fact, courageous Americans helping us to do our  advice and consent responsibility to understand the record of the  individual and whether the individual is fit or unfit.   To those who say that, well, these might not be true, wouldn't you be  the first, then, to stand up and say that the FBI should reopen the FBI  investigation and that nothing should go forward until the President  authorizes that? If you want fairness, you want facts.   Here we are. Not only are we failing the test of 1991 in terms of the  FBI investigation, but we are failing the test in terms of the  witnesses. In 1991, numerous corroborating witnesses came forward to  share and expand the dimensions of the events under consideration with  Anita Hill. Now the Judiciary Committee is saying that we are only  going to allow a ``he says, she says'' dynamic. This is absolutely  unfair to the women who have come forward.   Now the Judiciary Committee is saying they are going to bring an  individual to prosecute, as if this is a trial of the woman that is  coming forward. How wrong is that to try to turn this into a trial? If  you want a trial, well, then, shouldn't you have the FBI investigate  and get the facts? It shouldn't be a trial. We should be listening  carefully, and we should be allowing fairness to both, those with  corroborating information and, certainly, for the nominee, as well as  those who are sharing their experiences from the past about the  nominee. Give transparency and opportunity to both but not this farce  of a hearing planned by the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee.   We should be able to do so much better. We have had decades of  experience since 1991, since we went through a parallel situation of  allegations regarding personal conduct. How is it that now, 27 years  later, we are doing so much worse in respecting women coming forward to  share their stories. Why are we doing a worse job of respecting  dignity, a worse process in terms of listening to facts, a worse  process in terms of trying to turn it into a trial of a courageous  woman who came forward to share her experiences?   Well, I have never felt so burdened by the misconduct of this Chamber  as I feel right now. Let's stand up for decency and dignity and honor  those who have come forward, respect them, listen to them, and explore  the stories and the experiences they share so that their voices can be  fairly heard before this body.   Let us not let the President of the United States trample all over  the Constitution by violating the separation of powers and blocking our  Chamber from receiving the documents necessary to review the record of  the nominee.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Blanca Gaytan Farfan, be granted privileges of the floor for the  remainder of the day.
