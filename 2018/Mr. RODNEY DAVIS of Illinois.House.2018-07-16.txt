 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 66) to establish the Route 66 Centennial  Commission, to direct the Secretary of Transportation to prepare a plan  on the preservation needs of Route 66, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 66         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Route 66 Centennial       Commission Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Route 66 was the Nation's first all-paved highway under       the U.S. Highway System connecting the Midwest to California       and has played a major role in the history of the United       States.        (2) Route 66 was the symbol of opportunity to hundreds of       thousands of people seeking escape from the Dust Bowl in the       1930s, serving as a ``road to opportunity'' in the West and       providing employment during the Great Depression, as       thousands were put to work on road crews to pave the road.        (3) Route 66 was invaluable in transporting troops,       equipment, and supplies across the country to the West, where       the government established multiple industries and armed       force bases during World War II. Upon the conclusion of the       war in 1945, Route 66 was a key route taken by thousands of       troops as they returned home.        (4) Route 66 symbolized the Nation's positive outlook       during the postwar economic recovery in the 1950s and 1960s,       serving as an icon of free-spirited independence and linking       people across the United States. During this period, the       tourist industry along Route 66 grew tremendously, giving       rise to countless tourist courts, motels, service stations,       garages, and diners.        (5) Since June 27, 1985, when Route 66 was decommissioned       as a Federal highway, the popularity and mythical stature of       Route 66 has grown domestically and internationally, as the       road has experienced a rebirth of interest and support.        (6) The year 2026 will be the centennial anniversary of       Route 66, and a commission should be established to study and       recommend to Congress activities that are fitting and proper       to celebrate that anniversary in a manner that appropriately       honors America's Mother Road.       SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.         There is established a commission to be known as the Route       66 Centennial Commission (referred to in this Act as the       ``Commission'').       SEC. 4. DUTIES.         The Commission shall have the following duties:        (1) To study activities that may be carried out by the       Federal Government to determine whether the activities are       fitting and proper to honor Route 66 on the occasion of its       centennial anniversary, including any of the activities       described under section 8(b)(2)(B).        (2) To recommend to Congress the activities the Commission       considers most fitting and proper to honor Route 66 on such       occasion, to be carried out by the Department of       Transportation and any other entity or entities within the       Federal Government that the Commission considers most       appropriate to carry out such activities.        (3) To plan and host, in cooperation with such partners, a       conference on the U.S. Numbered Highway System, and assist in       the activities of such a conference.       SEC. 5.

SEC. 10. TERMINATION.         The Commission shall terminate not later than June 30,       2027.       SEC. 11. CLARIFICATION REGARDING FUNDING.         No additional funds are authorized to carry out the       requirements of this Act. Such requirements may be carried       out using amounts otherwise authorized or made available for       the Department of Transportation, except for amounts       authorized from the Highway Trust Fund.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 66, as  amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 66, the Route 66  Centennial Commission Act.   I thank my colleague, Representative Grace Napolitano, for sponsoring  this legislation with me, and I also thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking  Member DeFazio for helping shepherd this bill to the floor, along with  Highways and Transit Subcommittee chairman, Mr. Graves.   I am proud to have Route 66 run through the middle of my district,  and I believe it is important that we celebrate the history of Route  66.   In 1926, Route 66 became our Nation's first all-paved highway under  the U.S. highway system, connecting Chicago, Illinois, to Santa Monica,  California. Early on, the road was used by hundreds of thousands of  Americans seeking to escape the Dust Bowl and provided critical  employment opportunities for road crews paving the road during the  Great Depression.   During World War II, the highway transported troops, equipment, and  supplies to military bases across our country and was used after the  war by thousands of troops returning home to their families.   By the 1950s, Route 66 began to see a rise in tourism and became the  true symbol of American freedom and independence that we all know  today.   In April of last year, I went on an extended tour of Illinois'  stretch of the highway with my colleague Representative Darin LaHood  and also many State and local leaders. I had the opportunity to see the  economic impact that the Mother Road brings to Illinois. It supports  many jobs and key economic activity in small towns, and it helps to  generate important revenue to support those small rural communities.   For example, travelers along Route 66 in Illinois can see a giant  pink elephant statue and other larger-than-life sculptures at the Pink  Elephant Antique Mall in Livingston, Illinois.   Mr. Speaker, as a matter of fact, my family and I were coming back to  my hometown of Taylorville yesterday, and we stopped and had a great  lunch at the Twistee Treat, which is attached to the Pink Elephant  Antique Mall. So  [[Page H6217]]  if you ever want to go there, they have great burgers. I happened to  have a pork tenderloin sandwich that I probably shouldn't have eaten,  but it was really, really good, and topped it off, of course, with  Twistee Treat's famous ice cream.   You can also, if you are traveling Route 66, stop and see a movie at  the Wildey Theater in Edwardsville, Illinois. That originally opened in  1909. Or stop for an all-day breakfast at Jungle Jim's Cafe, a  quintessential roadside diner in Springfield, Illinois.   Those are just a few of the thousands of local businesses along Route  66 whose livelihoods depend upon the historic highway.   You don't even have to be in a car to ride along Route 66. The  Illinois Route 66 Trail is a system of off-road paths for bikes,  hikers, or anyone else looking to see the Mother Road in a different  way.   The centennial of this great highway will be an international  celebration, and the State of Illinois will be ready to welcome  travelers from around the world who want to experience the history and  magic of this scenic byway.   This bill, Mr. Speaker, will create a 19-member commission to  recommend activities to honor the 100th anniversary of the Mother Road  in the year 2026.   It also directs the U.S. Department of Transportation to develop a  plan to ensure the first all-paved U.S. highway connecting the Midwest  to my colleague's, Mrs. Napolitano's, district in California will be  preserved for many years to come. In doing this, the Secretary of  Transportation will work with the Governors of the eight States that  this historic highway passes through to develop a comprehensive  preservation plan.   H.R. 66 is endorsed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation;  the Route 66 Road Ahead Partnership; the National Historic Route 66  Federation; Auto Club Enterprises, also known as AAA; and the Route 66  Alliance.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record their letters of support of the  bill.                                                  National Trust for                                           Historic Preservation,                                                      July 16, 2018.        Dear Members of the House of Representatives: We appreciate       this opportunity to present the National Trust for Historic       Preservation's perspective on H.R. 66, the Route 66       Centennial Commission Act, which is scheduled for House floor       consideration today. The National Trust enthusiastically       endorses this legislation and looks forward to its enactment       this year.          interests of the national trust for historic preservation         The National Trust for Historic Preservation is a       privately-funded charitable, educational, and nonprofit       organization chartered by Congress in 1949 to ``facilitate       public participation in historic preservation'' and to       further the purposes of federal historic preservation laws.       The intent of Congress was for the National Trust ``to       mobilize and coordinate public interest, participation, and       resources in the preservation and interpretation of sites and       buildings.'' With headquarters in Washington, D.C., nine       field offices, 27 historic sites, more than one million       members and supporters, and a national network of partners in       states, territories, and the District of Columbia, the       National Trust works to save America's historic places and       advocates for historic preservation as a fundamental value in       programs and policies at all levels of government.                 h.r. 66, route 66 centennial commission act         We appreciate Representative Rodney Davis' leadership on       this legislation to create a Route 66 Centennial Commission       that recognizes and honors Route 66 on its centennial       anniversary. Historic Route 66 stretches approximately 2,400       miles from Chicago, IL to Los Angeles, CA, passing through       eight states and more than 300 communities. This vital       transportation corridor between the Midwest and southern       California has endured as a symbol of freedom and mobility       while epitomizing a new optimism that pervaded the nation's       economic recovery following World War II.        Route 66 was found by the National Park Service (NPS) to be       nationally significant in its 1995 Route 66 Special Resource       Study, which determined that Route 66 met the eligibility       requirements for a National Historic Trail. Numerous       buildings along Route 66 are listed on the National Register       of Historic Places (NRHP), and a 2012 Multiple Property       Documentation Form (MPDF) establishing the road's national       significance was recently approved by the Keeper of the       National Register. Route 66 has been designated a National       Scenic Byway in four states, including one segment that has       been designated an All-American Road--the highest designation       offered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).        Route 66 is internationally recognized as representing       America's love of the automobile and open road. As a Dustbowl       migration route, a World War II strategic military route, and       a vacation travel route, it has been celebrated in music,       literature, television, movies, and popular lore. The       National Trust has been supportive of Route 66 preservation       efforts for many years, including it in our signature       National Treasures program, participating in symposiums,       providing strategic assistance, and including Route 66 on the       2018 list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places.        When Congress passed the Route 66 Corridor Preservation       Program in 1999, a program administered by the National Park       Service (NPS), Route 66 was described as a symbol of the       American people's heritage of travel and their legacy of       seeking a better life. We applaud Representative Rodney Davis       and the over 40 cosponsors of H.R. 66 for their commitment to       recognizing the national significance of Route 66.        Thank you again for the opportunity to present the National       Trust's perspectives on this legislation, and we look forward       to working with Congress to ensure H.R. 66 is enacted into       law this year.            Sincerely,                                                        Pam Bowman,      Director of Public Lands Policy.                                   ____                                The Rt. 66 Road Ahead Partnership,                                                      March 7, 2018.        Congressman Davis: The Rt. 66 Road Ahead Partnership       supports H.R. 66, which will establish a Rt. 66 100th       Anniversary Commission at the Federal level. This legislation       will help ensure activities that are fitting and proper to       celebrate this milestone are planned and carried out in a way       that appropriately honors America's Mother Road.        2026 marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of       the U.S. Numbered Highway System and Route 66. The road was       our nation's first all-paved highway connecting the Midwest,       starting in Illinois, and ending in California. Since the       early decades of the 20th Century, Route 66 has reflected and       been an integral part of American history.        Hundreds of thousands of people used Route 66 to escape the       Dust Bowl of the 1930s, and many found employment along its       path. The road also transported troops, equipment, and other       military supplies across the country during WWII, and was       used by thousands of troops as they returned home. In the       1950s and 1960s, Route 66 saw the rise of American tourism       and became home to countless tourist attractions, motels,       diners, and other businesses along its path. Today, Route 66       remains an iconic symbol of American freedom and of the U.S.       as a mobile society.        H.R. 66 will create a commission to recommend activities       for the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Route 66.       The bill also requires USDOT to develop a plan on the       preservation needs of the road, and directs USDOT to host a       conference on the U.S. Numbered Highway System.        The Rt. 66 Road Ahead Partnership believes in the       preservation, promotion, and development of Route 66, and is       committed to helping ensure the road's 100th Anniversary is       planned and celebrated in a manner that recognizes its       historic significance. For this reason, we strongly support       H.R. 66.            Sincerely,                                                 William M. Thomas,      Chairman.                                   ____                                                   National Historic                                             Route 66 Federation,                              Lake Arrowhead, CA, February 10, 2018.        The Route 66 Road Ahead Partnership: This is to let you       know, the National Historic Route 66 Federation supports H.R.       66, which will establish a Route 66 100th Anniversary       Commission at the Federal level. This legislation will help       ensure activities that are fitting and proper to celebrate       this milestone are planned and carried out in a way that       appropriately honors America's Mother Road.        2026 marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of       the U.S. Numbered Highway System and Route 66.

H.R. 66 will create a commission to recommend activities       for the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Route 66.       The bill also requires USDOT to develop a plan on the       preservation needs of the road, and directs USDOT to host a       conference on the U.S. Numbered Highway System.        For 24 years, The National Historic Route 66 Federation has       been dedicated to the preservation and promotion of Route 66,       and is committed to helping ensure the road's 100th       Anniversary is planned and celebrated in a  [[Page H6218]]       manner that recognizes its historic significance. For this       reason, we strongly support H.R. 66.            Sincerely,                                                     David Knudson,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                  Automobile Club of                                             Southern California,                                  Los Angeles, CA, January 17, 2017.      Subject: H.R. 66--Route 66 Centennial Commission Act.       Hon. Rodney Davis,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        The Honorable Congressman Davis: Auto Club Enterprises       (AAA) applauds your leadership for introducing H.R. 66, which       would form a commission tasked with celebrating Route 66's       centennial and direct that a preservation plan for the Route       be prepared.        Auto Club Enterprises represents the interests of our AAA       members and motorists in five of the eight states represented       in this proposal (California, New Mexico, Texas, Missouri and       southern Illinois). Furthermore, the largest motor club       within ACE, the Automobile Club of Southern California       (ACSC), played a central role in the survey and signposting       of the original highway that became Route 66: the National       Old Trails Road, created in 1914-1915. ACSC published the       first maps of the route and its signs guided travelers for       the first decade of the road's existence [both illustrations       attached].        We are keenly aware of the strong historical connection       between Route 66 and major trends in our nation's history and       travel and the history of the Southwest.        Route 66 was one of our nation's first all-paved highways       connecting the Midwest to California, and has played a major       role in the history of the United States. It offered       opportunity to hundreds of thousands of people seeking escape       from the Dust Bowl in the 1930s, and its construction created       jobs for thousands during the Great Depression.        Route 66 represented America's great optimism and       enthusiasm during the postwar economic recovery. In this era,       the tourism industry along Route 66 grew tremendously; giving       rise to countless tourist courts, motels, service stations,       garages, and diners.        Because of its resonance within American history and       culture, Route 66 has been the subject of memorable       productions in all media, from popular music to television to       movies.        For all these reasons--its historical and cultural       significance and its connection with our own history, Auto       Club Enterprises supports the passage of H.R. 66.        We look forward to working with you and other stakeholders       in support of passing H.R. 66 and to our continued       partnership after its passage to successfully implement its       provisions.            Sincerely,                                                 Hamid Bahadori,                                      Manager, Transportation Policy      and Programs.                                   ____                                            The Route 66 Alliance,                                        Tulsa, OK, February 8, 2018.      Re H.R. 66.         The Route 66 Road Ahead Partnership: On behalf of the Route       66 Alliance, I am pleased to provide this letter of support       for H.R. 66, which will establish a Route 66 100th       Anniversary Commission at the Federal level. This legislation       will help ensure activities that are fitting and proper to       celebrate this milestone are planned and carried out in a       manner that appropriately honors America's Mother Road.        2026 marks the 100th anniversary of the establishment of       the U.S. Numbered Highway System and Route 66. The road was       our nation's first all-paved highway connecting the Midwest,       beginning in Illinois, and ending in California. Since the       early decades of the 20th Century, Route 66 has reflected and       been an integral part of American history. And Tulsa       celebrates this legacy since the Father of Route 66, Cyrus       Avery, led the effort to have Route 66 pass through Oklahoma,       specifically Tulsa, where East meets West!        Hundreds of thousands of people used Route 66 to escape the       Dust Bowl of the 1930s, and many found employment along its       path. The road also transported troops, equipment, and other       military supplies across the country during the Second World       War, and was used by thousands of troops as they returned       home. In the 1950s and 1960s, Route 66 saw the rise of       American tourism and became home to countless tourist       attractions, motels, diners, and other businesses along its       path. Today, Route 66 remains an iconic symbol of American       freedom and of the U.S. as a mobile society.        H.R. 66 will create a commission to recommend activities       for the commemoration of the 100th Anniversary of Route 66.       The bill also requires USDOT to develop a plan on the       preservation needs of the road, and directs USDOT to host a       conference on the U.S. Numbered Highway System.        The Route 66 Alliance is dedicated to the preservation and       promotion of Route 66, and is committed to helping ensure the       road's 100th Anniversary is planned and celebrated in a       manner that recognizes its historic significance. For this       reason, we strongly support H.R. 66.            Best regards,                                                         Ken Busby,                                          Executive Director & CEO.     Mr. Speaker, throughout its history,  Route 66 has become more than just a way to get from point A to point  B. It has evolved into a symbol of American independence and  prosperity. I am proud to help continue the legacy of Route 66, and I  urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 66.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my  colleague Mrs. Napolitano, and also my colleague Mr. LaHood, for going  on the Route 66 tour and passing legislation through the Natural  Resources Committee when he was a member of that committee to ensure  that this Mother Road gets the recognition that it deserves when it  turns 100 years old.   I will tell you, you talk about economic impacts, this road has a  tremendous impact in rural America and central Illinois. When I pulled  into the Pink Elephant Antique Mall yesterday, it was tough to find a  parking spot on a Sunday in Livingston, Illinois, when that town has  850 people who reside there. This is a big deal.    I yield to the gentlewoman from  California.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
