 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished co-chair of this  incredible Special Order sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus  for those very kind words.   I will say, as someone who has spent most of his life following the  work of this Black Caucus, it is an honor to finally join the legends,  the luminaries who helped to inspire my own run for the United States  Congress. Thank you.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the CBC for holding this hour to  reflect on Black history. I want to share, in particular, the story of  a young lawyer who came to the village of Hillburn in Rockland County,  New York, during his fight to desegregate our public schools.                                time  2100    Like many places in 1943, the Village of Hillburn had a main school  for White children. It was called the Hillburn School. And it had a  school for children  [[Page H580]]  of color without a library, a playground, or indoor plumbing. That was  called the Brook School.   But our elders did not accept this. They fought back. Parents of the  Brook School children organized and, with the help of a young attorney  with the NAACP's legal defense fund, they sued the district. With the  help of their lawyer, the parents of the Brook School children won  their fight against segregation in a case that helped to lay the  groundwork for Brown v. Board of Education 11 years later.   Who was this young lawyer who came to the Village of Hillburn?   He was the man who would later become our Nation's first Supreme  Court Justice who was Black: Thurgood Marshall.   I am moved by the story because it shows how Black history creates  Black futures, how the courage and resistance of the Black leaders of  years past are the reason a poor Black kid from Rockland County now  stands in this special Chamber as the United States Congress Member  representing that same school district today.
