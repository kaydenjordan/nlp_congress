 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about mental health  in general and the need for a different mindset about mental health and  care in this country specifically. I stand up tonight for the countless  family members, friends, and neighbors across the country as they  endure struggles with mental health, either for themselves or for a  family member.   The number of Americans battling mental illness or disorder is not  small. In fact, over one-half of adults will deal with mental health  issues, and one in five children has or will have a debilitating mental  illness.   Suicide is now ranked as the second leading cause of death among  children ages 10 to 14. Think about that: Suicide is the second leading  cause of death.   This is more than simply heartbreaking. We have a problem. That is  nearly one death every 11 minutes.   Suicide is a tragic outcome for people dealing with mental crises,  but across the country, there are so many dealing in other ways,  especially in the midst of this pandemic: working parents trying to  make it through the day juggling; parents not working, trying to find  ways to make ends meet; kids in remote school losing the opportunity  for the social-emotional learning that is so critical for their  development; and families juggling remote work and remote school at the  same time. All of these have contributed to what is truly a mental  health crisis in the country.   In fact, as we think about it, in the same way that young kids and  babies born during the Depression were forever known as Depression  babies, it is very likely that this generation enduring the pandemic  will be COVID babies throughout their lives. It will have an impact.                                time  1945    Beyond that we have the issues of mass violence. I live in Highland  Park. Two weeks ago, we experienced something that no community should  ever have to go through, but, unfortunately, too many communities have  and continue to do so.   Highland Park, Uvalde, we can go back to Sandy Hook, and so many  others, it is too long a list to give a comprehensive naming of every  single community that has suffered from mass violence.   But, at its core, there is something about these kids committing and  perpetrating these heinous crimes, monstrous crimes--if we can reach  them at an earlier age, maybe we can reduce some of that violence.   Nor is this an exhaustive list of all the things, all the aspects of  mental health that affect people.   We know that the pandemic has made all of us painfully aware of the  inadequacies and inequalities of our mental health system. Too late in  the process, our system steps in to deal with crises, rather than  working on helping people have a strong and confident, healthful life  and tackle challenges as they occur. We should be providing holistic  mental healthcare and provide support early and often.   At the baseline, Americans are experiencing anxiety and depression at  higher rates, and the number of services available just aren't keeping  up, putting a crisis on top of a crisis.   For those already suffering from mental health issues, the pandemic  has increased their symptoms, and experts worry that we will deal with  the stressors and effects long after the official end of this pandemic.   Everywhere I go, in my district, and around the country, I hear  stories, some heartbreaking, some just simply frustrating, about  people's struggles getting care for themselves and their loved ones. It  is not a new problem.   In fact, sharing just a couple of personal stories, my first  experience of tragedy in the context of mental health, my best friend  as a young child in elementary school, was a boy named David Segal. He  was special, kind heart, a brilliant young man. As he aged, we moved  apart in middle school. And then I learned that, at age 21, he took his  own life.   His parents were told that he felt as if he was locked in a box. He  was so smart, and he could see the possibilities available to his  friends. He wanted more than anything else what he saw everyone else  had, but he knew that it would never be available to him because of the  box in which he was locked in. His pain was unbearable and, at 21, he  took his life.   Years later, I lost a cousin, Jeff, whose pain was also all- consuming. He tried many times to escape his pain. His family tried to  help. We all tried to help. He sought therapy, but, again, that pain  was so all-consuming that, ultimately, as a relatively young man, he  died by suicide.   Let me come back to the present moment. I have heard from the Ann &  Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago that the pandemic has  increased the severity of the mental health crisis in children.   During the pandemic, suicide attempts jumped from a pre-pandemic  level of two to three per month to two to three each and every day.  Before the pandemic, Lurie Children's would get maybe 50 calls a week  for new appointments. At the height of the pandemic, they were  receiving 50 calls every single day.   A third of clinicians are reporting a 3-month wait time for an  appointment, if they even have the room to begin with. In many places,  the wait is much, much longer. This massive mismatch of supply and  demand impacts the quality of care those with appointments are able to  receive.   Providers have empathy and compassion fatigue, emotional exhaustion,  and are less personal and less connected with their patients.   Older Americans, some of the most vulnerable in our society, are at  an increased risk. High levels of isolation increase their risk of  depression, cognitive decline, and dementia. Already, 20 percent--20  percent of those 55 or older typically experience some form of anxiety  and depression to severe cognitive impairment.   Additionally, mental health does not only afflict those who have been  diagnosed, it touches many other parts of our society. In 2008, Thomas  R. Insel, then the leader of the National Institute of Mental Health,  estimated that mental illness costs our economy about $193 billion-- $193 billion each year in lost earnings.   8.4 million Americans are providing about 32 hours of uncompensated  care per week to those with mental healthcare needs, whether family or  friends. Leaving mental illness unaddressed results in the increased  incarceration of people with unmet mental health needs. Those dealing  with stressors related to mental health are left more susceptible to  the overuse of drugs and alcohol.   Despite the pervasiveness of mental health issues, less than half of  adults with any mental health condition received treatment in 2020. For  Americans of color, the rate of those getting treatment is even less  than the national average.   I find the current landscape of mental health in America simply  unacceptable. Every day we fail to take strong action to bolster mental  healthcare services is another day closer to failing our friends, our  family, our neighbors. That is why making access to the appropriate  mental health resources cheaper and easier is critical.   I want to share with you one example of how the mental health crisis  affects one of our most important population groups, our youth.   Last year, I received a letter from a high school senior outlining  her findings about the disparities in mental health resources at her  school. She highlighted the value placed on new gym flooring and new  scoreboards, but the lack of investment in mental health counselors.   She shared that they lost a classmate early in the year to suicide.  She had also become more aware of so-called suicide websites and social  media's influence on our children's mental health.   I applaud the initiative of that high schooler writing to me and  voicing her concern. Each of us has a responsibility to not only reach  out for help, but to advocate for our neighbors who feel powerless and  are left to struggle.  [[Page H6876]]    Another story I want to share is that of a dear, young, beautiful  woman, 19-year-old Orli Sheffey from my town. Orli was a light that  shined brightly. In fact, her name means, my light.   She was a tenacious journalist and beloved friend with a passion for  the pursuit of truth and justice. She strongly believed in the need to  provide mental health services, to the point where she was training to  provide confidential peer counseling services to her classmates.   Sufficient mental health services possibly could have saved Orli's  life. Orli's time with us is not about how she left us, but it is about  the impact she made while she was here, an impact that is still felt by  so many today.   No parent should lose their child at such a young age.   We also lost Brian Kroeter's younger sister, Katie, who died by  suicide at 25. She was completing her master's degree in social work  and was active in the community with programs like Meals on Wheels. The  family has carried on Katie's memory through their suicide prevention  advocacy work and Brian's participation in the Bank of America Chicago  Marathon in honor of his sister.   Our unmet health needs reach from our youth to our Nation's heroes.  When it comes to veterans who defend our Nation and our freedom, we are  losing 22 to suicide every day.   When it comes to our cops and firefighters, we fail to recognize that  their on-the-job trauma is crushing to their mental health and well- being.   Jeff Smith was a Metropolitan police officer whose family lives in my  district. He was dispatched to the U.S. Capitol on January 6 and  suffered injuries, both visible and not, in defending us, in defending  me that very day. His father shared with me that those injuries and the  combination of the stigma around mental health and the lack of access  to care contributed to his terrible loss.   We must do better if we want to honor Officer Jeff Smith. We must do  better if we want to honor our veterans, if we want to honor Orli  Sheffey, and if we want to honor all those we have lost to terrible  mental health issues of all stripes.   Fortunately, I have some positive news to share that is giving me  hope and optimism about this mental health crisis. Here in the House,  we passed the Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act of  2022 to holistically address American's mental health and crisis care  needs.   One program I am glad this legislation will help strengthen is the  National Suicide Prevention Hotline, which is now 988. Moving to the  988 phone number is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for America to  strengthen and expand an existing lifeline to everyone and ensure that  everyone is aware of this new service.   The nationwide number will allow people to call or text a trained  crisis counselor who can provide critical help, whether it is thoughts  of suicide, mental health, or a substance use crisis. No matter where  you are in the country, a well-resourced 988 line will be able to:   Connect a person in a mental health crisis to a trained counselor who  can address their immediate needs and help connect them to ongoing  care.   Mitigate healthcare spending with more cost-effective early  intervention.   Help reduce the use of law enforcement to treat mental health issues.   Meet the rising need for crisis intervention on a grand scale and,  importantly, help end the stigma toward these seeking or accessing  mental healthcare.   The creation and launch of 988 fills me with hope and optimism that  this will not be the last action we take. We will have to make sure  that mental health resources are adequately funded for Americans and  our healthcare providers, and properly managed if we want to see proper  success.   I will continue to fight for the belief that access to affordable  quality healthcare is our right for every American, not just a reserved  privilege for a select few.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild),  a dear friend and colleague.    Thank you for your remarkable words, for sharing your  perspective and expressing compassion I think we can all share.   It is now my privilege to recognize my friend from Michigan,  Representative Elissa Slotkin.    Thank you, Representative Slotkin. Thank you for those  beautiful words. Thank you, Representative Wild.   We have a national crisis. It needs a national response. We are a  caring Nation. It is reflected in the outreach across the Nation when a  community is struck by tragedy, whether it is a mass shooting or a  flood, hurricane, whatever the case may be.   We see it in the response of individuals lending a helping hand when  they see someone fall on a curb or down a stair. It is who we are as a  people. We need to extend that when we think about our mental health  crisis and mental healthcare. We have to do so much to try to address  the stigma.   In the same way, if you think of a world-class athlete who is trying  to achieve their highest potential, no one says going to seek  assistance of a coach or advice of a friend is a shortcoming.   When it comes to dealing with the challenges of life, too often that  outreach for assistance, that simple ask, help me get through this  moment, isn't made because people are afraid of how they will be  judged. Yet, even if we address the stigma, we still have the  [[Page H6878]]  challenge of access as we talked here tonight--not enough providers,  not enough quality services.   Everyone in this country deserves access to quality, affordable, and  available care. We need to make sure that we are investing in training  providers to provide services across our country and making sure that  those services are available at a price that people can truly afford.   We need to recognize that care for our mental health is every bit as  important as care for our physical health. Think about it. If a child  is diagnosed with cancer at a young age, we have poured billions of  dollars into research to try to cure those cancers, and we are  investing thousands, if not millions of dollars, in treating  individuals and having great results. Kids with cancer today have a  much higher likelihood of beating that cancer back and reaching their  full potential.   The same is true for diseases we might face in middle age or even  treating our seniors. We are working so hard to address that. We need  to do the same for mental health and mental healthcare.   We need to recognize that the care for a challenge, a mental health  challenge, is every bit as real and deserves every bit as much  investment as the care for a physical health challenge.   We are a caring Nation. We know we have a crisis. I am hopeful that  this body will continue to do its work to try to address this crisis  for the people we represent.   I am grateful for the great words, kind words, insightful words,  compassionate words of my colleagues, and I am thankful for the work of  this body.   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
