 Madam Speaker, today, I went to the Jose  Andres food bank in Washington, D.C., for Federal workers. I was  stunned to see hundreds waiting in line in the rain.   Inside, they were giving a hot meal to everybody, as well as fresh  vegetables, diapers, and feminine products. And they were assisting  those who were in danger of missing utility payments.   As I served the workers, I asked them what their jobs were. They  worked for the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the D.C. Superior  Court.   How many of these workers were served by this food bank yesterday?  Eleven thousand.   They are like the Federal workers in my district, people like  Catherine, who has back problems and now can't afford the copay for  physical therapy and epidurals, or Eric, who told me he had to defer  car maintenance in order to avoid missing his son's college tuition  payment.   This suffering could end right now. But instead of ending their pain,  Trump ignores it. Just this morning, his Commerce Secretary, Wilbur  Ross, said he could not understand why furloughed workers have to go to  food banks. Well, I say: End this shutdown today.                            ____________________
