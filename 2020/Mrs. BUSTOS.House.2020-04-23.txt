 Madam Speaker, 4 weeks ago we passed the largest  economic rescue in American history. Today we replenish some of its  most important programs.   Behind each program are real people in desperate need of our help:  healthcare workers and hospitals in dire need of support, supplies, and  testing;   Small business owners agonizing amid uncertainty and boxed out of  loans by big banks serving well-connected clients; and   Our family farmers who continue to feed the world under unprecedented  hardship, unable to qualify for the disaster loans afforded to others.   Today's legislation rights these wrongs. It also harnesses the help  of our community banks and our credit unions, but it does not go far  enough.   Our cities, our States need assistance now. They soon may have to lay  off police and first responders, the very people we need on the front  lines in this crisis.   Our corn growers and ethanol producers deserve the same help afforded  Big Oil. We must take care of them in this next relief package.
