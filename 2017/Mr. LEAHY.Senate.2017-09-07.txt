 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to continue for 5  minutes.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I strongly support the disaster relief  package that is before us today. It is going to provide much needed  assistance to the thousands of families and communities who were  devastated by Hurricane Harvey. As vice chairman of the Appropriations  Committee, I looked at it very carefully, and I know it provides a  short-term increase to the debt limit to ensure the U.S. Government has  access to the resources it needs. It funds the government with a  continuing resolution through December 8, enabling Congress to work to  complete the fiscal year 2018 appropriations bills. It is a responsible  approach to addressing the needs of our Nation.   As a Vermonter, as a human being, it was heart-wrenching to watch the  devastation march through Texas as Hurricane Harvey made landfall, only  to see it turn toward Louisiana. Now, Hurricane Irma has struck Puerto  Rico and continues on its path toward Florida and the east coast.  Hurricanes Jose and Katia are swirling in the Atlantic. They are  threatening our coast. This is a horrific time.   My fellow Vermonters and I are all too familiar with these images. It  was only 6 years ago that Tropical Storm Irene tore through our small,  special Green Mountain State and left a wound we are still trying to  heal today.   A disaster of this magnitude demands the full support of the U.S.  Government, and that includes all of us here. I am glad this disaster  relief package is before us today. My Appropriations Committee staff  has worked so hard on it. If we don't act and act fast, FEMA exhausts  its funds by the end of this week.   Republicans and Democrats in the Senate stood by my side in 2011 and  in the following years to help Vermont rebuild after Irene, and I will  stand in support of Texans and Louisianans now. And I will stand in  support of Floridians, if and when they need it. This is only a  fraction of what we will need to help recover and rebuild after these  storms. It is going to require years of Federal support, and we cannot  let our commitment fade.   We live in a world where 100-year storms seem to occur every year, so  we have to invest in technology, conservation, and infrastructure that  will mitigate further damage and make our communities more resilient in  these crises.   Our ability to respond doesn't just depend on emergency assistance.  Each year, in the annual appropriations bills, we fund programs that  help us prevent and respond to severe weather events and invest in the  necessary infrastructure. The National Weather Service, the Army Corps  of Engineers, the Sea Grant program, the Flood Map Modernization  Program, Watershed Flood Prevention Operations, Regional Coastal  Resilience Grants, Community Development Block Grants, and State and  Local First Responder Grants--just to name a few--are all critical to  these efforts. We cannot and should not accept the deep cuts that have  been proposed by President Trump to these critical investment programs.   Now, I thank Chairman Cochran for his leadership and cooperation to  advance these bills. It is through these bills we can fund important  priorities. I have been asking since March to begin bipartisan budget  negotiations to establish responsible topline funding levels for both  defense and non-defense programs based on parity. The current budget  caps do not allow us to produce 12 responsible bills. Absent a budget  deal, deep cuts are mandated for both defense and non-defense programs.  We have to move forward with urgency.   So my heart goes out to all of those affected by Hurricane Harvey and  Hurricane Irma. My vote goes out to help them, and I will continue to  fight for them.   This Senate amendment is really the first step and I support it.   I yield the floor.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to waive the  mandatory quorum call.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The quorum call is waived.   Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending  cloture motion, which the clerk will state.  [[Page S5038]]    The legislative clerk read as follows:                               Cloture Motion         We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the       provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate,       do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to       concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R.       601, with a further amendment numbered 808.          Lamar Alexander, John Boozman, Roy Blunt, Thom Tillis,             Mike Crapo, John Cornyn, Shelley Moore Capito, Steve             Daines, Cory Gardner, Richard Burr, Orrin G. Hatch,             Roger F. Wicker, David Perdue, Dan Sullivan, John             Barrasso, John Thune.    The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. By unanimous consent, the mandatory  quorum call has been waived.   The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the  motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R.  601, a bill to enhance the transparency and accelerate the impact of  assistance provided under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to promote  quality basic education in developing countries, to better enable such  countries to achieve universal access to quality basic education and  improved learning outcomes, to eliminate duplication and waste, and for  other purposes, with a further amendment, shall be brought to a close?   The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk called the roll.    Mr. President, we had promises from the White House that  the President would treat DACA recipients with great heart. I don't  believe it  [[Page S5040]]  is great heart when he abandons protections for our Nation's Dreamers.  It is an unfortunate pattern, and I hope it changes, facing historic  low approval ratings, the President desperately rallies his dwindling  supporters by exploiting fear and resentment. Such conduct is shameful  and unbecoming of the presidency, an office intended to represent our  proudest ideals--not play to basest instincts. I have been here with  every President since President Ford, both Republicans and Democrats.  We agreed on some things and disagreed on some things, but the  Presidents have always seemed to want to present and represent  America's proudest ideals.   We live in an unprecedented time when our President prefers to divide  us, rather than unite us. Instead of honoring the sacrifice made by  transgender individuals serving in our Armed Forces, President Trump  decided to ban them from serving at all. When white supremacists  violently rallied around hate in Charlottesville, resulting in the  murder of Heather Heyer, the President equated those who promote  bigotry with those who oppose it. There is no equation. The bigotry  shown there and the hate shown there is wrong.   This week the President targets another vulnerable population-- Dreamers. Dreamers are American by almost any definition. They came to  the United States as children through no fault--and by no choice--of  their own. Those of us who have had children or grandchildren know they  don't make those kinds of choices. They play by our country's rules.  They grow up. They have no criminal records, and seek only the chance  to contribute to their communities and make them better. America is  their home. Often, it is the only country they have ever known, just as  my maternal grandparents came from Italy and found a home in Vermont or  my great grandparents--paternal grandparents came from Ireland and  found a home in Vermont. They wanted that to be their home. That was  the American dream. When you threaten the Dreamers, you threaten the  American dream itself.   The President's attempt to justify this decision as deference to  Congress or respect for our courts is disingenuous, at best. It strains  reason that a President who signed 90 Executive actions in his first  100 days suddenly cares about deference to the Legislative Branch. It  borders on laughable that a President who doggedly defends a Muslim ban  found likely to be unconstitutional by multiple courts, is now cautious  about the litigation risk of defending DACA in court.   Dreamers are our friends and neighbors. They are students in our  schools and universities in all our States. They serve our country in  the military. They are among the first responders who come to save your  life when there is a fire. Consider, for example, Jesus Contreras, a  Dreamer and a paramedic, who saved American lives during Hurricane  Harvey. If we had thrown him out, he wouldn't have been there saving  those lives. The President's decision to end DACA is nothing but a  cynical ploy to rally the anti-immigrant voices within his base while  attempting to escape responsibility for deporting some of the most  inspiring Americans in our country.   On Tuesday, I received a letter from Dr. Juan Conde, a DACA recipient  and resident of Vermont. Dr. Conde was brought to the United States by  his mother as a child. In 2007, his mother lost her life battling  cancer. This tragedy inspired him to find a way to help cancer patients  like her. Unable to pursue his dream of being an oncologist due to his  immigration status, he initially decided to pursue a Ph.D. in cancer  research. But Dr. Conde wanted to treat cancer patients, not just study  the disease. After receiving DACA status, he was able to pursue his  dream of directly helping patients, applying to and being accepted into  the University of Vermont's Larner College of Medicine, where he is  currently pursuing his medical degree. He hopes to spend his career  here in the United States treating cancer patients and researching the  disease that has taken the lives of millions of Americans, including  members of my own family.    Dr. Conde is the face of DACA. Dreamers have enormous potential and  determination to contribute to the only country they have known since  childhood. To deny them these opportunities because they were brought  here as children by their parents would be cruel and inhumane,  motivated more by the toxic xenophobia of this administration than by  any coherent policy goals. Stories like Dr. Conde's reveal why  President Trump's decision to rescind DACA is as senseless as it is  callous.   Now the fate of DACA is in the hands of Congress. We can bring up a  vote on this if the Republican leadership will allow that in the House  and the Senate. Some Republicans have spoken out against the  President's decision. It is easy to speak out. Act on it. Vote on it.  We Democrats stand ready to protect our Nation of Dreamers. We stand  ready to defend the American dream. I hope we are not standing alone. I  would invite our Republican friends--stand up with us. Stand up with  those Dreamers. I guarantee you, you have some living in your State. I  guarantee you, just as my grandparents and my great-grandparents did,  they can make America a better country.   Mr. President, I see other Senators on the floor.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.
