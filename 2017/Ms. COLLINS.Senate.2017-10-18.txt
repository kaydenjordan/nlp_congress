 Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion  about what the appropriate tax rate should be for large corporations.  That is important because we want them to create jobs right here in  America and not overseas.   Let us not forget the true engine of our economy, and that is our  small businesses. We need to provide true tax relief to our small  businesses, the job creators in our economy.   I rise to discuss my amendment, which is No. 1151, which would create  a deficit neutral reserve fund to support small business tax relief  while preventing wealthy taxpayers from sheltering income from taxation  at the appropriate rate.   It would send the message that through tax reform, we can help our  small businesses thrive and be the engine of job creation and economic  growth in communities all across our great country.   Small businesses make an out-sized contribution to our economy.  According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses employ  nearly half of all workers and generate two out of three net new jobs  each year. Nationwide, they generate nearly half of our private,  nonfarm GDP and one-third of our Nation's export value.   The State of Maine is truly a small business State, with nearly  300,000 of our residents employed by our more than 141,000 small  businesses. That is nearly 60 percent of our workforce.   Most small businesses are organized as so-called passthrough  entities, which means that their profits are passed on to their owners  and reported on individual income tax returns.   Under current law, this income is taxed at individual rates, which  can reach nearly 40 percent at the Federal level and can be  significantly higher than the corporate tax rates that larger firms  face.   Given the administrative costs and these high tax rates, small  businesses are forced to devote more resources to compliance and tax  payments and fewer resources to creating good jobs and investing in  their local communities.   It is no wonder that a recent survey by the National Federation of  Independent Business found that concerns about Federal taxes on small  businesses ranked third on the list of the top 10 concerns.   With tax reform, we have the opportunity to fix this problem. Of  course, we should aim to do so in a way that prevents people from  abusing rates intended for small business passthrough income.   My amendment would allow for changes to Federal tax laws and to  provide relief to small businesses, while not allowing wealthy  individuals to shelter their income from taxation at the appropriate  rate.   I urge my colleagues to support it.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.                              Amendment No. 1144    Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate,  equally divided, prior to a vote on amendment No. 1144, offered by the  Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, for the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch.   The Senator from Utah.    Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion  about what the appropriate tax rate should be for large corporations-- so-called C corps. That certainly is important because we want to make  sure that those large businesses are creating jobs here in the United  States and not overseas in order to take advantage of lower tax rates.   But let us not forget the importance of providing tax relief for our  small businesses. It is our small businesses that create the majority  of new jobs in this country and that are really the economic engines  for so many of our communities.   Small businesses make an outsized contribution to our Nation's  economy. According to the Small Business Administration, they employ  nearly half of all workers and generate two out of three net new jobs  each year. Nationwide, small businesses generate nearly half of our  private nonfarm GDP and one-third of our Nation's export value. My  State of Maine is truly a State of small businesses. Sixty percent of  our workforce--that is, nearly 300,000 of our residents--are employed  by more than 141,000 small businesses.   I spoke at length earlier about the amendment, and I know that the  chairman of the Budget Committee has a lot of work to do tonight. So I  won't repeat the comments I made earlier. Let me just say that my  amendment would create a deficit-neutral reserve fund to support small  business tax relief while preventing wealthy taxpayers from sheltering  income from taxation at the appropriate rate. We want to have some  guide rails. But it is important that we recognize that it is the small  businesses of America that are the true job creators in so many of our  communities.   I urge our colleagues to support the amendment.   Mr. President, I request a voice vote.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?   If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.   The amendment (No. 1151) was agreed to.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for his cooperation and  support as well.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.
