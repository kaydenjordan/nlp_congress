 Madam Chair, I appreciate the courtesy of my good friend  from Idaho. I certainly appreciate his help and support with this  amendment that is included in this package.   Put very plainly, my amendment is designed to get the attention of  the Army Corps of Engineers and for a very good reason.   In the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016,  language was included requiring the Army Corps of Engineers to work  with localities that request a no-wake zone if there is a safety  concern caused by speeding boats generating large wakes in stretches of  federally maintained waters that run adjacent to a marina.   Southport, North Carolina, a beautiful waterfront community, has been  waiting nearly 3 years to have a no-wake zone established. That is 3  years of speeding boats creating wakes that have caused fuel spills at  Southport Marina and, thankfully, at least so far, only minor injuries  to date.   Everyone back home knows this poses a significant safety concern. We  just need for some who work in an agency known as the Army Corps of  Engineers to understand it just as well.   Common sense tells us that at some point, there is going to be a  major accident. This is a very high traffic area of recreational boats.  Doing nothing, as the Corps appears to favor, is not an option.   Madam Chair, I thank my colleagues for their support of this  amendment.
