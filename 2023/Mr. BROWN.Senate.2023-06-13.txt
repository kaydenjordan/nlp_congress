 Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting the nomination of Dr. Jared Bernstein to be Chairman of the  Council of Economic Advisers, or CEA.   Dr. Bernstein is highly qualified, with close to four decades of  economic experience. He has devoted his career to working on economic  policies that ensure growth reaches all Americans, fighting to make our  economy fairer--something there is a lot of talk about in here but not  enough action.   Since the beginning of the Biden administration, he served as a  member of CEA. Before that, his experience, again, tells the story. He  served in various senior-level roles inside and outside government-- chief economist and economic policy adviser to then-Vice President  Biden; Deputy Chief Economist, Department of Labor; a senior fellow at  the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; economist at the Economic  Policy Institute--all the kinds of qualifications that feed into this  job.   Dr. Bernstein is widely respected by his peers from both sides of the  aisle. I want to really make that clear. Before his nomination  hearing--and I chair the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs, from which he came. Before that hearing, seven--seven--former  CEA chairs--the only one that didn't is long, long, long retired. I  don't know if he was even asked. But seven former CEA chairs, who  served in Republican administrations, wrote to the committee in support  of his nomination. Three of them served under President Trump.   Think of that. Seven Republican former CEA chairs--still Republicans,  most of them, much more conservative than Jared Bernstein--they all  wrote a letter together, initiated by one of the Trump nominees, one of  the Trump CEA chairs, Kevin Hassett. He led the effort. He told the New  York Times:         I disagree with Jared about a lot, and Jared and I have       been disagreeing about things for 20 years. But he really is       a fundamentally good person who tries to figure things out       with an open mind, and [sometimes he] changes his mind.    That is really all you want from a CEA chair.   Again, President Trump's chief economist said that Jared Bernstein  has an open mind and changes his mind. That is precisely the kind of  openness to ideas from anyone, of any party or point of view, that we  should all want in an economic adviser.   Despite Dr. Bernstein's years of experience, despite his impeccable  credentials, and despite receiving support from seven--I believe the  most recent seven--former CEA chairs serving in Republican  administrations, my Republican colleagues on the Banking, Housing, and  Urban Affairs Committee all voted no to Jared Bernstein.    Now, the decision to vote against his nomination is partisanship for  the sake of partisanship, and I will give you an example. This sort of  tells the whole story, Mr. President. The Banking and Housing Committee  has a tradition of members voting for the President's pick. This isn't  the Secretary of the Treasury. This isn't the Secretary of Labor. There  are major disagreements. This isn't the head of the EPA.   This is essentially the President's personal economic adviser. So  regardless of ideology, we support that, as I did--and I will get to  that in a second--with the Trump nominees. Whom the President picks, we  support in this body. It is one of the good traditions of the Senate.  Not all traditions are good here. That is one of the good traditions of  the Senate.   In 2017, I voted for Kevin Hassett, President Trump's nominee to  serve as CEA Chair. I wasn't wild about Kevin Hassett. I liked him as a  person. I wasn't wild about his ideology. He much too much believed  that if you cut taxes on rich people and you give corporations all  these tax breaks, it will trickle down and grow the economy.   I didn't buy that. I still don't buy that. We saw that huge tax cut.  All it did was make rich people richer, make corporations move jobs  overseas more quickly. It never trickles down to help middle-class  workers. It never honors the dignity of work. We know that,  [[Page S2062]]  but, nonetheless, because the President of the United States, duly  elected, picked him as his Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers  and Kevin Hassett was honest, he was credentialed--he just was wrong on  issues, but that shouldn't stop us from supporting for that position.   In 2021, Pat Toomey, the ranking member of the Housing, Banking, and  Urban Affairs Committee, voted for Cecelia Rouse, President Biden's CEA  nomination. The way I voted for a more conservative economist than I  wanted, Senator Toomey voted for a more liberal economist than he  wanted because she was qualified, she was credentialed, and she was an  honest person.   Next step: The Senate confirmed both of them--Dr. Hassett's  nomination, 81 to 16. I led our side of the aisle, with my fellow  Democrats here, in an overwhelming--only 16 of them voted against, out  of 48 or 49 then, because I stood in the committee and said: We owe  this to the White House. The tradition is such in the Senate that you  support the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.   Dr. Rouse's nomination passed 95 to 4. Senator Toomey did the same.   So we all used to agree in this body until somebody made it much more  partisan. Never before in this nomination was there this kind of  partisanship. We have agreed that the President is entitled to have his  choice of CEA Chair.   I see no reason why that should change today. Dr. Bernstein's  Republican peers and Democratic peers all came together and supported  him. There is no reason the Senate shouldn't, in that same bipartisan  fashion, vote to confirm his nomination. There are no really good  reasons at all to do that.   I urge my colleagues to support Dr. Jared Bernstein's nomination to  be Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  scheduled at 5 p.m. begin immediately.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
