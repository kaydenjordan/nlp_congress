 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory and  celebrate the life of Don L. Taylor, a lifelong resident of Wisconsin  and a friend, who peacefully passed away at age 88 on April 16, 2021,  surrounded by his family.   Don was active in many civic and service organizations and wore many  hats throughout his lifetime. He served honorably as a second  lieutenant in the U.S. Army and was a longtime member and past  president of the Waukesha Rotary Club. He spent his leisure time  writing historical fiction set in Waukesha. He also had many other  interests and, as many Wisconsinites do, Don enjoyed many trips to his  family cabin up north in Wisconsin.   Don was a staple in the Waukesha community due to his involvement in  the Waukesha State Bank. Don succeeded his father, Carl, as president  and CEO of the Waukesha State Bank, a role he held for 25 years, from  1969 to 1994. Don is credited with modernizing the operations of the  bank and computerizing operations in 1968, one of the first banks to do  so. In 2004 Don's son, Ty Taylor, became the third generation of the  family to serve as president of the bank.   Don will also be remembered for his deep involvement in politics. He  served as chairman of the Waukesha County Republican Party for 30  years, from 1979 to 1989, and again from 1993 to 2013. Don was one of  the early pioneers in Waukesha to help grow the conservative movement,  and his efforts cannot be understated for their lasting impact today.  Don was recognized for his organizing capabilities by being selected to  chair and co-chair President Ronald Reagan's 1968, 1980, and 1984  Wisconsin campaigns.   Above all else, Don Taylor was first and foremost a man of faith. He  was a devoted Christian who lived his values through his everyday work  and his family life.   Don is survived by his loving wife of 62 years, Carol. He is also  survived by  [[Page H2753]]  children Wendy, Scott, Jenifer, and Ty; 10 grandchildren; four great- grandchildren; and his sister, Velma Geraldson.   On behalf of Wisconsin's Fifth Congressional District, it is my  privilege to celebrate the life and legacy of Don L. Taylor for his  unparalleled contributions and impact on our community. I offer my  heartfelt condolences to Don's family and those who were lucky to call  him a friend.                            ____________________
