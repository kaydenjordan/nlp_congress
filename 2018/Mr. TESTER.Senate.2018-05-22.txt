 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Committee on  Veterans Affairs I continue to fight hard on behalf of new policies  that will allow VA to better serve our Nation's veterans. As a former  ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military  Construction and VA, I am also very mindful of the need to secure the  resources necessary for VA to properly carry out those policies.   The Choice program has been a disaster in Montana, and I am proud  that the VA MISSION Act streamlines VA community care in a manner that  makes more sense for veterans and their doctors and for community  providers, but as we provide the tools and authorities necessary for  veterans to get the care they need, I agree that we also need to secure  the resources necessary to achieve the goals of this legislation  without short-changing other domestic priorities. I am therefore  strongly supportive of including language in an upcoming appropriations  bill that provides veterans with the certainty they deserve, and I  remain committed to working with the chairman and vice chairman on this  effort.  [[Page S2809]]         Mr. President, I thank Senator Moran for his kind  comments.   I want to begin my comments by acknowledging the chairman of the  Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. We would not be here today taking  up the VA MISSION Act without the leadership of Senator Johnny Isakson  of the majority. He is a fierce advocate for veterans, and he has been  an incredible pleasure for me to work with. The bipartisanship and  collaboration on our Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee happens because  we leave politics at the door. That is possible because of Johnny's  personality and leadership style, as well as his commitment to the  veterans of this Nation.   I would also like to thank the many veterans service organizations  that have weighed in and provided positive feedback on the VA MISSION  Act. Thirty-eight veterans organizations representing millions of  veterans and service men and women nationwide support the VA MISSION  Act. They have been asking for Choice reform and responsible investment  in the VA, and this bill gets it done.   I also thank the House Veterans' Affairs Committee for working with  us in getting a bill drafted that we can all be proud of.   At the beginning of this Congress, we set out to draft a bill that  reforms community care and also strengthens the VA. As Senator Moran  pointed out, coming from a State like Montana--a rural State, 147,000  square miles--I know we cannot have a VA clinic in every community, but  veterans cannot always drive 2 hours to the nearest VA clinic, and they  certainly can't afford to wait months for an appointment. That is why  we need private healthcare to fill in the gaps when the VA cannot  deliver that healthcare.   I also know how much veterans need the services they get from a VA  clinic. In my dozens and dozens of face-to-face listening sessions with  veterans, they have told me that the kind of care they get from the VA  is important. They are surrounded by their peers, many of whom have  experienced the mental and physical implications of being in combat. VA  doctors and nurses know how to treat PTSD, toxic exposure, and other  wounds unique to their service.   The best defense against any effort to privatize the VA or send  veterans wholesale to the private sector is to make sure the VA is  living up to our promise to veterans. The VA MISSION Act recognizes  that there is a balance  [[Page S2820]]  between VA care and community care and invests in medical and clinical  staff to serve veterans at the VA. It builds capacity within the VA,  and it uses the private sector to fill in the gaps where the VA falls  short.   It takes the bill that Johnny and I wrote, the Caring for Our  Veterans Act, and adds a few things, but the foundation of this  legislation is something Senator Isakson and I have written over the  course of the last year with veterans groups. So I am incredibly proud  to be standing here today to hopefully push this bill to the  President's desk.   The Choice Program was created with an important mission: to make it  easier and faster for veterans to get healthcare. It hasn't worked like  that for many veterans--veterans like Tom, a retired U.S. Navy  commander of the Vietnam war, a Montanan. In his 24 years as a Navy  pilot, Tom spent a lot of time yelling to be heard over the roar of an  engine. That took a toll on his ability to hear. Three years ago, he  began the process of getting hearing aids from the VA. He got his  hearing test done, but when it came time to order the hearing aids, Tom  was told that he wasn't authorized.   The nearest VA facility to Tom was almost 3 hours away, so he and his  wife decided to drive to the closest civilian clinic, which was about  45 miles away in Sandpoint, ID, just across the line from his home in  Noxon, MT. There, he hit another snag. After weeks of back-and-forth  visits, the authorization was again denied because he was not a  resident of Idaho. So he returned to square one. He drove 5 hours to  Fort Harrison in Helena, 250 miles away.   With assistance from my office, he got the authorization for those  hearing aids. Tom had to drive two 5-hour roundtrips to a Choice  provider in Kalispell, but a few months later, he finally received his  hearing aids.   All in all, Tom drove nearly 20 hours to get those hearing aids, and  I am here to tell you that it shouldn't be that hard for a veteran to  get the healthcare they have earned from the VA. Do you know what the  worst part is? There was an audiologist in Tom's hometown the entire  time who could have helped him if the VA had just realized how  important it was to access that audiologist instead of driving 20 hours  down the road.   Unfortunately, Tom is not the only veteran with a story like this. I  could tell you about a veteran in Lake County who had several  appointments scheduled through the Choice Program, and then he was told  he wasn't eligible for Choice at all--after his appointment. When he  caught pneumonia, my office stepped in and got him the care he needed  through the Choice Program. I could tell you about Bruce, a veteran in  Billings who couldn't get a followup appointment through the Choice  Program after his hip surgery. He was told he wouldn't wait more than 5  days, and then he couldn't get anybody on the phone. We were able to  help him get the followup care he needed. Terry, in Butte, got a  procedure done through the Choice Program. It was approved, completed,  and then he was told he didn't qualify for the Choice Program. Again,  this U.S. Senator had to step in so Terry didn't have to foot the bill  for his healthcare.   I could go on and on. Veterans across the State of Montana have  called my office for help since the Choice Program was started. Their  frustrations over issues like scheduling, reimbursements, or traveling  long distances for care are a sorry way to say thank you to those folks  who have served this country.   It shouldn't take a Senate office stepping in to make sure the  government lives up to its promises to America's veterans, so Chairman  Isakson and I wrote a bill that reforms the entire system. We  negotiated with the House, the White House, veterans, and advocates to  move our bill forward.   The Caring for Our Veterans Act was a giant step forward. Thanks to  the leadership of the House Veterans Affairs Committee and our effort,  the Caring for Our Veterans Act is included in the VA MISSION Act.   Our bill gets rid of seven different community care programs,  including Choice, and replaces them with one community healthcare  system with a streamlined set of rules for veterans, local providers,  and VA staff. It will be much easier to understand.   Under the MISSION Act, if a veteran wants to get care in their  community, they can have a discussion with their doctor and decide what  is best. VA doctors and nurses won't have to spend time figuring out  which program to refer a veteran to.   Local providers who see veterans won't be waiting months for payments  from the VA. A new, streamlined payment system will make sure they are  getting paid in a timely manner.   Our bill holds the VA accountable and requires them to create a  business plan to tell us exactly how the agency will spend taxpayer  dollars if and when they ask for additional funding.   Our bill brings more providers to work at the VA, especially in rural  and Tribal areas and vet centers.   The bill breaks down barriers along State lines that prevent veterans  from accessing mental health care closer to home.   The bill expands the VA Caregiver Support Program to veterans of all  eras and their caregivers. This was a provision Senator Murray worked  on very hard. It was the right thing to do, and Senator Isakson made it  a priority of his.   The VA and community care are equally important parts of the VA  healthcare system. It will either starve the VA to death and empower  rural community hospitals or, as this bill does, strike a balance--the  right balance--between investing in the VA's ability to provide care  for our veterans and cutting the bureaucracy when it makes sense for a  veteran to go to a local doctor.   The VA MISSION Act is a bold, bipartisan product of working together  that puts healthcare decisions in the hands of veterans and breaks down  barriers to healthcare wherever it makes the most sense for a veteran  to get the care they need.   This Nation owes our veterans much more than a thank-you. Veterans  deserve a healthcare system that works for them regardless of where  they live, what medical condition they are struggling with, or their  means. Our bill gets rid of a one-size-fits-all system and creates a  more efficient and easier to navigate system for veterans.   I urge the Senate to pass the VA MISSION Act to send the message that  saying thank you isn't enough for those who put their lives on the line  for our Nation. We are going to deliver them a healthcare system that  is worthy of their service.   Mr. President, I turn the floor over to Senator Johnny Isakson,  chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee.
