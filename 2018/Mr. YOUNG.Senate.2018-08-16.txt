 Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Green Banner  Publications on their long and fruitful career in the publishing world.  As a true family-owned business, the Green family has always served  their customers as if they were one of their own. Their network of  local and weekly newspapers delivered current events to more than  60,000 homes in southern Indiana.   After 85 years of service, they have made the decision to close up  shop and end all publications. I thank them for their longtime  commitment, and I appreciate all of their hard work informing thousands  of Hoosiers in southern Indiana.                            ____________________
