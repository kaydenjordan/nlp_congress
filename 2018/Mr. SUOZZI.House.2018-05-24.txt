 Mr. Speaker, today marks the 350th anniversary of the  founding of my hometown, Glen Cove, New York, on May 24, 1668. Earlier  this year, we also celebrated the 100th anniversary of Glen Cove's  designation as a city.   I love Glen Cove. I served as the city's mayor from 1994 to 2001. My  father, Joseph, an Italian immigrant and an American success story, was  the first Suozzi to serve as mayor from 1956 to 1960.   My uncle, Vincent, also known as Jimmy Suozzi, was the second. He  served from 1973 to 1979 and again from 1984 to 1987. The most recent  Suozzi to serve as mayor, my cousin Ralph served from 2006 to 2013.   In fact, in the 100 years since Glen Cove became a city, a Suozzi has  served as mayor for 32 years. We Suozzis have devoted a great deal of  our lives to serving the city we love, and we have been repaid with the  satisfaction of knowing our friends, neighbors, and family will  continue to strive to work to ensure our best days are still yet to  come.   Glen Cove was the first industrial center of Long Island. The  Carpenter, Simkin, and Cole families purchased over 2,000 acres of  waterfront property overlooking Hempstead Harbor and the Long Island  Sound from the Native American Matinecock Tribe.                                time  1100    There they built a lumber mill and a gristmill powered by the fresh  water of Glen Cove Creek.   Originally named Musketa Cove, which means ``a place of rushes'' in  the Matinecock language, Musketa Cove went on to become one of the top  four ports for smuggling on Long Island, as no one wanted to pay the  English taxes on brandy, rum, and wine.   The area grew with professional craftsmen, weavers, carpenters, wool  spinners, tailors, millers, and shipbuilders. Corn farming developed in  the surrounding area.   A second major industry began in the early 1800s when Dr. Thomas  Garvie discovered massive clay deposits and began to mine and ship the  clay to potteries in New York City and elsewhere on Long Island. Dr.  Garvie also began a daily steamship operation between Glen Cove and New  York City that began to attract residents looking to escape the city's  sweltering summer heat.   Tourism-minded residents started to worry that the name Musketa Cove  [[Page H4726]]  sounded too much like mosquito cove, and, in 1834, they changed the  name to Glen Cove. It worked. By the mid-1850s tourism was booming with  daily steamship operations, leading to the development of six major  hotels, taverns, and boarding houses.   A new industry emerged. The Duryea Starch factory took advantage of  the fresh water, the gristmills, and the plentiful corn and became one  of the world's largest starch factories. In fact, in 1878, Duryea won  the Paris Gold Medal for the best starch in the world. Industry  flourished, tourism flourished, and Glen Cove began to attract more  attention.   In the early 1900s, some of the wealthiest families in the world made  Glen Cove their home. J. P. Morgan, the wealthy financier, who bailed  out the U.S. Government; F. W. Woolworth, the founder of the original  five-and-dime department store, whose marketing began the  commercialization of Christmas gift giving; and the Pratt family, who  amassed their fortune by controlling the kerosene market and,  ultimately, merging with John D. Rockefeller to form Standard Oil, all  built their massive summer estates in Glen Cove, leading to the moniker  of the ``Gold Coast.''   Between the industries that flourished on the waterfront and the Town  & Country magazine rated Gold Coast estates, Glen Cove with its vibrant  downtown of merchants was booming. Immigrants from all over the world  and America flocked to the area to work at the starch factory, or the  Ladew Leatherworks that tanned hides to be used for industrial belts.  Immigrants like my grandfather and father from Italy, and others from  Ireland, Poland, Germany, and elsewhere, worked not only in the  factories, but in the gardens, kitchens, pantries, and garages of the  Gold Coast estates. African Americans from the South migrated to the  area and found work, many as experts training and caring for  thoroughbreds and polo ponies.   Around 1917, Glen Cove residents, who saw the economic vibrancy from  the estates, the factories, and the vibrant downtown, populated by  Jewish, Italian, and English merchants, no longer wished to share their  plentiful property and sales tax dollars with the town of Oyster Bay,  under whose jurisdiction Glen Cove existed as a village. Community  leaders worked with the State legislature and the Governor to break off  and become Long Island's first city.   Glen Cove has traveled a long journey. Its population exploded, as  did much of Long Island, with veterans returning from World War II.   Its industrial vibrancy, which went on to include Li Tungsten, a  munitions factory; Mattiace Petrochemical; Columbia Ribbon and Carbon;  Powers Chemco; Konica; and Photocircuits, a circuit board manufacturer,  all left behind a negative environmental legacy that the City has now  cleaned up as it moves forward to a new age of development and  waterfront revitalization.   With hundreds of acres of publically-owned nature preserves, three  public beaches, golf courses, a fishing pier, and multiple ballfields  and parks, Glen Cove has been restored to a waterfront community with a  short commute to Manhattan that once attracted some of the wealthiest  families in the world.   Unlike much of Long Island, that is either all rich or all poor, or  all Black or all White, or all this or all that, Glen Cove remains a  diverse community with the wealthiest of the wealthy and a large supply  of low-income housing that is anchored by a solid middle class. It is  home to over 60 ethnicities: two Catholic churches, two Baptist  churches, two Jewish synagogues. It also has houses of worship for  African Methodist Episcopalians, Lutherans, Methodists, Episcopalians,  and Evangelicals. The Presbyterian church is one of the most beautiful  architectural marvels of the City. Glen Cove is also home to a Russian  Orthodox church, a Sikh gurdwara, Jehovah's Witnesses, and several  Latino churches.   Many movies, television shows, and commercials have been filmed in  Glen Cove, including Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest, starring  Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint; and Sabrina, starring Audrey Hepburn,  William Holden, and Humphrey Bogart. In fact, as mayor, I met Harrison  Ford while filming the remake of Sabrina with Julia Ormond and Greg  Kinnear. I met Michael Douglas while filming A Perfect Murder, and told  him how his dad, Kirk Douglas, had filmed A Lovely Way to Die in the  1960s in Glen Cove. A former Pratt estate, now the Webb Institute of  Naval Architecture, was stately Wayne Manor in Batman Forever. A host  of other movies, such as Annie Hall, Hair, Eyes Wide Shut, and one  obscure favorite, A New Leaf, were all filmed in Glen Cove as well.   Famous historical figures called Glen Cove home. Bobby Kennedy  resided in Glen Cove when he ran for United States Senator of New York.  Jackie Kennedy called West Island home after the President had been  shot.   The first female congresswoman from New York was Ruth Baker Pratt.  Baseball legends, including Roy Campanella, Whitey Ford and, more  recently, Yoenis Cespedes of the New York Mets. Billy Joel spent a  short time in Glen Cove. And Ashanti grew up in Glen Cove--I attended  her sweet 16 birthday party--while many other artists record here  regularly at Cove City Sound Studios.    And Sergeant Major Dan Daly, a marine, is one of only 19 men in U.S.  history, in our entire Nation, to have received the Medal of Honor,  twice.   Many of the old estates have been repurposed, including Killenworth,  a former Pratt estate that served as the home of the Soviet Ambassador  of the United Nations, and still serves the Russian Ambassador. Nikita  Khrushchev visited the estate after pounding his shoe on the lectern at  the United Nations back in the 1960s. Welwyn, another former Pratt  estate, is a 200-acre nature preserve and serves as the Nassau County  Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center.   Not every Glen Cover has a boldface name, but every Glen Cove  resident contributes in their own unique way to the community: the  first responders, the business owners, and the volunteers; the elected  officials, city employees, the coaches, and the moms and dads; the  teachers, preachers, and the gadflies that show up at the city council  meetings; the world-class restauranteurs and bakers, the  multigenerational shop owners, and the too many to mention fraternal  and service organizations. Glen Cove is alive and will continue long  after these words are forgotten.   As I said, I love Glen Cove and Glen Cove is why I love America. It  has diversity. It has history. And it has wonderful people.   Glen Cove has offered opportunity to so many families, including  mine. It is what makes America great.   E pluribus unum, ``out of many one.''   Glen Cove has every type of ethnicity, religion, and income group. It  enjoys low crime, low unemployment, and a robust community life. It  works and it will continue to work.   Happy anniversary and congratulations to my friends and neighbors.  God bless our warm city with the cool sound, and God bless the United  States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
