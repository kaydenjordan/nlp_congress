 Mr. Speaker, to know how high the stakes are in the  Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, you only have to  listen to your constituents. One of the many I have heard from is Kevin  Wittbrodt from Warren, Michigan, who writes: ``I'm a Marine Corps  veteran, and I'm covered by the VA system, but my wife isn't. She has  kidney disease and I've found it hard to get coverage for her with the  preexisting condition . . . but I found an affordable plan under the  ACA. This allows for continued treatment and she's still with me.''   ACA is not collapsing, contrary to what the Speaker is saying. The  Republicans are trying to sink ACA while it is very much afloat and  alive for Kevin, his wife, and millions and millions of others.  Republicans have been promising a plan for 7 years and never delivered.  They will not deliver now for all of America.                            ____________________
