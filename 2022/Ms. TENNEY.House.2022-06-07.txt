 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the participants  of this year's Congressional Art Competition in New York's 22nd  Congressional District.   Each year, dozens of high school students from across the 22nd  District submit pieces of art that they have spent countless hours and  put tremendous effort into perfecting; although every work of art is  abandoned, it is never perfect.   Last year's winner, Gavin Schiavi from New Hartford, submitted a  beautiful piece done completely with colored pencil, and our judges  were thoroughly impressed with the attention to detail and the amazing  work done by Gavin.   This year, we made a few additions to the competition. During the  last week of April, we held two community art shows where the students'  artwork was on display for the public. Over 100 people attended these  viewings, voting on two pieces as their favorite; those from Gianna  Yacobucci of New Hartford, and Salwa Nadeem of Vestal.   Following these events, our independent judges voted on the winners.  The first-place winner was Nadja Wall, with her painting ``The  Aquarium.'' In second was Anita Grant from New Hartford; third, Olivia  Muse from Vestal; and fourth, Emily Carlson from Holland Patent. Our  judges agreed this is one of the best years we have seen in terms of  competition and the quality of work submitted.   I thank all of the teachers and students for their work, and the  parents as well, for their support of these remarkable students and  their fantastic work.   I look forward to viewing everyone's work from all Members of  Congress in the hallways of Congress.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, since the onset of the pandemic, Congress  has passed several COVID-19 relief bills totaling an unprecedented $5.3  trillion. While some of this spending was unwise, other programs, like  the Paycheck Protection Program, provided much-needed relief to  employers and businesses devastated by the pandemic.   One particular area of concern is the COVID-19 Economic Industry  Disaster Loan program, otherwise known as EIDL. This program, unlike  other relief programs, was direct lending by the SBA, the Small  Business Administration. This means the agency did not partner with our  local banks and credit unions and, instead, approved and administered  these loans directly.   Since the COVID-19 EIDL funding passed, we have learned of countless  cases of fraud, waste, and abuse. The Federal Government is simply not  set up to be a direct lender.   This is one reason I introduced the House version of the Transparency  in COVID-19 Expenditures Act, which would require an audit of all  Federal COVID-19 relief spending. There is obviously room for  improvement in providing additional oversight and returning  fraudulently awarded funds back to the taxpayers.   In response, Ranking Member Luetkemeyer has done great work  introducing the COVID-19 Economic Industry Disaster Loans Fraud Statute  of Limitations Act of 2022 that will help fix part of the shortcomings  by expanding the statute of limitations for EIDL loans and fraud from 6  to 10 years, the same as bank fraud. This will give officials a greater  window to track down fraudulent activity and hold bad actors  accountable.   No one should be wrongly profiting from the need to distribute aid  during this pandemic. The American taxpayers deserve better, and I  applaud  [[Page H5252]]  the ranking member's efforts on this. I urge all my colleagues to  support this.    Madam Speaker, I am honored to partner with the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan) to introduce the  bipartisan Women-Owned Small Business Program Transparency Act. In 2014  and 2019, the Government Accountability Office found that the Women- Owned Small Business program has several oversight deficiencies and  needs to release more in-depth performance metrics to ensure it  addresses the needs of women-owned small businesses and the taxpayer.   This legislation today addresses these concerns, requiring the Small  Business Administration to annually disclose the total number of  businesses that are certified as women-owned by the SBA, the number  certified by third-party certifiers, and fees charged by third-party  certifiers, the dollar amount and percent of contracts to women-owned  small businesses, and the information on contracts incorrectly awarded.   For over two decades, the Women-Owned Small Business program has set  aside at least 5 percent Federal contracting dollars for certified  women-owned small businesses. This plays a small, but important, part  of ensuring that the Federal Government does not leave our Nation's  small businesses behind and that we continue to have a robust and  competitive contractor ecosystem to pull from.   In New York's 22nd Congressional District, small businesses make up  94 percent of all employers, and I have witnessed firsthand the  tremendous impact of women-owned small businesses. In fact, my own  family business is a women-owned business. Whether it is Curcio  Printing in the Southern Tier or AeroMed Technologies in Utica, our  communities and, yes, our taxpayers benefit when women-owned businesses  thrive.   With these additional metrics available to policymakers, it will pave  the way for future improvements to the Women-Owned Small Business  program. Only through full transparency can we ensure that this program  works effectively and efficiently for small businesses and for  taxpayers.   I thank, again, my partner and colleague, the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan), for cosponsoring this great piece of  bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join us in  supporting this.                                time  1645
