 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1569) to amend title 28, United States Code, to add  Flagstaff and Yuma to the list of locations in which court shall be  held in the judicial district for the State of Arizona.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1569         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DISTRICT COURTS IN THE JUDICIAL DISTRICT FOR THE                     STATE OF ARIZONA.         Section 82 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by       striking ``Globe, Phoenix, Prescott, and Tucson'' and       inserting ``Flagstaff, Globe, Phoenix, Prescott, Tucson, and       Yuma''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1569, a bill  unanimously supported by our entire Arizona delegation that will amend  title 28 of the U.S. Code to add the cities of Flagstaff and Yuma to  the list of locations in which Federal district court can be held in my  home State of Arizona.   The U.S. Code is outdated. It has not been amended since it was  enacted in 1948. It is preposterous that right now, district court  matters can only be held in Globe, Phoenix, Prescott, and Tucson.   That means Yuma and Flagstaff residents must travel at least 100  miles to attend a hearing or report for jury duty. That is totally  unacceptable and unnecessary.   A pillar of the United States structure of democracy is for all  Americans to have access to the courts, whether that is by literal  location or by reducing cost barriers. We are weakening that pillar  when residents must drive over 100 miles for their day in court.   Access to justice should not be dictated by where you live. I am  proud to support this legislation because it will have a tremendous  impact on the residents in these parts of Arizona.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I hope the  Senate acts  [[Page H5329]]  swiftly and delivers H.R. 1569 to the President for his signature.   It is time for Arizona to have a more efficient and effective court  system.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran), the sponsor of H.R. 1569.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman O'Halleran for his  leadership on this important legislation. I also thank Chairman Nadler  for working with me and advancing this bill through the House Judiciary  Committee. It is going to make a positive difference to Arizonans. And  I thank Representative Collins, as well, for his support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time
