 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Cuban  people in their fight for freedom under the Communist dictatorship.  Over the past few years, the situation on the island has rapidly  deteriorated with limited access to essentials like food, medicine,  clean water, and electricity.   When the people rose up in record numbers to oppose the regime, they  were attacked, brutalized, and, in some cases, disappeared.   We stand with the Cuban people and support their mission. That is why  I am encouraging the President to provide direct aid like food,  medicine, diapers, internet, and vaccines directly to the Cuban people  and to stop arms shipments from Venezuela and Russia that are being  used against the Cuban people.   Lead the free world in support of the demonstrators. We expect  democratic nations to stands for democracy.   My prayers are with all the Cubans, including those in my home State  of Florida, whose loved ones are on the island.                            ____________________
