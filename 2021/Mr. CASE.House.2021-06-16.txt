 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues for so many to  recognize and honor a stamp just issued by the U.S. Postal Service  that, with stunning simplicity, remembers, recognizes, and honors one  of the most remarkable and inspirational stories in the whole of our  country's history.   It is a story of tragedy, perseverance, and triumph that is so  quintessentially American, that goes so deeply to our essence, and that  offers the most fundamental lessons that we must never forget. And that  is the point of this stamp, that we never forget the story of the  Japanese-American soldiers of World War II and their famous motto,  which is its own lesson: ``Go for broke.''   For many of us, the story is well-known and has instructed and  inspired our own lives. But for a growing number of our fellow citizens  of our country and world it is not. So permit me just a brief  retelling.   As World War II loomed, Americans of Japanese ancestry were beginning  their third generation, or nisei, in substantial communities, yet they  remained largely marginalized because of their race. In Hawaii, they  constituted over one-third of our population, yet largely still labored  on plantations or worked in small businesses. The same was true on the  West Coast, from Washington through Oregon to San Diego.   Some nisei saw war with Japan coming and sought to enlist in our  armed services, but they were largely denied out of race and suspicion,  and sought to prove themselves through service in the Guard or in  Hawaii, the Varsity Victory Volunteers.  [[Page H2887]]    Pearl Harbor changed everything. Infamously, over 100,000 Japanese  were interned for their race, an indelible stain on our national  fabric. After years of Japanese Americans pushing to be allowed to  prove their loyalty by enlisting and fighting, the military finally  relented with the 100th Infantry Battalion; the 442nd in the military  intelligence service; and the 1399th Engineer Construction Battalion.   The rest, as they say, is legend. The 100th and 442nd fought their  way through Sicily, through France and Italy, and ended up with the  highest number of decorations for their length of service in the  history of our military. We honored them in 2010 with our Congressional  Gold Medal.   But was that enough?   Would it all be remembered?   Three Japanese-American women in California, who themselves had been  incarcerated--Fusa Takahashi, Chiz Ohira, and Aiko King--thought not,  and they fought a 16-year effort to gain approval of this beautiful  stamp from the U.S. Postal Service, impeccably designed by Antonio  Alcala. It was issued just weeks ago.   The design is taken from a 1944 photo in the field of 442nd Private  First Class Shiroku ``Whitey'' Yamamoto, a nisei born and raised in the  plantation village of Ninole on the Hamakua coast of my home island of  Hawaii.   It is such a fitting tribute, so appropriate. To look into his eyes,  Mr. Speaker, you see fatigue; you see commitment; but most of all, you  see gaman, perseverance through great adversity to a better place.   No better fitting tribute could be issued at this point than this  stamp. I am so honored to stand with my colleagues to honor the  issuance of this stamp in memory of the Japanese-American soldiers of  World War II.   I am honored to be joined by my colleagues here today who will speak  also, many of whom labored long and hard with the rest of us towards  the issuance of this stamp.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano),  who is the second vice chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific  American Caucus and chair of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr.  Kahele).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
