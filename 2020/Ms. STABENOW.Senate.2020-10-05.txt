 Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to  the proud Michigan residents who have served in our Nation's military  and their families.   When our country was at risk of fracturing in a brutal Civil War, the  people of Michigan volunteered. When fascism threatened freedom around  the world, the people of Michigan fought back. And when faced with new  dangers--from terrorism to pandemic diseases--the people of Michigan  remain willing to put our lives on the line on behalf of the American  people.   Whenever and wherever our Nation needs us, the people of Michigan  always respond. In some families, this spirit of service stretches back  generations.   The Armsteads are one such Michigan family. Peter Armstead was  originally from England, but when his new Nation needed him, he  answered the call. He fought during the Civil War  [[Page S6037]]  and barely survived his time in a Confederate prisoner of war camp in  Mississippi.   Earl Armstead, Peter's grandson, served in France during World War I,  where he was put in charge of destroying enemy bridges. He came home  suffering from post-traumatic stress and, like so many of our veterans,  struggled to talk about what he had seen.   And Robert Armstead, Earl's nephew, also fought in Europe during  World War II. He served in the Tank Destroyer Battalion and took part  in the Po Valley campaign in Italy. His unit was being readied for the  Pacific Campaign when the war ended.   All three of these veterans were willing to sacrifice everything in  defense of our Nation. This past August, a grateful nation honored them  with side-by-side burials at Great Lakes National Cemetery in Holly.   Dr. Robert Armstead II, Robert's son, worked to make this historic  interment happen. He believes veterans deserve to be remembered and  honored for their service. I couldn't agree more.   My own father, who served during World War II, always told me that  veterans should not stand at the back of any line. Our Nation must keep  its promises to our heroes who have served, whether it is healthcare,  education, a chance at a good job, the military recognitions they  earned in service, or a place of honor in our national cemeteries,  places that Robert Armstead II calls ``sacred holy ground.''   On this Veterans Day and every day, I salute all of Michigan's  veterans past and present. I salute their families, who sacrifice  alongside them and help ensure that their stories are never forgotten.   Thank you.                            ____________________
