 Mr. President, during the last week, I spent some time  traveling through Texas, meeting with constituents, and talking about  some of the legislation we have been working on here in Washington and,  perhaps most importantly, spent a little time listening to what was on  their minds.   One of the things we talked about was the fact that in 2017, more  than 70,000 Americans died of drug overdoses. That is according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The opioid epidemic, which  contributed mightily to that number, has affected every State, every  city, and every community. My constituents, like all of our  constituents, are in search of real solutions to try to support those  leading the fight on the ground.   I had the chance to spend a little bit of time in Tyler, TX, which is  in East Texas, which we affectionately call ``behind the Pine  Curtain.'' I learned from some of the folks in Tyler about how  substance abuse has affected that area and what we can do better to  serve the people who are impacted. I heard from pharmacists, healthcare  providers, law enforcements officers, community leaders, and other  experts about their efforts. We talked about the need for a holistic  approach that focused on reducing supply and also reducing demand,  helping those with substance abuse problems, and preventing drug abuse  from occurring and spreading into the future.   We talked about some of the legislation we have passed here in  Congress to try to help equip them with the tools they would need in  order to fight this fight--a bill we call the SUPPORT for Patients and  Communities Act. This legislation provides critical tools to those  communities in the fight against substance abuse. It reauthorizes  programs to reduce demand for narcotics and provides tools for  pharmacists, prescribers, and law enforcement so that  [[Page S3148]]  they can work together more seamlessly to combat opioid addiction. It  also provides support for those recovering from substance abuse  disorders by providing expanded treatment options and recovery  services. It takes unprecedented steps to combat the opioid crisis, and  it received overwhelming bipartisan support in both Chambers.    Now, I don't blame people who may listen to this and say: Well, I  never heard about that before. That is what happens when we pass  overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation here in Congress. If there is not  a big fight about it, if it is not on the cable news, if it is not on  social media, then it happens without people paying much notice. Yet it  is important work that happens every day here in Washington, DC-- Republicans and Democrats working together, trying to solve problems,  trying to equip those on the frontlines with the tools they need in  order to fight that fight.   Folks in East Texas told me about how the new grants under the  SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act may help to strengthen their  efforts and help ease the pain of the opioid epidemic.   Then I took a trip over to Lufkin High School in Lufkin, TX, which is  also in East Texas, to meet with students, educators, and  administrators to talk about the GEAR UP program. This is a competitive  grant program that helps historically underrepresented students to  achieve college and career readiness through academic, social, and  planning support.   For example, if you come from a family in which no one has previously  gone to college, well, you may not really know what it is you need to  do, starting even in the seventh grade, to begin to prepare--what  courses you need to take, what prerequisites are going to be required  for you to be considered by the college of your choice. If you decide  to take a career path that doesn't involve a 4-year college--through  one of our community colleges--and get a certificate so you can qualify  for a good-paying job, let's say, as a certified welder, you need to  prepare early.   The folks in East Texas told me how these grants under the GEAR UP  program help one to do exactly that. The GEAR UP program recognizes  that college and career readiness begin early. That is why it is so  important that the cohort that is first helped by these GEAR UP grants  is of those in the seventh grade--pretty early. I don't remember having  a plan in the seventh grade, to be sure. If I had had a plan, I am not  sure exactly what it would have been. I came from a family in which  going to college was expected. As a matter of fact, I never entertained  any other idea. Yet we have to recognize that many young students don't  have that sort of example in their own households and that they need  some additional help in order to pursue their educations and prepare  for good, well-paying jobs.   The good thing about the GEAR UP program is that it doesn't use a  blanket approach to support students because we know what works well in  one State and in one region of the country may not work as well in  another. Instead, the GEAR UP program gives local leaders the  flexibility to cater to their students' needs.   The best part about GEAR UP is that it is actually a government  program that works. GEAR UP students graduate from high school at a  higher rate than their peers, regardless of ethnicity or income, and  they attend college at a higher rate.   In Lufkin, 3,000 students have benefited from more than $10 million  in Federal GEAR UP grants over the last two decades, and last week, I  had the opportunity to hear what it meant to them personally.  Statewide, Texas students have benefited from $885 million in GEAR UP  grants over the last 20 years, and we have seen incredible results.   I believe there are additional steps we can take to ensure that local  leaders have the flexibility they need in order to tailor their  programs appropriately, so earlier this year, I introduced the GEAR UP  for Success Act, which will provide more flexibility to school  districts on how they may use those funds so that local jurisdictions  can better tailor these programs to their students' specific needs. It  would reduce the local cost share significantly--by half--that is  required to receive a GEAR UP grant, which means more students will  benefit from these funds and these programs.   I appreciate the folks in Tyler, in Lufkin, and in the many other  cities I visited in Texas last week for taking the time to share with  me their thoughts and ideas so that we can bring more Texas common  sense to Washington, DC.                               Border Security    Mr. President, on another matter, we know that Central American  migrants continue to make their way to our southern border in record  numbers and that law enforcement, city officials, and nongovernmental  organizations are struggling to manage this influx of humanity. We are  seeing people arrive en masse, and it is not uncommon to see multiple  groups, each with hundreds of people, arrive in a single day.   My State has 1,200 miles of a common border with Mexico, and I  believe that border security is one of the Federal Government's most  important responsibilities. These are people who are showing up at our  border and literally turning themselves in to the Border Patrol because  they know that by exploiting gaps in our asylum laws, they are  virtually guaranteed entry into the United States. As well, the human  smugglers who get rich by smuggling this human cargo from Central  America, across Mexico, and into the United States are making untold  millions of dollars in this very profitable business.   Last week, one of the large groups who came to El Paso broke a  record. The Border Patrol encountered a group of more than 1,000  illegal immigrants--more than double the previous record of 421 that  was set last month. Only 39 of the people who were traveling in that  group were single adults. The rest were either families or children who  were traveling alone, and that was no mistake. The smugglers know that  if they send unaccompanied children or families, they can exploit those  vulnerabilities in our immigration and asylum laws and successfully  place those individuals in the United States, only to be told to show  up at later dates for court hearings that are maybe months or even  years into the future. Surprise, surprise--most do not show up, and  they successfully make their way into the United States without  complying with our immigration laws. We simply don't have the  facilities, the funding, or the resources to detain and properly care  for many of these individuals, let alone these children and families.   Regardless of where each individual Member of Congress stands on  immigration generally, I hope everyone in this Chamber can agree that  there is a problem and that it must be addressed urgently.   In the short term, I hope appropriators can come to an agreement soon  to provide desperately needed funding to those who are working to  manage this humanitarian crisis in Texas and in other border States.  Without the Federal Government's assistance, funding to support these  migrants may soon dry up, and conditions in these facilities will  rapidly deteriorate.   Additional funding is a much needed bandaid to help manage this  crisis right now, but we need to continue working on longer term  solutions so that we can stop the flow of migrants without hurting our  country economically or doing it in a way that is inconsistent with our  values and our laws.   Our country relies, for example, on a strong trading relationship  with Mexico. Goods and services that were traded between our countries  in 2018 totaled more than $670 billion. Much of the trade we have is  between Texas and Mexico. Mexico is by far and away my State's top  trading partner. In 2018, Texas exported nearly $110 billion in goods  to Mexico. That is roughly four times the number of exports to our No.  2 trading partner--Canada. We also imported more than $107 billion from  our southern neighbor. That includes everything from motor vehicle  parts, to computer equipment, to tractors, to avocados. It is not  uncommon to see certain products, like automobiles, cross the border  multiple times throughout the production process before they eventually  make their way to consumers. It is a fact of life that businesses and  jobs in our communities in Texas and literally around the country rely  on a strong trading relationship between the United States and Mexico-- something I have always supported and for which I will continue to  advocate.  [[Page S3149]]    I appreciate President Trump's unwavering commitment to securing our  southern border and enforcing our immigration laws, and I will continue  to support his efforts to stop the flow of illegal immigration, to  improve physical security, to close dangerous loopholes in the law, and  to provide our frontline officers and agents the tools and resources  they need to carry out their sworn mission.   It is important to remember that with any actions that we take to  secure our southern border, we must also keep in mind the important  role that Mexico plays in the economy of the United States. My State  enjoys a strong relationship economically with Mexico because of that  1,200-mile common border and because of the sort of trading and  commercial relationships I described a moment ago. Any decisions that  would disrupt that relationship need to be closely examined and debated  and be subject to a cost-benefit analysis.   I believe there are solutions that can secure our border, that can  fix this mass influx of humanity that is coming across as a result of  the exploitation of our asylum laws, and that can also deliver a secure  economy not just for Texas but for the entire United States. In Laredo,  TX, 14,000 to 16,000 trucks a day cross the international border  between Laredo, TX, and Nuevo Laredo, and that is an important part of  the Texas and local economies. They understand the importance of that  cross-border trade, and they are interested in working with us to try  to make sure we deal with what is broken when it comes to our asylum  laws.   My friend and colleague Henry Cuellar, who is a Democrat from Laredo  and represents that part of the State, has joined with me in a  bipartisan, bicameral bill to fix what the Border Patrol and the  Department of Homeland Security say needs fixing in our asylum laws  because there is basically now a superhighway leading from Central  America, through Mexico, into the United States, and we are seeing more  and more people being drawn to the opportunities they have when they  enter the United States and exploit those broken laws.   My plea to all of our colleagues here on a bipartisan basis is this:  We need to get serious about fixing these problems. I think the  American people look at us and wonder why it is we have let partisan  politics overcome our willingness to do the things we said we would do  when we ran for office to benefit the American people. This is one of  those issues that require a congressional solution. Nobody else can fix  it. We need to get serious about finding solutions and getting this  fixed as soon as we possibly can.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
