 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the president of  Stater Bros. Markets, Mr. George Frahm, who will retire at the end of  October, after more than 47 years of service.   Under George's leadership, Stater Bros. has become the largest  privately-owned supermarket chain in my district and a staple in our  community for thousands of employees.   George began his career as a clerk's helper and janitor before rising  to management and eventually being named the company's president.   In addition to his work in the community, he went on to lead the  California Grocers Educational Foundation, helping to secure college  scholarships for students throughout our State.   George will leave a legacy of hard work, vision, and service, and he  will be missed by his Stater Bros. family. I would like to thank him  for his tireless service to the Inland Empire community and our  families, and I wish him all the best as he begins his retirement.                            ____________________
