 Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the  Justice in Policing Act, introduced yesterday by my colleagues Senator  Harris from California and Senator Booker from New Jersey.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. This  legislation is urgently needed after the death of George Floyd in  police custody in Minnesota, which has sent shock waves through the  Nation and the world. I am pleased that the protests have been largely  peaceful, and that where the Senate sits in Washington, our local  leaders have moved to deescalate tensions.   I was pleased on Monday to hold a Facebook Live session with Hillary  Shelton, the director of the NAACP's Washington bureau and senior vice  president for advocacy and policy, as well as Marc Morial, the  president and chief executive officer of the National Urban League and  the former mayor of New Orleans. We talked about this legislation in  some detail.   I received feedback from several of my constituents at my Facebook  Live event on how to improve relations between police and the  communities they serve and how to rebuild trust between them.   Before they first put on a badge, a police officer takes an oath to  uphold the law. Most do so with the best intentions and carry out their  duties with a willingness to help communities. But in far too many  communities around the country, the system in which they work has been  failing. People are dying at the hands of police, predominantly people  of color. Accountability has been tied to public videos rather than  doing the right thing. Incremental reform is no longer an option when  it comes to police reform. We have been patient, but we must do better  to protect the civil rights, human rights, and lives of men, women, and  children of this country.   Congress must finally pass a comprehensive plan to improve training  and community relations, hold police  [[Page S2854]]  accountable, and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the  communities they serve. To that end, I have been proud to work with my  colleagues Senator Booker and Senator Harris in creating a package of  reforms and accountability measures that shows where we need to be as a  nation with a fair and just system of laws.   The package focuses on three major pillars: accountability, data  collection, and training policies. I was proud that two major pieces  included in the Justice in Policing Act are from bills that I have  introduced for many Congresses: the End Racial and Religious Profiling  Act and the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act.    The End Racial and Religious Profiling Act is designed to enforce the  constitutional right to equal protection under the law by eliminating  racial- and religious-based discriminatory profiling at all levels of  law enforcement by changing the policies and procedures. It allows  police to focus their work more accurately rather than wasting  resources on blanket stereotypes. It requires enhanced data collection  for DOJ to track and monitor discriminatory profiling. It holds State  and local enforcement agencies accountable by conditioning Federal  funds on their adoption of policies and best practices to combat  profiling by officers.   The Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act takes a comprehensive  approach on how local police organizations can adopt performance-based  standards to ensure that instances of misconduct will be minimized  through training and oversight. The bill provides that, if such  instances do occur, they be properly investigated. It requires the  creation of law enforcement accreditation standards and recommendations  based on President Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing.   This bill also enhances funding for so-called pattern and practice  discrimination cases. In Baltimore City, for example, the police  department voluntarily entered into a consent decree in 2017 with the  U.S. Department of Justice to overhaul the police department after the  tragic death of Freddie Gray in police custody in 2015, which led to  civil unrest in Baltimore.   I might add, I am very pleased that we have seen progress in  Baltimore, as evidenced by the types of protests after the Floyd  tragedy. They have been almost all peaceful.   In Baltimore, the Department of Justice report had found a widespread  pattern and practice of illegal and unconstitutional conduct by the  Baltimore Police Department through targeting African-American  residents for disproportionate and disparate treatment. The U.S.  District Court for the District of Maryland is now overseeing a  complete overhaul of the Baltimore Police Department.   We have made progress.   Other important provisions of the Justice in Policing Act will save  lives. The bill bans choke holds at the Federal level and conditions  law enforcement funding on State and local governments banning choke  holds. It bans no-knock warrants in drug cases at the Federal level and  conditions law enforcement funding on State and local governments  banning no-knock warrants. It requires that deadly force be used only  as a last resort and requires officers to employ deescalation  techniques first. It requires better data collection on how and under  what circumstances police officers use force. We need these standards.  We have seen too many tragedies on the misuse of power and force by law  enforcement.   The bill takes important steps to demilitarize our police forces--we  are a civilian society; we are not run as a military state--and  encourage more professionalism, consistent with changing our police  officers' mentality from a warrior mindset to a guardian mindset.   The legislation limits the transfer of military-grade equipment to  State and local law enforcement. It requires Federal uniformed police  officers to wear body cameras and requires State and local law  enforcement to use existing Federal funds to ensure the use of police  body cameras.   This comprehensive legislation takes several important steps to hold  police accountable in courts. It makes it consistent with standard  practice to prosecute offending officers and enables individuals to  recover damages in civil courts when law enforcement officers violate  their constitutional rights by changing qualified immunity for law  enforcement.   Finally, the legislation gives better tools to the Department of  Justice and State attorneys general to investigate and prosecute police  misconduct. It reinvests in our communities by supporting critical  community-based programs to change the culture of law enforcement and  empower our communities to reimagine public safety in an equitable and  just way.   As I mentioned earlier, in Baltimore, after the Freddie Gray tragedy,  we recognized that we needed to do a better job in working with  communities and police, and we reached out. Part of our consent decree  is to improve that relationship, that direct relationship between  police and community.   The legislation that I have mentioned on the floor here establishes  public safety innovation grants for community-based organizations to  create local commissions and task forces to help communities to  reimagine and develop concrete, just, and equitable public safety  approaches.   Let me share with you two stories. I do this because there are so  many people who have come forward and shared their experiences growing  up and living in a society of discrimination.   I remember very vividly, after the Freddie Gray episode in Baltimore,  I met with a group of community leaders in Sandtown, where the tragedy  occurred, and listened to their accounts of how they grew up with the  fear of police and the stories of how they were singled out or  discriminated against by traffic stops and by other harassment just  because of the color of their skin.   So let me share with you two stories that were reported recently in  the paper. One is the story of Michael Turner, his encounter years ago  with the Montgomery County police. Turner was only 18 years of age when  this encounter occurred.         Officers had come to break up a party in the suburban       county and quickly focused on Turner and his fellow African       American friends. They checked IDs. No one was drunk. The       cops asked them to move along. ``One officer looks at us,''       Turner recounted, ``and says, `Now go back to your       projects.' ''        The broader context of the email, written eight days ago,       was Turner's effort to explain why he wanted a protest in       downtown Silver Spring. ``We come in peace, commander,''       wrote Turner, 36. ``March with us. It's time for a change.       I'm ready to help, are you?''        The email set off six days of written and phone dialogue       between Turner and Captain Darren Francke, who commands the       Silver Spring police district for the Montgomery County       department. It culminated Sunday afternoon when Turner,       Francke and three other Montgomery County police officers       took a knee in front of more than 200 protesters facing them       and stretching half a block down Georgia Avenue.        Everyone sat still for 2 minutes 53 seconds, the estimated       time George Floyd lay unconscious with his neck pinned below       the knee of a Minneapolis police officer.        . . . . Turner's protest in the sprawling suburb just miles       north of the District had a different twist: It was a       demonstration put together with the active help of the       police.        To Captain Francke, it all made sense. He had served in the       Pennsylvania Army National Guard and joined the Montgomery       police in 1996. A father of three, including a daughter who       also came to the protest, he previously commanded the       department's major crimes division--supervising murder       investigations throughout the county.        ``Thank you for sharing your story,'' Francke wrote. ``I       don't blame you for having a chip on your shoulder. I am not       proud of some things that a few officers did before and now.       . . . I am saddened and angered by what happened to George       Floyd, and a number of other events over many years that were       clearly violations of the values that the vast majority of       officers have. My officers and I will march with you. With       your assistance, we will also help to keep the event safe       from those that would want to turn your message into       something else. We want your message to be heard.''        By 1 p.m. Sunday, more than 200 people had gathered at       Veterans Plaza in downtown Silver Spring. They marched 3       blocks to the corner of Colesville Road and Georgia Avenue,       halted, and waited for Turner to lead everyone to one knee.       He swayed back and forth, his head buried in a towel weeping       as he thought of Floyd's family. Francke stood next to him,       clapping. Next a quick prayer. Then the kneel. The crowd       erupted with applause at the 2 minute 53 seconds mark as the       group marched back to Veterans Plaza.        A series of speakers addressed the crowd. . . . About 3:30       p.m., Turner handed the microphone back to Francke. The       commander told the crowd about Turner's encounter with the       police 18 years earlier. And then the captain turned toward       him. ``I'm sorry,'' he said.   [[Page S2855]]     That sorry, I think, underscores the importance that what happened in  Minneapolis affects everybody in our country, not just the African- American community.   Let me close with one additional story that was also reported and  brings out a very familiar challenge for African-American families.   As the day drew to a close, DeShawn Rasberry, age 6, and his younger  brother, Davian, age 4, were already tired. They had been at  Pennsylvania Avenue and 13th Street since noon with their mother,  Janessa Smith, age 28, handing out water, Gatorade, and granola bars as  people were passing. The brothers had never seen so many people before,  and neither had Ms. Smith. It was the family's first protest.   ``Do you know why all these people are here?'' the mother asked her  younger son. He stared at the crowd, munching on his granola bar that  had crumbled to pieces in his hands. The mother said, ``They're out  here for you.''   Davian was dressed in a Superman cap and a matching T-shirt and  smiled and nodded. Ms. Smith had explained to her sons that they were  here to ``protest,'' which means standing up for something, she said,  and to help others. She hadn't told them that the protest was against  police brutality, spurred by the killing of a man with their same skin  color in police custody.   ``They're so young now, still so young,'' Ms. Smith said. ``And right  now they're in love with law enforcement. . . . I don't want to spoil  that. Not yet.''   She pointed out that neither of her children were afraid of police.  Ms. Smith looked at her sons, both just barely coming up to her waist,  gripping cold water bottles. One day she will have to give them ``the  talk'' about police officers, she thought to herself, but not today.   Let's rise to the occasion so that Janessa Smith never has to give  that heartbreaking talk to her boys in Prince George's County, MD. I  urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to focus on our common  humanity and respect for the rule of law.   There are examples of best practices in community policing that  should be a guide nationwide. Let us work together to guarantee equal  justice under the law and fulfill the promise of our Constitution in  order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, and ensure  domestic tranquility.   Let this Nation finally guarantee ``Equal Justice Under Law,'' which  is carved in the marble of the entrance to the Supreme Court, which is  just across the street from our Senate Chamber.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
