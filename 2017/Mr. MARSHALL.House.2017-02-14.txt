 Mr. Speaker, I too am honored to be part of the 115th  Congress, the freshman class, a group of people who want to work  together.    I think back to my campaign the last two years, and one of the most  common concerns I had from people were: Why can't people in Congress  get along? Why can't you respect each other?   What I saw day after day was the left and the right yelling at each  other and the press throwing gasoline on top of that fire.   I remember, growing up, my dad had a saying: If you don't have  something good to say about somebody, then don't say it. That is always  something that I have taken to heart.   I think back to my sixth grade teacher, Mrs. Tyner. Her word for the  entire year was ``respect.'' She taught us to respect ourselves and  respect each other, and that is what I would like to bring to the 115th  Congress, is respect for each other, for each other's points of views,  and never question someone's intentions or motivations.   I believe in iron sharpening iron and coming up with better ideas  together. I believe in defining problems together, to talk about the  problem, and then discuss solutions together.   The hope is that you and I, my friends across the aisle and down the  aisle, together we can come up with better solutions for this country.  I believe that national defense is not a Republican or a Democrat  issue. I believe the economy is not a conservative or a liberal issue.  I think these are American issues that we need to fight to make better.  I certainly don't think that health care is a Republican or Democrat  issue.   My pledge is to work with civility, to work with respect toward my  colleagues across the aisle and down the aisle. I look forward to  making America a better place to live.  [[Page H1164]]
