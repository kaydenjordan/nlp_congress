 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5053, the Justice for  Juveniles Act. This bill eliminates some of the obstacles for juvenile  prisoners seeking relief from our correctional facilities in Federal  court.   Juvenile offenders often lack the knowledge to pursue and exhaust all  the complex administrative rules and grievance procedures in our  correctional facilities. H.R. 5053 will provide juvenile offenders  quicker access to courts when they feel they are being abused or  mistreated.   President Trump has been a leader on criminal justice reform. He  signed into law the bipartisan First Step Act in December 2018. The  President has also commuted the lengthy prison sentences of several  nonviolent offenders and, more recently, pardoned Alice Johnson, who  served 22 years of a life sentence for nonviolent drug trafficking.   This bill is another important step in criminal justice reform. I was  honored to be the Republican lead on this bill. It was a pleasure to  work with Ms. Scanlon from Pennsylvania, the bill's primary sponsor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, this bill is a good piece of bipartisan  legislation.   I agree with Ms. Scanlon; it is an important first step. But I also  think it is important to recognize that, when we do place juvenile  offenders in the adult criminal justice system, we are doing some  things in a different way, and they have unique challenges that they  face in those systems.   This is neither the time, necessarily, nor the place for the larger  debate, but I think the least we can do is exhaust some of those  administrative remedies, given what we know.   I was proud to be the Republican colead on this bill, and I look  forward to its passage.  [[Page H4571]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, under current law, the health and dental insurance  industries are exempt from some Federal competition laws and related  enforcement actions.   Congress established this exemption in 1945 at a time when Federal  antitrust law was less developed and more likely to disrupt  procompetitive practices in the insurance industry under State laws.   H.R. 1418 would update antitrust law and apply it to the business of  health insurance in ways designed to better protect consumers. At the  same time, H.R. 1418 would still permit the health insurance industry  to engage in procompetitive collaboration that benefits customers.   Mr. Speaker, this bill represents another small step designed to  improve America's healthcare system. I encourage my colleagues to  support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I urge my colleagues  to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 227, Savanna's Act.   Savanna's Act is named after Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, a 22-year- old member of the Spirit Lake Tribe, who was murdered in my district in  August of 2017. Her disappearance and murder devastated the community  and the entire State of North Dakota.   Tragically, Savanna was found dead 8 days after she was reported  missing. Thankfully, her baby was found alive, despite being cut from  Savanna's womb. Savanna's story brought to light the fact that the data  regarding missing and murdered indigenous people, particularly women  and girls, is scattered across various government databases, if it even  exists at all.   Savanna's heartbreaking story, unfortunately, is not unique. A woman  named Olivia Lone Bear disappeared from the Fort Berthold Reservation  just a month later, in October of 2017. She was found in a submerged  truck in Lake Sakakawea in July of 2018.   These are just two recent examples from my State. There are hundreds  more across the Nation.   Savanna's Act will begin to help address this crisis of missing and  murdered indigenous people. The bill will establish guidelines and best  practices for law enforcement agencies across the country. It will also  improve coordination amongst those agencies. Finally, it will enhance  reporting, recordkeeping, and communication for law enforcement and  families of victims.   This legislation is needed because Native American and Alaska Native  women face a murder rate 10 times higher than the national average.  Shockingly, 84 percent of women in these communities experience some  form of violence in their lifetime.   The rural nature of most Native American communities, increased  levels of poverty and addiction, and other circumstances pose unique  challenges. Because of outdated databases and lack of coordination  between law enforcement agencies, there is no reliable way of knowing  how many indigenous women actually do go missing each year.   Savanna's Act addresses this disturbing increase in missing and  murdered Native American women by creating new guidelines for  investigation of these cases and by incentivizing the implementation of  these new guidelines.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 227, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Torres, Mr. Newhouse, and my colleagues in  the Senate, Senator Cramer and Senator Hoeven. This is not the first  time in my short time in Congress that I have been on the floor talking  about this bill, and I think it is also important to remember people  who came before us. Senator Heitkamp was a champion of this in the last  Congress. And through this process we have gotten a more targeted and  workable solution.   This bill allows U.S. Attorneys in Indian Country more autonomy and  authority that is important to law enforcement, and that is  particularly important in missing cases. And I think it is also  important to recognize that these don't always happen in rural areas or  actually on the reservation.   Savanna Greywind, while a member of the Spirit Lake Tribe, was in  Fargo, North Dakota, the largest city in my State when this incident  occurred.   So this is a good bill, it has been a long time coming, and I really  appreciate everybody's hard work. With that, I recommend we pass it,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5546, the Effective  Assistance of Counsel in the Digital Era Act.   As a defense attorney, I cannot overemphasize the importance of  protecting attorney-client privilege. The ability to have confidential  discussions with a client for the purpose of providing legal advice is  foundational to providing effective assistance of counsel.   This bill will help modernize our criminal justice system by  extending attorney-client privilege to electronic communications sent  or received through the Bureau of Prisons' email system.   This will allow incarcerated individuals to communicate with their  attorneys efficiently and privately. And it would prohibit the Bureau  of Prisons from monitoring privileged email communications.   We all agree that attorney-client privilege is a vital component of  our legal system, as it helps to ensure that a criminal defendant has  an effective advocate in the courtroom.   Emails between incarcerated individuals and their attorneys should  absolutely fall under attorney-client protections. This bill would  protect the rights of incarcerated men and women to speak openly and  honestly with their attorneys via email without fear that the  prosecution is monitoring those communications.    Other methods of communication, such as in-person meetings and  letters, can be particularly burdensome and time consuming. Even if an  attorney is in close proximity to the incarcerated client, it could  take hours to travel to a detention facility and visit with that  client.   H.R. 5546 requires the Attorney General to ensure that BOP's email  system excludes the contents of electronic communications between an  incarcerated person and his or her attorney.   The bill stipulates that the protections and limitations associated  with attorney-client privilege, including the crime-fraud exception,  apply to electronic communications. It does permit BOP to retain  electronic communications until the incarcerated person is released but  specifies that the contents may only be accessed under very limited  circumstances.   Finally, it allows a court to suppress evidence obtained or derived  from access to the retained contents if such access were granted in  violation of the act.   Congress must continually address the application of existing law to  emerging technology. This is a commonsense application of existing law  to a technology that is decades old. It is time we act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5546,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I do appreciate this bill, and the only question I sometimes have is  that it seems like email has been around for a long time, and we are  just getting to it, but better later than never.   But I also think it is really important to recognize a lot of these  cases are public defense cases. You will have public defenders who have  bigger caseloads than we would like sometimes  [[Page H4579]]  and clients that don't necessarily trust the system.   This is good for defendants. This is good for lawyers. This is good  for overall faith in the criminal justice system. It protects people,  and it doesn't just protect the client who that public defender is  recognizing. It helps all of his other clients if he or she can  communicate with all of their clients quicker and more efficiently.   This is a really good bill. I urge everybody to support it, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of S. 982, the Not Invisible Act of 2019.   We just discussed the appalling extent of missing and murdered  indigenous women and how Savanna's Act will begin to address this  issue. The Not Invisible Act is another step to solve this abhorrent  problem.   This bill provides an opportunity for the Federal Government to  improve its efforts to combat the growing crisis of murder and  trafficking and the disappearance of indigenous men and women.   While there are many Federal programs tasked with addressing violent  crime, the agencies that operate these programs do not have an  overarching strategy to properly deploy these resources in Indian  Country and in urban Indian communities. Program implementation often  takes place without considering the unique needs of Native American  communities in this context.   S. 982 will require the appropriate agencies to coordinate prevention  efforts, grants, and programs across the Bureau of Indian Affairs and  the Department of Justice, among other stakeholders.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 982, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse), my good friend.     Mr. Speaker, I don't think I could close any better  than that, so I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1321, the Defending the  Integrity of Voting Systems Act.   This bill will protect our Nation's most sacred democratic process by  making it a Federal crime to hack any voting system used in a Federal  election.   Protecting our Nation's election process from bad actors must be a  top priority of Congress.   In 2018, the Department of Justice's Cyber-Digital Task Force issued  a report finding that election systems were not adequately protected by  Federal law. This bill is a bipartisan response to address the problems  identified by the task force.   Bad actors who attempt to interfere in our elections must be punished  for their actions. As someone who spends a lot of time here talking  about where crimes fit in the State and Federal place, and oftentimes I  think we overreact as a Federal Government and interfere in things that  I believe should be left to the States, I think this is the opposite of  that. An election in North Dakota can have consequences across the  country. An election in Texas can have consequences across the country.   This is written in a way that it deals with Federal elections and any  machines used in those. It is a good piece of legislation. It is a  bipartisan piece of legislation. It is based off of task force  findings. It is narrow, and it does what we need it to do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1380, the Due Process  Protections Act.   This is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that will reinforce  constitutional protections for criminal defendants.   This bill amends the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to require a  judge to issue a Brady order, reminding prosecutors of their obligation  to disclose all evidence that is material to the case, especially  exculpatory evidence.   Although some judges already have a practice of issuing Brady orders,  this bill will require all judges to issue it in all criminal  proceedings.   Our criminal justice system falls short when key evidence is withheld  by prosecutors and revealed years later at a conviction. Due process is  a fundamental right of all Americans; so is the right to a fair trial,  protected by the Constitution and this bill helps guarantee that  fundamental right.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, at a time when violent extremists are destroying cities  nationwide, our Democratic colleagues here in the House continue to  ignore this violence. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee even  called Antifa violence a myth and imaginary. Instead of addressing  violent leftwing extremism head-on, my colleagues across the aisle only  want to use this bill for political purposes. They are not interested  in passing legislation that would make any real difference in rooting  out violence in our communities.   Democrats are unable to call out the violent anarchists who are  burning down cities all around the country. Instead, they seem to want  to paint a picture that ties only conservatives to domestic terrorism.  Not only is this bill blatantly political on its face, but it increases  our already bloated bureaucracy by adding three new separate offices to  do the exact same thing. That is the very definition of duplication and  government waste.   We already have dedicated law enforcement who fight domestic  terrorism every day, and we should recognize them, commend them, and  let them do their jobs. Unfortunately, my colleagues across the aisle  likely will not do that either.   Democrats must end the partisan charades. Democrats must stop  ignoring the leftwing violence and crime that has taken over American  cities. Instead of this biased approach in this bill, we should pass  legislation that roots out all kinds of domestic terrorism, not just  the type that is politically convenient for Democrats.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 5602,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), the ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I was in the committee when we did this  and when we accepted Republican amendments and garnered some support  from people on my side of the aisle in committee. I have no doubt that  my friends on the other side of the aisle condemn all kinds of  violence, but somewhere between committee and here things got added to  the bill.   Mr. Speaker, do you know what didn't get added? Not one mention of  the horrific attack against two police officers shot at pointblank  range in their patrol car. The bill did not mention the murder of a  Trump supporter in Portland. But we did manage to mention the juvenile  from Kenosha.   So, while the gentlewoman says she supports a certain thing or nobody  condones certain things, their actions on how this occurs show us where  their priorities are. The priorities are political because we could  have added all of these things.   I find it interesting and odd on the same day that we are talking  about due process, rights to effective assistance of counsel, justice  for juveniles, and all the election integrity and voting, we don't  condemn the burning down of the post office in Minneapolis. We don't  talk about these other things, but we will make sure we mention a  juvenile offender in Kenosha prior to any of his court hearings being  held.   We can talk about delaying justice and the administration of justice,  but that is not how it reads in the bill, and that is not how it was  spoken to on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, if we are going to do this, all I ask is that we are  consistent. The gentlewoman can stand here and say that we condemn all  forms of violence, but only one made it into the bill after committee.  That is because it fits a particular political narrative, and we have  no interest in actually rooting out domestic terrorism wherever it  exists. We want to make sure it fits a particular narrative. That is  what this bill is about, and that is why we should oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1600, the Stop FGM Act of  2020.   This bill outlaws a practice that is recognized internationally as a  human rights violation, and even torture. It is an extreme form of  discrimination against women and girls. Unfortunately, half a million  girls and women worldwide are subject to this torture or at risk for  it.   I am sure most people assumed that FGM was already illegal. It was.   In 1996, Congress prohibited the practice of FGM. But in 2018, a  Federal judge in Michigan dismissed charges against a doctor and others  from a local Indian Dawoodi Bohra community involved in the mutilation  of nine young girls. The judge ruled that the Federal Government does  not have the power to regulate FGM.   Since that time, the Justice Department has been able to stop these  acts of violence against America's young girls.   This bill will amend title 18 to make FGM that is performed for  nonmedical reasons a crime and overturn the judge's decision by  explicitly describing the constitutional basis for banning FGM under  the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I think all my colleagues can come together and support  this important bipartisan bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 6100.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I watched the wrestling video and I hear the stories from a school in  Texas or Banana Republic, and I find these things horrible. I don't  think you can find any Member in this Chamber who doesn't find racial  discrimination to be repugnant and inconsistent with basic standards of  human decency.   What Democrats and Republicans also agree on is that using hairstyles  as an excuse for engaging in racial discrimination is wrong and is  already illegal under Federal civil rights law, and I think that is  where we come to a little bit of a disagreement. If a school  administrator in Texas can't find title VII, he is not going to find  this language in addition to title VII.   In 1973, the Supreme Court held that using a pretextual reason as  cover for undertaking an action prohibited by Federal civil rights laws  is, nonetheless, a violation of Federal civil rights laws. As early as  1976, Federal courts held that discrimination on the basis of a  hairstyle associated with a certain race or national origin may  constitute racial discrimination.   Looking at both this bill and the law, it appears to me that the  behavior that we are seeking to make illegal is already illegal.  However, both at markup and on the floor, our colleagues have made  impassioned arguments about why this bill is necessary, even though we  all agree that the activity that we are already talking about is  already illegal.   That doesn't take anything away from the discrimination or the  embarrassment that any of those young men or women have felt in any of  those incidents, but I am not sure the bill solves the problem, and  that is why I wish the committee had taken time to examine whether the  bill is either redundant or necessary.   Our committee should have held a hearing with alleged victims of the  sort of discrimination that the Democrats argue this bill is designed  to help. Our committee should have had a hearing with some legal  scholars and individuals responsible for enforcing our Nation's civil  rights laws to determine if this bill will achieve what it is intended  to do.   Schools, employers, and other entities covered by Federal civil  rights laws can have race-neutral policies that everyone must follow.  They can also have race-neutral policies that have a disparate racial  impact, and those are the places we need to address.   This is particularly true when the policy is necessary for critical  functions of the job. There is a reason firefighters have mustaches but  not beards, and that is because you have to wear an SCBA. You can't  wear the mask if you have a beard.   Our committee should have examined how this bill would affect the  ability of schools, employers, and other entities to maintain such  policies. But we never had a hearing; we just had a markup. Chairman  Nadler brought this bill straight to markup, and now we are on the  floor today without any legislative hearing.   I am not even sure it is a bad idea. But I would like to know if it  is not redundant. I would like to know what the unintended consequences  are. And there are real reasons why, when you are dealing with civil  rights law, particularly on something that has already been agreed on  that is illegal--enforcement and legality are two different things, and  we just don't know enough about what we are doing or why it is  necessary.    So, I would ask that we oppose this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), the ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I will say that the stories we hear, and the  things are terrible, but this is a problem of education and not  legislation. And it is more than that.   Without having these hearings, without understanding this, without  understanding where in our current law that we don't already make this  conduct and this pretextual racial conduct illegal, we essentially are  saying that we are--I mean, making something illegal twice isn't going  to change somebody's mind if it was already illegal once, and I think  that is the mistake we are making here. It is not about the conduct and  the underlying conduct and those types of things, it is about what we  are trying to accomplish, how we are doing it, and the process in which  we do it.   The sentiment is there, and I can't disagree with any of these  stories, I just don't think this bill solves the problem they are  trying to solve. And I don't think we have nearly enough evidence to  show that it does. So with that, I would urge my colleagues to vote  against this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
