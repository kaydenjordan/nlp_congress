 Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the Bipartisan  Congressional Ukraine Caucus, I rise to introduce a resolution  reaffirming the House's bipartisan support for Ukraine, our ally.   This time-sensitive measure proclaims the United States' vital  strategic interest in preserving liberty and democracy in Ukraine and  across Europe.   In 2014, Vladimir Putin's Russia invaded Ukraine without provocation.  Over 5 years later, Ukraine remains engaged in a heroic struggle to  defend its freedom and sovereignty.   Today, Ukraine represents the scrimmage line for liberty on the  European Continent and globally.   This resolution makes clear that we in Congress recognize the  sacrifice that Ukrainians make each day to defend liberty in Europe. As  our ally, we support her continued defense, growth, and success.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join this timely  resolution.                            ____________________
