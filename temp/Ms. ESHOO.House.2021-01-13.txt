 Madam Speaker, future generations are not going to know  the names of each Member in the Chamber today and voting, but they will  know what we did and why. We must impeach the President because he  incited the mob that attacked the Capitol of the United States, the  tabernacle of our democracy. He is incapable of honoring his oath and  our Constitution, and he has proven to be unfit and dangerous.   I will vote to impeach this traitor to our country.
