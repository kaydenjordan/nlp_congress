 Mr. Speaker, last Saturday, across America, was Small  Business Saturday, a yearly event that highlights American Main Street  businesses by encouraging consumers to shop in their local shops.   Forty-five percent of all companies in Texas are small businesses.  They provide jobs to 4 million Texans. They are our neighbors, our  family members, and our friends. They provide jobs to more than 4  million families as well as the 4 million Texans.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides small businesses in my north Texas  district with the lowest tax rate since World War II, allowing them to  invest in their community, hire more people, and, as the National  Federation of Independent Business says: This tax bill will lead small  businesses into a better position.   We highlighted small businesses last weekend, and the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act follows through with a Tax Code built for increased wages and  long-term growth.                            ____________________
