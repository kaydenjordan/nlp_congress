 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this  bipartisan bill. I thank Representative Schrier, an amazing woman,  pediatrician, and fellow member of our freshman class, for leading this  bipartisan effort.   Preventing child abuse is an issue that is front-of-mind for our  community in Illinois' 14th District, with the recent death of AJ  Freund, a 5-year-old  [[Page H3991]]  boy from Crystal Lake, who was tragically killed.   AJ's heartbreaking death was a result of a system that failed him. I  am committed to honoring his life with action.   Child abuse prevention is an issue that calls for big policy  solutions, and this bill offers those, as my colleagues have outlined.   Rates of child abuse have recently been rising as the opioid epidemic  has devastated communities across the country; and children who are  adopted after being removed from homes with substance abuse issues have  special kinds of trauma.   My bipartisan amendment, with Representative Smucker, looks out for  those kids. It would allow us to track their outcomes and ensure we  have the information we need to make informed policy decisions to best  serve them and set them up for success.   With my amendment, a Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment  Act will help keep kids safe and make sure families get the services  they need. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bill.
