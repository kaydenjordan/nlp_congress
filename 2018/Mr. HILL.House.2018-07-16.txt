 Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Mr. Howard Marshall, former  Deputy Assistant Director at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   Mr. Marshall recently concluded a 21-year career with the FBI, this  after growing up in a household where his father, Brian, a resident of  my district, was a special agent for 33 years. The Marshall family is  visiting us in Washington, D.C., in the historic Capitol today.   During the early stages, Mr. Marshall worked in St. Louis, Memphis,  as well as the FBI headquarters, where he worked on multiple task  forces and supervised a public corruption squad.   In 2008, Mr. Marshall was promoted to FBI leadership as Assistant  Special Agent in Charge of the Dallas division, where he managed the  white-collar crime and intelligence programs. After Dallas, he was  promoted to the Inspection Division, where he led inspections of local  field offices, as well as shooting incident review teams. Mr. Marshall  was then appointed Special Agent in Charge in Louisville.   Recently, Mr. Marshall served as the Deputy Assistant Director of the  Cyber Division, where he supported the mission to identify and defeat  cyber threats targeting U.S. interests. Prior to the FBI, Mr. Marshall  worked for the Prosecuting Attorney's Office in Little Rock, Arkansas.   We thank Mr. Marshall and his father, Brian, for their combined 54  years of public service to the American people and their service to the  FBI, and all their fellow agents at the Bureau.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time tonight. It is my hope  tonight that we will have a discussion in our country and in this  historic Chamber on trade policy. I am delighted that two of my good  colleagues have joined me to carry on this discussion.   A key tenet of international economic policy for the Trump  administration has been to improve U.S. bilateral and multilateral  trade arrangements with an eye toward enforcing reciprocity with our  trading partners as it relates to tariff levels and the elimination of  nontariff barriers. The goal: to simply achieve more market access for  American goods and services.   Mr. Trump recognized this, campaigned on free and fair trade, and  routinely emphasizes the importance of reciprocity between trading  partners. He has stated that he prefers bilateral arrangements over  multilateral arrangements by indicating that he did not want to pursue  the Transpacific Partnership or the Transatlantic Trade and Investment  Partnership, one with Asia partners and one with the EU.    While it is true that bilateral treaties are easier to negotiate and  acquire, select multilateral arrangements can achieve broad  geopolitical and geo-economic strategic objectives.   In the case of TPP, it could, potentially, significantly leverage the  economic clout of China in Southeast Asia and obviously link  longstanding free trade partners across the transatlantic region with  the TTIP.   President Trump has also initiated the effort to improve the North  American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, among the United States, Mexico,  and Canada. He has called this agreement one of the worst ever, but has  offered concrete ways to improve it and modernize it for current  conditions in Mexico, Canada, and the United States. No doubt, these  are, in fact, significantly different than back in 1992 when the NAFTA  agreement was arranged.   This work continues in earnest, and I am pleased that the  administration has made significant strides in improving NAFTA between  Canada and Mexico over the past year, something that I think is very  important in my home State of Arkansas, where Mexico and Canada are  absolutely the largest trading partners that our companies and farmers  have in my home State.   President Trump's objectives of changing the mercantilistic trade  policies of China have proven more challenging. Tonight, we will talk  about the President's strategy, because we want the United States to  have an opportunity in China. We want a more open China trading  process. We want more goods and services made in America sold in China.   But over the last 3 decades, China has developed into one of the  world's largest and fastest growing economies, but also one of the  world's largest protectionist economies, putting up barriers to  American goods and services in both tariff matters and in nontariff  ways.                                time  1930    We are going to talk about that tonight, and I would like to start by  talking about that with my friend from Ohio. What is interesting is  that this strategy of getting at a more open China, ending a more  mercantilistic trading policy with China has taken a couple courses of  action: one, the President has imposed section 301 under the Trade Act  of 1974, going after China's intellectual property theft in the U.S.,  their ability to compel U.S. companies or companies from the European  Union to give up their intellectual property in order to do business in  China, clearly a violation. And so the President has proposed a 301  investigation and tariffs related to that.   He has also imposed tariffs under the 1962 act for national security  purposes across the board on steel and aluminum--all countries, all  products. And that is very challenging, Mr. Speaker, because, if the  real issue is getting at China, the world's largest subsidizer and  dumper of steel and aluminum, this may not be the most successful  strategy to accomplish. That could, in fact, be a distraction from our  ultimate objective in opening China.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson), my  friend, so that we can have his perspective on tariffs and trade and  how we can improve and be more successful in getting the outcomes that  we want.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Ohio. He is a valued  member of the House Financial Services Committee, and his decades of  work in private business and in manufacturing is ideal for this  discussion. He knows about intermediate goods manufacturing and how a  lot of those parts are made domestically, but some parts, critical  parts, might be made abroad. Nonetheless, they allow us to create a  competitive manufactured good here in the United States, employ  Americans, and then potentially sell that domestically or export it to,  yet again, another country. I appreciate his manufacturing expertise.   We are also joined tonight by my friend from Illinois, a  distinguished member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Darin  LaHood, who comes from America's heartland of agriculture and can speak  to the issue of how do we achieve this outcome that we want: more open  markets, fairer and reciprocal trade, but how do we do that in a way  that minimizes the impact on American consumers and our agricultural  producers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood), my  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. LaHood from Illinois,  for his expertise in agriculture and these markets. I think it is very  important to have his example.   I might react by saying the gentleman was talking about the power of  working together. I was reflecting that if we were working together to  leverage the challenges of China, we are about 15 percent of two-way  trade with China. The European Union is about 15 percent or so of trade  with China. Japan is another seven. Clearly working together on some of  these issues that we have in common would give us more leverage.   Let me just outline four key objectives I think of U.S. trade policy  with China that I believe would be shared by those two other groups  that I mentioned, the European Union and Japan.   Ensure China fully complies with its obligations as a member of the  WTO, including the beneficial agreements on government procurement,  information technology, environmental goods agreement, and a trade and  services agreement. These are things, Mr. Speaker, that we have worked  on bilaterally and multilaterally since China entered the WTO in 2001,  an admission I think now that many people question, was China really  ready to join the World Trade Organization in 2001?   That is number one.   Number two, that we fully protect U.S. intellectual property rights  and establish ways and means to cease government-directed cyber theft  of U.S. trade secrets and intellectual property both for commercial and  national security reasons.   I am reminded that Ambassador Winston Lord, the U.S. Ambassador to  Beijing in 1989, when he was briefing President Bush 41 in preparation  of his first foreign trip. President Bush's first foreign trip in  February of 1989 was to China where he had served as our representative  back in the 1970s. Ambassador Lord wrote that memo to the President and  said:   You have got to talk about religious freedom, human rights. You have  got to talk about Taiwan. You have got to talk about Tibet. And you  have got to talk about theft of intellectual property.   This was in February, 1989, Mr. Speaker, and we are still debating  that issue today, unresolved. I would say that the European Union  shares that view.   Now, here is the amusing point. Ambassador Lord and the State  Department team, when they sent that memo to President Bush 41, said  that it was in its eighth printing, and they were sorry that the author  wasn't getting any royalties for it. Meaning, we have been talking  about this since we established diplomatic relations with China back in  1979, and we have been fighting this intellectual property theft.   Number three, seek changes in China's extensive industrial policies  which protect domestic sectors and firms, particularly China's state- owned industries. China's objective is for these state-owned  enterprises to be global competitors compatible with other trading  partners, but they are not. They are state-owned. They are state- subsidized.   Finally, fourth, promote changes to industrial policies that provide  open  [[Page H6249]]  and reciprocal treatment for American exporters of goods and services  by reducing nontariff barriers and making China's tariff level  comparable with U.S. tariffs.   I think those four things, Mr. Speaker, is what all of us agree on  tonight, and I think they would benefit the European Union as well. But  I think my friends hav made a good case that if we were to partner with  the E.U. and with Japan, we would have a lot more economic clout in  delivering on that negotiating posture.    I would ask my friend from Ohio, does he share that view? What are  his thoughts about what are alternative strategies maybe in the steel  and aluminum area?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Ohio.   It is quite clear that in Article I the Congress exclusively in an  enumerated power has the power of regulating commerce between foreign  nations and, of course, we know setting duties, levies, and taxes as an  Article I power. I think you make an important component, just like  Congress partnered with the executive branch on how to rightsize  certain overregulation in our economy from the previous administration  or how Congress collaborated with the Treasury Department in designing  tax reforms to make America more competitive to have people bring  business back to the U.S., not be double taxed on foreign earnings. In  both of those examples, as you note, we collaborated, the executive  branch and the legislative branch.   So I do think that also would strengthen the sequencing of our  strategy to get at the heart of what I think our key challenges are  which revolve around access into China.   I ask my friend, Mr. LaHood, does he have thoughts on this line of  discussion?    Mr. Speaker, my friend from Illinois mentioned enforcement.  I was looking in the archives this week when I was thinking about  China, and I found an article that I wrote back in 1996 as a private  citizen about the Clinton administration's China policy.   The paragraph on China and trade reads like this:         China, as a world power, for her part, must recognize that       bilateral and multilateral treaties are to be enforced. Lack       of compliance with international treaty obligations must       produce a known and delivered set of sanctions by the world       community. China must clearly understand the consequences of       noncompliance.    I would argue so strongly about the gentleman's point that have we-- when I say ``we,'' I mean the United States, in the past two decades,  the European Union as an entity and others--have we done a good job at  enforcing those norms and those treaty provisions and those basic  tenets of being a WTO member aggressively and collectively against  China? I would argue we have a mixed record at best. But I think the  gentleman makes a very good point about enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about the steel and aluminum  tariffs across the board. I have raised that issue before I was joined  by many Members of the Congress on that issue because I felt like it  came out of the blue to Members of Congress engaged in trade policy,  whether on the House Financial Services Committee or on the House Ways  and Means Committee, and that it was sweeping in its nature.  [[Page H6251]]  It has produced the challenge you talked about that 20,000 American  businesses are trying to seek an exclusion from that.   I have several in my district, Mr. Speaker, who make the steel belts  and steel-belted radial tires who are hurting. These are companies in  Arkansas that use a steel rod that is not made in America, Mr. Speaker,  and that is spun into the steel belt that is sold to the tire  manufacturing industry. They are being hurt by this kind of across-the- board steel and aluminum tariff.   If we are concerned about a good, healthy aluminum industry for  national security purposes and a good, healthy steel industry for  national security purposes, then we ought to go after, directly, the  world's largest dumper of steel and aluminum, which is China and their  state-owned enterprise sector with their subsidies, and not sweep up  everyone engaged in that intermediate goods manufacturing in America,  not penalize our partners in Europe who share that concern with us, who  could help us go after that.   Ambassador Lighthizer made a comment. He said: Well, one of the key  reasons for going across the board like that was the risk of  transshipment risk, in other words, violating the rules of origin,  passing Chinese subsidized or dumped steel through a third country into  the U.S., like Mexico, for example, or Canada, for example, just to  name two possibilities.   That got me thinking: Well, surely--back on my friend from Illinois'  comment about enforcement--there is a more elegant way to tackle what  is really a regulatory issue, a transshipment risk, rule of origin  risk. Why don't we see what others are doing?   So I looked at Canada. Just in March of this year, Mr. Speaker, the  Canadians put in place a whole new regulatory regime working with the  Americans to block rules of origin changes or transshipments of Chinese  steel or aluminum through Canada. And, likewise, we have worked with  the EU; and the OECD has their own steel committee that works to, on a  regular basis, block that kind of work.   So I just wonder, if we had consulted and worked together, perhaps we  could have taken a more sophisticated route at stopping steel and  aluminum dumping that is damaging our American industry. We do need a  protective steel and aluminum industry in this country, no doubt.   We also have good friends like Canada, good allies who produce it,  but that is not to say that we don't want to have a vibrant industry  here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time of my colleagues tonight  on the floor. We have worked hard tonight to talk about how do we have  a more constructive partnership between the executive branch and the  legislative branch like we do in designing economic policy, tax policy,  regulatory reform policy, like this excellent description that Mr.  Davidson gave of how we created a modernized CFIUS approach for  reviewing investments into the United States.   We had full engagement with General Mattis at the Pentagon, Secretary  Mnuchin at the Treasury Department, Secretary Ross at the Commerce  Department, and the White House, with Senator Cornyn in the United  States Senate,  Andy Barr,  Robert Pittenger here in the House working  to create a collaborative approach regarding how to have a great  national security policy for investment in the U.S.   I think we have all argued here tonight that, with our Article I  engagement in the House Financial Services Committee, the House Ways  and Means Committee, we want to be a constructive partner on  accomplishing the President's objective, which is fair and reciprocal  trade, first and foremost, with China, and to finally break this cycle  we have talked about tonight of inadequacy, of holding them to account,  making progress, enforcing their rules of the road under WTO, all with  a heart toward helping our consumers, having more choice, more free  [[Page H6252]]  trade, more opportunity to expand our economy, not contract, as we get  into a downward spiral on a tariff-only strategy.   Mr. Speaker, we want to work successfully with this administration on  a new and modern NAFTA and with a successful set of trading  arrangements with our friends in Europe and in Asia.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
