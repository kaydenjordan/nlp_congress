 Mr. President, our democracy is protected by its  institutional checks on unlimited power. The three branches of  government are not the only manifestation of the careful balancing  achieved by the Framers of the Constitution. Within the legislative  branch, the Senate's unique traditions protect the rights of the  minority party by allowing extended debate and by requiring a  supermajority vote to pass legislation, with few exceptions. These  rules have helped to make the U.S. Senate the greatest deliberative  body in the world.   Before commenting further on the importance of the extended debate  and the 60-vote requirement for passing legislation, I want to point  out a critical protection built into the Senate's procedures. Changing  the rules requires 67 votes, not 60 votes, not 51 votes--67 votes.   But in a power grab that would be incredibly destructive to the  functioning of the Senate, the Democratic leader is proposing to  circumvent the rules in order to eviscerate the filibuster because he  does not have anywhere near the 67 votes required to rewrite the Senate  rules. Instead, he will propose to ``change the rules by breaking the  rules,'' as former Democratic Senator Carl Levin, a true giant of the  Senate, put it when arguing against a similar ploy in 2013.   As one of Senator Levin's predecessors, Arthur Vandenberg, warned in  1949, if the majority can change the rules of the Senate at will,  ``there are no rules except the transient, unregulated wishes of a  majority of whatever quorum is temporarily in control of the Senate.''   Both Senators Levin and Vandenberg actually favored the rule change  being considered at the time, but each recognized that ``breaking the  rules to change the rules'' would irreparably harm the Senate and,  thus, our country.   Democrats well understand the consequences of what they are  proposing. Just 5 short years ago, Senator Chris Coons and I wrote a  letter urging Senate leaders to preserve the 60-vote threshold for  legislation. That letter was signed by 61 Senators: 28 Republicans, 32  Democrats, and 1 Independent. This total not only represented a  majority of Senators but also a majority of the Republican caucus, a  majority of the Democratic Caucus, and the current Vice President.   How well I remember seeking signatures on the Senate floor for that  letter. Holding a green folder with the letter inside, I approached  Senators on both sides of the aisle to achieve my goal of a total of 60  Senators signing, representing a majority of each caucus.   Not a single Senator whom I approached said no to signing the letter,  not one. Quite the contrary, each was eager to sign the letter, and  many thanked me for leading the effort to make clear that whatever our  disagreements on a supermajority vote for nominees, they were firmly  committed to keeping the filibuster for legislation. They understood  its vital importance to the Senate and to our country.   This is what our letter stated, in part:         [W]e are united in our determination to preserve the       ability of Members to engage in extended debate when bills       are on the Senate floor.        We are mindful of the unique role the Senate plays in the       legislative process, and we are steadfastly committed to       ensuring that this great American institution continues to       serve as the world's greatest deliberative body. Therefore,       we are asking you to join us  [[Page S185]]       in opposing any effort to curtail the existing rights and       prerogatives of Senators to engage in full, robust, and       extended debate as we consider legislation.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bipartisan letter,  dated April 7, 2017, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, April 7, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader       Schumer: We are writing to urge you to support our efforts to       preserve existing rules, practices, and traditions as they       pertain to the right of Members to engage in extended debate       on legislation before the United States Senate. Senators have       expressed a variety of opinions about the appropriateness of       limiting debate when we are considering judicial and       executive branch nominations. Regardless of our past       disagreements on that issue, we are united in our       determination to preserve the ability of Members to engage in       extended debate when bills are on the Senate floor.        We are mindful of the unique role the Senate plays in the       legislative process, and we are steadfastly committed to       ensuring that this great American institution continues to       serve as the world's greatest deliberative body. Therefore,       we are asking you to join us in opposing any effort to       curtail the existing rights and prerogatives of Senators to       engage in full, robust, and extended debate as we consider       legislation before this body in the future.            Sincerely,          Susan M. Collins; Orrin Hatch; Claire McCaskill; Lisa             Murkowski; Christopher A. Coons; Joe Manchin; John             McCain; Patrick Leahy; Roger Wicker; Luther Strange;             Angus King; Michael Bennet; Amy Klobuchar; Robert P.

The culture of the Senate is built upon a foundation of  respect and cooperation that is meant to transcend partisanship. It is  a culture in which legislative goals are reached with patience,  persuasion, and perseverance, not raw power.   I implore my colleagues to consider the ramifications for our  country. Do we want laws enacted one year to be repealed 2 years later  on a simple majority vote and then perhaps reenacted in another 2 years  by just 51 votes?   Do we want major laws, significant changes in policy, to be rammed  through the Senate without thoughtful debate and bipartisan support?   At a time when our country is deeply and closely divided, do we  really want to worsen the polarization by improving significant changes  in public policy by a narrow partisan vote?   We are now on the brink of heading down that dangerous road, a  slippery slope toward a tyranny of the majority. Limiting the ability  of Senators to engage in a debate on legislative matters would give the  majority party unprecedented power to push through major changes  without careful deliberation or bipartisan cooperation. Such a move  would have lasting implications, as future majorities--whether  Republican or Democratic--would have little incentive to work with the  other party.   It is crucial that we work together and find common ground on the  issues that matter most to the American people. Changing longstanding  Senate rules to benefit one political party would discourage efforts to  forge consensus and only serve to reinforce bitter partisan divisions.   I urge my colleagues to stand against this calamitous change and for  the principles of compromise and cooperation that have long defined and  been the hallmarks of the U.S. Senate.   Let us listen to the admonition of the Democratic leader when he  spoke against changing the rules in 2017: ``Let us go no further down  this road.''   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
