 Mr. Chair, the Great Lakes Advisory Board  plays an essential role in providing the EPA with the technical,  environmental, and local expertise needed to carry out the Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative.   This board is one of over 1,000 advisory boards that operate across  the Federal Government.   This past Friday, the Trump administration put all of those boards at  risk by signing an executive order eliminating one-third of Federal  advisory boards.   These boards provide technical expertise on topics as diverse as  animal health, safe pesticide use, trade, and offer useful third-party  review of scientific research conducted at Federal agencies.  [[Page H4957]]    The Trump administration order is, in a word, arbitrary, and it  presents a clear threat to the ability of agencies to have the best  information when making fundamental and far-reaching decisions.   While my amendment is specific to the Great Lakes Advisory Board, I  have offered this amendment to underscore the importance of preserving  funding for all of these boards.   The executive order is a mistake. It is another stunning escalation  in this administration's war on science, and the American people  deserve better.
