 Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank my friend, the  gentleman from Alabama, for letting me participate in this very  important debate today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule, but specifically to voice  my very strong support for one of the bills of the underlying  legislation. That would be H.R. 3043, which is the Hydropower Policy  Modernization Act of 2017.   This legislation, which is sponsored and spearheaded by my good  friend and fellow Washingtonian, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers,  will improve the licensing process for U.S. hydropower resources by  promoting accountability as well as transparency, by requiring greater  cooperation among Federal and State agencies, as well as by reducing  needless duplication of efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I am a strong, steadfast supporter of hydropower--I  admit that--which, as America's first renewable electricity source, has  provided our country with low-cost, clean, reliable energy for over a  century. In my own home State of Washington, nearly 70 percent of our  energy is derived from hydropower.   While there are still some misguided, extreme efforts to breach our  dams and remove these critical sources of electric generation, I  believe we need to increase our use of clean and renewable resources.  By passing the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act, we can take a very  major step in doing just that.   Mr. Speaker, FERC, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,  serves as the lead agency to coordinate hydropower reviews and convene  stakeholders to participate in collaborative,  [[Page H8538]]  transparent public proceedings. However, FERC lacks the authority to  improve the hydropower licensing process, including the ability to  resolve disputes among agencies and enforce scheduling deadlines.    Far too often, it is those Federal and State agencies, as well as  other bureaucratic bodies, that stand in the way of moving these  licensing efforts forward. In fact, in response to a House Energy and  Commerce Committee's subcommittee hearing, FERC reported that there are  26 separate cases where the Commission has finished its environmental  review and is currently waiting for action to be completed by another  agency before FERC can issue a decision on any particular project.   Mr. Speaker, the licensing process for these projects should not be  taking 10 years or more. Natural gas-fired facilities and other carbon- based energy sources are being approved in considerably less time.  Meanwhile, less than 3 percent of the dams in this country produce  electricity.   I will continue to support efforts to increase hydropower generation  that will provide our country with reliable, stable, and clean energy.  We can usher in a new era of U.S. energy independence derived from our  very first renewable energy source by streamlining these processes.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule and, particularly,  its underlying legislation, H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy  Modernization Act of 2017.
