 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  confirmation votes on the Padin and Sweeney nominations be at 11 a.m.  tomorrow, May 25; further, that the remaining cloture votes for the  motions filed during Wednesday's session of the Senate occur after  disposition of the Sweeney nomination.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 904, Paul M.  Rosen, to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Investment  Security; that the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening  action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table; that any statements related to the nomination be  printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action and that the Senate resume legislative session.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I understand there are three bills  at the desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    I now ask for a second reading, and I object to my  own request, all en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar  No. 369, S. 3846.  I ask unanimous  consent that the bill be considered read a third time and passed  and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 647, submitted earlier  today.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 648, submitted earlier  today.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 649 submitted earlier  today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, we are nearing the end of the  session, when we will go back to our homes for the evening, but when  the families of 18 children and 4 great educators go home tonight,  their homes will never be the same again.   There are no words in a place filled with words during today and  every day in this place when we are in session. There are no words  today to capture the heartbreak, the gut-wrenching grief and pain that  those families will feel and that I remember feeling almost 10 years  ago when we stood in the space just outside the firehouse in Sandy  Hook, as parents learned that their 20 children would not be coming  home that night.   The same bottomless grief is hitting the families in Texas, in  Uvalde, where they have lost children. And there are no words also to  capture the deep, abiding pain that will last forever. That pain will  be with them--a hole in their hearts, a place at their tables, a room  in their houses that never will be filled again, and hugs that they  will never feel, cheeks that will never be kissed.   This Nation, like their families, is torn apart by violence-- needless, senseless gun violence--every day in America. And the mystery  is why the greatest Nation on Earth continues to tolerate it. It is no  longer surprising or stunning. It is no longer unfathomable or  unforeseeable.   It is incomprehensible that this great Nation is blocked by Members  of this body from taking action that can forestall and prevent it. Why,  the outrage that we feel, the grief that pervades America on these  occasions has not caused action. And this body has been complicit by  its inaction. In fact, it isn't this body. It is Members of this body,  principally on the other side of the aisle. Let's be blunt. I will  never forget hearing from that gallery those words: ``Shame. Shame on  you,'' when we failed to adopt commonsense measures--a background check  proposal, even though we had 55 votes. I can still hear those words.  ``Shame.''    And had we acted, who knows what tragedy could have been averted? We  don't know and we can't tell and we never will be able to fathom  whether  [[Page S2670]]  specific measures would have prevented specific tragedy. Charleston or  San Bernardino, Pulse or Las Vegas, Parkland or Santa Fe, or Pittsburgh  or El Paso or Dayton or Boulder or Indianapolis or Oxford or Buffalo or  Uvalde--we will never know because the false reason to object is this  measure wouldn't have prevented that shooting.   But that is not the way to approach gun violence reform, because we  know there is no panacea; there is no single measure. What we know is  that stopping gun violence requires that we act with these measures and  that commonsense, sensible steps can prevent a senseless, needless  violence.   There is no panacea, but there are actions we can take. We are not  without agency.   Now, we need to be very blunt and recognize that opposition to these  measures is bankrolled and emboldened and enabled by the gun lobby's  dark money, by its threats and intimidation, by its encouragement.   And until my colleagues have the courage to stand up to that gun  lobby, they will continue in its thrall and its grip, and they will  continue to be complicit.   And some on our side, some who have demonstrated the courage to stand  up and speak out, have shown that we have the power to take action.   We lack facts about the shooter and about the killing, all the  circumstances in Uvalde, but we know enough to say that those families  and that community will be torn apart. It will never be the same. They  will never be whole again because they have lost something precious,  and there will always be that hole in their hearts.   Already some of our Republican colleagues are saying we are  politicizing the issue, but they are the ones who, for decades, have  tied themselves to the NRA's fanatical devotion to unrestricted,  unyielding firearms ownership for political purposes at the expense of  real lives.   Tying themselves to firearms ownership is unnecessary for law-abiding  citizens to own firearms. There are commonsense actions we can take to  separate dangerous killers from firearms that are absolutely consistent  with the Second Amendment, as judged by the Supreme Court, and  absolutely consistent with gun ownership by law-abiding people.   We know these actions won't save everyone, but there can be no doubt  that each of them will save some lives: expanding background checks and  closing glaring loopholes in our background check system; getting  untraceable ghost guns and military-style assault weapons off our  streets; protecting domestic violence survivors from gun violence;  keeping guns out of the hands of domestic terrorists and violent  extremists and individuals who are dangerous to themselves or others,  red flag statutes; preventing kids from accidentally and  unintentionally shooting themselves with unsecured firearms, Ethan's  Law for safe storage; investing in community violence intervention  programs--we know they work in Hartford, New Haven, all around the  State of Connecticut; reducing the number of firearm suicides--more  than half of all gun deaths are suicides; red flag statutes, separating  firearms from people who are dangerous to themselves as well as others.   We need to do all these things and more. We need to do them right now  because every day that passes without action means more of the same.  Not surprising, not stunning--more of the same.   Those measures are written, they are fully drafted, vetted for their  constitutionality. My subcommittee on the Constitution has had hearings  on them, many of them: S. 529, the Background Check Expansion Act; S.  591, the Background Check Completion Act; S. 1558, the Untraceable  Firearms Act to stop ghost guns; S. 736, the Assault Weapons Ban; S.  527, the Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act; S.  2169, the Lori Jackson-Nicolette Elias Domestic Violence Survivor  Protection Act, a hearing just last week on it; S. 2090, the Disarm  Hate Act; S. 4278, the Age 21 Act; S. 190, Ethan's Law; S. 2982, the  Child Suicide Prevention and Lethal Means Safety Act; S. 1819, the  Extreme Risk Protection Order Act--the red flag statutes.   Let us do one of them. Let us vote to make one of them law. That is  our job: to vote. It is how we change this gut-wrenching, heartbreaking  status quo, and it is how voters know where each of us stand when push  comes to shove.   So we have no words, but words will mean nothing without action. We  have created a political movement. It is a movement that is growing as  young people say: Enough is enough, as the hand wringing and the tears  are translated into action at the grassroots level, action by State  legislatures. Almost 20 states now have red flag statutes in the wake  of Parkland. And as communities and States show that they will no  longer tolerate the hypocrisy of thoughts and prayers without action,  all of us who have advocated for years--indeed, for decades--that this  body must act, we cannot lose courage or heart. We cannot lose the  hope, and we must match our thoughts and prayers with real action.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I understand that there are two  additional bills at the desk, and I ask for their first reading en  bloc.    I now ask for a second reading, and I object to my  own request, all en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when  the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Wednesday, May 25; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Thompson nomination; finally, that if any  nominations are confirmed during Wednesday's session, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9:02 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, May 25, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
