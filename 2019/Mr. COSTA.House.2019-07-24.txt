 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the  administration's proposal, its recent attack on some of the most  vulnerable Americans, the 38 million people who rely on the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, otherwise known as SNAP.   The USDA, United States Department of Agriculture, announced  yesterday a rule change to the eligibility for the program. This change  would kick millions of Americans--seniors, children, and their  families--off a program that provides critical assistance. It is a  safety net.   This change would weaken our ability to provide support for working  people who are struggling to get by month to month.   It would have a huge impact in my district. Unfortunately, 25 percent  of my constituents depend upon the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program monthly to provide nutrition for themselves and their families.   As a member of the conference committee that negotiated the 2018 farm  bill, these suggestions were a part of the discussion. We opposed them.  We fought successfully to include expanded SNAP eligibility  requirements, and Congress agreed.   That is why I fought to expand the employment and training programs  that we do in SNAP in the Fresno Bridge Academy, to equip recipients  with the necessary tools to get back on their feet, to make them self- sufficient. That is what we should be doing.   Guess what: The President supported it when he signed the farm bill  into law last December. He needs to remain consistent.   I will fight for families, for seniors, and for children. The bottom  line is this: SNAP is a helpful program to support people in their time  of need with achieving self-sufficiency. It is part of America's safety  net.   We must block this egregious attempt to administratively do what  Congress did not do last December.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with me and oppose this  attack on some of our Nation's most vulnerable populations.       Highlighting the Achievements of the House in the Last 6 Months     Mr. Speaker, I call to the attention of the House of  Representatives what we have achieved in the last 6 months, many of  these pieces of legislation on a bipartisan basis.   We have passed 10 bills to reduce the price of healthcare; lower  prescription drugs costs, which our communities want us to do; and  strengthen protections for people with preexisting conditions--reducing  the cost of drugs and  [[Page H7249]]  strengthening protections for preexisting conditions to protect those  individuals.   We passed the Equality Act to ensure that every American enjoys the  same rights and is protected equally under the law. The Equality Act is  so important.   I fought to improve our water infrastructure, to address the strain  on this precious resource brought by drought and climate change to  ensure that we have clean, safe drinking water for all of our  communities.   In the San Joaquin Valley, sadly, we have many communities that don't  enjoy clean, safe drinking water standards.                                time  1015    I have worked hard to implement the farm bill, to lead education and  outreach programs for farm programs to help farmers improve not only  their water sustainability, but their ability to market their crops.   In immigration, we have passed the funding bills to help alleviate  the humanitarian crisis at our border and advanced legislation to  secure a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants  currently living in the United States; our Dreamers, over 800,000, who  came here through no choice of their own, and for them America is the  only country they have ever known. They need and deserve legal status.   I am proud that, in the last 6 months of work, this week we will  consider H.R. 3239, the Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in  Customs and Border Protection Custody Act.   Many of us have been to the borders, and we do have a humanitarian  crisis there, and we need to do what is right. We need to ensure that  those individuals receive good standards of water, beds, and access to  healthcare, and that they are treated humanely. That is the American  way. These are basic living standards.   Finally, the budget deal that was agreed to on a bipartisan basis  over the weekend is important, not only as it relates to our  discretionary and non-discretionary spending for the next 2 years  lifting the budget cap, but in addition to that, to ensuring that we  produce a budget on time; that we avoid a government shutdown; that we  ensure that our men and women serving in American Armed Forces have the  adequate funding that they need; that our veterans get the support and  our VA hospitals that we have promised them.   These are the things that are part of an overall budget deal. It  avoids the kind of circus that we had over the last year where we had a  government shutdown, a government shutdown we should never have. We  should never have that impact on our economy; our Federal workers to be  expected--whether they be in air traffic control or food safety--to go  to work and not to receive a check. That is irresponsible.   So the budget deal is good. It is a bipartisan effort. It, frankly,  gives the sort of discretion that Congress needs to make budget  decisions to prioritize our needs in America.   So, for that, I thank the Congress.                            ____________________
