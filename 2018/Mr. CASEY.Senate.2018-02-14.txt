 Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue that we are  dealing with on the floor, and I am grateful for this opportunity.   I wanted to first of all stress the critical urgency that we act to  protect America's Dreamers. The United States is a proud Nation of  immigrants. Yet in September the administration insulted our values by  announcing a decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  Program, which we know by the acronym DACA.   Dreamers are young people who have lived in our country since they  were children. They are law-abiding residents who have learned English.  They have paid taxes, and they have secured jobs to support themselves  and their families. Our government promised them that they would be  protected if they came forward, and now the administration, at least so  far, has broken that promise.   Democrats have been fighting for something on the Dream Act since the  administration first announced its decision on DACA more than 5 months  ago. We have yet to vote on a single piece of bipartisan legislation to  protect Dreamers. I do, however, commend the bipartisan work of a  number of my colleagues in both parties who have come to the table to  draft legislation that protects Dreamers and secures our border.   With hundreds--soon to be thousands--of Dreamers losing protection  every day, it is critical that we come together to pass bipartisan  legislation that will provide permanent protections for these  remarkable young people. Dreamers are deeply integrated into  communities across Pennsylvania, as well as in a lot of other States  and across our country, of course. Dreamers work as nurses, caring for  our families. They work as teachers, educating our children, and as  servicemen and servicewomen in our military, working to keep us safe.   Take a young Pennsylvania Dreamer whom I met a few months ago--way  back, I guess, in September. She was  [[Page S952]]  studying to be a nurse. Talking about her own life, she said:         All I want to do is heal people. All I want to do is be a       nurse.    Then she became very upset thinking about whether or not she might  have that opportunity because of what had not happened in Washington-- no legislation passed to protect her.   Another Dreamer from Lancaster, PA--the Presiding Officer knows that  part of our State well--is Audrey Lopez. Audrey was brought to the  United States from Peru when she was just 11 years old. Audrey spent  most of her childhood in Pennsylvania, and her parents instilled in her  the value of hard work and education. Like so many Dreamers, Audrey  only learned that she was undocumented when she was applying to college  and learned that she did not have a Social Security number. Despite not  having access to financial aid, Audrey worked hard, and she graduated  from college.   After graduation, she took a job in public service working at Church  World Services, assisting refugees with resettlement. This past fall,  Audrey accepted a nearly full scholarship to American University, where  she will obtain a master's degree in international development.   Audrey is an American in every way but not on paper. She is  continuing to work hard, despite not knowing if she will have a future  in the country she calls home.   We should be supporting young, hard-working people like Audrey who  want to work in the service of others and our Nation. Instead, some,  but not all--not all--Republicans are threatening her future--not only  her future, but our Nation's future--by making us less safe and,  frankly, damaging our economy. Protecting Dreamers is not only the  right thing to do, but it is also good for the American economy, and it  is in our national security interests.   DACA has enabled almost 800,000 young people to grow and thrive in  America, including about 5,900 in Pennsylvania. As part of the fabric  of our community, these impressive young people, like Audrey, provide  an enormous contribution to our society, including paying an estimated  $2 billion each year in State and local taxes.   By contrast, repealing DACA would amount to a loss of $460.3 billion  from the national GDP over the next decade. So if you want to do it by  year, it is roughly $46 billion a year for each of the 10 years.   In Pennsylvania, ending DACA would result in an annual loss of $357.1  million to the State GDP, according to the Center for American  Progress.   Currently, about 900 Dreamers are serving in the U.S. military and  more than one out of every seven DACA-eligible immigrants has language  skills that are currently in short supply in the U.S. military. It  makes no sense to remove these Dreamers from a country they call home.  I believe it is both wrong and dangerous.   The American people overwhelmingly support allowing Dreamers to stay  in the United States. It is about time Congress listened to the nearly  80 percent of Americans who want to pass protections for Dreamers,  along with increased border security so we can prevent this situation  in the future.   So it is time for action. We need a real compromise solution that  will get 60 votes in the Senate and, of course, 218 votes in the House,  and a signature from the President of the United States.   While I have advocated in the past for a clean vote on the bipartisan  Dream Act, which is what I would prefer, compromise will be critical to  ensuring we get something done and sent to the President's desk.   In 2013, I and many others--67 other Senators--voted for a bipartisan  immigration bill that would have doubled the number of Border Patrol  agents. That bill also would have mandated 24-hour surveillance of the  border using advanced technology, like drones, and it would have  provided a pathway to citizenship for law-abiding immigrants.   There are a number of bipartisan proposals to pair Dreamer  protections with data-driven, sensible border security that focuses on  public safety.   I look forward to finally voting on these issues, and I hope my  Republican colleagues will continue to work with us to secure our  border and ensure that Dreamers like Audrey Lopez have a future they  can count on.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
