 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong appreciation of our  Ohio National Guardsmen, who have valiantly served Ohio's food banks  during the COVID-19 pandemic. As their mission closes this Friday, let  us commend the women and men in uniform whose selfless duty helped meet  unprecedented need.   Ohio's food banks served up to 150,000 more Ohioans monthly during  this pandemic and saw 3 in 10 people seeking out emergency food  assistance for the first time.   With the food banks' core volunteer force sidelined, the Ohio  National Guard deployed over 400 members to help meet the human  challenge. These women and men are owed a significant debt of  gratitude.   Let us offer our deepest thanks to the Ohio National Guard adjutant  general, Major General John Harris, whose leadership and swift  organization implemented the Guard's mission with great precision.   I thank the Ohio Association of Foodbanks executive director, Lisa  Hamler-Fugitt; the Toledo SeaGate executive director, Mindy Rapp; the  Toledo Food Bank president and CEO, James Caldwell; the Second Harvest  of North Central Ohio president and CEO, Julie Chase-Morefield; and the  Greater Cleveland Food Bank president and CEO, Kristin Warzocha.   These tireless teams put a human face on America. Congratulations to  them all.                            ____________________
