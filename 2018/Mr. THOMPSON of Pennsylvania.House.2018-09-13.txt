 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Abe and Trish Harpster of Spruce Creek, Pennsylvania.   Abe and Trish were recently chosen as the Congressional Coalition on  Adoption's 2018 Angels in Adoption Honorees for their extraordinary  contributions to adoption.   I proudly nominated the Harpsters for this honor because they truly  are generous and selfless individuals.   The Harpsters have successfully adopted three of their children:  Logan, Riley, and Teagan. Trish works in sales and Abe runs his  family's dairy farm in Huntingdon County. Both feel extraordinarily  blessed and lucky to be parents of these three great kids.   Having attempted several adoptions, Abe and Trish like to share their  adoption stories and act as a resource for parents beginning the  process. They are passionate about improving Federal laws and  regulations to ensure more children are connected with a permanent,  loving family.   Every year the Harpsters host a fly-fishing tournament on their  family farm. The money raised from this event goes directly to the  Centre County Youth Services Bureau.   This nonprofit organization has been strengthening children and  families since 1968. They work to provide every child with the  opportunity to reach their full potential.   Last year's fishing event raised more than $60,000 for the Youth  Services Bureau, and in the coming years, the Harpsters hope to raise  even more for this great organization.   Later this month, Angels in Adoption honorees from across the country  will arrive in Washington, D.C., to be celebrated for their great  contributions.   I look forward to meeting Abe and Trish to congratulate them on this  outstanding honor and discuss child welfare issues as well as their own  personal experiences with the adoption process.   For the past 20 years, Angels in Adoption has celebrated individuals,  couples, and organizations from across the country that have made an  extraordinary contribution on behalf of children in need: everyday  heroes, or in this case angels, like the Harpsters, who never seek  recognition but wholeheartedly deserve it.   I look forward to congratulating Abe and Trish in person.   Madam Speaker, I would also like to note that this past Sunday was  National Grandparents Day. In honor of this special day, we must not  forget the outstanding work being done by the foster grandparents  across the country.   The Foster Grandparent Program is a part of the Senior Corps of the  Cooperation for National and Community Service.   This program provides a way for volunteers age 55 and over to serve  as role models, mentors, and friends to children with exceptional  needs.   In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, there are more than 10,000  Senior Corps volunteers. These volunteers have touched the lives of so  many children by tutoring more than 4,000 young people in Pennsylvania  alone. And, Madam Speaker, these foster grandparents provide the kind  of guidance and love that set children on the path towards a successful  future.   I look forward to celebrating Abe and Trish Harpster, and want to  recognize all those who play an important role in the lives of young  people. There is no greater gift to give than time, love, and support  to a child in need.            Recognizing Nothing But Nets for Work Against Malaria     Madam Speaker, recently I met with a  constituent who works with the grassroots organization Nothing But  Nets, which raises awareness in the fight against malaria.   As you may know, malaria is transmitted to people through mosquitoes  carrying the disease. In 2016, there were 216 million new cases of  malaria worldwide and 445,000 deaths, 70 percent of which were children  under five. Malaria takes the life of a child every 2 minutes.   Most malaria cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, but  Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East are also at risk.   Malaria is a treatable, preventable disease, but half the world's  population lives in danger of contracting the parasite from a simple  mosquito bite.   U.S. leadership is critical to the elimination of malaria around the  world and we have helped to create and expand lifesaving interventions  like long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spray,  and rapid diagnostic tests.   Our continued leadership is critical in finally eliminating malaria  around the world. I look forward to the day when we can eradicate  malaria once and for all.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  HealthSouth Nittany Valley Rehabilitation Hospital on 35 years of  excellence in rehabilitation care.   HealthSouth is a rehabilitation hospital in Pleasant Gap,  Pennsylvania, that offers comprehensive inpatient and outpatient  rehabilitation services designed to return patients to leading active  and independent lives.   Mr. Speaker, I know firsthand the dedicated work these highly skilled  professionals perform each day at HealthSouth. Before coming to  Congress, I worked for 30 years as a therapist, a rehabilitation  services director, and a licensed nursing home administrator.   There is no greater joy than to see your patients make progress after  a debilitating event such as a stroke, a spinal cord injury, a brain  injury, or a motor vehicle accident.   HealthSouth is fortunate to be led by Chief Executive Officer Susan  Hartman, a long-time rehabilitation professional who joined HealthSouth  in 1994 and was named CEO in 2005.   I congratulate CEO Hartman and the entire staff at HealthSouth on 35  years of dedicated service to the community. They are committed to  providing patients with comfort, professionalism, and respect  throughout their rehabilitation experience, and we are grateful for  their high level of care.                            ____________________
