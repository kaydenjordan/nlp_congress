 I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Udall)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we gather on the floor of the Senate at an  unusually early hour. In fact, the Senate has been in session all  night. The question before us is the nomination of Betsy DeVos to be  Secretary of Education. It is possibly the most controversial  nomination made by our new President Trump.   This is an office which doesn't usually attract this kind of  controversy. Former Secretaries of Education have included Arne Duncan,  who ran the Chicago Public Schools system. He was the first to be  appointed in the first term of President Obama. Senator Lamar Alexander  of Tennessee--who is a friend of mine and whom I have served with-- before his service in the Senate, was also the Secretary of Education.   The choice is usually one that is bipartisan and largely supported by  not only teachers but parents and administrators and education  officials from across the United States. In this case, though, we have  in Betsy DeVos of Michigan a person of some controversy.   Last Saturday, I spoke to the Illinois Education Association, a group  of about 150 teachers who had gathered in Springfield, IL. They have  been my friends for many years. Cinda Klickna, who is the President of  the organization--we have a relationship that goes back to the days  when she was a classroom teacher--she now has risen through the ranks  and heads up one of the major teachers organizations in our State.   Cinda is a true teacher at heart and really cares for students, cares  for schools. She has devoted her life to it. She brought together 150  of her best teachers from around the State, preparing them to become  more active politically in our State and Nation.   Naturally, they were tuned into this nomination of Betsy DeVos. They  have a lot on their minds these days with the selection of the new  President. Nearly all of them have written me, sent me an email, or  contacted me personally opposing the nomination of Betsy DeVos.   I have not met Betsy DeVos. We tried to set up our schedules so I  could, but it didn't work. I take as much blame as necessary for that  not happening. I have studied her background. I have paid close  attention to what she has said since she has been nominated and tried  to understand where she comes from.   It is true that she is a person of wealth. The Prince family, which  she was born into, is well known in the Midwest and in Michigan for its  success in the automotive industry and many other endeavors. Then, she  married into the DeVoses of Amway, another legendary business, where  she has been able to accumulate some money.   There is nothing wrong with that in America. In fact, many people  aspire to it and reach that goal and are admired for reaching it. It  doesn't disqualify her for anything in life as far as I am concerned,  but it does not necessarily qualify her for certain things in life.   It is not clear to me from her record, when it comes to the field of  education, that she is prepared to serve this Nation as our next  Secretary of Education. I don't find in her background qualifications  for the job that I found when the Presiding Officer was chosen as  Secretary of Education or when my friend Arne Duncan of Chicago, whom I  had breakfast with yesterday, was chosen for the same position.   Ms. DeVos's experience in education is limited to using her family's  substantial wealth to push for a so-called reform agenda in her home  State of Michigan. Ms. DeVos has never been a teacher. She has never  been an administrator. In fact, she has never held any  [[Page S793]]  job in public education. Neither she nor her children have attended  public school. That is not a disqualification. I attended Catholic  schools. My children attended both. She has never been a professor or  college president. She has never had anything to do with college  financial aid, as I understand it. She has never been involved in a  loan program--least of all one as large and complex as the Department  of Education's Direct Loan Program.   She has never taken out a Federal student loan, nor have her  children. Admittedly, that is not a requirement to be Secretary of  Education, to have had any of these experiences, but had she had even  one or two of these, we could point to real-life experiences which  would prepare her for this awesome administrative responsibility.   I think these gaps in her life experience are fair to raise when a  nominee to be the Nation's top authority in education has shown a lack  of familiarity with even basic educational policy issues, as Ms. DeVos  did in her testimony before the Senate HELP Committee.   She could not articulate the difference between proficiency and  growth in the context of K-12 accountability. I can tell you that  Saturday at the Illinois Education Association meeting, everyone in the  room knew those terms well. They knew the central role they had played  in the national debate on education since the election of President  George W. Bush and the creation of No Child Left Behind.   Ms. DeVos also said in her testimony that States should be able to  decide whether to enforce the Individuals with Disabilities Education  Act. She apparently didn't know that IDEA is already a Federal law and  has been for more than 40 years. As a nominee, Ms. DeVos did not do her  homework.   Is that the person we want as Secretary of Education? The experience  Ms. DeVos has is limited to using her considerable wealth in favor of  an agenda for so-called school choice. Ms. DeVos has spent years  supporting school vouchers, which funnel taxpayers' money from public  schools into private schools.   I am familiar with that model, as it was implemented here in the  District of Columbia years ago. It actually started with an amendment  in the Appropriations Committee by a friend of mine. Mike DeWine was  the Senator from Ohio and offered an amendment to create a voucher  program in the District of Columbia. It was a surprise because a markup  of the Senate Appropriations Committee is not usually the place you  tackle something of that moment, but he offered it, and I offered some  amendments. The notion behind it was that the District of Columbia  would provide vouchers for the parents of children so they could choose  the schools for the kids. They wouldn't be forced to attend public  schools. They might not attend charter schools. They might choose  instead to use their voucher to send their kids to a private school.    I offered three amendments that day in the Appropriations Committee.  The fate of those amendments told a pretty graphic story about the  voucher program in the District of Columbia, and it also reflects on  the candidacy of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education.   The three amendments were, No. 1, that the teachers in the voucher  schools had to have college degrees. That to me did not sound like a  radical idea. Most of us assume that if you are going to teach in a  school, you have a college diploma. It turns out my amendment was  rejected with the DC voucher program that day when it was offered. The  argument was made they needed more flexibility in terms of who would  teach in these schools. That was worrisome.   The second amendment I offered said that the schools themselves, the  students, had to take the same test--achievement test--as students in  public schools in DC so we could measure one against the other. That  amendment was also rejected. They wanted to have the right in the so- called voucher schools to have their own set of tests that they would  approve, not necessarily the same test as the kids in public schools.  That amendment failed.   The third amendment I was sure would pass, but it failed as well. The  third amendment said the actual school buildings used for DC voucher  schools had to pass the fire safety code requirements of the District  of Columbia, and that was defeated too.   I voted against the DC voucher program for those reasons. I couldn't  understand how you could push for a voucher program not guaranteeing  that the teachers had diplomas from colleges, that they had schools in  safe buildings, and that the students would be tested against the same  public school test that DC Public School students faced.   That raised questions in my mind about the true intent and motive of  those who were pushing voucher schools. Ms. DeVos, in Michigan, has  been a proponent of voucher schools. She has pushed the expansion of  charter schools and used her extraordinary wealth to insulate them from  commonsense oversight and accountability in her State.   Even as the schools failed to deliver on the promises made to  children of parents, Ms. DeVos continued to protect them from the same  accountability standards as public schools. In 2015, a Federal review  found ``an unreasonably high'' percentage of charter schools on the  list of Michigan's lowest performing schools.   Today, for-profit companies operate almost 80 percent of charters in  Michigan, more than any other State, and are underperforming compared  to public school counterparts.   Let me be clear. I believe some charter schools can be effective. I  have visited so many schools in my State, public schools, Catholic  schools, charter schools, every imaginable school. I have supported  high-performing successful charter programs.   I think about the KIPP program here in the District of Columbia, in  Chicago, and other places, consistently producing some of the highest  results, the best results, and the highest standards for students. Is  there a lesson to be learned from the KIPP model for all schools? Of  course there is. You have to be blind to ignore it.   But on average, charter schools don't perform any better than public  schools--on average. To say that this is a model that we should embrace  regardless is unfair to students. If we are going to exalt performance  and results, let's do it in an honest fashion.   These schools that receive Federal and State taxpayer funding should  be held accountable, as all schools. Ms. DeVos doesn't agree. Senator  Tim Kaine from Virginia asked Ms. DeVos at her confirmation hearing if  she agreed with equal accountability for any K-12 school that receives  taxpayer funding, whether that school is public, charter, or private.  She refused to agree, and at one point even said ``no''.   Ms. DeVos also seems unwilling to acknowledge that many private and  charter schools are not equipped to support students with disabilities  and other special needs in the way the public schools are required to  do. These students, along with many low-income and minority students,  would certainly be left behind in Ms. DeVos's ideal education world.   Last year--and the Presiding Officer was a major part of this  decision--Congress did what seemed unimaginable. We came together and  passed the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA. ESSA makes important  improvements to our elementary and secondary education program. It  requires States to set academic standards, measure student achievement,  and develop accountability plans for all schools receiving Federal  money.   Giving Illinois parents, teachers, and principals a replacement to No  Child Left Behind was a great bipartisan achievement. I do want to call  out in a favorable way, my colleague, the Presiding Officer, Senator  Alexander of Tennessee, and my colleague Senator Murray of the State of  Washington. They did a great job.   While ESSA provides more authority to States and local school  districts, it also included important Federal guardrails to ensure key  civil rights protections and holds States and school districts  accountable. Federal rules to carry out that important Federal task are  now in doubt and in jeopardy.   I don't have confidence that, as Secretary, Ms. DeVos will  appropriately carry out the Federal Government's responsibility under  the law to ensure that all students--regardless of income, race,  gender, or disability--are achieving.  [[Page S794]]    For me, it all boils down to this. I do not believe Betsy DeVos will  keep the promise we made more than 50 years ago when Lyndon Johnson  signed into law the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which  guaranteed in the United States of America a free and equal quality  public education to every child.   I am not going to give up on that promise, which really is a bedrock  principle of America. There is more work to do, I am sure, but I  believe we can improve America's public schools.   Let me also say that I couldn't disagree more with what Ms. DeVos has  said about guns in schools.   My colleague Senator Chris Murphy represents the State of  Connecticut. Both he and Senator Blumenthal have told us many times, in  heartbreaking and graphic detail, what happened that day at Sandy Hook  Elementary--what they went through just as observers--what they saw in  the eyes of the parents who came to realize that their children had  been killed--brutally killed in the classroom at that elementary  school. I have had the responsibility to meet with the parents of those  kids, and to try to make some sense out of a tragedy which is just  nonsensical.   Ms. DeVos was asked by Senator Murphy about guns in schools. Ms.  DeVos said she would not commit to opposing efforts to repeal Federal  law that makes schools gun-free zones. She went on with a hard-to- explain explanation about grizzly bears and why schools may need guns  to ward off grizzly bears. That kind of statement is reckless and  dangerous. We should expect more of someone who wants to be our  Nation's top education authority.   I am also concerned when it comes to higher education policy. Betsy  DeVos has a tendency of siding with corporate and for-profit interests  over students when it comes to education. Take for-profit colleges as  an example. Despite years of fraud and abuse by for-profit colleges,  the extent of which is unparalleled in other sectors of higher  education, Ms. DeVos does not see the connection between the business  model of for-profit colleges and these abuses. When she was asked by  Senator Murray if she believes different types of corporate-controlled  structures result in different decisions and behaviors by for-profit  institutions compared to nonprofit institutions, Ms. DeVos simply  answered: ``No.''   Even for-profit industry insiders have acknowledged that the business  model indeed encourages abuse. In a 2015 interview with Deseret News,  John Murphy, the founder of the University of Phoenix, admitted that  the company experienced a shift in priorities that led to diminished  student outcomes when it became a publicly traded company. He says the  new focus became increasingly the value of the stock--at any cost,  including ``lowering its admission standards,'' and ``jettisoning the  academic model'' it had previously relied on. Other companies soon  followed the University of Phoenix's corporate example. As John Murphy  said, ``Phoenix was the one that got it rolling, then all the other  for-profits followed them in.''   What resulted was an entire industry built on defrauding students and  fleecing taxpayers. For-profit colleges and universities in America  today are the most heavily subsidized private for-profit businesses in  our country. These are not good corporate models. These are crony  capitalist ventures that have found a way to tap into the Federal  Treasury at the expense not only of taxpayers but of unwitting students  and their families. Nearly every major for-profit college has been  investigated or sued by one or more State or Federal agency for unfair,  deceptive, and abusive practices.   The numbers tell the story, and I have told them many times. Some 10  percent of college students go to for-profit colleges and universities,  and 20 percent of all the Federal education aid goes to the same  schools. That is 10 percent of the students and 20 percent of the  Federal aid. The schools are extraordinarily expensive. And 40 percent  of all the student loan defaults in America are students from for- profit colleges and universities.   Corinthian may be one of the worst and well-known examples, though  it's not unique. Corinthian, a for-profit college, falsified and  inflated job placement rates to entice more students to sign up for  their worthless programs. One of the tricks they used was to pay  employers to hire their graduates for a couple of months so they could  count them as successfully off to work after they graduated. It was a  fraud, and they were caught red-handed. The company's predatory  practices, once exposed, led to its bankruptcy. But tens of thousands  of students were left with huge amounts of student debt and a worthless  education.   Shame on us in the United States of America for the Department of  Education's giving the green light to these schools to do business in  America and to defraud these students, their families, and, ultimately,  the taxpayers.   This embarrassing episode at Corinthian led the Department of  Education to create an interagency task force to coordinate Federal  oversight efforts of for-profit colleges and a new enforcement unit  within the Department to investigate allegations against schools  participating in the Federal title IV program. Unfortunately, at her  hearing, Ms. DeVos would not commit to maintaining this important  office, signaling she is ready to take the cops off the beat at the  Department when it comes to for-profit colleges and universities. I am  afraid that is consistent with what she has done in Michigan, where she  leans toward the for-profit model--blind to the fact that many of these  for-profit schools in her State are worthless. For-profit colleges, the  most heavily subsidized private entities in America already, have  friends in high places in Washington.   We know what happened to their stock prices over the years, as  students and families realized how terrible they were and stopped  attending them. Enrollment went down in many of the schools. Guess what  happened the day after President Trump was elected? The stocks of for- profit colleges and universities started to rise again. They saw new  opportunities. They were going to get a Department of Education that  would stop enforcing the law to stop the fraud that they have been  guilty of.   At her hearing Ms. DeVos gave us no hope for any different outcome.  We know from recent data released by the Obama Department of Education  that many for-profit colleges actually receive nearly 100 percent of  their revenue from Federal taxpayers in the form of title IV funds,  Department of Defense tuition assistance, and Department of Veterans  Affairs GI bill. I don't know how a good business-oriented Republican  could overlook the fact that these so-called for-profit schools are  thinly veneered operations, gleaning every available Federal tax dollar  to keep their schools open. Annually, they take in nearly $25 billion  in title IV Federal funds alone.    The Department has a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer funding  isn't wasted by enriching investors and executives at institutions that  prey on students and don't deliver on their promises. In keeping with  that responsibility, the Obama administration created new Federal  regulations to ensure that career training programs are meeting the  statutory requirement and that they prepare students for gainful  employment. The gainful employment rule cuts off title IV funding for  programs where graduates' ratio of student debt to earnings is too  high. In other words, if they sink these students deeply in debt and  they can't end up with a job that is worth at least as much as they  need to earn to pay off their debt, then something is wrong with the  program.   Ms. DeVos would not commit to maintaining this protection for  students and taxpayers. Proactive oversight and enforcement is one  thing, but when fraud and abuse do occur, Ms. DeVos would not even  commit to make it right by the students harmed. She refused to say that  she would ensure defrauded students received the Federal student loan  discharges to which they are entitled under the law.   Maybe this shouldn't surprise us. For one, Ms. DeVos's would-be boss,  the President of the United States, Donald Trump, operated his own for- profit college that defrauded students. And as it turns out, Ms. DeVos,  a billionaire, has financial connections to the for-profit college  industry. She has disclosed investments with several entities linked to  for-profit colleges, including Apollo Investment Corporation, which is  connected to one of the organizations that  [[Page S795]]  just bought the University of Phoenix. Apollo invests in another for- profit college chain that has several programs that are in danger of  losing Federal funding because of the gainful employment rule. These  colleges also happen to be accredited by the Accrediting Council for  Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS, which put its stamp of  approval on the likes of Corinthian, ITT Tech, and the notorious  Westwood College. Last year, the Obama Education Department revoked  ACICS' Federal recognition, and the accreditor is now actively suing  the Department over this decision. Now Ms. DeVos wants to take over the  Department, and she is supposed to defend against the lawsuit when she  has a financial interest in the schools that are involved?   For-profit colleges aren't the only ones who may be given free rein  to prey on students under a Secretary DeVos. The private student loan  industry is also licking its chops. A recent Chicago Tribune article  entitled ``Student Loan Lenders May See Opportunities with Trump in The  White House'' told the story. It noted that, since the election, stocks  of major private student loan issuers have also gone up. The article  quotes a report by financial analyst Bob Napoli that says: ``There  could be substantial growth potential in the student lending business  as we believe the Trump administration is likely to reduce government  involvement in the student lending business.''   What is government involvement in the student lending business? Well,  it is an effort to have oversight so that students and their parents  aren't exploited by student loans. The fear is that with Secretary  DeVos, that oversight would disappear. This government involvement in  student lending, which Napoli speaks about, also includes Department of  Education direct loans, which help millions of low-income and middle- class students attend college each year with lower interest rates for  loans. These loans have fixed interest rates, strong consumer  protection, and flexible repayment. In addition to loans, Federal Pell  grants provide much needed financial support to thousands of low-income  students across the country--financial support they don't have to  repay.   On the other hand, private student loans often have variable interest  rates that can reach nearly 20 percent, hefty origination fees, few  consumer protections, and no alternative repayment option. Unlike  nearly all other private debt, private student loans are not  dischargeable in bankruptcy. That is a debt they will take to the  grave. A greater role for private student lenders, without strong new  protections and oversight by critical agencies like the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, would be a ``sentence to debt'' for many  college students across our country.   I have deep concerns about Ms. DeVos's ability to hold this job as  Secretary of Education. This morning or perhaps early this afternoon,  we may see history made on the floor of the Senate. It is quite  possible that the only way Betsy DeVos can become Secretary of  Education is if the Vice President of the United States will come and  preside and cast the deciding, tie-breaking vote so that she can become  a member of President Trump's Cabinet. I understand from news reports  that this will be the first time in history that someone has had to  rely on the Vice President's tie-breaking vote to become part of a  President's Cabinet. Doesn't it say a lot about the controversy  surrounding Ms. DeVos that it has reached this point, that she has to  pull out all the stops--literally, all the stops--to become part of the  Cabinet?   She was asked at one point--I believe by Senator Sanders of Vermont-- how much money she had actually contributed to the Republican Party  over the years. Was it $200 million or more? She said she just didn't  know. Well, it is not against the law to contribute money under most  circumstances. It shouldn't be held against people because many folks  who receive political appointments are contributors to the President  who makes the appointments. That is not unusual. It has happened with  both political parties, but it is seldom a person with such a thin  resume--and such a big wallet--who is given such an important job. This  goes too far. For Ms. DeVos to be the Ambassador to Aruba, or wherever  she might be, that is a good political reward. To be placed in charge  of the public education system of the United States of America, I  think, is a step too far.   I have deep concerns about Ms. DeVos's ability to hold this job and  her commitment to public education and protecting students from for- profit interests that seek to exploit them. Like tens of thousands of  Illinois parents, teachers, and principals who call my office--as well  as national education civil rights organizations--I oppose Betsy  DeVos's nomination as Secretary of Education.   Two of my Republican colleagues have shown extraordinary courage in  announcing their opposition to Ms. DeVos. I want to salute Senator Lisa  Murkowski of Alaska and Senator Susan Collins of Maine. I am sure it  wasn't easy for them to come out publicly against Ms. DeVos. That means  right now that there are 50 ``no'' votes and 50 ``yes'' votes, by rough  calculation. We need, at this moment in time, one more Republican to  stand up and do what is right for America's children and America's  students.   Who will it be? Who will join these two women from Alaska and Maine  and the Democrats in saying to President Trump: We can do better. To my  Republican colleagues, I say: Parents, students, teachers in your  States are counting on you to stop this dangerous nomination. Please  don't let them down.   I would also like to note some excerpts from mail I have received  about Ms. DeVos's nomination from my home State of Illinois. Hannah is  a graduate student at the University of Illinois in a K-12 librarian  program. She writes:         I am a student who benefitted from IDEA. . . . Without this       Federal protection it is unlikely that I would be where I am       now. [Betsy DeVos] does not share the American value of equal       and free education. Confirming her is dangerous and reckless.       The children who need help the most will not be helped.    Barbara, mother of two Chicago public school high school students  writes:         Please do not support Betsy DeVos for Education Secretary.       She knows nothing about public education. We need strong       support for public education.    Hanan, a certified and licensed speech language pathologist writes:         As . . . a Mother with three children who received therapy       while two currently do, I beg you to vote no on Betsy DeVos.       I am afraid of what will become of my children, as well as my       students if therapy services are not provided through the       public education system. Many of my student families cannot       afford private therapy. They rely on getting their therapy       through the school they attend.    Michelle, a teacher from Chicago writes:         As an educator myself, I believe Betsy DeVos is unfit to       serve as Secretary of Education. Our schools and our children       need a leader who supports public education, is qualified and       experienced, and does not have conflicts of interest.    Katie, a school counselor from Chicago writes:         I fear the impact [Betsy DeVos] will have on the lives of       our students. My greatest concern is her sheer lack of       understanding of education in the U.S. For myself and my       colleagues, many of the questions she was asked during the       hearing were topics we share a variety of opinions and could       talk about at length. The fact that she answered very few       questions, did not know what IDEA is and doesn't even seem to       understand the concerns of having guns in schools does not       qualify her to be in this position.    Alejandra, middle schooler from Bellwood, IL. She writes:         I do not believe that Mrs. DeVos is a suitable choice for       the place as Secretary of Education for the United States.       One of the many reasons for this is because she lacks       experience. Another reason . . . is because she has no plans       and the few plans that she does [have] may result in harm to       the public school system. I believe that Mrs. DeVos does not       understand how public schools function and I also believe       that she should be replaced with someone with more knowledge       and understanding on this subject. Mrs. DeVos does not       understand that public schools have the same impact on       students as private schools and should be treated fairly.       This affects my community because many cannot afford private       school and public schools are their only option. If Mrs.       DeVos were to become Secretary [of Education] she would most       likely harm the public school system and leave many students       without an education.    From Loves Park, IL, Lisa writes:         While my own child attended Catholic school, I am opposed       to vouchers. I do not complain about paying education taxes.       It was my and my husband's decision to send our child to a       private school. It was our choice. But as my immigrant       grandmother  [[Page S796]]       often said, one of the things that makes America great is       education for all regardless of social class. I want every       person as well educated as they can be in grades K-12. For       goodness sake, vote No [on DeVos].    Travis, a principal from Southern Illinois writes:         As a strong supporter of public education, I ask that you       oppose the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of the       U.S. Department of Education. We must have a secretary who       can commit to supporting every student in all public schools,       and provide leadership that will help our neighborhood       schools succeed. Betsy DeVos' record in education and her       performance at the recent confirmation hearing prove she is       the wrong candidate for the job. As a principal, I have       spoken with teachers, parents, students, and community       members who agree that America's future depends on a strong       investment in our Nation's public schools.    Celia from Streamwood, IL, writes:         [Betsy DeVos] will not do justice to all of our students,       because she has no experience with public schools. A lot of       school districts outside of the metropolitan area do not have       charter schools, which she is a big proponent of.    Tawnya from Chicago writes:         I attended public school in rural Illinois. My kids attend       public school in Chicago. My husband teaches at a charter       school, but you and I both know that not all charter schools       are run efficiently . . . and the record of charter schools       in Michigan, Mrs. DeVos' home state are proof of that. Mrs.       DeVos has absolutely no business making decisions about       public schools, having never attended, nor sen[t] children of       her own, nor having worked in any capacity there. I am an       evangelical, white Christian who votes in every election, and       while I might share some of her basic beliefs, I vehemently       oppose her nomination for education secretary. Please lean on       those who support her to withdraw her name and do what is       best for our Nation's children.    Peggy from Belvidere, IL, writes:         I am extremely concerned and actually appalled that Betsy       DeVos is the nominee for Secretary of Education. I have been       in public education my entire life and believe we need to       look at the millions that benefit for quality public       educators and their dedication. There are wonderful       classrooms, but also some systems in need of great       improvement, but this candidate is clearly not qualified for,       or even interested in giving a second thought to what middle-      class and poor children may need. Please vote no! Our       children deserve better than this! In this uncertain time,       please stand up for our kids' and educators!    When I went back to Springfield, IL, I asked the local office there  what kind of telephone calls we have been receiving this past week.  They showed me the results from Wednesday, approximately 600 calls  voting no on Betsy DeVos, 3 yes.   Sarah from Hyde Park writes to me:         Mrs. DeVos would single-handedly decimate our public       education system if she were ever confirmed. Her plan to       privatize education would deprive students from a good public       education, while helping students from wealthy families get       another leg up. It would deprive teachers of a decent salary,       and it would make it harder for parents to get a good       education for their kids. Public education has lifted       millions out of poverty, has put millions in good paying       jobs, and has been the launching pad for people who went on       to cure disease and to create inventions that have changed       our society for the better. I have a daughter who will be       starting kindergarten in Chicago's public schools this fall.       Please do the right thing for her and millions of other       Illinois children who depend on public schools and who will       be negatively affected by Mrs. DeVos's confirmation.    Dr. Kranti Dasgupta, a doctor from the City of Chicago writes:         Not only do ethical concerns exist regarding [DeVos']       conflicts of interest but I am also appalled at how       unqualified she is to lead this country in such an important       arena. As a family medicine physician, I have worked and       trained in some of the poorest neighborhoods [in Chicago]. I       have seen firsthand how behind many of these children are       compared to their more affluent peers. I strongly believe [a]       voucher program would further this education gap by taking       money away from public schools that need it the most. Without       a solid education, there is little chance for many of those       children to lift themselves out of their socioeconomic       situation. I implore you to consider the well-being of these       children and give them a better chance to be productive       citizens of Illinois. Please cast your vote against Betsy       DeVos for Secretary of Education.    I have a message from Daniel from the Ukrainian Village; Michelle  from Bolingbrook; Kristi, a mother of two from the Rogers Park area of  Chicago; Crystal from the city of Pekin; and Kristin from Naperville,  IL.   Daniel from the Ukrainian Village area of Chicago:         As the proud uncle of a wonderful autistic child who is       being educated in the public schools, I cannot support       someone so [un]qualified to be our educator in chief.       Further, as you well know, DeVos has a long and documented       record of lavishly supporting causes that are antithetical to       the values I--and so many other Americans--hold dear. I hope       that you will vote ``no'' on this important nominee.    Michelle from Bolingbook:         I have [worked] in Special Education for the past 20 years.       [Betsy] DeVos' nomination is frightening to the future of all       children. This isn't about politics; but about the lack of       qualifications that she brings to this position.    Kristi, the mother of two from the Rogers Park area of Chicago:         I feel very strong in the separation of church and state       and [Betsy DeVos] does not. She wants to ``advance God's       kingdom'' through school reform.    Crystal from Pekin:         I am a special educator in central Illinois. I teach a very       special population of students with severe and profound       disabilities in an all special education school. As an       advocate for my students, I urge you to reject the nomination       for Betsy DeVos. She is not qualified to make decisions that       will affect teachers and students in rural public schools       across Illinois.    Kristin from Naperville:         DeVos' skillset is commandeering public funding for private       education. She was a key player in shaping the Michigan       charter school system, which is severely lacking in       oversight, demanding little accountability for how tax       dollars are spent or how well students are educated. I don't       want to see the same thing happen nationally . . . America's       students and teachers deserve better than DeVos.    I ask unanimous consent that this several-page document, which  includes a list of letters of opposition to the nomination of Betsy  DeVos, be printed in the Record. There are some 322 letters in  opposition. To spare the Government Publishing Office, I will not ask  that all of these letters in their entirety be printed, but it is a  voluminous list of opposition to Betsy DeVos.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   Letters of Opposition to the Nomination of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of                                 Education         Includes:        National Women's Law Center; People for the American Way;       National Council of Jewish Women; NAACP Legal Defense and       Educational Fund, Inc., National Education Association;       Americans United for Separation of Church and State; The       Leadership Conference; Legal Aid At Work; YouthCare; American       Federation of State County and Municipal Employees; OCA--      Asican Pacific American Advocates; National Urban League;       HRC; Feminist Majority Foundation; Tri-Caucus; NASSP;       YouthCare; Outright Vermont; National Organization of Women;       American Federation of Teachers; AFL-CIO; American Federation       of State, County, and Municipal Employees; CLASP; Council of       Parent Attorneys and Advocates (COPAA); Council of District       of Columbia, Chair of Committee on Education; American       Association of People with Disabilities; Autistic Self       Advocacy Network; Center for Public Representation;       Children's Mental Health Network; Disability Rights Education       and Defense Fund; Education Law Center-PA; Judge David L.

I also want to direct my colleagues--I see my colleague  on the floor from Connecticut, and I want to yield to him--to a New  York Times article, which was published on June 28, 2016, entitled ``A  Sea of Charter Schools in Detroit Leaves Students Adrift,'' by Kate  Zernike.   Let me close by saying, this is rare. It is rare that we have a  nomination for the position of Secretary of Education which has drawn  such controversy. There were many things that Ms. DeVos could have been  given as a reward for her loyal support of Republicans and all of the  things she has done in her life, but to be entrusted with the  responsibility of running America's public education system at this  critical moment in our history certainly is not one of them, as far as  I am concerned.   We should have taken the time and the President should have taken the  time to find a person who had the resume, the qualifications, and the  expertise in education policy for this important responsibility. We owe  our children nothing less.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, let me say at the outset that I am glad I  was here for the statement made by the Senator from South Carolina. We  disagree on many things. We agree on things as well. I respect him very  much and turn to him often to find bipartisan support when, frankly, no  one else will answer the phone. He has been a great friend and ally and  has been very blunt with me when we disagree. We do disagree today, and  I do it respectfully because Senator Graham is a person I do, in fact,  respect as a Senate colleague.   He is right about one thing: You would expect a new President to pick  someone to be an Attorney General whom they know and trust. It might  have even been someone from the campaign trail.   A classic example is 1960, when President John Kennedy was elected  and chose his brother Robert Kennedy, who had worked on his campaign,  to serve as Attorney General of the United States. You can't think of a  clearer analogy to what has been described today. But the point that  was made earlier by Senator Feinstein about the relationship of Senator  Sessions with Candidate Trump is one that goes beyond familiarity,  beyond support in a political campaign. In fact, they did work  together, and they do agree on some fundamental issues.   If the press can be trusted--and the White House is the first to tell  us they can't--but if the press can be trusted,  [[Page S833]]  in a Washington Post article of January 31, 2017, we see a very clear  working relationship that extends beyond the would-be Attorney General  Jeff Sessions and the new President Donald Trump but includes a former  key staffer for Senator Sessions, Steve Miller, and a man named Steve  Bannon, who is with Breitbart News and is now a political inspiration  to the Trump White House. It appears that they have a very close  working relationship among them. That in and of itself is not  troubling, except when you look at the issues they have worked on  closely together--the issue of immigration, the Executive orders, of  which the Post said Senator Sessions was the ``intellectual  godfather.'' That is a clear example pointed out by this article, and  that is one of the reasons it was raised by Senator Feinstein.   I understand what Senator Graham has to say: that Senator Sessions  has been nothing more than a Senator loyal to his home State of Alabama  in his politics and in his views on issues. I do acknowledge that and  can tell you that, over 20 years, I have heard Senator Sessions's  speeches repeatedly, and he does take those positions. But the thing  that troubles me is the question about whether the values of the  Senator from Alabama are the values we want in the Attorney General of  the United States. To be very blunt, in some cases, they are not, as  far as I am concerned.   I understand that President Trump won the election, but that doesn't  mean, when it comes to advice and consent, that every Member of the  Senate has to bow and step back a few steps for every nominee proposed  by this new President. We have a responsibility to ask what is right  for America, what is right in terms of values and judgments that we  bring to this job, as well.   It is not a happy moment for me to say this, but I do stand in  opposition to the nomination of Jeff Sessions to serve as Attorney  General of the United States. The reason I don't view this as a happy  moment is I have known him for 20 years. We have worked in the Senate,  in committees, and on the floor. I know him personally. I met his  family. And to say that I don't support him for this elevation to  Attorney General is something that is hard to say, but I know that I  have to. This is not a decision I have come to lightly. Senator  Sessions is a colleague of over 20 years. But the question we now face  is whether he is the right person to be the No. 1 law enforcement  official in the United States of America.   He comes to this new opportunity in a sharply divided nation. We have  a controversial new President who already has seen an Executive order  blocked by the courts in what appears to be record time. Think about  that for a moment. Donald Trump has been President of the United States  for 19 days. In those 19 days, he has issued an Executive order stopped  by the Federal courts of the land from implementation and he has  dismissed an Attorney General. No other new President, in 19 days, can  point to that happening. It is an indication of the types of policies  he is promoting. It is also an indication that in the future, he is  likely to again test the separation of powers in this government.   In this context, the need for an independent Attorney General has  never been greater. We need an Attorney General who will not just serve  as the President's lawyer or cheerleader but who will defend the  constitutional rights of everyone, including protecting those rights  from an overreaching President, if necessary. As a member of the  Judiciary Committee, I have carefully considered this nomination, and I  am not persuaded that Senator Sessions will serve that level of  independence.   Also, I have strong concerns that. if he is confirmed, he won't  adequately pursue the cause of justice on a range of important issues.  In his nomination hearing, Senator Sessions said on issue after issue  that he would simply follow the law, enforce the law, but that doesn't  come close to capturing the real role of the Attorney General. The  Attorney General, as chief prosecutor in America, doesn't just ``follow  the law''; that person uses his discretion to determine how the law is  enforced and whom it is enforced against. Ignoring that is to ignore  one of the key elements of service as Attorney General.   As Acting Attorney General Sally Yates reminded us, the Attorney  General has a critical role at times in even standing up to the  President. The American Bar Association standards say that the duty of  the prosecutor is to seek justice, not merely to convict. I don't have  confidence, based on the answers he has given me, that Senator Sessions  would follow that standard.   Here is one example. At the hearing, I introduced Senator Sessions to  Alton Mills of Chicago, who in his youth was a street-level courier for  drug dealers. He was sentenced to life without parole and prison at age  24--life without parole at age 24 under the Federal three strikes and  you are out law. He was sentenced on a nonviolent drug offense--no  guns, no violence. He sold drugs a third time and got a life sentence.   Even the judge imposing the sentence did not agree with it, but he  said the law said what he had to follow and his hands were tied. Alton  Mills needed to pay for his mistakes, but he did not need to spend the  rest of his life in prison. In December 2015, President Obama commuted  Alton's sentence, after he had served 22 years in prison.   Under the Obama administration, Justice Department prosecutors were  directed to search out low-level offenders like Alton Mills and use the  discretion of the Department of Justice and make sure that they were  given a second chance. Senator Sessions has said that he strongly  opposes these guidelines.   When it came to clemency, Senator Sessions fiercely criticized  President Obama, saying he commuted sentences in ``an unprecedented  reckless manner.'' Senator Sessions also said: ``So-called low-level  non-violent offenders simply do not exist in the Federal system.''   When it came to changing the law that led to Alton Mills sentence,  Senator Sessions led the opposition. I appreciate the work we did  together on the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. But every time I have  returned to Senator Sessions and asked him to work with me for the  thousands still stuck in Federal prison for nonviolent drug offenses  under the old sentencing disparities which we have now rejected, he  refused, time and again. He has opposed every bipartisan effort,  including a bill that I put together with Senator Grassley, Senator  Cornyn, and others to allow individuals to petition on an individual  basis for sentence reductions.   So to sum it up, Senator Sessions has staunchly opposed using  prosecutorial discretion, clemency, or legislation to address the  plight of thousands of people like Alton Mills. What can we expect of  Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the next 4 years when it comes to  criminal justice and criminal sentencing reform? I am afraid we can't  expect a caring person to take a look at the simple injustice in our  system.   I have listened. time and again, as many other colleagues have, to  the statements made by Senator Sessions on the issue of immigration. I  have said before on this floor--and I will say it again--that I am the  proud son of an immigrant. For generations. America has been renewed  and enriched through immigration. Since World War II, we have set an  example to the world when it comes to providing a safe haven for  refugees.   We have four Hispanic Senators in this Chamber. Three of them are  Cuban Americans. What can we say about the Cuban refugees who came to  the United States by the hundreds of thousands to flee the oppression  of Castro? They were not subjected to extreme vetting. In most cases,  we said: If you can find freedom in this country you are welcome. They  have made America a better nation for it.   Since World War II, that has been America's standard. Now it is being  challenged. It is hard to understand how the Trump administration could  consider spending so much on a Mexican wall that Texas Republican  Congressman Will Hurd, whose district covers 800 miles of the southwest  border, described as ``the most expensive and least effective way to  secure the border.''   I have come to this floor and voted for more money for walls and  obstacles and technology on that border than I ever imagined necessary,  in the hopes that we could finally put to rest this notion that we  could always do more. I wonder what image it creates of this  [[Page S834]]  country, as we continue to talk about walls and banning travel.   President Trump signed an Executive order on January 27 banning  immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, and banning refugees  from those countries into the United States. As I go through the list  of the people who were affected by this, overwhelmingly they are women  and children, victims of war, terrorism, and persecution. Many of them  have been waiting literally for years to come to the United States.  Since World War II, we have accepted so many refugees from Eastern  Europe, from Vietnam, from Cuba, as I mentioned earlier, and from  Yugoslavia. Over 100,000 Soviet Jews make their home in the United  States because we accepted them as refugees.   Now President Trump has issued this Executive order that is being  challenged in court, and we will know within a matter of days whether  it will be stayed or continued, contested or if it will stand as law.  Acting Attorney General Sally Yates said that she could not stand to  defend that order. She felt it was illegal and unconstitutional.   The question, obviously, is what would the new Attorney General, if  it is Jeff Sessions do, when faced with that same challenge? My fear is  that he would not stand in independent judgment of the actions of the  President. That to me is unfortunate and falls short of what we expect  from the Attorney General.   We need someone like Edward Levi, the longtime president of the  University of Chicago, who served as a truly nonpartisan Attorney  General under President Ford. He restored honor and integrity to the  Justice Department after Watergate. Where would Senator Sessions stand  once confirmed? Would he defend the President's Executive orders? Would  he stand up to the President if he disagreed with him? I have strong  concerns.   Mr. President, one of the most important issues when it comes to the  Attorney General is the oversight of the Civil Rights Division, which  is, in fact, the crown jewel of the Justice Department, as far as I am  concerned. It is responsible for protecting the civil rights of all  Americans.   Senator Cory Booker and Congressmen John Lewis and Cedric Richmond  gave powerful testimony at Senator Sessions' hearing. They discussed  their concerns about the Justice Department under his leadership and  whether it would protect the civil and voting rights of all Americans.  I took their words to heart. I want to talk specifically about their  concerns about the Voting Rights Act.   One month from now, we will recognize the 52nd anniversary of what  came to be known as Bloody Sunday--March 7, 1965. John Lewis and Rev.  Hosea Williams led 600 brave civil rights activists in a march over the  Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. The marchers were brutally beaten as  State troopers turned them back and chased them down. John Lewis was  beaten unconscious and nearly killed.   A few months after Bloody Sunday, President Lyndon Johnson signed the  Voting Rights Act into law, guaranteeing that the right to vote would  not be restricted through clever schemes like poll taxes and literacy  tests devised to keep African Americans from voting.   In 2006, Congress voted to reauthorize that same act after holding 21  hearings, hearing testimony from more than 90 witnesses, and receiving  15,000 pages of evidence.   Congressman Lewis said in an op-ed about the ongoing need for that  act:         Congress came to a near-unanimous conclusion: While some       change has occurred, the places with a legacy of long-      standing, entrenched and state-sponsored voting       discrimination still have the most persistent, flagrant,       contemporary records of discrimination in this country. While       the 16 jurisdictions affected by Section 5 represent only 25       percent of the nation's population, they still represent more       than 80 percent of the lawsuits proving cases of voting       discrimination.    While Senator Sessions ultimately voted to reauthorize the Voting  Rights Act, his comments about the law have been very troubling.   In contrast to Congressman Lewis's statement about the need for a  strong Voting Rights Act, Senator Sessions repeatedly criticized the  law's section 5 preclearance provision, which required certain  jurisdictions--including, but not limited to, Alabama--to ``preclear''  any changes to their voting laws with the Department of Justice. At his  nomination hearing last month, Senator Sessions reiterated his view  that section 5 of the law, in his words, was ``intrusive.''   He also celebrated the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v.  Holder when a divided Court--5 to 4--gutted the Voting Rights Act and  struck down the preclearance provision. That decision left the  Department of Justice with fewer tools to protect Americans' right to  vote. Nonetheless, on the day of that awful decision, Senator Sessions  stated: ``[The decision was] good news, I think, for the South, in that  [there was] not sufficient evidence to justify treating them  disproportionately.'' Senator Sessions was wrong to dismiss the vital  role that preclearance has played in protecting voters from  discriminatory laws.   When Senator Sessions came to my office for a personal meeting before  this hearing began, I sat down with him and talked about the Voting  Rights Act. I gave to him a book written by Carol Anderson. She is a  political science professor at Emory University in the State of  Georgia. The book is entitled ``White Rage.'' Carol Anderson  systematically goes through the history of race in America after the  Civil War, and she points out in each section how Congress would, on  one hand, give rights to African Americans and then turn around and  take them away. The most recent example relates to the Voting Rights  Act itself and all the efforts of the 1960s to guarantee that  minorities had the right to vote in America. She follows it with the  undeniable record of efforts toward voter suppression when it comes to  minorities in the United States.   I pointed this out to Senator Sessions because he has been in denial  over this reality. I told him about hearings that we held in Ohio, in  Florida, taking election officials, putting them under oath--officials  from both political parties--and asking them point blank: Before you  established the need for these voting restrictions in your State, what  was the incidence of widespread voter fraud that led you to believe it  was necessary? And the answer repeatedly was, there was none. No  incidents of widespread voter fraud to speak of. No incidents of  anything substantial when it came to prosecution. Clearly the motive  behind these voter suppression laws are just that--to suppress voters  from their opportunity to vote.   What can we expect of Attorney General Sessions on this issue? I am  afraid, based on his statements, his record, his voting, we can expect  the worst.   Example: A three-judge Federal appeals court struck down a North  Carolina law that required voter ID and limited early voting. The court  found that the law was crafted and passed with ``racially  discriminatory intent,'' in violation of the Constitution and section 2  of the Voting Rights Act. In the decision, this Federal court noted  this regarding the North Carolina statute:         Before enacting [the] law, the legislature requested data       on the use, by race, of a number of voting practices. Upon       receipt of the race data, the General Assembly enacted       legislation that restricted voting and registration in five       different ways, all of which disproportionately affected       African Americans.    We are still facing this challenge in America. I wish it were not the  case. I had hoped at this point in my life that I would be pointing to  our problems with race as something from the past, but it is a current  challenge we face, and it is a challenge the Attorney General must face  squarely. I do not believe that Attorney General Jeff Sessions will do  that, and that is why I can't support him for that position.   Of course there is also Senator Sessions' decision as U.S. attorney  to bring the 1985 Perry County case when he was in Alabama. He  prosecuted three African-American civil rights activists for voter  fraud. All three were acquitted. That case prompted former  Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, who was an attorney for the  defendants, to send a letter to members of our committee saying, ``To  use prosecutorial discretion to attempt to criminalize voter assistance  is wrong and should be disqualifying for any aspirant to the Nation's  highest law enforcement post.''   Senator Sessions' statements and his records are particularly  concerning in  [[Page S835]]  light of President Trump's recent repeated, baseless claims about voter  fraud in the 2016 Presidential election. Make no mistake--President  Trump's false claim that there were millions of fraudulent votes cast  in the last election is an excuse for further voter suppression  efforts.   It is imperative that the Department of Justice be led by someone who  values the vital role the Department plays in protecting the right to  vote. Given Senator Sessions' dismissive comments about the Voting  Rights Act and his history of supporting burdensome voting laws, I am  not confident he is prepared to do that.   Senator Sessions' record on religious freedom also raises significant  questions. The free exercise of religion is enshrined in the First  Amendment of the Constitution. However, Senator Sessions has only been  outspoken in his defense of religious freedom for some faiths. For  example, he denounced a 1997 court order that limited prayer in Alabama  public schools, calling it ``one more example of the effort by the  courts to eliminate the natural expression of religious belief from  public life.''   A year later, he introduced a Senate resolution ``affirming the right  to display the Ten Commandments in public places, including government  offices and courthouses.'' He said ``[w]e've got to end the hostility  toward the display of the Ten Commandments in public places.''   But he has been much more ambivalent about Islam. He has referred to  Islam as ``a toxic ideology'' and said of American Muslims ``our nation  has an unprecedented assimilation problem.'' When President Trump first  proposed his ban on Muslim immigrants during the 2016 campaign, Senator  Sessions said, ``I think it's appropriate to begin to discuss this, and  he has forced that discussion.''   I am also concerned about Senator Sessions' support of laws and cases  that permit individuals and companies to discriminate against other  Americans on the basis of religious beliefs. For example, in 2015, the  Supreme Court held that marriage equality is the law of the land in the  landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision. Sessions referred to the  decision as an:       effort to secularize, by force and intimidation, a society       that would not exist but for the faith which inspired people       to sail across unknown waters and trek across unknown       frontiers.    After disparaging the decision, Senator Sessions went on to cosponsor  the First Amendment Defense Act, which would permit widespread  discrimination against LGBTQ individuals on the basis of religious  beliefs.   Senator Sessions also praised the Supreme Court's troubling 5-4  decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, which held that the Religious  Freedom Restoration Act permits closely held, for-profit corporations  to deny contraceptive coverage to employees due to religious  objections.   If confirmed to be the next Attorney General, Senator Sessions will  be responsible for protecting the rights of all Americans, regardless  of their faith or beliefs. That is why I am deeply concerned about  Senator Sessions' record, which suggests that he may prioritize the  freedom of certain faiths over others, and permit religious freedom to  be used as a guise for discrimination.   The Attorney General also has great power to determine how the  Department of Justice's resources will be prioritized. I am alarmed  that Senator Sessions will not commit to support funding for important  programs like COPS and Byrne-JAG. And I am deeply disappointed that he  will not commit to increase Justice Department resources for Chicago to  address the city's surge in gun violence.   I asked Senator Sessions about this when we met in person before his  hearing and again as part of my written hearing questions. It is well  known that there's been an epidemic of gun violence facing the City of  Chicago. There were more than 760 homicides in Chicago last year, a 58  percent increase over the previous year. More than 4,300 people were  shot last year in the city. It is a crisis.   At our meeting, I handed Senator Sessions a copy of Mayor Emanuel's  plan to improve public safety. The plan calls for hiring nearly a  thousand more Chicago police; more training and equipment, like body- worn cameras and gunshot detection technology; more mentoring programs  for youth; and reforms to rebuild trust and cooperation between police  and the community.   All of these are areas where the Justice Department can, and must,  help. The Justice Department's COPS program helps local police  departments put more cops on the beat. The Byrne-JAG program helps them  buy equipment. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention provides mentoring and violence prevention funds. And the  Civil Rights Division was invited in by me, the mayor, and the state  Attorney General to review the Chicago Police Department's practices.  On January 13, they reached an agreement in principle with the City to  pursue much-needed reforms and to seek to enforce the reforms through a  consent decree.   I asked Senator Sessions about his support for these efforts,  especially in light of President Trump's tweets where he has urged  Mayor Emanuel to ask for Federal help--even though the Mayor has  already asked for aid--and threatened to ``send in the Feds'' to  Chicago. But Senator Sessions has steadfastly refused to make any  commitment of Justice Department resources to help reduce Chicago's  violence. He refused to commit to increase Justice Department funding  for Chicago. He wouldn't even commit not to cut funding. He refused to  commit to honor the agreement in Principle that the Justice Department  signed with the city to reform the Chicago Police Department.   And he refused to commit not to request budget cuts to the COPS and  Byrne-JAG programs and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention.   This is unfathomable to me. Now is not the time for the Justice  Department to turn its back on the City of Chicago and its people. It  is hard to understand how the Trump administration could think about  spending $15 billion on an inexpensive and ineffective wall and not  commit to spend another penny to address gun violence in Chicago. If  the administration took just 1 percent of what they want for a border  wall and used it to help Chicago implement the mayor's public safety  plan with more police, training, and youth job programs, we could save  a lot of lives. But instead Senator Sessions and the Trump  administration are threatening to cut Federal funds for Chicago. Their  priorities are profoundly misplaced.   Senator Sessions did say he would increase Federal gun prosecutions.  That may be helpful, but it is not enough to reduce gun violence. The  Chicago Sun-Times looked at Federal gun prosecutions over the past 5  years and found that cities like Detroit and Baltimore had  significantly more than Chicago, but their per-capita homicide rates  are still higher that Chicago's. So that is not enough.   Senator Sessions also seems to think that immigrants are at the root  of most of our Nation's crime problems. That is why he pushes to  withhold critical Federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities. But  many studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit  serious crimes than native-born individuals. And there is no evidence  whatsoever that undocumented immigrants are responsible for any  significant proportion of the murders in Chicago. If sanctuary cities  are the problem, why did a sanctuary city like New York City experience  record low crime in 2016? Senator Sessions' priorities when it comes to  these issues does not give me confidence.   I am also troubled by the casual approach that Senator Sessions has  adopted when it comes to Russian interference in our Presidential  election.   Election Day 2016 is a day that will live in cyber infamy. A foreign  adversary intentionally manipulated America's Presidential election.  Amid warnings of Russian manipulation going back to early October,  President Donald Trump not only resisted these findings, he has praised  Russian President Vladimir Putin and dismissed the true nature of Putin  and his threat. As early as July of last year, then-candidate Trump  urged a foreign adversary of the United States to conduct espionage  against Hillary Clinton. He said, ``I will tell you this, Russia: If  you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are  missing . . . I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our  press.'' And  [[Page S836]]  President Trump, who has impulsively attacked just about anyone who  criticizes him, has not criticized the one person who is guilty of  sponsoring this cyber attack: Vladimir Putin.   This is bigger than one election or one person. This is about our  national security, and we should take it seriously.   For those who have been following Putin's actions over the last  several years, this attack should come as no surprise. Russia has  conducted cyber warfare against Ukraine, the Netherlands, Georgia,  Lithuania, Estonia, and a host of other nations. Russia now appears  focused on disrupting the upcoming German elections over Putin's  dislike of Chancellor Merkel. And it could happen again here.   We need to know that the next U.S. Attorney General will take this  matter seriously as well and will be independent of the White House.  This means allowing career Justice Department prosecutors and the FBI  to follow the facts and the law.   I am concerned about Senator Sessions when it comes to this  assignment. I asked Senator Sessions questions about this. In his  written responses, he admitted that he has not even read the January 6  intelligence community assessment on Russian involvement in the U.S.  election--neither the classified nor the unclassified version. As  recently as last week, Senator Sessions admitted he still has not read  this report.   The unclassified version incidentally is just a few pages if you  don't count the annexes. I read it in less than 15 minutes.   Senator Sessions, seeking to be the top law enforcement official in  the land, should have found time to read this report. His failure to do  so is inexplicable. This does not give me confidence that Senator  Sessions is giving this matter the attention it deserves.   I also asked Senator Sessions if he would commit not to impede or  terminate ongoing Justice Department or FBI investigations into Russian  involvement in the 2016 election. He would not make any commitment  about allowing investigations to continue if confirmed.   And I asked Senator Sessions if he would recuse himself from any FBI  or DOJ investigation into Russian efforts to influence the election. He  said he was not aware of a basis to recuse himself.   Well, Department of Justice regulations call for recusals from  investigations due to personal or political relationships. And it is  clear that Senator Sessions has a close relationship with President  Trump, including on Russia issues. Senator Sessions was a prominent  supporter of the President's campaign.   On March 3, 2016, then-candidate Trump announced that Sessions would  serve as chairman of Mr. Trump's National Security Advisory Committee  and that he would ``provide strategic counsel to Mr. Trump on foreign  policy and homeland security.''   In a July 31, 2016 interview with CNN, Senator Sessions stated the  following:         What I want to tell you is that Hillary Clinton left her       email system totally vulnerable to a Russian penetration.       It's probably clear that they have what was on that system. I       have people come up to me all the time and say, why don't       you--if you want to find out where those 30,000 emails are,       why don't you ask the Russians? They're the ones that have       them . . . The big issue is, can we, should we be able to       create a new and positive relationship with Russia. I think       it's . . . it makes no sense that we're at the hostility       level we are.    On August 15, 2016, USA Today published an article entitled ``Sen.  Jeff Sessions backs Donald Trump on Russia Policy'' detailing how  Sessions changed his hawkish position on Russia to align with then- candidate Trump's statements. It said:         "Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., has long supported increased       military spending and tough talk about the threat Russia       poses to the U.S. and its allies in Europe. Since becoming an       adviser to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump,       however, those principles appear to have undergone some       revisions. Trump has upended traditional conservative caution       toward Russia by exchanging niceties with President Vladimir       Putin and expressing hope for warmer relations. And Sessions,       a frequent surrogate for the Trump campaign in public       appearances, is nodding in agreement.''    On October 7, 2016, Politico published a story entitled ``Lobbyist  advised Trump campaign while promoting Russian pipeline: Richard Burt  helped shape the candidate's first foreign-policy speech while lobbying  on behalf of a Moscow-controlled gas company.'' The Politico story  noted that the lobbyist in question ``attended two dinners this summer  hosted by Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who had been named chairman of  Trump's national security committee'' and that the lobbyist ``was  invited to discuss issues of national security and foreign policy, and  wrote white papers for Sessions on the same subjects . . . `'   In an October 30 interview with DefenseNews, Senator Sessions said,  ``The United States and Russia should be able to be far more harmonious  than we are today.''   Clearly, an investigation into the reported Russia-Trump allegations  has the potential to significantly impact the interests of Senator  Sessions' soon-to-be-boss, if he's confirmed, and his close political  ally.   Again, Senator Sessions' answers to my questions do not give me  confidence. In the end, the American people deserve the truth about  Russian involvement in our election. The stakes too high to ignore.   There are other aspects of Senator Sessions' record that give me  serious concerns about what his priorities would be if confirmed as  Attorney General, including his vote against reauthorizing the Violence  Against Women Act; his votes against the Detainee Treatment Act and the  McCain-Feinstein Army Field Manual Amendment; his past statement that  the use of prison chain gangs was ``perfectly proper''; his opposition  to laws such as the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes  Prevention Act; his questioning of the 14th Amendment's guarantee of  birthright citizenship; and his refusal to commit to recuse himself  from involvement in any case, investigation or Office of Legal Counsel  decision involving the receipt of emoluments by President Trump. All of  these factors have weighed on me as I have considered this nomination   Mr. President, let me conclude.   We need a nonpartisan Attorney General with the independence,  judgment, and backbone to stand up to a President when his actions are  illegal or unjust. Senator Sessions is an able politician. He has been  an able representative of his State of Alabama. But he is not the right  person to serve as Donald Trump's Attorney General.   The Justice Department's motto ``qui pro domina justitia sequitur''  refers to an Attorney General ``who prosecutes on behalf of justice.''  Based on his record and his responses to questions over the past few  weeks, I am not confident Senator Sessions would be such an Attorney  General. I cannot support his nomination, and I will vote against him.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper),  the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons), the Senator from California  (Mrs. Feinstein), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy), the  Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Virginia (Mr.  Warner) are necessarily absent.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper),  the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons), the Senator from California  (Mrs. Feinstein), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the  Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper),  the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons), the Senator from California  (Mrs. Feinstein), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the  Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, I would like to respond to the statement  made by the Republican whip, my friend from Texas, Senator Cornyn. This  is day 20 of the Trump administration. Day 20. Not quite 3 weeks since  President Trump was sworn in as President of the United States. This  evening at about 7 p.m., we will vote on his nominee for Attorney  General. So in the first 20 days of his administration, he will have  his Attorney General.   What the Senator from Texas failed to relate was the experience we  went through not that long ago when President Obama wanted to fill the  vacancy of the Attorney General's office with Loretta Lynch, a woman  who had served as prosecutor, U.S. attorney, lifelong professional in  the Department of Justice, who went through the regular hearing process  in the Judiciary Committee, was reported from the committee, and she  was sent more than 20 additional questions by Senator Jeff Sessions of  Alabama--more questions which of course, she dutifully answered, as she  was required to do. Then she was reported to the calendar, where she  sat for 2 months. A 2-month vacancy in the Attorney General's office.  Why? Was there something substantively wrong or controversial about  Loretta Lynch? If there happened to be, I never heard it.   Where then was that argument about national security and leaving the  Attorney General nomination in limbo when it was President Obama  seeking to fill that spot? Well, we didn't hear it at all. In fact, the  Senator from Texas said: Oh, it was related to another bill and whether  that bill was going to be called; it was actually Senator Reid who was  holding it up.   From where I was sitting--and I came to the floor at one point and  said: What are we waiting for? This lady is eminently qualified. She  has been reported by the committee. She has answered all the questions.  She languishes on the calendar.   She wasn't alone in this experience, incidentally. The Executive  Calendar, as the Obama Presidency ended, was filled with nominees who  were held for  [[Page S924]]  no obvious reason by the Republicans. They had been reported from the  committees. They were ready to fill judicial vacancies across the  United States and other posts. And the official position of the  Republican Senators happened to be: We are not going to ever let people  vote on them because we are hoping and praying we will get a Republican  President who can fill those same vacancies with people of our  political persuasion. That was the reality.   That was the same reality that left Merrick Garland, President  Obama's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, languishing  for almost 1 year. The Republicans and the leaders in the Senate would  not give him a hearing or a vote. And Senator McConnell came to the  floor and said: I won't even meet with him.   So when I hear these protests now from the Republican side of how we  are not moving quickly enough on these nominations, we are. And I think  we are moving in the appropriate way. We are asking hard questions.   And I don't subscribe to the position of the Senator from Texas, who  preceded me here, when it comes to the Voting Rights Act. I listened as  Senator Sessions of Alabama said that he believed the Shelby County v.  Holder decision was a victory for the South when it ended preclearance  of legislation that could have a direct impact on the voting rights of  individuals. And I do recall what happened when the Federal court took  a specific look at North Carolina's legislation statutes as it related  to voting and said the North Carolina legislature had ``with surgical  precision'' found ways to exclude African Americans from voting--not 20  years ago but just a few months ago, before this last election.   This is a critical issue, and it is interesting to me that last night  the dustup on the floor involving the Senator from Massachusetts,  Senator Warren, was about the same issue, the Voting Rights Act.   In a letter sent by Coretta Scott King to Strom Thurmond--then  chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee--when Senator Sessions,  before he was Senator, was being considered for Federal judgeship-- this is what Coretta Scott King said in the letter. I am not going to  read the personal and controversial sections that have been pointed out  before, but it is critical to what her message happened to be. She said  to Strom Thurmond in a letter about Senator Sessions moving to the  Federal bench:         Free exercise of voting rights is so fundamental to       American democracy that we cannot tolerate any form of       infringement of those rights. Of all the groups who have been       disenfranchised in our Nation's history, none has struggled       longer or suffered more in the attempt to win the vote than       black citizens. No group has had access to the ballot box       denied so persistently and intently.    It was a critical issue over 30 years ago when Mr. Sessions was then  being considered for a Federal judgeship. It is a critical issue to  this day because of two things: a decision by the Supreme Court, which  basically took away one of the major powers of the Voting Rights Act,  and, secondly, a coordinated effort by Republicans across the United  States to suppress the vote of minorities and particularly African  Americans.   I point directly to that North Carolina decision for what I just  said. What they have tried to do is to systematically reduce the  likelihood that poor people and minorities will vote. As chairman of  the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil  Rights, and Human Rights, I held public hearings in Ohio and Florida.  Those hearings were held in those States because they had proposed new  restrictions on voters.   So, both in Cleveland and in Florida, I brought the election  officials--Democrats and Republicans--before my subcommittee, put them  under oath and asked: What was the incidence of widespread voter fraud  in the elections in your State which led you to make it more difficult  and challenging for the people of your State to vote?   The answer was: There were none. There were no examples of widespread  fraud. There were only a handful of prosecutions for voter fraud. That  told the story. This didn't have anything to do with voter fraud. This  had to do with discouraging turnout in areas that were more friendly to  Democratic candidates, period. So when we make a big issue of the  position of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions on the Voting Rights Act, it  is with good cause.   It is historically an issue which has haunted the United States since  the Civil War, when excuses after excuses were made for African  Americans seeking the right to vote, and people were denied the right  to vote with poll taxes and literacy tests and ridiculous standards to  this very day, when the Republican Party strategy is to diminish the  African-American vote by voter suppression.   Is it important that we know the position of Senator Jeff Sessions on  the Voting Rights Act? To me, it is one of the most important questions  to be asked. The fact that it evoked controversy on the Senate floor  with Senator Warren last night is an indication of how seriously we  take it. Yes, we have added a few more hours to the debate. I disagree  with the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Texas who say: You know  how it is going to end; why are you wasting our time?   I don't think it is a waste of time to have a fulsome debate in the  Senate on something as fundamental as protecting the right of every  American citizen to vote.   I yield the floor.    I will be happy to yield.    Through the Chair, I will respond to the Senator from  Montana. Here is the difference. Eight years ago, when Barrack Obama  was elected President and was to be sworn in on January 20, he brought  together his team to serve in his Cabinet and said to them: The first  thing you need to do is to follow the law. You need to file all the  papers required of you by the ethics standards of the United States  Government.   So, I am told that on January 8, almost 2 weeks before he was sworn  in, their paperwork was on file. So they had complied with the law and  they were awaiting their opportunity for a hearing. Contrast that with  the current situation. There are still proposed Cabinet members by  President Trump who have not filed their required ethics disclosures.   Why is it important? Because we believe that though we can't reach in  and require the President to file his income tax returns, which he has  steadfastly refused to do, we know what the standards are when it comes  to many of those departments.   The standards are very demanding. There has to be a disclosure and  there has to be a process of divestment. If I am about to become the  head of an agency and my personal wealth includes holdings that have a  direct impact on that agency, I am required by law to divest myself of  those holdings. The more complicated my portfolio and net worth might  be, the more challenging this is.   Penny Pritzker, a very wealthy individual from Chicago, was chosen by  President Obama to be the Secretary of Commerce. It took her 6 months,  I say to the Senator from Montana, to fully comply with the law so she  could go through the hearing--6 months. Now we hear complaints from the  Republicans: Well, why aren't the Trump nominees going through more  quickly? Why aren't our billionaires put on the fast-track?   I am sorry, but Trump billionaires are subject to the same rules as  all billionaires. They have to file the necessary documents. I might  add, you can go back a little further in history and find  disqualifications for Cabinet positions. Oh, you hired someone in your  [[Page S925]]  household to work for you and you did not pay their Social Security,  their FICA? Sorry, you are disqualified from being in a Cabinet.   Now we have Trump nominees where that is happening--not with  frequency, but it is happening--and it doesn't seem to be even close to  a disqualification. So it clearly is a double standard. I would say to  the Senator from Montana, the fact that the Obama nominees moved  through as quickly as they did showed they took the law seriously, they  made the disclosures they were required to make, and in virtually every  case had unique qualifications for the job.   To put Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education next to Arne Duncan, who  headed up the Chicago Public School System as Secretary of Education,  is to show that contrast.
