 Mr. President, we are getting close to making tax relief  for Americans a reality. Last week the House released its tax reform  bill, and this week we expect the Senate Finance Committee to release  our version. In the coming days, the tax committees in both Houses will  review the bills, and then we will debate them on the floor and develop  a final version.   After years of economic stagnation, Americans are ready for relief.  They are ready to keep more of their hard-earned money. They are ready  to finally see a real pay increase, and they are ready for access to  more economic opportunity. That is what our tax reform bill is going to  provide.   To start with, our bill is going to put more money in Americans'  pockets by lowering their tax rates and doubling their standard  deduction. Under our bill, a family making $24,000 a year or less will  not be paying any taxes, and families making more than $24,000 a year  will be paying significantly less than they are paying today. We are  also going to help families by substantially increasing the child tax  credit, and we are going to simplify and streamline the Tax Code so  that it is easier for Americans to figure out what benefits they  qualify for so they don't have to spend a lot of time and money filing  their taxes.   But that is only the beginning. Americans don't just want to keep  more of their hard-earned money. They also want to be making more of  it, but Americans have had a hard time doing that lately. Wages have  been stagnant for years, and new opportunities have been hard to find.   So in addition to reforming the individual side of the Tax Code, we  are going to reform the business side so that we can give Americans  access to the kinds of jobs, wages, and opportunities that will set  them up for a secure future. In order for individual Americans to  thrive economically, we need American businesses to thrive.   Thriving businesses create jobs, they provide opportunities, and they  increase wages and invest in their workers. Right now, though, our Tax  Code is not helping businesses thrive. Instead, it is strangling both  large and small businesses with high tax rates. Small businesses are  incredibly important for new job creation. They play a huge role in the  economy in my home State of South Dakota and other States all across  the country, but the high tax rates that too many small businesses  currently face can make it difficult for them to even survive, much  less thrive and expand their operations.   So we are going to lower taxes for small businesses so that they can  grow and hire new workers. We are also going to allow small businesses  to recover their capital invested in things like inventory and  machinery more quickly, which will free up capital so they can use that  to expand and create jobs. Right now it can take small businesses  years, or in some cases even decades, to recover the cost of their  investments in equipment and facilities. That can leave them extremely  cash poor in the meantime, and, needless to say, cash poor businesses  have a hard time expanding, hiring new workers, or increasing wages.  Allowing small businesses to recover their investments more quickly  will mean more jobs and more opportunities for American workers.   In addition to high tax rates on small and large businesses, another  thing that is decreasing jobs and opportunities for American workers is  our outdated worldwide tax system, which is discouraging American  companies from investing their profits here at home in American jobs  and American workers. Having a worldwide tax system means that American  companies pay U.S. taxes on the profit they make here at home as well  as on part of the profit they make abroad once they bring that money  back to the United States. The problem with this is that American  companies are already paying taxes to foreign governments on the money  they make abroad. Then, when they bring that money home, they too often  end up having to pay taxes again on part of those profits and, I might  add, at the highest tax rate in the industrialized world. It is no  surprise that this discourages businesses from bringing their profits  back to the United States to invest in their domestic operations, in  new jobs, and in increased wages.   Between 1982 and 2003, when the U.S. tax rate was much more  competitive with those other countries, there were 29 corporate  inversions where U.S. companies moved abroad. Between 2003 and 2014,  when other countries were dropping their corporate tax rates and  shifting to territorial tax systems, there were 47 such inversions.   Our tax plan addresses this drag on our economy by moving from our  outdated worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system. What does  that mean? By shifting to a territorial tax system here in the United  States--a move, I might add, that is supported by Members of both  political parties--we will eliminate the double taxation that  encourages companies to send their investments and operations overseas.  Combine that with a reduction in our high corporate tax rate, and we  can provide a strong incentive for U.S. companies to invest their  profits at home in American jobs and American workers instead of  abroad.   Business tax reform is essential to reversing the economic stagnation  that we have seen in recent years. The White House Council of Economic  Advisers estimates that the tax reform framework that Republicans have  presented will boost economic growth by  [[Page S7042]]  between 3 and 5 percent. That is good news for the economy. More  specifically, however, it is good news for American workers, who can  expect to see their incomes rise as a result. A study from the White  House Council of Economic Advisers estimates that reducing the  corporate tax rate from 35 percent, where it is today--the highest, as  I said, in the industrialized world--down to 20 percent, which is more  competitive with our competitors around the world, would increase  average household income by $4,000 annually. Think about that. Reducing  the tax on businesses in this country would increase average household  income for families in America by $4,000.   A Boston University professor and public finance expert, Larry  Kotlikoff, found that lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent  would increase household income by $3,500 per year on average. This was  most recently confirmed by Martin Feldstein, a Harvard professor and  former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, who noted in the Wall  Street Journal this week that corporate tax reform is likely to boost  household income by $3,500 per year.   There are lots of analysts, lots of experts who are looking at these  proposed changes to the Tax Code and the tax reform that we are  attempting to get through the Congress this year and onto the  President's desk, and they have concluded that not only will it reduce  taxes--the tax burden, the amount of tax that is paid by middle-income  families in this country--but the reduction in the rates on businesses  will also increase the number of opportunities for better paying jobs  and higher wages and it will raise that annual income--that average  household income--that is so desperately in need of a boost.   It has been a rough few years for the American economy and for  American workers. I think all you have to do is to look at the numbers  and you know that most Americans haven't seen a pay raise in almost the  last decade. But with comprehensive tax reform, the next few years--and  the next few decades, for that matter--can look very, very different.   Republicans' tax reform legislation is going to provide direct relief  to hard-working Americans, and it is going to create the kind of  economy that will give workers access to more jobs, to better  opportunities, and to higher wages, not just for the near term but for  the long term.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Finance  Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Hatch, to put the final  touches on our bill and to take it up in the committee next week. Then,  I hope we can bring that bill to the floor of the Senate and have an  open debate, process amendments, and pass something through the Senate  that we can conference with the House of Representatives, put it on the  President's desk, and move our economy in a direction that will provide  a brighter and more prosperous future for American workers and American  families.   It is time to give the American people some relief.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Thank you, Mr. President.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly oppose the  legislation that has emerged from the House of Representatives that  pretends to provide tax relief to middle-class Americans, but if you  take a look at it and you look at the analyses that have already come  out, what it really is, is another big tax giveaway to millionaires,  billionaires, and big, multinational corporations.   I believe we should do tax reform. We should take our Tax Code and  clean up a lot of the junk that has gotten into our Tax Code that is  not there for good public policy reasons and is there because someone  had a high-powered lobbyist. We need to clean up our Tax Code, we need  to reform our Tax Code, and we need to do it in a way that helps the  middle class and doesn't add more big breaks for big corporations.   Unfortunately, this Republican plan does the opposite of tax reform.  What it does is doubles down on big tax breaks for big corporations and  the superwealthy.   There is a headline today based on the analysis. The New York Times  looked at it. ``Republican Plan Would Raise Taxes on Millions'' of  middle-class families. I can tell you that is very true in my State of  Maryland. In fact, it is going to be true in States throughout the  United States of America. We are going to see millions of middle-class  families paying more under this plan. In fact, this analysis that is  discussed in the Times found that 45 percent of middle-class families  will see a tax increase under this plan once it is fully implemented.  That means that families making between roughly $50,000 a year and  $160,000 a year--about half of them are going to end up paying higher  taxes under the Republican plan.   Here is one of the double standards that you see continuing  throughout the Republican tax plan: Big corporations not only get big  tax cuts--$1.5 trillion--but they are going to go on forever. In  middle-class families, many people will see an immediate tax increase.  Others will initially see a little tax cut. But for individuals and  families, it is the great disappearing tax cut--a little sweetener to  make the bill look good in the early years, but the bill takes away all  those tax cuts for middle-class families, on average, and then actually  increases the burden on a family of four making $59,000 under the plan.   For corporations, a $1.5 trillion tax cut over 10 years--permanent.  For folks in the middle, many will see an immediate tax increase, and  the tax increase will stay in place. Others will see a little tax  decrease, but as the years go by, many of those are going to see their  taxes go up. It is a major corporate tax cut financed in large part by  millions of middle-class families paying higher taxes.   Just to give a sense of how well the folks at the very top will do,  there is a headline from the Wall Street Journal--this is not a  Democratic-leaning newspaper--``Banks Sidestep a Big Tax-Plan  Pitfall.'' Right here in the second paragraph of the Wall Street  Journal article, it says this: At a 20-percent corporate tax rate,  banks stand to be among the biggest winners from tax reform. That is  according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The five biggest  diversified banks alone might have had tax savings of $11.5 billion in  2016 at that rate--the biggest sum for any subindustry group tracked by  S&P. The biggest banks do just great under this Republican plan.  Middle-class families are left paying the bill.   If you look at this on the individual side, the top 1 percent  wealthiest Americans in this country are going to get an average tax  cut of $65,000--that is per person, on average. If you are in that top  1 percent, an average family will get a $65,000 tax cut. That means  that 48 percent of the benefit of all the tax cuts in this Republican  plan goes to the top 1 percent. Let me say that again and just flip it  around. The top 1 percent wealthiest households are going to get 48  percent of the dollar benefit of this tax cut. That doesn't sound like  a plan focused on improving the situation of middle-class taxpayers.  They are the ones who are going to have to finance many of those tax  cuts for the very wealthy and big corporations.    I know our Republican colleagues recognize what a vulnerability this  is because our colleague, Senate majority leader Mr. McConnell, said  about the tax bill in an interview last Saturday: ``At the end of the  day, nobody in the middle class is going to get a tax increase.'' To  understand what that means, he is saying that not a single middle-class  household out there in the country is going to see their taxes go up.  Well, I don't know what tax plan he is talking about, but it is  certainly one that hasn't seen the light of day yet because the bill  that has come out of the House will raise taxes on millions of middle- class families, and that is a fact.   Just the other day, in an interview on FOX News, Speaker Ryan said:  ``We are making sure every middle income taxpayer is a winner here.''  Every middle-class taxpayer is a winner here. Well, that is certainly  not true of the plan that was just marked up in the Ways and Means  Committee of the House because there are a whole lot of families in the  middle class who are big losers under the Republican plan--in fact,  millions of them around the country.  [[Page S7043]]    I don't know what plan they are talking about. I am looking forward  to seeing the Republican plan that doesn't raise taxes on any middle- class family in the United States. That should be our policy. We should  not be increasing the burden on middle-class families in order to  finance a $1.5 trillion tax cut for big, multinational corporations,  but that is the way it is right now.   Homeowners are going to be especially hard hit under this Republican  plan because a lot fewer homeowners will utilize the mortgage interest  deduction, and the Republican plan also slashes the deduction for State  and local taxes. In fact, they eliminate your option to deduct State  and local income taxes. The result is going to be that a lot of middle- class homeowners are going to pay a lot more. That is why the Realtors  oppose this bill. These are the folks in our neighborhoods who are  buying and selling homes. They are folks who have their ears to the  ground in our communities.   Here is what the president of the National Association of Realtors  said about this bill: It ``threatens home values and takes money  straight from the pockets of homeowners.''   In fact, they had a study done by PricewaterhouseCoopers that said  that if you are a homeowner and your income is between $50,000 and  $200,000, adjusted gross income, you will see an average tax increase.  They also predicted that home values across the board could drop by 10  percent, and it is not clear when they would recover their value.   The National Association of Home Builders is also opposed to this  legislation because of the impact it will have on home ownership and  the prices and value of people's homes around the country. They said:         The House Republican tax reform plan abandons middle-class       taxpayers in favor of high-income Americans and wealthy       corporations. The bill eviscerates existing housing tax       benefits by drastically reducing the number of homeowners who       can take advantage of mortgage interest and property tax       incentives.    I think all of us know that this is not some left-leaning group. We  are talking about the National Association of Home Builders finding  that the Republican plan abandons middle-class taxpayers in favor of  high-income Americans and wealthy corporations. That is their finding  based on their analysis of the bill.   Here is the catch. It is that double standard again. Just as I said  earlier, you have the tax cuts for big corporations going on forever,  but there is much less tax relief for some middle-income taxpayers, and  it takes effect early but then phases out. You also have a situation  where, if you are a big corporation, you get to deduct all of your  State and local taxes. In fact, if you are a multinational corporation  and you are in China, you get to deduct taxes you pay to the Government  of China. But if you are a household in Maryland or any of our States,  you don't get to deduct the taxes you pay to your State and local  governments. So you are paying taxes twice on that dollar--once to the  State government and again to Uncle Sam out of the same dollar.   Fitch Ratings looked at this and concluded that it will put dramatic  strains on State and local budgets since people in those States are not  going to be able to take those tax deductions. Either you are going to  see dramatic cuts to school funding or healthcare, or you are going to  see State and local governments raise the property taxes in those  States. So you get hit coming and going if you are a middle-class  homeowner.   This also damages our economic development efforts in many parts of  our country. It repeals the new markets tax credit. While it doesn't  get rid of what President Trump said was a huge giveaway, the hedge  fund loopholes--I can't remember how many times during the Presidential  campaign Candidate Trump talked about how the hedge fund tax break was  a total giveaway. That is not eliminated in this Republican bill. They  keep the big hedge fund loopholes, but here is what they get rid of.  They get rid of the ability of people with high medical expenses to  deduct those expenses from their taxes.   They even take away the additional standard deduction that currently  applies to taxpayers who are at least 65 years of age or who are blind.  There are many folks who are in that category who are also going to see  their taxes go up. Seniors are going to see their taxes go up, which is  why the AARP has raised the alarm about that provision and others.   While they keep the big hedge fund loopholes, they get rid of the  ability of families who adopt children to take a tax credit to help  cover the costs of adoption.   They get rid of provisions of the Tax Code that help students and  teachers and schools. If you are a teacher who has been spending money  to buy textbooks and other materials for your class, you used to be  able to deduct the costs of what you are buying to help your kids. They  take that away in the same bill that they give big corporations a big  $1.5 trillion tax break. If you are a student who has been struggling  to afford college bills, you no longer get to deduct the interest on  your student loans.    If you are an employer who is currently receiving an incentive to  employ veterans who have served our country, sorry, that is gone too.   So I want to get this straight. You are going to take away the  ability of people with high medical expenses to take a deduction. You  are going to take away the ability of college graduates to take a  deduction so that their expenses are more affordable. You are going to  take away the ability of people to get the adoption tax credit. And you  are going to take away incentives for people to hire our veterans. But  you are going to keep the hedge fund loophole and you are going to give  a $1.5 trillion tax cut to big corporations. That is what this bill is  all about.   Finally--and I am going to talk about this at greater length some  other time--look at the international tax provisions in this Republican  bill and how they are structured. I really urge my colleagues to take a  look at this. They actually increase the incentives for U.S.-based  businesses and companies to move their operations overseas. That is for  two reasons. No. 1 is that when you reduce the international tax  rates--when you say, essentially, that a U.S. corporation that moves  its jobs overseas now just pays the tax in that country and has no U.S.  tax obligation; we, under this bill, are at 20 percent--you still have  an incentive, obviously, to move your operations to a very low tax  place like the Cayman Islands.   But, then, there is an effort to address that issue in this bill. The  problem is the effort to address that provision doesn't work at all.  Here is the current situation: A lot of corporations try to park what  are known as their intangible assets in the Cayman Islands or other tax  havens. These are things like the value of patents. You make a great  discovery, and you get a patent from the U.S. Patent Office, and you  make royalties off of that patent. Then, you have a lot of good  lawyers, and essentially you park that patent in the Cayman Islands.  That really has no tax obligations, so all the profits that derive from  that patent are not subject to any tax--or maybe 1 or 2 percent tax.   So in this Republican bill, there is an effort to try to address that  issue--at least it pretends to address the issue--but the problem is  that it doesn't.   Here is what they say. They say: Well, we are going to catch you if  you park your money in a place like the Cayman Islands because we are  going to have a tax of 10 percent--a foreign high-return tax is what  they call it. The way they determine whether you are making an excess  profit is you look at your tangible assets in that country and you  determine whether the profit you have made is over 8 percent. That is  the way it approximately adds up under this bill. But here is the  problem: It is an average international minimum tax, not a per-country  minimum tax.   So let me tell my colleagues what a company that wants to reduce its  tax obligation does. They move their company offshore. They take a  company, say in Baltimore, MD, that is worth $100 million, and they are  making a $5 million profit today here in the United States and they  will be taxed at 20 percent, and then they have this profit from the  Cayman Islands at $2 million. Under that previous provision I talked  about--this effort in the Republican bill to protect against what they  call  [[Page S7044]]  high-return tax areas--they would normally have captured some of the  income generated from profits in the Cayman Islands. But when I move my  company from Baltimore to, say, the United Kingdom, I actually then  escape having to pay that tax on my monies in the tax haven.   So the bottom line is that this Republican bill, because it has this  average 10 percent minimum tax provision, is going to encourage  American businesses and companies to move overseas. If that is not what  the intention is, I urge my Republican colleagues to fix this right  away. It hasn't been talked about much.   There have been a couple articles recently about it. Gene Sperling,  Kim Clausing, and others have gone through the economics of this, and  it would make the situation a lot worse compared even to today in terms  of these incentives.   The bottom line is, in addition to this being a $1.5 trillion tax  break for big, multinational corporations, paid for and financed by  folks in the middle--which, even after you see the middle-class  families pay more, results in a $1.5 trillion addition to the debt, but  even after all of that--after the big tax giveaway to big corporations,  it has an incentive to add insult to injury for them to move their  businesses and factories offshore.   I hope we will take a big step back and stop rushing a bill through  as a matter of political imperative. We need to get this right. We  should have hearings. We should have folks from all different walks of  life and folks who will be impacted by this bill in many different ways  come and testify to Congress about this bill. Then, let's get together  on a bipartisan basis and actually do something that works for the  American people, not something that is going to clobber the middle  class and provide this huge windfall tax break to big multinational  corporations, while encouraging them to suck jobs and factories from  the United States overseas.   We need to start again on this. I urge my colleagues to do that.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The Senator from Ohio.
