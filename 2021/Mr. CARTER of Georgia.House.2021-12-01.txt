 Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I  rise today to honor a man who has dedicated his life to a better  Georgia and a better United States: Robert Hamilton Hurt.   Bob Hurt is retiring this year, but his legacy will last generations.  You would be hard-pressed to find a better adviser, more loyal friend,  or hardworking foot soldier for every cause to which he has dedicated  himself than Bob Hurt. This includes his commitment to his lovely wife,  Virginia, and daughters Emma and Louisa, who are daily witnesses to  Bob's unwavering support.   Bob is a proud graduate of Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, where  he studied history. During this time reporting for and serving as  editor for the campus newspaper, The Cluster, Bob both covered and  advocated for the school's desegregation.   After graduating, Bob cashed in on a couple of summers interning for  the Atlanta Constitution to score a full-time job reporting for the  paper.   That career was put on hold as Bob was commissioned as an officer for  the United States Army through Mercer's ROTC program and was then  called to defend our Nation in Vietnam.    While in Vietnam, he served as an Army infantryman and military  intelligence officer with the 173rd Airborne Brigade and with the 5th  Special Forces, more commonly called the Green Berets.   Bob returned to Atlanta following the war, where he continued his  career as a journalist covering many beats before moving to Washington,  D.C., to report on the happenings inside this building for the people  of Atlanta.   While in Washington, Bob continued to pursue his goals while studying  legislative affairs at George Washington University, where he went on  to receive a master's degree.   Bob left the Atlanta Constitution and began an illustrious career in  the United States Congress working for both the House of  Representatives and the United States Senate.   Accumulating an incredible 24 years of combined experience, Bob has  truly seen it all, but he never lost his commitment to the people of  his beloved Peach State. He served as chief of staff to two of my  predecessors, Representative Bo Ginn and Lindsay Thomas, as well as  staff director for Senator Sam Nunn.   Though his dear friend Frank Norton may have convinced Bob to leave  the government service, Bob never stopped working for our State. He has  been a trusted adviser to Members on both sides of the aisle to further  the interests of Georgians at the Federal level.   For more than 40 years, Bob Hurt has had a hand in nearly every  project to create jobs and improve lives in the First District of  Georgia. He has also been a fierce advocate for our military  installations and for ensuring America's troops are the best equipped,  highest trained, and most well cared for in the world.   While he is the first to roll up his sleeves and commit to doing the  hard things, Bob is the last person who will ever take credit for  getting the job done.   Mr. Speaker, I am here today to shine a light on this faithful public  servant who I am honored to call my friend.   Joining me in honoring Bob today are former Senator Sam Nunn and my  predecessors Lindsay Thomas and Jack Kingston.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record their remarks.                                                  November 29, 2021.        Dear Bob: It is a pleasure to join with your family and       many friends to congratulate you on your well-deserved       retirement. (I don't really believe it.)        From your work at The Atlanta Constitution and your service       in the U.S. Army--to your time as my Administrative Assistant       in the Senate and your hard work at Hurt & Norton, you have       had an outstanding, impactful, and I am sure, very fulfilling       career. In every role, you have served with distinction,       integrity, and a great sense of humor, and you have been a       force for good for Georgia and our nation. You've given all       of us who have been blessed by your company a joyful example       of how to live a wonderful life.        Considering your news media background, I am reluctant to       admit that you are a superb writer, so let's put it this way:       I am looking for a speechwriter for my own retirement years.       Are you available? I am honored that we've had the       opportunity to work closely together over these many years,       and I treasure our relationship.        Thank you for your friendship, your leadership, your wise       counsel and your good jokes, which you have occasionally       shared. Colleen and I send our best wishes to you and       Virginia for a relaxing and enjoyable retirement. She is the       one who really deserves it, and we hope to see more of both       of you on the Georgia coast!            Sincerely,      Sam Nunn.                                   ____         Though a newcomer to the political arena, I was well aware       of the reputation and capabilities of Bob Hurt long before he       agreed to serve as my Chief of Staff.        I cannot recall a serious disagreement that came between us       throughout those ten years. There were surely times when my       naivete and lack of experience frustrated him greatly but       never did it shake his steady, even-handed manner of       directing the affairs of our office.        Bob selected our staff, directed the budget, and inter-      office proceedings and, with his established knowledge of the       First District, precluded any serious opposition during my       ten years in office. His careful stewardship of the complex       management challenges that face any congressional office       enabled me to concentrate on focusing on the district and its       people. In doing so, he afforded me the ability to spend the       kind of time I found necessary to keep our pulse on the       sentiments of the people we represented and the agenda of the       First District.        I came to recognize how much respect Bob had on Capitol       Hill. Other chiefs of staff and even other Members were aware       of his knowledge, experience, and wisdom, seeking his counsel       often. On many occasions I was perfectly aware of how Bob       felt about various issues before us based on their questions       of me.        In serving former Congressman Bo Ginn before me and then       Senator Sam Nunn after, I have often thought of what a       contrast it must have been to take on the responsibility of       such a novice as myself. He did so in a manner that helped me       come to a resolution on controversial matters, on the gamut       of ordinary issues that affected the nation and the First       District, and on the mundane responsibility of assuring the       people who elected me that our office was there to serve them       in every way possible.        Bob Hurt is a person of sterling character, very deep       intellect, and passion for our nation. He has exemplified       that passion not only through his years as Chief of Staff for       three Members of the United States Congress, a Vietnam       veteran, a father and family man, and a consultant to some of       the most important enterprises in the country, but also as a       friend and trusted counsel to people who shape the nation's       agenda.        He is a perfect example of a life well lived, and a person       whose service has made our country a better place.        I am truly honored to be his friend and I can say without       reservation our longtime friendship and association has made       me a better man.                                                 Lindsay Thomas,                                     Member of Congress (1983-1993),      First District of Georgia.                                   ____         Most of us don't know if Bob Hurt ever officially moved his       residency to the state of  [[Page H6722]]       Virginia but either way we in Georgia claim him as one of our       most outstanding citizens.        As a young man Bob played an integral volunteer role in the       election of the late Congressman Bo Ginn. After Ginn was       elected Bob stayed on as a staff member. Knowing the hours he       worked and the reality of congressional salaries, I'm sure       the compensation was only slightly better than what he made       as a volunteer!        He worked grueling hours traveling the state of Georgia,       meeting its people and dealing with the issues that most       affected them. Along with Congressman Ginn, his successor       Lindsay Thomas, and Sen. Sam Nunn, Bob was on the forefront       of nearly every major public project for the last five       decades. He helped push for the development and expansion of       our ports, universities, military installations, countless       roads, bridges, airports, and industries. As Georgia grew and       prospered Bob never forgot the quality of life in which we       all believe. He balanced environmental, rural, and urban       dynamics so that generations to come will still be able to       know and love the same Georgia in which Bob was reared.        In all of these achievements Bob never cut the ribbon or       took the applause. He worked quietly behind the scenes and in       most cases crafted the message and wrote the very speeches       the elected officials gave as they accepted the accolades.        After his retirement from Congressional life Bob continued       his public service as a lobbyist. I always describe Bob is a       guy who charged you a dollar when he should've charged you       two dollars and always gave you three dollars worth of work.       He has been an example for many other public advocates. To       Bob the mission is always primary, not the dollars or the       political impact.        Bob's wife Virginia and daughters Emma and Louisa have been       part of Bob's contribution to a better Georgia. Bob puts his       family first yet there been many sacrifices that all of them       have made to make Bob a success. I hope Bob stays in the game       but whatever the future holds he will be known as the premier       and most successful public servant and lobbyist on Capitol       Hill.                                                  Jack Kingston,                                     Member of Congress (1993-2015),                                         First District of Georgia.                                time  1100     Mr. Speaker, Bob Hurt is a great Georgian. He  is a great American. Most importantly for me, he is a great friend who  has helped me tremendously, as he has helped so many people.   I wish him well in his retirement. I know that he will be living in  my district. I look forward to representing him. We need more people in  this world like Bob Hurt. We need more people in the United States and  in Congress like Bob Hurt.   I thank Bob for his tutelage and for all he has done for our great  State and for our great Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today with gratitude to  honor the service and ministry of Pastor Kenny Grant at Calvary Baptist  Temple in Savannah, Georgia.   It is not often in life that you meet someone with as complete an  understanding and unwavering trust in God's plan as Kenny Grant.   Kenny has served as senior pastor at Calvary Baptist Church for 10  years, and this past Sunday, he delivered his final sermon.   Kenny dedicated his life to serving others at 17 when he joined the  U.S. Marine Corps. It was during this time in the Marine Corps that he  came to Christ and discovered his calling to preach and minister to  others.   After 9 years in the Marines, Kenny went straight into the ministry  by founding his own church. Kenny took his experience from his time in  the Marines and used it in his ministry, growing his church and  nourishing the hearts of his brothers and sisters in Christ.   Kenny has served the members of Calvary Baptist Temple selflessly,  and we are excited to see where God takes him next.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding, and I appreciate her hosting this today.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in defense of the lives of our unborn  children. I am proud to stand with my colleagues without apology on the  side of life.   Roe v. Wade was one of the Supreme Court's biggest failures. Today  our Justices have an opportunity to right that wrong.   At 5 weeks a baby's heart begins beating. At 10 weeks the child has  arms, legs, fingers, and toes. That baby can kick and jump if startled  while in the womb. They can taste and make facial expressions, yawn,  hiccup, and suck their thumbs. Those are the actions of a child, not a  clump of cells.   More importantly, that child starts to feel pain only 3 weeks into  development. Inflicting unnecessary pain on an innocent child in the  womb is not healthcare. Abortion is not healthcare. This is not  healthcare. This is a child, a life.   Madam Speaker, abortion is an evil that has plagued this country for  50 long years. I call for the Supreme Court to act and to defend the  lives and rights of our unborn. We must put an end to this torturous  practice that has denied almost 20 percent of young children their  constitutional right to life.
