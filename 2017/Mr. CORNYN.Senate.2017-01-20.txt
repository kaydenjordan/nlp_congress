I am glad to yield for a question.    I ask the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services  Committee whether a period of transition from one administration to  another is a time of particular vulnerability to the United States, at  a time when we are transitioning not only to a new administration but  also to a new national security Cabinet.   Isn't this a time of particular vulnerability for the United States?   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded  an additional 2 minutes.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would just like to say to my friend from  Texas, our leader, that there is enormous controversy about our  intelligence community overall. Questions have been raised going all  the way back to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, questions about  what we know or don't know about Russian involvement in the last  election.   It seems to me that all of the things that the Senator from Texas  just said argue for a rapid transition to a person we all trust.   I would ask the Senator from Texas very quickly: Has he heard someone  who objects to Congressman Pompeo assuming the role of Director of the  CIA?    Mr. President, I am responding to the Senator from  Arizona.   I am not confident that he will get a unanimous vote here, but he  will certainly be confirmed resoundingly under the rules established by  the Democratic majority in the last Congress, which allow 51 votes for  confirmation.   Mr. McCAIN. Respectfully and with high regard, I would just ask my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle--let's get this intelligence  team to work. Let's put them together. We will have outstanding  individuals in a time when, in the view of most observers, this Nation  is in greater peril than it has been in 70 years.   This is a very, very serious situation we find ourselves in. The  people have spoken. Let's confirm them today.   I yield the floor.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I think under the circumstances the  Democratic leader and I have come up with a solution that I think at  least moves the ball in the right direction. First, I want to implore  our colleagues on the other side to give us a vote on Pompeo today.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Alabama (Mr. Sessions).
