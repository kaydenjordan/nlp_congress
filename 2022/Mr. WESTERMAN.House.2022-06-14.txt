 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in reluctant opposition to H.R. 2773, as  drafted. The goal of this bill is commendable. Republicans and  Democrats alike want to see America's wildlife thrive. Unfortunately,  the legislation as written contains partisan provisions that I simply  cannot support.   State and Tribal fish and wildlife agencies have long been recognized  as the primary and most well-equipped managers of local species and  habitat in the United States. After all, those on the ground are more  attuned to what is happening in their backyards than the Federal  Government. That is why State and Tribal wildlife agencies, as well as  prominent sportsmen's groups support this bill.   While the bill would provide financial resources to States and Tribes  to help meet wildlife recovery goals, the spending is mandatory and  lacks any offset. This spending is not pocket change. The Congressional  Budget Office estimated the Rules Committee Print would lead to more  than $12 billion--that is $12 billion--in direct spending in the first  decade of the program alone. And I say the first decade, because that  is only what is in the so-called scoring window. In reality, this  program and its mandatory spending would last forever since there is no  sunset in titles I and II of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, this is not the modern-day funding models suggested by  the blue ribbon commission. This is an important issue, and we should  make the responsible, tough decisions on how to fund it.   This funding model has no offset ever, and it has an average  expenditure of $1.4 billion per year. It is the most irresponsible,  lazy way to fund the program, especially with the record government  spending that is contributing to record inflation. At a time of rampant  inflation, it would be wildly irresponsible to drive inflation even  higher and saddle future generations with the consequences. The debt  created by this bill will only add to our Nation's current $30 trillion  debt.   This bill also lacks a sunset provision. Without a sunset, there is  no mechanism to ensure oversight or proper review of the program to fix  flaws that may arise. Mandating a permanent new program is poor  governance, and it ignores precedent. Congress routinely passes  legislation like the Farm Bill or the Water Resources Development Act  which have proper sunsets. Those sunsets require us to come back and do  our jobs by assessing what is working, what is not working, and making  tweaks and changes to the law.   The bill does not allow Congress the opportunity to perform the  needed oversight. Instead, it requires spending $1.4 billion per year  in perpetuity. I, and my fellow Republican committee members, tried to  resolve these fiscal issues with amendments at the committee markup. We  were told by the Democrat majority that, although they opposed these  amendments at the time, they would work with us on finding a funding  offset before this bill would be considered on the floor.   We stayed at the negotiating table, as did the bill's sponsor, Mrs.  Dingell, whom I have a lot of respect for and commend her for her  efforts on this bill. But larger forces decided to ram this bill  forward without fixing anything. In fact, the majority made the bill  worse than it was when it left our committee.   They decided to airdrop provisions into a new title III that would  siphon money away from States and Tribes and give it to the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service. That is in direct contrast to the spirit of this  bill to give money to the State and Tribal agencies so that they could  do the management.    We never even had the chance to debate this terrible title in the  committee. The whole point of this bill was to empower States and  Tribes who are the ones, again, who are closest to our lands and  waters, not to increase the Washington, D.C., Federal bureaucracy,  which is now what this bill will do.   A number of Republican amendments proposed to the Rules Committee  tried to fix these problems and several other issues but they were  similarly ignored, depriving us of ways to improve the bill and debate  these issues today. As a result of all of this, we have a regrettably  flawed bill. The situation we are now in was avoidable. The bill before  us represents a lost opportunity to forge significant bipartisan  compromise. It didn't have to be this way, and I hope that this is not  a partisan sign of the future of conservation.   I will remain at the table and hope that my Democratic colleagues  come back and work together with us on a lasting solution. Until then,  I am opposed to H.R. 2773, and I reluctantly encourage my colleagues to  vote ``no'' on the resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will point out that even though there  is a reporting requirement in the legislation, once you approve  mandatory, permanent spending, then Congress loses our leverage.  Creating a permanent program doesn't bode well for oversight from  Congress. Programs that were mentioned like Pittman-Robinson, think  about the land and water conservation fund, all of those had dedicated  funding streams. This funding is coming straight out of the Treasury.  It is coming out of our kids' and our grandkids' piggy banks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Bentz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I know that we all like the idea of dynamic scoring, and I spend a  lot of money on hunting and fishing myself, as do a lot of other  Members of Congress. But CBO, unfortunately, does not take that into  account.   I know we all think that this bill could help not have listings of  endangered species. But case studies clearly show that Federal money  alone will not keep species off the endangered species list.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the record the CBO score from the Senate  version of the language that is in this bill.                                                     U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                       Washington, DC, May 26, 2022.      Hon. Thomas Carper,      Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S.           Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 2372, the       Recovering America's Wildlife Act of 2022.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Madeleine       Fox.            Sincerely,                                                 Phillip L. Swagel,                                                          Director.        Enclosure.    S. 2372, RECOVERING AMERICA'S WILDLIFE ACT OF 2022--AS REPORTED BY THE    SENATE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS ON APRIL 27, 2022 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                           By fiscal year, millions of                                                    dollars--                                      -----------------------------------                                          2022      2022-2027   2022-2032 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Direct Spending (Outlays)...........          0       7,049      14,082 Revenues............................          0           0           0 Increase or Decrease (-) in the               0       7,049      14,082  Deficit............................ Spending Subject to Appropriation             0           1         not  (Outlays)..........................                          estimated ------------------------------------------------------------------------         Statutory pay-as-you-go procedures apply? Yes.        Increases on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive       10-year periods beginning in 2033? $5 billion.        Mandate Effects:        Contains intergovernmental mandate? No.        Contains private-sector mandate? No.        The bill would:        Make funds available to the Department of the Interior for       grants and other support for wildlife conservation by states,       territories, and Indian tribes.        Allow the department to spend interest accrued on certain       unspent balances for wildlife conservation.        Estimated budgetary effects would mainly stem from:        Spending without further appropriation on authorized       activities.        Spending of interest credited from amounts invested in       Treasury securities.        Bill summary: S. 2372 would amend the Pittman-Robertson       Wildlife Restoration Act and appropriate funds for the       Department of the Interior to support efforts by state,       local, and tribal governments to conserve endangered and       threatened species. The bill also would allow interest       accrued on unspent balances in one account to be available       without further appropriation for those activities.        The bill would require the President to provide the       Congress each year with a list of threatened or endangered       species and to estimate the amount of funding allocated for       their conservation. S. 2372 also would direct the Government       Accountability Office to study the progress of states,       territories, the District of Columbia, and Indian tribes in       protecting endangered and threatened species and to report       its findings seven years after enactment.        Estimated Federal cost: The estimated budgetary effect of       S. 2372 is shown in Table 1. The costs of the legislation       fall within budget function 300 (natural resources and       environment).        Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that S.       2372 will be enacted near the end of fiscal year 2022. On       that basis, CBO expects that outlays from funds provided in       2022 would occur in 2023. Using information from the affected       agencies and historical spending patterns for similar       activities, CBO estimates that enacting S. 2372 would       increase direct spending by $14.1 billion over the 2022-2032       period.

S. 2372 would require annual reports whose cost would total $1 million over the 2022-2027 period, subject to the availability of appropriated funds.         Direct spending: S. 2372 would establish new accounts in       the Treasury, specify the amounts to be deposited into those       accounts each year, and make the funds in those accounts       available to the Secretary of the Interior to spend without       further appropriation. In 2021, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife       Service (USFWS) spent $713 million for similar activities.        Title I would make $850 million available in 2022 for USFWS       to make grants to state, local, and tribal governments for       wildlife conservation. The amounts made available would       increase in 2023 and 2024. In 2025 and every year thereafter,       title I would make $1.3 billion available for those purposes.       CBO estimates that enacting this title would increase direct       spending by $12.4 billion over the 2022-2032 period.        Title II would make $97.5 million available in 2022 and       every year thereafter for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to       help Indian tribes conserve species on tribal land that       have the greatest need for conservation. CBO estimates       that enacting this title would increase direct spending by       $963 million over the 2022-2032 period.        Title III would make $187.5 million available each year       from 2022 through 2025 for USFWS to make grants to states and       Indian tribes for the conservation of endangered and       threatened species and to carry out other authorities under       the Endangered Species Act. A portion of those amounts--$75       million each year--would be made available to the National       Fish and Wildlife Foundation to recover threatened or       endangered species. CBO estimates that enacting this       provision in title III would increase direct spending by $750       million over the 2022-2032 period.        In addition, title III would direct the Department of the       Treasury to credit interest on unspent balances made       available under that title to USFWS. That interest would be       available to spend without further appropriation for recovery       efforts under the Endangered Species Act. (Crediting interest       to an account in the Treasury is an intragovemmental transfer       and thus would have no budgetary effect but allowing the       agency to spend the accrued amounts would increase direct       spending.) Using the interest rates underlying the May 2022       baseline projections, CBO estimates that under this       provision, $18 million would be accrued and spent over the       2022-2032 period.  [[Page H5516]]         The bill would permit USFWS to accept and spend donations.       CBO estimates that the effect on net direct spending from       donations would be negligible over the 2022-2032 period.        The bill would authorize the transfer of some penalties       collected under current law to the accounts established under       title I and title II, but S. 2372 would not authorize any new       penalty collections.        Spending subject to appropriation: S. 2372 would require       the President to submit to the Congress lists of threatened       or endangered species for which recovery efforts would be       funded under the bill and to report annually on the amounts       allocated for endangered species recovery, interagency       consultation, and conservation activities. Using information       about similar activities, CBO estimates that producing the       annual reports would cost $1 million over the 2022-2027       period; any spending would be subject to the availability of       appropriated funds.        Under the bill, the Government Accountability Office would       report in 2029 or 2030 on conservation efforts authorized in       the bill. Based on the cost of similar reports, CBO estimates       that the cost of that report would be insignificant.        Pay-As-You-Go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go       Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement       procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or       revenues. The net changes in outlays that are subject to       those pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in Table 2.

Mandates: None.        Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Madeleine Fox,       Mandates: Lilia Ledezma.        Estimate reviewed by: Susan Willie, Chief, Natural and       Physical Resources Cost Estimates Unit; H. Samuel Papenfuss,       Deputy Director of Budget Analysis; Theresa Gullo, Director       of Budget Analysis.     Mr. Speaker, this report does show that it will cost  over $12 billion in the first 10 years and $1.4 billion thereafter.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage the majority to put their  estimates to the test. Let's make this a bill with a 7-year sunset like  the amendment that I proposed. Let's come back, look at it, and see if  it really did save money. If it really did save species, maybe we  should fund it at more than $1.4 billion a year. Maybe we can find that  funding with an offset.   But the simple truth is it is all speculation right now, and we are  getting ready to put a permanent mandatory spending program in place  with no way to come back and have checks and balances on it without  repealing the law. And how many times does that happen when Congress  passes a law?   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Tiffany).                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Fulcher).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Idaho for  making a point that it is really the underlying reason that we should  be--or the underlying question we should be talking about is, Why do we  need to recover America's wildlife?   It is because we have messed up badly. We have mismanaged our Federal  lands. Catastrophic wildfires run rampant. That does nothing to help  wildlife habitat, and it is sad that we are actually here looking for  funding and ways to fix something that we should have already fixed,  something that we shouldn't have broken in the first place.   I think there is a way to recover wildlife, if we would just simply  manage the habitat that the wildlife lives in. That is the purpose of  this bill, but it is going to take some worldview changes, and the so- called environmental groups that are pushing to stop the management  activity are going to have to allow this activity to take place.   It doesn't matter how much funding we put out from the Federal  Government; we are going to continue to see wildlife habitat destroyed,  and we are going to continue to see the loss of wildlife.   So it is not a problem that simply throwing money at will fix, and it  is, again, a problem where we should put a program in place, come back  and evaluate it, and decide whether we want to continue the program  based on the merits of the successes of it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk about this bill being  bipartisan. The original House version of the text did have 42  Republican cosponsors on it, which is a sizable number. That is a  bipartisan bill.   There will still be Republicans who vote for this version, but as  long as we are in the business of estimating today, I am going to  estimate that it won't be the 42 cosponsors of the original text,  which, again, was supplanted by the Senate version that didn't send all  the money to the State and Tribal governments. It sent the money to  U.S. Fish and Wildlife, part of the funding to U.S. Fish and Wildlife.   I have talked to some of the Republican Members who have cosponsored  the bill, and their understanding was that the pay-for was going to be  worked out. If we would just sponsor the bill, we would get the pay- fors worked out. We were told the bill will go to the floor, and we  will work out the pay-fors. Well, here is the bill on the floor and  there is still no pay-fors. It is still permanent mandatory spending,  $1.4 billion a year.   If this bill passes out of the House, and if for some reason it  doesn't make it through the Senate and become law, then I hope to come  back and work on a bill that has the same objectives but is fiscally  responsible, a bill that has pay-fors, a bill that is not borrowing  from our children, and a bill that is not permanent, one that actually  gives Congress the authority to have oversight and to come back and  analyze the language, to analyze the success of it, and make changes as  needed as we go on.   We do this with the farm bill, we do it with other bills. I am not  sure why we can't do it with Recovering America's Wildlife Act because  it is a very important subject.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. In closing, I just want to go back through the facts as we  know them.   We know that we need to do better habitat management, whether it is  forest, rangelands, oceans, rivers, or lakes. We know there are areas  where we need to manage better. The intent of this bill is to let those  management activities be done by the people who do it best, State and  Tribal agencies.   I think there is a huge agreement in the House, both Republicans and  Democrats alike, but that is a good thing. The problem we have with the  bill, though, is the way that we are going to implement it in the  financial times that we are in now, and looking back at history and  seeing how we got in the condition that we are in. The spending problem  in this country is not discretionary spending. It is not the  appropriation bills that we should be debating and approving every  year.    It is the mandatory spending. It is the cruise control programs that  previous Congresses have put in place that are driving the deficit.  Over 70 percent of our debt is due to mandatory spending. And here we  are with record debt, record inflation, and we are talking about  putting more on the mandatory side of the equation.   There is a path where we could get huge support. We could probably do  this, maybe even do it on a unanimous consent bill, and that would be  if the majority would accept the amendment that I offered in the Rules  Committee.   As the ranking member on the committee, I offered an amendment that  would bring a lot of our Members on board, and it simply put a 7-year  sunset in, make it an authorization and let the Appropriations  Committee do their work.   We are not even going to vote on that. We are not even going to put  it on the floor to see where the Members of the body are at. The Rules  Committee took that off of the table. So we have no choice. No choice  but to recommend that we vote ``no'' on this bill, that we come back to  the table, that we look at something that everybody can agree on. Not  just on the authorization, but on how we fund the bill. I think we can  get there.   I hate to take it out of the House's hands and put it into the  Senate's hands when we didn't give it a full effort on how to not only  craft the legislation on what needs to be done on the ground, but how  to pay for it, how to be fiscally responsible going forward.   So, again, I support the idea. I don't support the way we are paying  for it. I have to recommend a ``no'' vote. I encourage my colleagues to  vote ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I also rise in support of this amendment en bloc.   None of the amendments included in this amendment en bloc would add  more spending to this bill. Three of the amendments in this en bloc  amend title I by adding more flexibility for State fish and wildlife  agencies when they make conservation investments funded under this  bill.   These amendments do not impose new mandates, but rather, provide  States more tools to manage wildlife as they see fit.   Mr. Scott's amendment on helping pollinators and their habitats will  enhance ongoing efforts aimed at helping the monarch butterfly.  Pollinators are critical to ecosystem conservation around the world.  That is why my Republican colleagues and I have continuously supported  the Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances for the monarch  butterfly, which allows private companies and landowners to contribute  to proactive conservation.   The amendment from Congresswoman Cherfilus-McCormick recommends that  States prioritize funding toward innovative strategies and partnerships  to recover species. I believe that innovation is critical for ensuring  widespread species recovery. The current species recovery framework  under the Endangered Species Act is not only outdated, but it is broken  and needs innovation.   Republicans have offered numerous ideas to use innovation to spur  species recovery. One idea from Representative Herrell of New Mexico  would help incentivize proactive Candidate Conservation Agreements that  allow private companies and landowners to contribute toward at-risk  species conservation through their own dollars and efforts. Sounds like  a good, commonsense idea.   The outdated Endangered Species Act has become a top-down government  approach that rarely works to help species or people. Innovative  approaches like Ms. Herrell's are much needed.   I was disappointed to see that the majority discarded amendments like  Ms. Herrell's without even giving us the chance to debate its merits on  the House floor.   Representative Stauber also had an innovative idea to update the  Endangered Species Act that he offered as an amendment. His amendment  would have provided the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service with the  flexibility to utilize so-called 4(d) rules for endangered species.  Under a 4(d) rule, the Secretary of the Interior can issue a rule for  individual species that tailors protections to that species'  conservation and recovery. Unfortunately, again, the majority also  ignored that amendment.   The amendment by Congresswoman Schrier is also included in this en  bloc by encouraging States to invest in ``conservation infrastructure  projects.'' While States already have flexibility to decide how to  spend the funding provided in title I of the bill, this amendment would  give them the option to invest in natural solutions, such as buffer  strips, wetlands--one of my favorite things--planting trees, and other  natural solutions to environmental challenges.   Lastly, Congresswoman Jackson Lee's amendment would require the  Secretary of the Interior to issue a report within 1 year of this  bill's enactment, detailing the percentage of total awards and grants  that were awarded or allocated to institutions serving minority  communities.   While I support this amendment and its reporting requirement, I have  bad news for the sponsor. Because the bill lacks a sunset provision,  there is little incentive and recourse for Congress to fix any  problems. In other words, if the reports required by this amendment  highlight a glaring flaw with the programs being carried out under this  bill, there will be no guarantee that Congress will fix the problem.  The same is true for the State reports required under the bill.   For that reason, I offered a commonsense amendment that would have  included a 7-year sunset to ensure that Congress would have to fix any  flaws associated with this new program. Unfortunately, as I stated  earlier, my amendment was also blocked by the majority.   This bill and the process to rush this bill to the floor today are  unfortunate. It could have been avoided, but at least the amendments  included in this en bloc do not spend any more taxpayer money and  provide some needed accountability.   Mr. Speaker, I support the en bloc, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I support this group of amendments  en bloc and encourage a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in wholehearted support of these  amendments en bloc, which include amendments from our colleagues from  Oregon (Mr. Bentz) and from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).   These amendments would ensure that the funds provided in title III  are subject to the same overhead cap requirements and oversight  measures as title I.   The original point of this bill was to empower States and Tribes to  carry out species conservation, not set up another Washington, D.C.- based Federal program, which is now what the bill does. Not only does  title III change that intent by giving more than $180 million annually  in the first 4 years to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, but it was  also added at the Rules Committee and was not part of the bill that the  Committee on Natural Resources marked up. Because the Committee on  Natural Resources never had the  [[Page H5523]]  chance to debate this title when we marked up the original bill, we did  not have the opportunity to add these good-governance amendments to it  like we did for titles I and II.   I believe that title III should be removed altogether. Unfortunately,  Representative Moore's amendment, which would have removed title III,  was not made in order, so we didn't even get the chance to debate it,  much less vote on it today.                                time  1615    In the absence of that amendment, the least we can do is ensure funds  allocated by title III are being spent responsibly and with some  oversight.   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the amendments, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Bentz).    Madam Speaker, I again encourage adoption of these  amendments, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment,  which adds more responsibilities to the already duplicative and  expensive title III portion of this bill, which was never debated in  the Committee on Natural Resources.   I have no objection to efforts aimed at controlling invasive species,  and these efforts are already being carried  [[Page H5524]]  out by many Federal agencies. For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service, the agency funded by title III at the expense of State and  Tribal funding, already administers invasive species control programs,  including the Coastal Program and the Partners for Fish and Wildlife  Program, two programs that title III would duplicate.   The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, at USDA  monitors, responds to, and conducts control and eradication programs to  address invasive species that pose a threat to U.S. agriculture.   These and other similar programs are subject to Federal  appropriations, which is what title III should be subject to as well-- not permanent mandatory funding. If the majority would like to increase  Federal funding for invasive species control, they should do it through  the appropriations process instead of airdropping another layer of  bureaucracy into this bill.   For these reasons, we should be striking title III from the bill, at  least until the committee of jurisdiction has a chance to consider and  mark up its provisions. Unfortunately, the majority refused to allow a  vote on my colleague from Utah, Mr. Moore's amendment, which would have  done just that.   I oppose this amendment to allow the funding for title III to be used  for even more duplicative Federal bureaucracy.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, once again, we all have invasive  species that we deal with. It is something we should be focusing on. We  just don't need another duplicative Federal program to do that.   Madam Speaker, I encourage a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, this amendment would actually make the  bill worse by authorizing nonprofit organizations to receive funding  under title I.   This amendment is in direct contravention to the original intent of  this legislation, which is to empower States and Tribes in species  conservation.   The current bill directs funds provided under this program to State  and Tribal fish and wildlife departments or  [[Page H5525]]  to regional associations of fish and wildlife departments.   The amendment would allow activist environmental groups, many of whom  are serial litigants against the kinds of projects this bill aims to  support, to receive funding under title I, decreasing money available  for State fish and game departments.   Radical special interest groups have weaponized the Endangered  Species Act by continuously suing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  This sue-and-settle process overwhelms regulatory agencies, resulting  in settlement agreements and consent decrees that require agencies to  promulgate major regulations within an arbitrarily imposed timeline.   These agreements are often negotiated behind closed doors with little  or no transparency or public input, allowing radical special interest  groups to promote their own Federal policy agendas, outside of the  normal processes.   To make matters worse, these groups are financially rewarded for  suing the government, for suing the American taxpayer. According to the  Government Accountability Office, from 2000 to 2010, ESA lawsuits cost  taxpayers nearly $24 million in attorneys' fees and associated costs.   Private citizens with a net worth of $2 million and for-profit  businesses with a net worth of $7 million cannot receive attorneys'  fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act. However, there is no such  cap for nonprofit organizations, which allows these wealthy groups to  rake in taxpayer money.   According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, from 2009 to 2017, there  were 109 Endangered Species Act settlements. The majority of these  settlements came from just three groups: the Center for Biological  Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, and the WildEarth Guardians. The  Center for Biological Diversity was individually responsible for 41 of  the 109 settlements.   This is not surprising after the Center for Biological Diversity's  director said, in 2009, that ``When we stop the same timber sale three  or four times running, the timber planners want to tear their hair out.  They feel like their careers are being mocked and destroyed--and they  are. Psychological warfare is a very underappreciated aspect of  environmental campaigning.'' We are paying them to do that.   Today we can see the legacy of this mentality and these lawsuits out  West where we have had two of our worst fire years back-to-back, and  this year is not looking any better.   I cannot in good conscience support allowing these radical groups to  receive funding under this bill, especially since it will pull money  away from State fish and wildlife agencies and Tribes, as the bill was  intended to fund.   Madam Speaker, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to  join me in opposition.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, there are some wonderful groups out  there that do great work, but this bill is not about funding private  groups or nonprofit groups. This bill is about funding State and Tribal  entities. It is what it was originally about. It has changed, it is now  funding the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as well. I guess the  majority is thinking, why not just throw in some of these environmental  groups. Who else will this bill be putting funding out to before it is  said and done?   There are groups that abuse the process. They abuse it greatly. They  abuse it at the expense of the American taxpayer. They abuse it at the  expense of the environment. They claim they are wanting to help the  environment and they are destroying the environment.   Madam Speaker, I am opposed to this amendment, and I hope my  colleagues will join me in opposing it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The  SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 8,  the yeas and nays are ordered.   Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  are postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
