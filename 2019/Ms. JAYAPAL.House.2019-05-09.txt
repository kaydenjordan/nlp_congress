 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Schakowsky for her  incredible leadership in the Congressional Progressive Caucus on so  many issues, including bringing truth to the Mueller investigation and  making sure people understand exactly what is going on.   Madam Speaker, for the rest of the Special Order hour, which is the  Congressional Progressive Caucus' Special Order hour that we do each  week, we are focusing on the 1-year anniversary of the family  separation crisis. Any of our Members here who would like to speak are  welcome to do so.   Let me start by saying, 1 year ago, I became the first Member of  Congress to go into a Federal prison where hundreds of men and women,  mothers and fathers, had been separated from their children and were  being held in the prison system, in the Federal prison just south of my  district.   I cannot, even today, 365 days later, forget the stories that these  mothers and fathers told me. They told me about how immigration agents  said to them, ``Your families don't exist anymore,'' and that they  would never see their children again.   At the time that I saw them, it was already 3 to 4 weeks after they  had been separated, and the majority of those parents had no idea where  their children were.   In fact, that morning, some of them had been handed slips that  supposedly  [[Page H3664]]  had the names of their children written on those slips of paper. One  woman came over to me crying and she said: These are not my children.   That slip that supposedly had the names of her children did not match  her actual children.   Can you imagine? I just think, as a mother, and for all the mothers  and fathers out there, as a parent, can you imagine being separated  from your child, in some cases children as young as 6 months, later we  found out 3 months old, babies, who were torn off the breasts of their  mothers?   These moms described immigration agents tearing them from their  children without the opportunity to say good-bye. Some of them told me  that when they went to go to the bathroom, they were told their  children would still be there. When they came back, their children were  gone. But they could hear them in the very next room crying for them,  screaming for their parents, and these mothers were not able to go.   They told me how immigration agents put them in line with their  children, and they would send the parents in one direction and the  children in another direction.   One of the mothers told me how she left Guatemala with her 8- and 12- year-old children. Her husband is in prison. He was put in prison for  raping a young child around the same age as her daughter. He was just  about to come out of prison, and she was afraid that he would come out  of prison and then go after their child, rape her daughter.   Another woman from El Salvador told me how she got a protection order  against her ex-husband, who is a police officer, but the protection  order was meaningless. He continued to antagonize her family, so she  left.   Many of these mothers told me how they had left one or two of their  children behind because they wanted to try to save one. It was too  difficult to bring small children on the long journey that they were  taking--the incredible sacrifice as a parent of trying to save one  child.   One mother told me that she had three children. The first was shot  and killed by gang members. The second was shot and paralyzed by gang  members. She left the paralyzed child at home because she knew that he  would not be able to make the journey. She took the final child. She  tried to bring that child to safety.                                time  2000    After everything these mothers experienced--the trauma in their home  countries, the cruel separation from their children--the treatment that  they experienced in immigration custody was just outrageous.   Immigration agents told them that they were ``filthy.'' They used  that word. Immigration agents laughed at these mothers when they cried  about losing their children. And these mothers told me how they were  detained in cells that were so cold that they called them ``the ice  box'' because it was so cold.   Many of these mothers described being put there after crossing the  Rio Grande River; and they were still wet, and they were put into these  freezer boxes, these ice boxes, without blankets, without sleeping  mats. Some mothers described how they went without water for 5 days.   After public outcry and pressure from elected officials, the  government set up a number for parents to call to get information on  their children, but some of the parents that I spoke to in Texas said  that the number didn't work or that ICE wouldn't allow them to speak to  their children.   One mother mentioned that she repeatedly tried to call her child to  try to locate her child, but the number would not go through.   One mother told me that, when she requested to talk to her child, the  ICE agents would get mad; and agents mentioned that, in some instances,  families would have to pay for these phone calls.   And this isn't just anecdotal. The DHS inspector general's September  2018 report found mixed results among parents attempting to call their  children and that important information about how to contact separated  children was not always available.   Just this week, 2 days ago, Members of Congress had hoped to do the  Special Order hour on the day of the anniversary. We had to do it today  because this is our scheduled time. But the group Families Belong  Together, a coalition of groups working on this issue, did an  installation on our Capitol lawn with the shoes of tiny children all  throughout and then an incredible 3-D statue of a mother reaching out  to her child, and the child was in a cage.   I cannot imagine that this is the country that we call the greatest  country in the world. I cannot imagine that my country that I am proud  of, that I serve here as a Member of Congress for would do this to  children.   And this administration has consistently demonized and vilified  immigrants, but this policy of cruel family separation is hard to even  describe, hard to imagine that it is happening in our borders.   I was privileged to co-chair, with Congresswoman Lucille Roybal- Allard, the Women's Working Group on Immigration Reform, and we led a  trip to the border. I see my good friend Representative Jan Schakowsky,  who was on that trip, and I just want to ask the gentlewoman,  Representative Schakowsky, who has been so eloquent on this issue, I  want to see if she wants to say a few words.   And then I know my friend Barbara Lee is here, as well, about this  crisis and about our commitment, as Democrats, to refuse to allow this  to continue.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Schakowsky for her  comments.   My colleague, the gentlewoman from California, Barbara Lee, has been  such a champion for families, for children,  [[Page H3665]]  for people of color, for low-income families across this country and  knows the history of this country. This is not the first time that we  have separated children from their parents.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee)  to say a few words on this, as well.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Lee for her work,  for her leadership. I was thinking about what she said about children  and the impact on them, even within 24 hours.   We had the then-Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Scott  Lloyd, who was in to testify before us in the Judiciary Committee.                                time  2015    We also had other career child welfare experts that were there on the  panel, including one who testified to us on the committee that he  warned the director and those above him about the increasing family  separations and the incredibly significant, and potentially lifelong  risks to those children; not only the ones that weren't reunited-- because at that point there was still, as there are today, over 300  families today that still aren't reunited--but not only to the ones  that weren't reunited, but he said even the ones who were reunited with  their families, but they spent 3 months or even a week, or even 3  weeks--most of them spent months separated from their parents--that  lifelong--and he used that--lifelong damage to those children would be  intense.   I asked Scott Lloyd as the then-director of the Refugee Resettlement  Program: Did you do anything? Did you take that information that you  got, that this was going to be lifelong, irreversible--he used the word  irreversible, the witness who testified about the damage to children-- did you do anything with that information about the lifelong,  irreversible damage to thousands of children that you, this  administration, has caused?   And he said: No, didn't share it with anybody. Didn't do anything  about it.   On the same day that the Trump administration said that it would  reunite thousands of children--because this is not a Democrat or a  Republican issue--people across this country were outraged by what they  saw.  [[Page H3666]]    I remember First Lady Laura Bush wrote an amazing op-ed talking about  this is not us, this is not America. Independents, Republicans, and  Democrats knew that the Trump zero-humanity policy was wrong, it was  cruel, and it was un-American.   The same day that the Trump administration said: Okay, we hear the  outrage. We will reunite thousands of children that it had separated  through a central database, a government official admitted in an email  that the Trump administration only had enough information at that point  to reconnect 60 parents with their kids; 60 parents out of nearly 3,000  children that we know of.   Because later, we also found out that there were more children that  we didn't know about in a ``pilot project'' that was even before the  scrutiny came.   Let me remind people that at the time that this was happening, DHS  Secretary, then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and other Trump  officials claimed repeatedly--not just once, not just twice--but  repeatedly in testimony, in hearings, that they were keeping track of  separations, and that claim had simply no basis in reality.   The truth is that DHS has better systems in place to track the  property that people who were in custody left, but not the children.  Trump's Department of Homeland Security did not see fit to track  children, including infants and toddlers.   A Federal judge recently ordered the Trump administration to locate  the children that were still remaining, potentially numbering in the  thousands, over the next 6 months as opposed to the 2 years that the  Trump administration requested. Just imagine, the Trump administration  said give us 2 years to try to reunite these kids with their parents.   But the truth is, Congresswoman Lee and everybody that is watching,  we may never know the number of children who were separated by the  Trump administration. There are children who may never ever be reunited  with their parents.   We are, of course, trying to get to the bottom of this. We are trying  to get accountability on this, but we know that DHS is still separating  families. We see the relentless efforts of this administration to cut  people off from seeking asylum, which is, by the way, a lawful act, not  only by our own domestic laws. We are signatory to human rights  treaties, international treaties, which require us to allow people to  seek asylum.   Last week I reintroduced my Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act with  my colleagues, Congressman Adam Smith, and Senator Booker introduced it  in the Senate. Last cycle, this bill had over half of the Democratic  Caucus. I think it was like 167 cosponsors. We intend to get more of  our Democratic Caucus. My office spent 8 months working on this bill in  the last Congress with stakeholders from across the country.   I am proud to say that as we reintroduce it, we have also made sure-- and, frankly, it would have addressed the humanitarian crisis that we  saw through family separation. Last year already made it extremely  difficult to detain children and families. This year, what we did is,  we added explicit language that bars Immigration and Customs  Enforcement officials from detaining children under 18 years.   We actually had the provision of not allowing for pregnant women to  be shackled. Why do we need provisions saying pregnant women can't be  shackled?   What this bill is about is denying this administration and any  administration in the future--Democratic or Republican--from using  detention to facilitate the cruel separation of families.   I am hoping--I know the gentlewoman is either on the bill or is going  to be on the bill--but I am hoping that every single one of my  colleagues joins me in transforming a cruel, abusive system; a  detention system that takes these children and puts them--we should  call them jails because that is what they are. They are not detention  facilities. Most of the actual facilities, as the gentlewoman saw, are  just like jails.   And, in fact, they are using more and more jails. But that system is  now detaining 52,000 people a day, which is why we need to make sure  that we address this in appropriations. We need to make sure that we  address this through legislation.   So I am still astounded by the profound cruelty of this  administration and this policy of family separation, of zero humanity  that was imposed on children and families seeking asylum.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California.     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for pointing that  out. The head of the American Academy of Pediatrics has come. We have  had a number of forums where people have been able to ask questions.  Our Members have been able to ask questions, and I am very grateful to  many of the Members who have taken it upon themselves to go and visit  these detention facilities, go to the border with us and on other trips  as well, and see exactly what is happening. Because I don't think you  can really imagine it unless you see it.   I don't think you can imagine what it is like to go into a giant  facility where children are being held, 6, 7, 8 years old, being held  in cages with no place to sleep.    Yes, begging for help. And I think about the children,  the parents that I talked to, and some of the reunifications that we  saw when I led that trip to the border and thinking about these parents  who had to experience their children not wanting to come to them.   Representative Schakowsky talked about one mom that we met who was  reunited with her 8-year-old daughter. The daughter had been told that  the mother had abandoned her, and for months, she thought the mother  had abandoned her and that she was going to go into a shelter, or a  foster home because her mother had abandoned her.   So you can imagine when the mother came to be reunited with the  child, the mother was so happy that she finally was getting to see her  child, and the child did not want to go to her mother. She didn't want  to go to her mother. It took some time for them to actually be reunited  and for the mother to say: No, I did not abandon you. But if you are  [[Page H3667]]  an 8-year-old child, how do you understand that?    How do you process it? And I think that in the end, I  continue to think about the ways in which we are criminalizing  migrants, criminalizing people who are fleeing violence, tremendous  violence in their countries.   Just the other day there was an article in The New York Times, I  think, that talked about in Honduras, which is where many of the  parents that I met with that were in that Federal prison separated from  their children, many of them were from Honduras. This article described  how you have two choices: You either get killed by the gangs or you  leave. That is the only choice you have.   I also went to Tijuana. I think I was the first Member to go to  Tijuana, and I met with a 15-year-old boy who had been shot in both  knees. And he had a phone message on his cell phone from his mother who  said: Please do not come back here. Just go. Just go. Get to the United  States. Get to a place of safety. Seek asylum. I will be devastated to  have you leave me, but I just want you to stay alive.   What parent doesn't want their child to stay alive? And this young  man who talked to me was a strong young man, but he started weeping,  talking about how he had to leave his mother and come to the United  States as an unaccompanied child. It was devastating to hear,  absolutely devastating to hear.   As we celebrate this 1-year anniversary--not celebrate, memorialize,  I should say--this 1-year anniversary of this cruel, zero-humanity  policy of family separation, I urge all of my colleagues to sign on to  my Dignity for Detained Immigrants bill, to work in appropriations in  every committee that we have, to remember that we still have children  who are separated from their parents, still to this day.   We still have families that are being separated from their parents as  we speak. We still do not know how many thousands more children were  separated from their parents as a result of this administration's cruel  policies that undermine who we are.   I see I have been joined by an incredible colleague, a leader on the  Judiciary Committee, a leader in the Progressive Caucus, and also  somebody who was on our trip to Texas, to the border, but also is from  Texas.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my  colleague, for her comments on this.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for  her leadership, for her words, and for her work on this issue.   I would just say that, as we get ready to close, here, this Special  Order hour, we are thinking, keeping in our minds and in our hearts the  thousands of families across this country and across the world that  have been separated from their children, and we will do everything we  can to continue to fight for justice.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
