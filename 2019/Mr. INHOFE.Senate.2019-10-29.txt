 With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I  report favorably the following nomination  [[Page S6242]]  lists which were printed in the Records on the dates indicated, and ask  unanimous consent, to save the expense of reprinting on the Executive  Calendar that these nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the  information of Senators.    Mr. President, for 58 years, the Congress has passed the  National Defense Authorization Act with large bipartisan margins, and I  believe we are going to do so again this year. In fact, we must. If it  were up to me, it would have already been done by now.   People have to realize that this is the most important bill of the  year. It is one that we have to do. We have to do it by the end of the  year--and that is the end of December--or we are not going to fund our  military. I mean, that is how serious it is.   I will keep working with my colleagues in the House and the Senate to  get this done. I am going to say that again because there is an ugly  rumor out there to the contrary. We are still working to get a  comprehensive bill done. We are going to keep working on it.   It is even more important because of what happened over the weekend.  Our brave Special Operations forces successfully executed a dangerous  mission to get ISIS leader al-Baghdadi, and it was successful. It was  the right call by President Trump to bring down one of the most  dangerous terrorists the world has ever seen, and it was successful.   It also underscored the importance of the annual Defense  authorization bill. There is no better time to pass an NDAA--that is  the national defense authorization bill--that puts our servicemembers  and their families first than after a perilous operation demonstrating  the bravery, service, and sacrifice of our troops, because it took a  lot of people to pull this off. But to ensure that we give the men and  women in the Armed Forces the tools they need to fight and win no  matter what, we are filing a ``skinny bill'' today. Let me explain what  that is.   We have to have a defense authorization. It has to happen. It is one  that has happened for 58 years in a row. It has to happen. It has  happened for 58 years in a row. If it has happened for 58 years in a  row, it is going to continue to happen. We all know that.    The problem with that is, everybody knows it is going to pass.  Consequently, people put more and more things on the bill, and many of  the things have nothing to do with the military because they know the  bill is going to pass. What happens is, then they decide to get  everything in there, and consequently there are so many people lined up  with different things they want to put on the Defense authorization  bill that we have not been able to come to an agreement.   This has happened in the past. What happens is, in the event of the  Defense authorization bill--this would be the largest bill of the year,  the most significant bill of the year--if, for some reason, we are not  able to pass it, military operations will stop.   A skinny bill is simple. It extends necessary authorities for  military operations, takes care of servicemembers and their families,  and authorizes essential military construction and acquisition  programs. That is it. That is one paragraph. That is all it does. That  part has to pass. At the end of the day, that is what we have to do by  the end of this year, by the end of December.   There is this old document that nobody reads anymore; it is called  the Constitution. If you read that, it says what we are really supposed  to be doing, what is really important.   I say to my friend from West Virginia, out of all the things we do,  sometimes they are not all that significant. This is that significant.  That is why this is important. It is going to pass. We ought to make  sure it passes.   By introducing this as a skinny bill, it takes out everything that  has nothing to do with the military, and we just pass the bill to take  care of our troops.   Here on Capitol Hill, the NDAA--National Defense Authorization Act-- is an institution itself, the last bill of its kind, an authorization  bill that passes every year.   We always have disagreements within and between parties on the future  of national security, but we have always managed to overcome those  divisions to support our military. This year is not going to be any  different.   Earlier this year, I worked with my Democratic colleague Senator Jack  Reed to produce a bipartisan NDAA in the Senate. We did a great job. We  spent hours on it, but we ultimately passed it out of committee almost  unanimously--Democrats and Republicans alike. We brought it to the  floor, and we passed it.   It is not the bill where Jack Reed and Jim Inhofe would necessarily  agree on every aspect, but these are tough decisions, and we had to  make decisions, so we made decisions. Consequently, when it came up to  the floor, it passed by 86 to 6. Only six people opposed it in this  entire body.   The same has to be true with any kind of agreement on fiscal year  2020 NDAA. That bill would require 60 votes in the Senate. It will  require Republican votes in the House. The bill that came out of the  House, from the House committee on the Defense authorization bill,  didn't have one Republican voting for it. Obviously, it has to have  Republicans in the House vote for it. It has to pass by a 60-percent  margin. There is no other way it can be done.   We continue making progress. We know we can't pass a bill with as  many partisan provisions as we saw in the House bill--things like  unprecedented restrictions on the President's ability to defend  America, defend the Nation, and putting social agenda above the needs  of our troops. Unfortunately, the same problem that is slowing progress  on the NDAA is also stalling the appropriations process.   When I supported the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, I argued that a  lower topline was acceptable if it got us on-time passage of the NDAA  and the defense funding, but now we are facing a delayed NDAA and the  real possibility of a full-year continuing resolution. This is  unacceptable.   The Department of Defense has never operated under a full-year CR. A  CR is a continuing resolution. A CR would simply be disastrous. What it  says is, we are going to do the same thing for the military and the  rest of the government as we did last year. Well, the needs have  changed. We have new programs that have to be authorized and have to be  voted on. It would be a huge waste of taxpayers' money if we were  unable to get this thing done.   We know a full-year CR would press pause on hundreds of new weapons  programs and leave tens of billions of dollars in the wrong places.   We had a meeting where we had General Martin testify. He is the Vice  Chief of Staff of the Army. For the Army alone, he said we would be  looking at delays to new-start programs and increased costs of 37  programs, totaling $7 billion. That is according to  [[Page S6247]]  the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. That is the Army alone. The total  failure is going to be somewhere around $22 billion that would be lost.   All said, this would put work rebuilding our military even further  behind and waste enormous amounts of taxpayer dollars.   The national defense strategy--that is this book. This is kind of  interesting because this book was put together by Democrats and  Republicans, all with expertise and a background in the military, equal  number of Democrats and Republicans, and they all agreed that this was  going to be our defense strategy. They have a National Defense Strategy  Committee. That national defense strategy provided a clear vision of  the serious challenges it faces and the necessity of ``urgent change at  significant scale.'' That is what Secretary Mattis stated.   Failure to pass an NDAA and accepting a full-year CR would stop our  Nation's defense strategy in its tracks. It would undo all the good  work we have done with Secretary Esper, the President of the United  States, the Pentagon, as well as our partners, to follow the  recommendations of the NDS Commission report.   This is not just inside-the-beltway gridlock. The world is watching.  Our allies and our enemies are watching. They want to know if America  is serious about its role in the world and its own national defense.   Failure to pass basic legislation on a timely basis to support our  military sends a terrible signal that undermines our national security.  Think of the signal that sends to our troops who are out there risking  their lives to defend us here at home.   Caring for our troops is about the only thing anyone in this town  agrees on. If we lose that bipartisan support, it will be hard to get  it back, and we need it now more than ever.   China and Russia. This is interesting because we didn't used to be  that concerned about them. I would say that during the Obama  administration, his priorities were not the same. He was very honest  about it. He had other priorities. So we didn't do the job we should  have done at that time for our military. China and Russia are not  waiting around for us to end our disagreements with each other.   During the last administration, under Obama, our military funding  decreased by 25 percent. Between the years of 2010 and 2015, we  decreased the amount of funding for our military in that administration  by 25 percent. Meanwhile, China had increased spending by 83 percent  over the last decade. Think about it. China increased its spending by  83 percent, and we reduced ours by 25 percent.   They are continuing a campaign of aggression, building islands in the  South China Sea. Our allies over in the South China Sea are watching  what China is doing there and around the world and what we are not  doing. They have come to the conclusion that a third world war may be  imminent, and they are not sure whose side they want to be on.   This chart I am showing right here is a picture of hypersonic  weapons. These are state-of-the-art weapons. These are missiles that  travel at five times the speed of sound. This is something we were  ahead on during the beginning of the previous administration, and we  are now behind. Right now, China is parading dozens of massive  hypersonic missiles, and we have haven't even built one yet.   There they are. That is a picture I haven't seen until today. Those  are hypersonic weapons, and they were on Tiananmen Square on October 1,  2019. A lot of people didn't know that they are--they have not just  caught up with us; they have passed us. We haven't built one yet, and  there they are.   People don't realize where China and Russia are. That is China, but  Russia continues to develop new and dangerous nuclear weapons, while it  expands its influence in the Middle East and elsewhere.   I have no doubt that a united America can face these challenges. I  fear that a divided America--a country that allows defending America to  be a partisan issue--cannot.   The path to a final defense bill is, as it always has been,  bipartisan. The Defense authorization bill has historically enjoyed  broad bipartisan support, and that is not an accident. Both parties  have compromised to get a bill worthy of our troops and worthy of our  troops' sacrifices.   I hope we get to a place where we can find common ground to give our  troops and military a comprehensive bill. That is what we want to  continue to do.   We have been working on this bill for a long period of time.  Normally, it doesn't take this long. We have gotten it down to what  they call the four leaders. I am one of those four leaders who have  been trying to put this together, but we have not been able to get it  done.   What we are doing with this bill is we are putting the bill up. We  are going to get it on the floor so we can be ready.   Here is the problem: If we don't do it, we can sit around and do  nothing through the month of November, and when December gets here, all  of a sudden, we are going to be faced with the fact that we are going  to have some bill that takes care of just the military, not all the  other stuff that is on the bill. To do this, you have to pass it out of  committee. You have to take it to the floor of the Senate. You have to  pass it out. Then, if you get that far, the House has to do the same  thing. Then we go into conference, and we confer on this thing.   Obviously, that is going to take not just days but weeks. So to  prepare for the unlikely possibility that we don't get together, we do  have the skeleton bill that we are going to introduce. I am going to  introduce it an hour from now. It is the only thing we can do right now  to make sure we can take care of our troops if we are not able to get  the comprehensive bill completed. That is the reason for it. I will be  introducing it.   Every provision in that bill is a provision to enhance our military  efforts, to pay our troops, and to take care of our country the way we  have been able to do in the past.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for 58 years, the Congress has passed the  National Defense Authorization Act with large bipartisan margins, and I  believe we are going to do so again this year.
