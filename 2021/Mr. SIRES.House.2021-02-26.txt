 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of this much-needed relief  package. The American Rescue Plan will help millions of people who are  struggling in every community in our Nation as a result of the  pandemic. It sends direct aid to those who need it most, boosts  vaccination efforts, provides a lifeline for small businesses, helps  kids get back to school safely, and much more.   As many of my colleagues have mentioned, the American people-- Democrats and Republicans alike--support this critical aid. I hope that  my colleagues will join me in passing this important bill and sending  relief to those who need it.
