 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Michigan  Veteran Homes in my district in Chesterfield.   I was fortunate enough to recently visit this facility and spend time  learning from the great folks caring for so many of Michigan's heroes.  This great facility provides veterans with top-level care, from  physical rehabilitation programs, memory stimulation, and all the way  up to full-term care.   The Chesterfield staff honorably serves our veterans with the utmost  dignity, which is something veterans deserve. I am so proud to have an  organization like this in Michigan's Ninth District, and I am  especially proud of the outstanding work Michigan Veteran Homes in  Chesterfield does every single day.                President Biden is Negotiating with Terrorists     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in anger. I am angry that  President Biden is quite literally negotiating with terrorists and  plans to release to Iran $6 billion in frozen assets.   Do you know what negotiating with terrorists leads to? I will share  with you what that leads to: more Americans being kidnapped for ransom.  Connect the dots, people. It is not that tough.   This is an absolute embarrassment to our country and a complete and  utter failure of Biden's foreign policy yet again. Make no mistake  about it. The $6 billion that Biden is so casually handing over to  Tehran, what will it be used for? It will be used to fund State- sponsored terrorism.   Let us not forget what happened on 9/11. This is on the heels of 9/ 11. We are incentivizing terrorism by giving our enemies $6 billion. We  can't be this asleep at the wheel; but he is. This will destabilize the  Middle East and put our allies at grave risk.   Let me be clear. This is not diplomacy or statesmanship. This is  signing a deal with the devil.                                time  1015    Mr. Speaker, I rise today because my home State of Michigan and our  entire country is at a crossroads.   This coming Friday, the United Auto Workers are likely going to  strike. Nearly 150,000 will stop working, leaving General Motors,  Stellantis, and Ford without anyone to build the cars that drive our  economy forward.   If you ask President Biden, he will say it is no big deal and the  strike is not going to happen. Well, let me tell you, Mr. President:  Guess again. The strike is real, and its dawn is coming tomorrow.   While I don't always agree with Big Labor and their strategies, I can  see why they are angry. They have watched as their companies have sold  out to the radical Green New Deal agenda and have placed EVs ahead of  their employees. Yes, I want to say that. These companies have placed  EVs ahead of their employees.   For those that don't know, it is simple. EVs take less parts. Less  parts means less workers. Less workers hurt our economy.   Make no mistake about it. This is happening because of Joe Biden's EV  mandates and his reckless agenda to rid the world of reliable engines.  It is not a sustainable plan, but Biden seems not to care.   Some automakers are just going along to get along with Biden because  even when their profits decrease due to EVs, they have doubled down on  their plan at the expense of the men and women who build our cars.   I want to be clear about something. I am not against EVs, but I am  against mandates and against abandoning things that actually work.   Gas-powered engines work, and they work well. EVs barely work, and  they are unreliable, which is something Secretary Granholm knows very  well.
