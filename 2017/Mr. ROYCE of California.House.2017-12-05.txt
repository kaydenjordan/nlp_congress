 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 90) condemning ethnic  cleansing of the Rohingya and calling for an end to the attacks in and  an immediate restoration of humanitarian access to the state of Rakhine  in Burma, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 90         Whereas on August 25, 2017, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation       Army carried out attacks on Government positions in the state       of Rakhine in Burma (``Rakhine State'');        Whereas in recent decades the Rohingya people have lost,       through systematic discrimination by Burmese national, state       and local authorities, a range of civil and political rights,       including citizenship, and face barriers today such that they       are mostly stateless peoples;        Whereas since the August 25 attacks, Burma's military and       security forces, as well as private mobs, have carried out       attacks resulting in over 600,000 Rohingya fleeing to       Bangladesh;        Whereas Amnesty International described the attacks by       stating that ``Myanmar security forces are setting northern       Rakhine State ablaze in a targeted campaign to push the       Rohingya people out of Myanmar.'';        Whereas the United Nations Security Council has called for       an end to the violence and attacks;        Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner on Human       Rights has said that the response by the military is       ``grossly disproportionate'' and a ``textbook example of       ethnic cleansing'';        Whereas Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said, ``This       violence must stop, this persecution must stop'';        Whereas under Burma's military-drafted constitution, the       country's military and security services are not subject to       civilian rule and only Burma's Commander-in-Chief, Min Aung       Hlaing, can command troops to cease attacks impacting       civilians in Rakhine State;        Whereas Burma's civilian Government, led by Aung San Suu       Kyi, has not yet taken necessary steps to address the       violence and should take further measures, including to       address the pervasive problem of hate speech;        Whereas the United States acknowledges the democratic       transition underway in Burma, maintains hope for further       genuine democratic reforms, and expects Burma's elected       officials to take action to prevent violence and secure       rights;        Whereas the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State (``Rakhine       Commission'') examined, beginning in 2016, the underlying       tensions in Rakhine State and made a series of       recommendations including a wide range of suggestions and       policy changes dealing with humanitarian aid, citizenship,       reconciliation, and peace;        Whereas the Rakhine Commission stated, ``While Myanmar has       every right to defend its own territory, a highly militarized       response is unlikely to bring peace to the area. What is       needed is a calibrated approach - one that combines       political, developmental, security and human rights responses       to ensure that violence does not escalate and inter-communal       tensions are kept under control.'';        Whereas the United Nations estimates that $434,000,000 in       humanitarian assistance will be needed to provide life-      sustaining support to 1,200,000 people, both refugees and       host communities, in the first few months of this crisis; and        Whereas the United States is providing an initial       $32,000,000 in humanitarian assistance to address the urgent       needs of Rohingya fleeing violence from Rakhine State into       Bangladesh, as well as the needs of internally displaced       persons in Rakhine State and host communities in Bangladesh:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That Congress--        (1) condemns the attacks against civilians by Burma's       military and security forces and calls on Burma's Commander-      in-Chief, Min Aung Hlaing, to immediately end all attacks       against civilians in the state of Rakhine in Burma;        (2) expresses deepest appreciation to the Government of       Bangladesh for providing refuge to those fleeing violence and       attacks;        (3) condemns the attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation       Army and the violence in Rakhine and Rohingya communities,       but warns that these attacks do not justify the unrestrained       response by Burmese military and security forces that has       resulted in severe human rights violations, murderous ethnic       cleansing, and atrocities against civilians;        (4) calls on Burma's Government, led by Aung San Suu Kyi,       and the Burmese military and security forces to work       constructively to implement the recommendations of the       Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, including those       relating to justice, reconciliation, humanitarian aid, and       citizenship;        (5) calls on Burma's Government and its military and       security services to allow unimpeded humanitarian access to       refugees and internally displaced persons;        (6) urges support and access for the United Nations Fact       Finding Mission to Burma;        (7) calls on Burma's military and Government to allow       refugees to voluntarily return to Burma in a manner       consistent with internationally recognized principles of       human rights and refugee protection and to change laws and       policies that have contributed to insecurity in the state of       Rakhine; and        (8) calls on the President of the United States to impose       sanctions on members of the Burmese military and security       forces who are responsible for human rights abuses.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days  [[Page H9644]]  to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material  in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days  [[Page H9644]]  to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material  in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, for decades, the Burmese Government and its military has  systematically oppressed the people known as the Rohingya, a Muslim  minority living in the Rakhine State of Burma.   A 1982 citizenship law denies the Rohingya citizenship, even though  most of them have lived in the country for generations. They have been  denied freedom of movement, access to healthcare, and education. The  Rohingya have been marginalized at every level of the Burmese  Government, from the top to the bottom.   Making matters worse, Burma's military is engaged in a new brutal  crackdown on the Rohingya that the U.S. has rightly deemed ``ethnic  cleansing.'' More than 600,000 Rohingya people have been driven from  their homes in recent months, forced to cross the border into  Bangladesh.   Hundreds have been killed, though with journalists denied access to  large areas of Rakhine State, that number is clearly very much higher  than those reported. At least 200 villages have been burned to the  ground. Land mines have been placed inside Burma's border with  Bangladesh, maiming refugees seeking safe haven. There are reports of  rapes and all types of violence committed against the Rohingya by the  Burmese security forces.   Importantly, this resolution not only condemns the attack against  civilians by Burma's security services led by General Min Aung Hlaing,  it also reaffirms the crimes committed against the Rohingya as ethnic  cleansing. Recently, Secretary of State Tillerson made this strong but  warranted determination, a decision that deserves our praise here.   Bangladesh also deserves credit for opening its borders in order to  handle the human refugees that are streaming out of Burma, but its  government has to honor its promise to build shelter for new arrivals  and provide medical services.   In response to this crisis, Secretary Tillerson recently announced an  additional $47 million in humanitarian assistance for Burma and  Bangladesh, bringing the total U.S. assistance to more than $150  million this year. It is very much needed.   State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and the  de facto leader of Burma, must make it a top priority to provide for  the safety of those in Burma, including the Rohingya. The safe and  voluntary return of the victims displaced in Bangladesh must also be a  top priority.   But to get to the point where the Rohingya will feel safe enough to  return to their homes, the Burmese Government and military must honor  their responsibility to ensure the protection of all of the people of  Burma, regardless of their ethnic background, regardless of their  religious beliefs.   The violence against the Rohingya must stop, and those responsible  for those atrocities must face justice.   The protection of human rights has long been our Nation's top  priority in Burma, including freeing Aung San Suu Kyi. Today, that must  include the Rohingya. This is a moral issue and a national security  issue. No one is secure when extremism and instability is growing in  this part of the world.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of what our colleague Joe Crowley brought  up today, there is new urgency in this argument and new urgency to us  getting the point across to the Government of Burma. Let me speak for a  minute as to that issue.   Many people at this moment are in grave danger. Many people who are  in certain areas in Rakhine State are in danger at this moment. They  are at risk of mass killings.   State security forces as well as armed civilian perpetrators stand  poised. So the situation right now, it is possible that we have not  seen the worst of this in terms of mass killings.   As we speak, the Government of Myanmar confines 120,000 Rohingya men,  women, and children to more than 45 internment camps in these eight  townships in Rakhine State, which we are most concerned about at this  moment. They have been confined for the last 5 years, as we know. They  have been denied aid, and they have been, obviously, deprived of their  dignity.   Since August 25, the Government of Myanmar has obstructed, as shared  with this body today by Joe Crowley, has blocked food aid, humanitarian  aid to some of these internment camps, systematically weakening that  population. They are at grave risk.   This is notice to the Government of Burma. The authorities there  continue to block the delivery of this humanitarian aid, this food aid  to these women and children. If this does not end now, it will  constitute acts of genocide. It must end now.   And also, of course, the authorities there continue to enforce severe  restrictions on freedom of movement and severe restrictions on the  livelihoods of these people.   It is more than worrisome, the extent to which the Burmese Government  and security forces have continued to thwart international observers  from moving into these camps and have thwarted international  organizations. The world should demand access now for impartial fact  finders. Any continued resistance can only reinforce our suspicions  that Burma has something to hide and that the evidence will show will  constitute acts of genocide if this continues. It must end now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the  Middle East and North Africa.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking  [[Page H9646]]  Member Engel for their leadership in bringing this important resolution  to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 90, condemning the  ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya and calling for an end to the attacks  in Burma and the immediate restoration of access to humanitarian aid. I  am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution.   I thank our previous speaker, my colleague, Joe Crowley, as well as  our Republican colleague, Steve Chabot, sitting in front of us, for  authoring this measure.   We are seeing condemnations of the atrocities occurring in Burma from  across the world, Mr. Speaker, as well as calls for the nation's de  facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to make greater efforts to stop the  violence there.                                time  1430    Last month, our U.S. administration issued an official determination  that the Burmese military's actions constitute ethnic cleansing, and  rightly so. The atrocities being committed against this ethnic minority  have been well documented and they deserve the utmost condemnation.   The reality on the ground is shocking, Mr. Speaker. Over 600,000 were  forced to flee to neighboring Bangladesh; the systematic massacre, the  rape, the pillaging, all in an effort to eliminate any trace of these  Muslim minorities in Burma.   No one is safe, no Rohingya is safe, yet the world continues to sit  back and watch as these individuals are targeted for extinction and  eradication from the history books.   We as a United States Congress can do more, we must do more, and we  expect responsible nations and responsible actors to do more to end  this persecution.   Last week, Pope Francis met with Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma's top  military commander, delivering the message that these atrocities must  be stopped. The Dalai Lama has spoken out against this systematic  campaign.   Now it is time for us in the U.S. Congress to add our voice and send  a strong message of our own, and this resolution does just that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the chairman of the Committee on  Small Business and a senior member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H. Con. Res. 90. The  discrimination and violence imposed on the Rohingya ethnic minority in  Burma is brutal, horrific, and preventable.   I do welcome, like the rest of my colleagues, the administration's  determination that the attacks against Rohingya are ethnic cleansing,  because it certainly is, but I would respectfully submit it certainly  rises to the level of genocide.   The Genocide Convention couldn't be clearer: If you look to destroy  an ethnic group--there are other categories as well, but it is all  about the group--in whole or in part, and even the thought, the  contemplation of doing so can rise to genocide.   Here it is actually happening, and it is happening because of who  they are as a group.   I think there needs to be a further refinement of that determination  to the point of being genocide.   The responsibility for this humanitarian crisis falls squarely on the  Burmese military and, to some extent, on the endemic and widespread  intolerance expressed in Burmese society for the Rohingya.   After the State Department's determination of ethnic cleansing, it  should not hesitate to impose sanctions against the Burmese military  leaders and all others who are responsible for this bloodbath.   Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I am deeply  concerned that this crisis may destabilize the National League for  Democracy's ruling coalition and set back Burma's democratic  transition.   I am concerned about China's interests in Burma, because a robust  democracy on China's border does not fit the goals of the Chinese  leadership, including Xi Jinping.   I am concerned that outside jihadi groups will exploit this situation  to open yet another front.   I am concerned, like my colleagues, about the stability of  Bangladesh, whose fragile economy must now host well over 500,000 new  refugees.   Of course, we are all most concerned about the Rohingya women,  children, and men who suffer horribly during this crisis.   The roots of this humanitarian crisis are long. A durable solution  for the Rohingya in Burma will be a difficult task, but we must make  the effort. As we all know, there are other ethnic minority groups in  Burma, including the Karen, the Karenni, and others, who have also  faced atrocities over the years at the hands of the Burmese military.   A democratic and multiethnic future should be Burma's best hope for  prosperity and stability. The Burmese military remains the obstacle to  that future.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I just wanted to, again, thank Joe Crowley, our colleague, and Mr.  Steve Chabot for their work on this measure, and Mr. Eliot Engel as  well, our ranking member of the committee. They have all along been  leaders on this issue, and I thank them for authoring the measure.   I think all of us know that even before this latest resurgence, this  massive displacement, this ethnic cleansing, many considered the  Rohingya to  [[Page H9648]]  be one of the most persecuted minorities, one of the most persecuted  populations on the planet. I think this particular resolution rightly  shines a light on the abuses committed against them, calling for an end  to all violence.   I urge all Members here, but also I urge the Government of Burma, to  consider that we are at a point of crisis. If the government there does  not reverse course immediately, it will do irreparable damage to its  standing in the world and earn it a place among the most egregious  human rights abusers in modern history. So what we ask is a reversal of  these policies.   I urge all colleagues to vote in favor, send a clear signal that the  U.S. will not turn a blind eye toward these atrocities.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and agree to the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 90.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1164) to condition assistance to the West Bank and  Gaza on steps by the Palestinian Authority to end violence and  terrorism against Israeli citizens, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1164         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Taylor Force Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Palestinian Authority's practice of paying salaries       to terrorists serving in Israeli prisons, as well as to the       families of deceased terrorists, is an incentive to commit       acts of terror.        (2) The United States does not provide direct budgetary       support to the Palestinian Authority. The United States does       pay certain debts held by the Palestinian Authority and funds       programs for which the Palestinian Authority would otherwise       be responsible.        (3) The United States Government supports community-based       programs in the West Bank and Gaza that provide for basic       human needs, such as food, water, health, shelter,       protection, education, and livelihoods, and that promote       peace and development.        (4) Since fiscal year 2015, annual appropriations       legislation has mandated the reduction of Economic Support       Fund aid for the Palestinian Authority as a result of their       payments for acts of terrorism including, in fiscal year       2017, a reduction ``by an amount the Secretary determines is       equivalent to the amount expended by the Palestinian       Authority, the Palestine Liberation Organization, and any       successor or affiliated organizations with such entities as       payments for acts of terrorism by individuals who are       imprisoned after being fairly tried and convicted for acts of       terrorism and by individuals who died committing acts of       terrorism during the previous calendar year''.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         Congress--        (1) calls on the Palestinian Authority, the Palestine       Liberation Organization, and any successor or affiliated       organizations to stop payments for acts of terrorism by       individuals who are imprisoned after being fairly tried and       convicted for acts of terrorism and by individuals who died       committing acts of terrorism and to repeal the laws       authorizing such payments;        (2) calls on all donor countries providing budgetary       assistance to the Palestinian Authority to cease direct       budgetary support until the Palestinian Authority stops all       payments incentivizing terror;        (3) urges the Palestinian Authority to develop programs to       provide essential public services and support to any       individual in need within its jurisdictional control, rather       than to provide payments contingent on perpetrating acts of       violence;        (4) urges the United States Permanent Representative to the       United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the       United States at the United Nations to highlight the issue of       Palestinian Authority payments for acts of terrorism and to       urge other Member States to apply pressure upon the       Palestinian Authority to immediately cease such payments; and        (5) urges the Department of State to use its bilateral and       multilateral engagements with all governments and       organizations committed to the cause of peace between Israel       and the Palestinians to highlight the issue of Palestinian       Authority payments for acts of terrorism and to urge such       governments and organizations to join the United States in       calling on the Palestinian Authority to immediately cease       such payments.

APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.         In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional       committees'' means--        (1) the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on       Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on       Foreign Relations of the Senate.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we consider the Taylor Force Act. This is  bipartisan legislation that honors a courageous and patriotic young  American, Taylor Force.   Taylor was an Eagle Scout. He was a West Point graduate who served  his country with distinction in Afghanistan and Iraq before he enrolled  in Vanderbilt's MBA program. He was a young man with big dreams and  loads of potential. Then Taylor's life was tragically cut short at the  age of 28 when he was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist while on a  business school trip to Israel.   I had the honor of meeting again with Taylor's parents, Stuart and  Robbi, who were on Capitol Hill today. They have worked so hard to make  this bill a legacy for their son, to ensure that no other family has to  experience what they have experienced. They have been so generous with  their time, their spirit, their story. We are grateful for all of their  efforts, and we wish them comfort as they continue to mourn the  heartbreaking loss of their son.   We need to be clear about responsibility for this vicious attack. The  Palestinian Authority gives salaries to Palestinians who attack  innocent people like Taylor. If the attacker dies, then the attacker's  family is compensated under their law. I know it is hard for us to  adjust to this, but it is Palestinian law to reward Palestinian  prisoners in Israeli jails with a monthly paycheck. The Palestinian  leadership also pays the families of Palestinian suicide bombers.   It goes without saying that these policies clearly incentivize  terrorism. In fact, this perverse pay-to-slay system uses a sliding  scale: the longer the jail sentence, in other words, the greater the  mayhem created there, the greater the reward. The highest payment goes  to those serving life sentences, to those who prove, obviously, most  brutal.   This system is a disgrace. It is also the result of an abiding  climate of hatred that Palestinian leaders continue to foster toward  Jews, toward Israelis.   As one witness told our committee: `` `Incitement' is the term we  usually use, but hatred is what we mean . . . teaching generations of  Palestinians to hate Jews by demonizing and dehumanizing them.'' That  is what democratic Israel faces, and it is not getting any better.   Yet, for a generation, we have given economic aid to the  Palestinians, in large part, to try to stabilize their society to  promote peaceful coexistence between the Palestinians and Israelis.  This goal is undermined every day that the PA makes payments for acts  of terrorism. This must stop.   This bipartisan bill cuts off assistance that directly benefits the  Palestinian Authority unless the PA takes credible steps to end acts of  violence,  [[Page H9650]]  stops payments for acts of terrorism, revokes the laws requiring these  payments, or takes actions comparable to revoking the laws, and  publicly condemns these acts of violence.   Our bill also requires consistent reporting to Congress that clearly  explains how the administration makes its determinations. If our  assistance is being withheld, the administration must report which of  the PA's dangerous actions are continuing so that Congress can  determine how to apply pressure going forward.   Too many grieving families go to sleep every night knowing that money  is changing hands as a reward for violence that killed one of their  loved ones.   With this bill, we are using the weight of U.S. law to help see that  no more families--American, Israeli, or anyone--join their tragic  ranks. We do this in the name of one brave American, Taylor Force, to  honor the memories of all victims and, importantly, help prevent future  victims. We also do it in the hopes of peace.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn). He is the author of this  important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. She is also  our chairman emeritus.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and my good  friend, Ranking Member Eliot Engel, for his hard work. I especially  want to thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) for offering  this important bill.   Sadly, as we have heard, Mr. Speaker, Taylor Force is the name and  the face of the disgusting and reprehensible practice in place by the  Palestinians that we know as pay to slay.   Taylor Force, as we have heard, was an Eagle Scout, a West Point  graduate, a veteran of two wars, who served our Nation bravely and with  distinction. It was a life cut tragically short at 28 years old, when  he was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist while in Israel.   While the world condemned this attack and while Taylor Force's  friends and family mourn his loss, the Palestinian leaders fail to take  responsibility. No, instead, Abu Mazen and the Palestinian leadership  continue to incite violence, continue to support terror. Because, make  no mistake, Mr. Speaker, as long as the Palestinian Authority or the  PLO--whatever name they want to use--make payments to terrorists, they  are supporting terror.   How can you conclude otherwise?   It is irresponsible and it is shameful to think that the American  taxpayer and the U.S. Government are in any way, shape, or form helping  to support this pay-to-slay program. This is why this act will ensure  that, until pay to slay is ended, we will not be a willing contributor  to the Palestinian scheme. This is just another tool that Congress has  given the administration to use in order to hold the Palestinian  leaders accountable.   However, I do believe that we should not allow for exceptions, not  allow for carve-outs in this important bill, because that flexibility,  sadly, is sometimes used to circumvent the spirit of the law and the  congressional intent.   I would like to remind our body that the administration already has  the tools it needs to withhold assistance to the Palestinian Authority  and the West Bank and Gaza, so we must exercise existing authorities  and send a message to the Palestinians once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the administration to use all of the tools at its  disposal, to not waive provisions of U.S. law, to not selectively  enforce some laws and apply others. That means ending all assistance to  the Palestinian Authority--all. It means closing the PLO office in D.C.  until pay to slay has ended and until the Palestinians stop their  incitement and stop their support for terror.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important and  tragic measure, and I urge the administration to use these tools that  we continue to provide to it. I thank the chairman and the ranking  member for rapidly bringing this important bill to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and  International Organizations.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce  and Ranking Member Eliot Engel for, again, working so well together to  bring this legislation to the floor; and Lee Zeldin, one of the  principal cosponsors of the bill; and Doug Lamborn, of course, the  prime author of this legislation.   I, too, am proud to be a cosponsor. This is a very important bill  that will serve as a measure of justice for the memory of U.S. Army  Officer Taylor Force and many others who have been victimized over the  years by Palestinian terrorism subsidized by the Palestinian Authority.  It is well past time for us to apply real pressure to the Palestinian  Authority for continuing incitement for anti-Israel, anti-Semitic, and  anti-American violence. This bill takes aim at the PA's ongoing  financial incentivizing of murder.   Mr. Speaker, when you pay someone to kill somebody else and pay their  family to kill somebody else, that is a crime. So this just ought to be  seen as a step in trying to say we mean business. Those who authorize  those payments ought to be held liable for these crimes.   Although 2 years ago Congress deducted the PA's compensatory payments  to terrorists and their families from U.S. assistance, there has been  no change in the PA's twisted and perverted policy. By conditioning  most U.S. assistance to the PA on its commitment to cease payments to  terrorists, the Taylor Force Act takes the necessary next and important  step to guarantee that American taxpayer dollars are not being used to  reward terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, the PA cannot be a partner for peace until it stops  subsidizing terrorism. Amidst increasing talk of a new peace initiative  in the region, we must be absolutely clear that there could be no true  peace until Palestinian public policy stops inculcating a culture of  death in the minds of the people.   Years of diplomacy, Mr. Speaker, and public pressure aimed at  stemming Palestinian incitement have not succeeded. Congress must act  now with the power of the purse.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), a member of the Committee on  Foreign Affairs. He is the coauthor of this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me thank my friend and colleague, Eliot  Engel, for his eloquence in explaining the enormity of the tragedy here  and the meaning of this terrorism. I think Mr. Engel has been such a  diligent partner in not only helping us move this bill through, but  helping us run the committee in a bipartisan way. I want to thank him  at this moment as we pass this act for all of his work on this issue  through the legislation and through the hearings. I think it has had an  impact in the understanding of the Members here.   I also want to recognize and thank our former colleague, Senator  Lindsey Graham. I have talked with him about this issue. He originated  this bill in the Senate. I know also how passionately he feels about  this, as do Eliot and myself. I look forward to working with our Senate  colleagues to ensure that the bill that we pass here in the House or  the Senate bill, either one, the bottom line is that the Taylor Force  Act must become law quickly. That is our objective.   The purpose of our aid, as we understand it, is to advance U.S.  interests around the world. That is why we give aid. I think all of us  can agree that that does not include paying people to commit crimes of  terrorism. The Palestinian Authority is flatout undermining U.S.  interests by compensating and incentivizing violence, as articulated by  my friend, Mr. Engel.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill, which ensures  that there are consequences for this disgraceful policy and ensures  that the U.S. plays no part, even indirectly, in participating in this  behavior. The PA giving compensation for violence is beyond the pale.  It is long past time that we treat it that way.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rothfus). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1164, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2658) to provide humanitarian assistance for the  Venezuelan people, to defend democratic governance and combat  widespread public corruption in Venezuela, and for other purposes, as  amended.

Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The deterioration of democratic governance and the       economic crisis in Venezuela have led to an unprecedented       humanitarian situation in which people are suffering from       severe shortages of essential medicines and basic food       products.        (2) According to the World Health Organization, Venezuela       had a shortage of necessary medications and medical supplies       of--        (A) 55 percent in 2014;        (B) 67 percent in 2015; and        (C) 75 percent in 2016.        (3) According to a Human Rights Watch 2016 report, it is       increasingly difficult for many Venezuelans, particularly       those in lower- or middle-income families, to obtain adequate       nutrition and there are reports of symptoms of malnutrition,       particularly in children.        (4) Maternal deaths in Venezuela increased by 66 percent       from 2015 to 2016 while infant deaths increased by 30       percent.        (5) There were 240,000 confirmed malaria cases in Venezuela       in 2016--a 76 percent increase over 2015.        (6) A survey--conducted jointly by the Central University       of Venezuela, the Andres Bello Catholic University, and the       Simon Bolivar University--found that almost 75 percent of       Venezuelans lost an average of at least 19 pounds in 2016 as       a result of a lack of proper nutrition amidst the country's       economic crisis.        (7) Despite massive shortages of basic foodstuffs and       essential medicines, Nicolas Maduro has rejected repeated       requests from the Venezuelan National Assembly and civil       society organizations to bring humanitarian aid into the       country.        (8) The International Monetary Fund has estimated that in       Venezuela in 2016 the country's gross domestic product       contracted by 12 percent and inflation rate reached 720       percent, and has stated that Venezuela had the worst growth       and inflation performance in the world.        (9) The International Monetary Fund has not convened an       Article IV Executive Board consultation for Venezuela since       September 13, 2004, which greatly limits the extent of       information available to the international community about       the severity of the Venezuelan economic crisis.        (10) Venezuela's political, economic, and humanitarian       crisis is fueling social tensions that are resulting in       growing incidents of public unrest, looting, violence among       citizens, and an exodus of Venezuelans abroad.        (11) These social distortions are taking place amidst an       alarming climate of criminal violence. According to the       United Nations Office on Drug and Crime, Caracas, Venezuela       had the highest per capita homicide rate of any capital city       in the world in 2015 at 120 murders per 100,000 citizens.        (12) In 2016, 18,155 Venezuelans submitted asylum requests       in the United States, which was the greatest number of       requests by any nationality, according to U.S. Citizenship       and Immigration Services.        (13) International and domestic human rights groups, such       as Foro Penal Venezolano, recognize more than 600 political       prisoners in Venezuela, including opposition leader and       former Chacao mayor Leopoldo Lopez, Judge Maria Lourdes       Afiuni, Caracas Mayor Antonio Jose Ledezma Diaz, National       Assembly Deputy Gilber Caro, and former San Cristobal mayor       Daniel Ceballos.        (14) According to media accounts, over 125 people lost       their lives as the result of public demonstrations and       protests in Venezuela since April 2017.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) Nicolas Maduro should permit the delivery of       international humanitarian assistance to address the       widespread and deeply concerning shortages of essential       medicines and basic food products faced by the people of       Venezuela;        (2) it is in the best interest of the Venezuelan people for       the Government of Venezuela to engage with multilateral       institutions to ameliorate the effects of the country's       ongoing economic, social, and humanitarian crisis;        (3) Nicolas Maduro should immediately release all political       prisoners and respect internationally recognized human rights       in order to facilitate the conditions for political       negotiations and dialogue in Venezuela;        (4) Nicolas Maduro and the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of       Venezuela should take steps to reinstate the full powers and       authorities of the National Assembly of Venezuela in       accordance with the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic       of Venezuela;        (5) Venezuela's National Electoral Council should establish       a specific timeline to hold national, regional, and municipal       elections in accordance with the Constitution of the       Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and allow supervision of       credible international electoral observers; and        (6) the United States should support meaningful efforts       towards a substantive dialogue through which all parties       uphold their commitments and agree to specific deadlines to       restore respect for Venezuela's constitutional mechanisms and       resolve the country's political, economic, and humanitarian       crisis.       SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT FOR STRATEGY TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN                     ASSISTANCE TO THE PEOPLE OF VENEZUELA.         (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in       coordination with the Administrator of the United States       Agency for International Development, shall submit to the       Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives,       the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, the       Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives       and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a strategy       to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Venezuela       through credible and independent nongovernmental       organizations operating in Venezuela or in neighboring       countries to alleviate the suffering of the Venezuelan       people.        (b) Matters to Be Included.--The strategy required under       subsection (a) shall include the following:        (1) A description of how and to what extent the following       assistance will be provided:        (A) Public health commodities for Venezuelan health       facilities and services, including medicines on the World       Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines and basic       medical supplies and equipment.        (B) Basic food commodities and nutritional supplements       needed to address growing malnutrition and improve food       security for the people of Venezuela, with a specific       emphasis on the most vulnerable populations.        (C) Technical assistance to ensure health and food       commodities are appropriately selected, procured, and       distributed, predominantly through local nongovernmental       organizations.        (2) An identification of United States Agency for       International Development best practices in delivering       humanitarian assistance and how such best practices are being       utilized in providing humanitarian assistance to Venezuela.       SEC. 5. REQUIREMENT FOR STRATEGY TO COORDINATE INTERNATIONAL                     HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the appropriate United Nations humanitarian agencies should       conduct and publish an independent assessment on--        (1) the extent and impact of the shortages of food and       medicine in Venezuela; and        (2) the efforts needed to resolve such shortages.        (b) Strategy.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in       consultation with the Administrator of the United States       Agency for International Development, shall submit a multi-      year strategy to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the       Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives that--        (1) describes how the United States will secure support       from international donors, including regional partners in       Latin America and the Caribbean, for the provision of       humanitarian assistance to the people of Venezuela; and        (2) identifies governments that are willing to provide       financial and technical assistance for the provision of such       humanitarian assistance to the people of Venezuela and a       description of such assistance.       SEC. 6. SUPPORT FOR EFFORTS AT THE UNITED NATIONS ON THE                     HUMANITARIAN AND POLITICAL CRISIS IN VENEZUELA.         (a) Initial Efforts.--The President shall instruct the       Permanent Representative of the United States to the United       Nations to use the voice and vote of the United States to       secure the necessary votes--        (1) to place the humanitarian and political crisis in       Venezuela on the agenda at the United Nations; and        (2) to secure a Presidential Statement from the United       Nations urging the Government of Venezuela to allow the       delivery of humanitarian relief and to lift bureaucratic       impediments or any other obstacles so that independent       nongovernmental organizations can provide the proper       assistance to the people of Venezuela without any       interference by such government.        (b) Additional Efforts.--        (1) In general.--If the Government of Venezuela refuses to       allow the delivery of humanitarian relief and lift       bureaucratic impediments and any other obstacles described in       subsection (a)(2), then beginning not later than 30 days       after the conclusion of the efforts of the United Nations       described in such subsection, the President shall instruct       the Permanent Representative of the United States to the       United Nations to use the voice and vote of the United States       to secure the adoption of a resolution described in paragraph       (2).        (2) Resolution described.--The resolution of the United       Nations described in paragraph (1) is a resolution--        (A) directing the Government of Venezuela to promptly allow       safe and unhindered access for humanitarian agencies and       their implementing partners, including possible support from       neighboring countries; and        (B) calling on the Government of Venezuela to--        (i) allow the delivery of food and medicine;        (ii) end human rights violations;        (iii) agree to free, fair and transparent elections with       credible international observers;        (iv) cease violence; and        (v) release all political prisoners.       SEC. 7. SUPPORT FOR ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES INTER-                    AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC CHARTER.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:  [[Page H9655]]         (1) Article 1 of the Inter-American Democratic Charter,       adopted by the Organization of American States in Lima on       September 11, 2001, affirms, ``The peoples of the Americas       have a right to democracy and their governments have an       obligation to promote and defend it.''.        (2) Article 19 of the Inter-American Democratic Charter       states ``an unconstitutional interruption of the democratic       order or an unconstitutional alteration of the constitutional       regime that seriously impairs the democratic order in a       member state, constitutes, while it persists, an       insurmountable obstacle to its government's participation in       sessions of the General Assembly . . . and other bodies of       the Organization.''.        (3) Article 20 of the Inter-American Democratic Charter       provides--        (A) ``In the event of an unconstitutional alteration of the       constitutional regime that seriously impairs the democratic       order in a member state, any member state or the Secretary       General may request the immediate convocation of the       Permanent Council to undertake a collective assessment of the       situation and to take such decisions as it deems       appropriate.''; and        (B) ``The Permanent Council, depending on the situation,       may undertake the necessary diplomatic initiatives, including       good offices, to foster the restoration of democracy.''.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) Nicolas Maduro, the National Electoral Council of       Venezuela, and the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela       have carried out systematic efforts to undermine, block, and       circumvent the authorities and responsibilities of the       Venezuelan National Assembly as mandated in the Constitution       of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela;        (2) such efforts by Nicolas Maduro and the Supreme Tribunal       of Justice of Venezuela amount to an unconstitutional       alternation of the constitutional regime that seriously       impairs the democratic order in Venezuela; and        (3) the Secretary of State, working through the United       States Permanent Mission to the Organization of American       States, should take additional steps to support ongoing       efforts by the Secretary General of the Organization of       American States--        (A) to invoke the Inter-American Democratic Charter;        (B) to advance a collective assessment of the situation in       Venezuela; and        (C) to promote diplomatic initiatives to foster the       restoration of Venezuelan democracy.       SEC. 8. CONCERNS AND REPORT ON THE INVOLVEMENT OF VENEZUELAN                     OFFICIALS IN CORRUPTION AND ILLICIT NARCOTICS                     TRAFFICKING.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The deterioration of governance in Venezuela has been       exacerbated by the involvement of senior officials of the       Government of Venezuela, including members of the National       Electoral Council, the judicial system, and the Venezuelan       security forces, in acts of corruption and illicit narcotics       trafficking and related money laundering.        (2) In March 2015, the Department of the Treasury's       Financial Crimes Enforcement Network determined that       approximately $2,000,000,000 had been siphoned from       Venezuela's public oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.,       in conjunction with its designation of the Banca Privada       d'Andorra as a Foreign Financial Institution of Primary Money       Laundering Concern.        (3) On August 1, 2016, General Nestor Reverol, Venezuela's       current Minister of Interior and former National Guard       commander, was indicted in a United States district court for       participating in an international cocaine trafficking       conspiracy.        (4) On November 18, 2016, Franqui Francisco Flores de       Freitas and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores, nephews of Nicolas       Maduro and Venezuelan First Lady Cilia Flores, were convicted       in a United States district court on charges of conspiring to       import cocaine into the United States.        (5) On February 13, 2017, the Department of the Treasury's       Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Tareck Zaidan El       Aissami Maddah for his involvement in illicit narcotics       trafficking, pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin       Designation Act (21 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.; title VIII of Public       Law 106-120).        (6) The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign       Assets Control has designated additional individuals and       senior Venezuelan officials for their involvement in illicit       narcotics trafficking, pursuant to such Act, including--        (A) Venezuelan national Samark Jose Lopez Bello, who is the       primary front man and money launderer for Tareck Zaidan El       Aissami Maddah;        (B) Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios, who is the current       National Assembly Deputy and the former Director of       Venezuela's Military Intelligence Directorate;        (C) Henry de Jesus Rangel Silva, who is the current       Governor of Trujillo State and the former Director of       Venezuela's Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention       Services;        (D) Ramon Emilio Rodriguez Chacin, who previously served as       the Minister of Interior; and        (E) Freddy Alirio Bernal Rosales, who previously served as       the Mayor of the Libertador municipality of Caracas.        (7) On September 12, 2017, Ambassador William Brownfield       testified before the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics       Control that drug trafficking organizations in Venezuela have       ``completely penetrated virtually every security, law       enforcement, and justice-related institution'' and that       ``there will be no long-term, democratic, prosperous and       secure solution in Venezuela until there is a solution to the       drug trafficking organization presence''.        (b) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Corruption.--The term ``corruption'' means the extent       to which public power is exercised for private gain,       including by bribery, nepotism, fraud, or embezzlement.        (2) Grand corruption.--The term ``grand corruption'' means       corruption committed at a high level of government that--        (A) distorts policies or the central functioning of the       country; and        (B) enables leaders to benefit at the expense of the public       good.        (c) Reporting Requirement.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, acting       through the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, and in       consultation with the intelligence community (as defined in       section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C.       3003(4))), shall submit a report to Congress that describes       the involvement of senior officials of the Government of       Venezuela, including members of the National Electoral       Council, the judicial system, and the Venezuelan security       forces, in acts of corruption in Venezuela, with a specific       emphasis on acts of grand corruption.        (2) Additional elements.--The report submitted under       paragraph (1) shall--        (A) describe how the acts of corruption described in the       report pose direct challenges for United States national       security and international security;        (B) identify individuals that frustrate the ability of the       United States to combat illicit narcotics trafficking; and        (C) include input from the Drug Enforcement Administration,       the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the Financial       Crimes Enforcement Network.        (3) Form.--The report under paragraph (1) shall be       submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified       annex. The unclassified portion of the report shall be made       available to the public.       SEC. 9. SANCTIONS ON PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR PUBLIC                     CORRUPTION AND UNDERMINING DEMOCRATIC                     GOVERNANCE IN VENEZUELA.         (a) Finding.--Executive Order 13692 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note),       which was signed on March 8, 2015, established sanctions       against individuals responsible for undermining democratic       processes and institutions and involved in acts of public       corruption that were not included in the Venezuela Defense of       Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-      278).        (b) Sanctions.--Section 5 of the Venezuela Defense of Human       Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-278) is       amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``or'' at the end;        (B) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (5);        (C) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following:        ``(3) is responsible for, or complicit in, ordering,       controlling, or otherwise directing, significant actions or       policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions;        ``(4) is a government official, or a senior associate of       such an official, that is responsible for, or complicit in,       ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, acts of       significant corruption, including the expropriation of       private or public assets for personal gain, corruption       related to government contracts or the extraction of natural       resources, bribery, or the facilitation or transfer of the       proceeds of corruption to foreign jurisdictions; or''; and        (D) in paragraph (5) (as redesignated), by striking       ``paragraph (1) or (2)'' and inserting ``paragraph (1), (2),       (3), or (4)''; and        (2) in subsection (e), by striking ``December 31, 2019''       and inserting ``December 31, 2022''.        (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the President and Secretary of State should seek to encourage       partner countries of the Organization of American States, the       European Union, and the United Nations to impose sanctions       with respect to Venezuelan individuals that are similar to       sanctions imposed by the United States with respect to such       Venezuelan individuals.       SEC. 10. CONCERNS OVER PDVSA TRANSACTIONS WITH ROSNEFT.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) In late 2016, Venezuelan state-owned oil company       Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (referred to in this section as       ``PDVSA''), through a no-compete transaction, secured a loan       from Russian government-controlled oil company Rosneft, using       49.9 percent of PDVSA's American subsidiary, CITGO Petroleum       Corporation, including its assets in the United States, as       collateral. As a result of this transaction, 100 percent of       CITGO is held as collateral by PDVSA's creditors.        (2) CITGO, a wholly owned subsidiary of PDVSA, is engaged       in interstate commerce and owns and controls critical energy       infrastructure in 19 States in the United States, including       an extensive network of pipelines, 48 terminals, and 3       refineries, with a combined oil refining capacity of 749,000       barrels per day. CITGO's refinery in Lake Charles,  [[Page H9656]]       Louisiana is the sixth largest refinery in the United States.        (3) The Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on       Rosneft, which is controlled by the Russian Government, and       its Executive Chairman, Igor Sechin, following Russia's       military invasion of Ukraine and its illegal annexation of       Crimea in 2014.        (4) The Department of Homeland Security has designated the       energy sector as critical to United States infrastructure.        (5) The growing economic crisis in Venezuela raises the       probability that the Government of Venezuela and PDVSA will       default on their international debt obligations, resulting in       a scenario in which Rosneft could come into control of       CITGO's United States energy infrastructure holdings.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) control of critical United States energy infrastructure       by Rosneft, a Russian government-controlled entity currently       under United States sanctions, would pose a significant risk       to United States national security and energy security;        (2) the President should take all necessary steps to       prevent Rosneft from gaining control of critical United       States interstate energy infrastructure;        (3) a default by PDVSA on its loan from Rosneft, resulting       in Rosneft coming into possession of PDVSA's United States       CITGO assets, would warrant careful consideration by the       Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States;        (4) if PDVSA defaults on its debt obligations, the       Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control       should review CITGO's transactions with United States persons       to assess and ensure compliance with United States sanctions       policies and regulations; and        (5) the Department of Homeland Security should conduct an       assessment of the security risks posed by foreign control of       CITGO's United States energy infrastructure holdings and keep       the relevant committees of Congress fully informed of its       findings and any subsequent strategy to address       vulnerabilities to United States energy security as a result.       SEC. 11. REPORT ON ACTIVITIES OF CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS IN                     VENEZUELA.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, acting       through the Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the       Department of State and in consultation with the intelligence       community, shall submit to Congress a report that describes       the full extent of cooperation by the Governments of the       Russian Federation, the People's Republic of China, Cuba, and       Iran with the Government of Venezuela and the Venezuelan       armed forces.        (b) Form.--The report under subsection (a) shall be       submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified       annex. The unclassified portion of the report shall be made       available to the public.        (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``intelligence       community'' has the meaning given such term in section 3(4)       of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003(4)).    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill represents broad bipartisan concern here in  the House for the worsening humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. It calls  on the Secretary of State and the USAID Administrator to develop a  humanitarian assistance strategy to help the people of Venezuela.   As the authoritarian Venezuelan Government digs in its heels and  consolidates its power, the people of that once wealthy nation, last  year, experienced a 65 percent increase in maternal mortality, a 30  percent increase in infant mortality, and a 76 percent increase in  malaria cases.   Severe shortages of basic medicine persists. They have right now  about 5 percent of the basic medicines that they used to have. A 2016  report shows that three out of every four Venezuelans had lost an  average of 19 pounds due to lack of proper nutrition and due to lack of  food.   Despite all of this, President Maduro continues to deny the existence  of a full-fledged humanitarian crisis while blaming any hardships on  his opposition or the international community that seeks only to  support the people of Venezuela in their pursuit of democracy and basic  human rights.   I applaud the administration for sanctioning those in the Maduro  regime complicit--complicit--in the rampant corruption and anti- democratic measures that have stifled the will of the people there. But  we must address the specter of the complete collapse of the Venezuelan  economy and the resulting humanitarian crisis.   I encourage my colleagues to support this measure by Mr. DeSantis,  which will require a strategy to address the crisis while signaling  bipartisan support for the democratic and human rights aspirations of  the people of Venezuela.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                  Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, December 5, 2017.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I write with respect to H.R. 2658, the       ``Venezuela Humanitarian Assistance and Democratic       Governance.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on       provisions within H.R. 2658 that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any       further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 2658 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 2658 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, December 4, 2017.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 2658, the Venezuela       Humanitarian Assistance and Defense of Democratic Governance       Act of 2017, so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to       the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 2658 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Eliot Engel  for authoring this bill along with Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. I also thank  Albio Sires and Ron DeSantis, the cosponsors of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen), who is the chairman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs, the primary Republican cosponsor of this bill.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time, and  I thank the ranking member for those very sweet words.   Mr. Speaker, I echo what Ranking Member Engel said about my trusted  staff director, Eddy Acevedo. This is his last week with us. He starts  Monday with the USAID. He has got the whole weekend to party on. He has  been my partner in all of these battles in favor of freedom and  democracy and against autocratic regimes, which brings us to this bill  before us, Mr. Speaker.   I rise in strong support of this bill, H.R. 2658, the Venezuela  Humanitarian Assistance and Defense of Democratic Governance Act of  2017. I am proud to be, as the chairman said, the Republican lead on  this important legislation.   I have been proud to work side by side with the author of the bill,  our ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Eliot Engel,  in putting this bill together. Eliot has been a leading voice in this  legislative body in support of freedom and democracy across the globe,  as has our esteemed chairman. But Eliot has really focused in on this  hemisphere, especially on Venezuela. I want to thank him for his  leadership on this issue.   I also want to thank his trusted adviser sitting two seats away from  him on all Western Hemisphere-related items. Eric Jacobstein is my  buddy from Haiti. We have enjoyed as much as one can enjoy going to an  island nation that needs so much help. The people of Haiti are  beautiful, and it has been a joy to travel with Eric and with Eddy.  Throughout the years, Eric has worked closely with us and with our  office. We work in a bipartisan manner. That is the tone that our  esteemed chairman has set for the committee. Eric and Eliot work that  way as well. Their knowledge and expertise on this topic has been  instrumental to our committee.   The bill before us, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2658, is simple, it is  straightforward, and it is important. Maduro, like Chavez before him-- two thugs--has turned Venezuela from a once vibrant and thriving nation  into a country on the brink of utter collapse. The results have been  disastrous for the people of Venezuela. There is food shortage, there  is water shortage, and there is a severe lack of medicine and medical  supplies. There is a lack of goods and services everywhere you turn.    The people need to get proper nutrition. They need proper care, but  they can't find it. It is a crisis that Maduro and his thugs have  denied exists because he is eating very well. The other day he was  making a televised public declaration. He opens up the drawer, takes an  empanada, and he is stuffing his face. But the people are starving. But  recognizing it would mean that Chavismo has utterly failed, so they  refuse to recognize this.   So what happens?   The Venezuelan people suffer from severe malnutrition. They are  subject to price controls. It is unbelievable the prices of items  there. If they can ever get the food, if they can ever get the services  they need, then the people can't afford them. They are subject to  substandard and unhygienic conditions. This has led to a sharp rise in  infant mortality, and really mortality rates across the board in  Venezuela have gone up.   In short, the majority of the people in Venezuela are living in  misery. What was once the breadbasket of the whole hemisphere, now the  people don't have food. They are living in misery. The Maduro regime is  not only to blame, but it is ensuring that the humanitarian situation  gets even worse. It was Maduro who ordered the supreme court to block a  law from the opposition that would have helped facilitate humanitarian  aid from NGOs and other international entities. As a result, it is ever  so difficult to get the supplies needed to respond to this crisis into  Venezuela to the people who so desperately need it. That is why, Mr.  Speaker, this bill is so important.                                time  1545    It directs USAID, the institution Eddy will be a partner of in just a  few days, and our great Department of State to develop a plan in order  to determine if and how the U.S. can possibly help with some of the  humanitarian assistance through credible and independent NGOs, or  nongovernmental organizations, that are operating in Venezuela or  neighboring countries to ensure that this assistance does get to the  people who desperately need it.   The bill also directs our Ambassador to the United Nations to use our  full voice, full vote, and full influence of the United States to place  the humanitarian and political crises in Venezuela on the agenda at the  U.N.   Mr. Speaker, this body, alongside our friends in New York at the  U.N., has worked to hold rogue regimes accountable for failing to allow  humanitarian assistance in their countries. Whether it is Syria or  Yemen, this body has spoken in a unified manner that humanitarian  assistance should not be prevented from reaching the people.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Kustoff of Tennessee). The time of the  gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from  Florida an additional 1 minute.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. But on Venezuela, Mr. Speaker, it seems as if we  hold a different standard, and that is  [[Page H9658]]  unacceptable. For too long, Venezuela has been shielded from criticism  and action at the U.N. by its cronies, like the equally corrupt and  morally reprehensible Castro regime in Cuba.   This is precisely the kind of situation for which the U.N. was  created to respond; yet, to date, the response has been woefully  inadequate and shamefully void of substance.   We have got to lead on this effort, and this bill is what we need.  There are millions of people suffering in Venezuela. We are in a  situation to help.   I would point out to our chairman and the ranking member that we had  some excellent news in the minutes that we have been speaking. The  Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the nomination of our  former committee chief of staff, Yleem Poblete, for Assistant Secretary  of State for Verification and Compliance. It now goes to the full  Senate. I know that she will be with us on these measures that attack  atrocious regimes and will help alleviate the humanitarian crisis.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Sires is not alone.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Cook), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western  Hemisphere and a cosponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues--Mr. Engel, the author, and  Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen, the cosponsor of this measure--for their  leadership and for bringing the bill here to the floor.   The world has watched with great sadness as President Maduro  continues to run his country into the ground, denying his citizens  access to basic food and denying them access to medicine. His obsession  with consolidating power has resulted in Venezuela's economic collapse,  and it is a collapse created by his wrongheaded populist and socialist  mismanagement that has left his country in dire economic straits.   Even more disturbing to me is that Maduro's lieutenants continue  lining their pockets while Venezuelan citizens go without food and  medicine. This bill reiterates this body's support for the people of  Venezuela by instructing relevant U.S. agencies to develop a strategy  to address their immediate humanitarian needs, while supporting  democracy and human rights.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2658, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 259) expressing concern and  condemnation over the political, economic, social, and humanitarian  crisis in Venezuela, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 259         Whereas in Venezuela, President Nicolas Maduro controls the       Presidency, a majority of the municipalities, the Supreme       Court, the military leadership, and the leadership of       Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and has gutted the National       Assembly of the power it constitutionally holds;        Whereas in late October 2016, Venezuela's state courts and       National Electoral Council, which are comprised of political       allies of President Maduro, halted efforts to hold a       referendum pursuant to provisions of the Venezuelan       constitution to recall President Maduro, thereby denying the       Venezuelan people the ability to pursue a democratic solution       to Venezuela's crisis;        Whereas Venezuela's National Electoral Council postponed       elections for governors and mayors scheduled for December       2016 and has not set a date to reschedule these elections;        Whereas there have been several attempts at dialogue       between President Maduro and the opposition over the past       year, which have all failed to yield tangible results;        Whereas the Government of Venezuela continues to silence       its citizens through political arrests, with more than 444       political prisoners currently in jail;        Whereas Joshua Holt, a United States citizen, remains       imprisoned in Venezuela with no due process, and four       postponed hearings to date;        Whereas in its 2016 report, Venezuela's Violence       Observatory assessed a widespread use of firearms by       criminals and increased use of violence by police and       military officials, contributing to a homicide rate of 91.8       per 100,000 residents, making Venezuela one of the most       violent countries in the world;        Whereas police and military raids have led to widespread       allegations of human rights abuses, including extrajudicial       killings, mass arbitrary detentions, torture, forced       evictions, and arbitrary deportations;        Whereas Venezuela is immersed in a deep economic crisis,       with shortages of basic food supplies and medicines, and       inflation estimated to top roughly 1,600 percent in 2017,       according to the International Monetary Fund;        Whereas the Venezuelan military controls the production and       distribution of basic food supplies, which has enabled       corruption, fraud, and food trafficking, and exacerbated       shortages throughout the country;        Whereas deteriorating conditions in health care persist,       with the World Health Organization estimating that there are       shortages of 75 percent of necessary medications and medical       supplies, up from 55 percent in 2014 and 67 percent in 2015;        Whereas a recent survey - conducted jointly by the Central       University of Venezuela, the Andres Bello Catholic University       and the Simon Bolivar University - found that almost 75       percent of Venezuelans lost an average of at least 19 pounds       in 2016 as a result of a lack of proper nutrition amidst the       country's economic crisis;        Whereas the country is facing increasing outbreaks of       previously eradicated diseases, such as malaria and       diphtheria;        Whereas the Health Ministry in Venezuela published an       epidemiological bulletin in May 2017 (the first since 2015),       showing a 30 percent increase in infant mortality, a 66       percent rise in maternal mortality, and a 76 percent increase       in malaria cases;        Whereas the deteriorating conditions in Venezuela have       prompted tens of thousands  [[Page H9660]]       of Venezuelans to flee to countries throughout the Western       Hemisphere, including Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia,       Panama, Peru, and the United States, which threatens a wider       refugee crisis in the region;        Whereas there were 18,000 asylum requests from Venezuelans       seeking to enter the United States in 2016, which according       to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services was the       highest number of requests made by any nationality last year;        Whereas the Government of Venezuela has regulated and       reduced the number of local and international media outlets       with opposing views, including CNN en Espanol following its       broadcast of a report alleging that Vice President Tareck El       Aissami was directly linked to a ring of fraudulent       Venezuelan passports provided to foreigners including known       members of the terrorist organization Hezbollah;        Whereas, on February 13, 2017, the Department of the       Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated       Venezuela's Vice President Tareck Zaidan El Aissami Maddah as       a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker pursuant to the       Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for playing a       significant role in international narcotics trafficking, and       imposed sanctions on Mr. El Aissami and froze his assets in       the United States;        Whereas, on March 23, 2017, fourteen Member States of the       Organization of American States (OAS) published a joint       statement calling for the Government of Venezuela to hold       elections, restore the constitutional powers of the National       Assembly, and release political prisoners;        Whereas, on March 28, 2017, the OAS Permanent Council       agreed by a vote of 20 in favor, 11 against, 2 abstentions,       and 1 absent/nonvoting Member States to move forward in       discussing the situation in Venezuela;        Whereas, on March 28, 2017, the Supreme Court of Venezuela       stripped opposition leaders of the National Assembly of their       parliamentary immunity and began to take steps to consider       prosecuting them for treason;        Whereas, on March 29, 2017, the Venezuelan Supreme Court       seized power from the democratically elected National       Assembly and nullified the legislative branch's ability to       function;        Whereas, on March 31, 2017, in the first major break of a       sitting Venezuelan public official, Venezuelan Attorney       General Luisa Ortega Diaz affirmed the Supreme Court's       actions ``had broken constitutional order'';        Whereas, on March 31, 2017, Venezuelan citizens took to the       streets protesting the Supreme Court's breach of power;        Whereas, on April 1, 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its       earlier decisions taking over the National Assembly's       legislative powers and stripping the legislators of their       parliamentary immunity;        Whereas, on April 26, 2017, the Government of Venezuela       announced its intent to withdraw from the OAS;        Whereas on May 1, 2017, President Maduro announced a       national vote to create a Constituent Assembly to rewrite the       Venezuelan Constitution of 1999, which OAS Secretary General       Luis Almagro stated (in testimony before the Committee on       Foreign Relations of the Senate on July 19, 2017) was       ``imposed by decree without the people and against the       people, setting the will of the dictatorship above the       popular will expressed through universal and direct vote'';        Whereas, on May 2, 2017, the Department of State stated,       ``We have deep concerns about the motivation for this       constituent assembly, which overrides the will of the       Venezuelan people and further erodes Venezuelan democracy'';        Whereas peaceful protests by Venezuelan citizens since       March of 2017 have been met with violence from Venezuelan       authorities that has caused 100 deaths;        Whereas, on May 17, 2017, the United Nations Security       Council met to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela;        Whereas, on May 18, 2017, the Department of the Treasury       announced United States sanctions against eight Venezuelan       Government officials, all members of Venezuela's Supreme       Court, pursuant to Executive Order 13692, for their       responsibility in issuing a number of rulings that       ``interfere with or limit the National Assembly's authority''       and that ``limit the ability of the National Assembly to       conduct its constitutional duties'';        Whereas, on May 23, 2017, President Maduro signed a       document formally establishing the terms for electing members       of a Constituent Assembly, presenting the proposed body as a       way to rewrite the Constitution;        Whereas, on June 2, 2017, President Maduro pledged to hold       a referendum on the proposed new constitution;        Whereas, on June 20, 2017, the OAS General Assembly meeting       was held in Cancun, Mexico, where a resolution regarding the       precarious situation in Venezuela failed to gain the votes       needed for passage;        Whereas Venezuela's Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz is       being legally pursued for defying President Maduro, with the       Supreme Court banning her from leaving the country and       freezing her assets;        Whereas, on July 8, 2017, opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez       was released from prison but remains under house arrest;        Whereas, on July 16, 2017, more than seven million people       cast votes in a popular consultation to reject the       Constituent Assembly;        Whereas, on July 19, 2017, Secretary General of the OAS,       Luis Almagro, issued a third report on the crisis in       Venezuela which documented the violations of the constitution       and systemic violations of human rights by the Government of       Venezuela and calling for the immediate suspension of the       Constituent Assembly, the cessation of violent repression,       the opening of a channel for humanitarian assistance, and the       release of political prisoners;        Whereas, on July 20, 2017, the government-controlled       Venezuelan Supreme Court annulled the process of the       appointment of judges by the opposition-controlled National       Assembly;        Whereas, on July 30, 2017, the Government of Venezuela       convened the Constitutent Assembly, which, on August 18,       2017, assumed lawmaking powers to supersede Venezuela's       legitimate National Assembly; and        Whereas the Constituent Assembly voted to remove Luisa       Ortega Diaz from her position of Attorney General on August       5, 2017, and to replace her with Tarek William Saab, who was       sanctioned by the United States Department of the Treasury on       July 26, 2017, along with 12 other current and former senior       officials of the Government of Venezuela: Now, therefore, be       it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) urges the Government of Venezuela to heed the calls of       the international community without delay to hold free, fair,       and open elections, release all political prisoners,       including United States citizens, respect the constitutional       rights of the National Assembly, and open a channel for       international humanitarian assistance and medicines;        (2) urges Organization of American States (OAS) Member       States to continue all efforts to support the principles of       the Inter-American Democratic Charter, regardless of       Venezuela's intent to withdraw from the OAS, and continue       calls for the Government of Venezuela to hold free and fair       elections and release all political prisoners in a timely       manner;        (3) recognizes the strong leadership of OAS Secretary       General Luis Almagro in building a coalition of OAS Member       States in support of democracy and human rights for the       Venezuelan people; and        (4) encourages the President of the United States to       prioritize a resolution to the political, economic, social,       and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and an effective       response to the growing regional refugee crisis that is       emanating from Venezuela, through multilateral cooperation       with partners at the OAS and United Nations, and through       targeted sanctions against individuals responsible for the       deterioration of democratic institutions and the rule of law       in Venezuela.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection. C    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection. C    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Congressman DeSantis for his work on  this resolution.   The world has watched as Venezuela's economy has nearly collapsed,  bringing about a humanitarian crisis on top of the existing political  crisis that we see there. Maduro's decision to sideline the  democratically elected National Assembly by forming a so-called  constituent assembly made up of his lieutenants has cemented Venezuela  as a full-fledged dictatorship.   The administration made clear through a combination of sanctions and  regional engagement that Maduro's violation of Venezuela's constitution  continues to destabilize not just Venezuela, but it is destabilizing  this entire region. And the sanctions also made clear that the Maduro  regime's corruption and involvement in drug trafficking is known and  will not be tolerated.   Venezuela's once prosperous economy is isolated and is suffering  record-high inflation rates. The humanitarian crisis, fueled by  shortages of food and shortages of medicine, has resulted in the  resurgence of diseases and a big increase in infant mortality. All of  this has led to even more unrest, fueling the potential of another  major migration crisis right here in the Western Hemisphere.   The destabilizing effect of the Maduro regime must end. The  resumption of talks this week between the opposition and the Maduro  regime cannot  [[Page H9661]]  be just another way for the regime to buy time. The international  community, regional leaders, and this body must be united in our  insistence that Maduro take seriously the need for resolution of this  serious political and humanitarian crisis.   Passage of this measure will send a strong, bipartisan message that  Congress stands with the Venezuelan people and that Congress stands in  favor of democracy and transparency and against corruption and against  human rights violations.   This resolution calls on regional leaders and the Organization of  American States to continue to pressure Maduro to release political  prisoners, to dissolve the unconstitutional constituent assembly, and,  most importantly, to schedule fair and transparent elections now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis), a member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee and author of this measure.   Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for moving this  through our committee, and I am glad that we are getting a lot of  support for this resolution on the House floor today.   President Trump, when he spoke at the U.N. in September, said that  ``the problem with Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly  implemented, but that it has been faithfully implemented.'' I think the  results speak for themselves. You have a country that is in chaos, that  is a basket case, and you have an autocrat doing whatever he can to  cling to power.   Think about what is going on in Venezuela:   You have the country with perhaps the largest oil reserves in the  world, and yet they have massive fuel shortages;   You have hyperinflation that is over 2,000 percent;   Diseases that we thought had been eradicated, like malaria, are now  coming back;   There are massive food shortages such that wide swaths of the  population are losing 10 or 15 pounds a year;   And, of course, the Government of Venezuela is very likely to have to  default on their debt.   Maduro and his socialist junta are dominating the country. They are  oppressing a great many, many people. And, of course, he is aided in  this effort by his patron and adviser, Raul Castro, and the Cuban  dictatorship. We cannot forget their role in this because they are  really central to a lot of what is going on there.   We have been speaking about some of the things Cuba did to our  diplomats. That has not been fully resolved to my satisfaction.   So Cuba's role in this is really nefarious. You really have the worst  elements of Latin America on display in Venezuela.   I think what this resolution does is it says that this Congress  stands foursquare behind the people of Venezuela and their rights and  their desires to live in a successful, free, and democratic country;  and we do call on the President to continue some of the actions he has  taken, some aggressive actions in sanctioning key individuals. We want  the Trump administration to clearly be on the side of the people of  Venezuela and to make clear that Maduro's failed socialist regime  simply cannot continue in this way.   So, please, pass the resolution. What we have done today is just one  step,  [[Page H9662]]  but I hope the U.S. can do more to aid the people of Venezuela. They  are fighting against some tall odds and a lot of power coming down on  them, but we have got to do something.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chairman emeritus of  the Committee on Foreign Affairs and one of this body's preeminent  experts on the Western Hemisphere.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our wonderful chairman for  yielding me time. I also thank our ranking member, Eliot Engel for his  hard work. This committee is a model for other committees in the U.S.  House of Representatives. We truly work in a bipartisan manner and it  is because of the leadership of Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel. They set the  pace.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill before us, H. Res. 259,  by my Florida colleague, Congressman Ron DeSantis, who has been very  active in the issue of human rights in our Western Hemisphere. His bill  expresses concern and condemnation over the dire political, economic,  social, and humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Venezuela  today. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important resolution. I  thank him for his leadership on this issue, on the issue of the lack of  freedom and democracy in my native homeland of Cuba, and what he is  helping the people of Nicaragua achieve in having separation of powers.   Mr. Speaker, there has been a real problem throughout the hemisphere,  and by approving this important measure, which is bipartisan, today,  this body will once again demonstrate that we stand in solidarity with  the people of Venezuela and their fight for justice, freedom, and  democracy.   These are values that we hold so dearly in our country. We take it  for granted that we live in this great country where we can express our  thoughts in this wonderful republic, but in so many places in our very  own hemisphere, Mr. Speaker, they don't have that luxury.   Venezuelans have been deprived of these key values of justice,  freedom, and democracy for far too long, first at the grip of Hugo  Chavez, a failed socialist leader, and now with his handpicked  successor, another failure of a man and a leader, Nicolas Maduro.   The Maduro regime has hijacked all democratic institutions in  Venezuela. It has run the economy so far into the ground that there is  hardly any food or medicine or even basic necessities. Inflation is at  an all-time high and people cannot afford their daily life.   The economic situation is in turmoil. It is heading towards an even  deeper downward spiral because this regime of Nicolas Maduro is corrupt  and is incompetent and they only care about filling their own coffers  and staying in power, no matter what. All the while, the people of  Venezuela continue to suffer.   But this does not seem to trouble Maduro. It does not seem to trouble  his cronies. They are enriching themselves on the suffering of the  people of Venezuela. From this illicit activity, like drug trafficking  and corruption, they are filling their coffers.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Lewis of Minnesota). The time of the  gentlewoman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Florida.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, they are even using this humanitarian crisis that they  have created to defraud organizations that are looking to bring much- needed food into the country.   This resolution in front of us, Mr. Speaker, is bipartisan and  strong. It calls on the administration to support the people of  Venezuela, to continue to impose targeted sanctions on those  responsible for the destruction of democratic institutions in  Venezuela.   This resolution also urges important bodies, like the Organization of  American States--and we will have soon a new U.S. Ambassador to that  esteemed institution--to support the principles of the Inter-American  Democratic Charter. It demands a noncorrupt electoral council, as well  as calling for the release of all political prisoners.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. DeSantis for authoring this resolution. I  urge my colleagues to offer their strong support and to join us in  sending a unified message to Maduro that his actions will not be  allowed to continue without a strong U.S. response.   What is that response, Mr. Speaker?   I call on the administration to use more targeted sanctions. We have  sent to the administration a very long list of names. So have Senators  Rubio and Menendez. Mr. Sires, Mr. Royce, and Mr. Engel have joined me.   There are many more people, thugs and cronies of Maduro, who are  enriching themselves with the suffering of the Venezuelan people. They  want to come to the U.S. We should not extend that courtesy to them.  There are consequences to these acts. We will continue to pressure the  Maduro regime until democratic order is restored in Venezuela and this  grave humanitarian crisis is resolved once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Royce for the time. I thank Mr. Engel; my  friend, Mr. Acevedo; and Eric Jacobstein on the Democratic side for  their help with this resolution. I most especially thank the author of  this resolution, our great Congressman, Ron DeSantis.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me again thank Congressman DeSantis, Mr. Engel, and  Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen for their work on this resolution.   I think it is a heartbreaking situation what is going on in Venezuela  today. It is rather astounding that Venezuela sits on the world's  largest proven oil reserves, yet here we have a situation where its  citizens lack medicine and food at this time.    I think the recent report that 20 percent of the country's medical  professionals have fled Venezuela amid the Maduro regime's self- inflicted political, economic, and humanitarian crisis is indicative of  the problem. Inflation right now is reaching 720 percent.   Support of this resolution will send a strong unified message that  Congress stands with the Venezuelan people, that we call on regional  leaders and the entire international community to hold Maduro  accountable for this crisis and to release political prisoners and,  importantly, to hold elections immediately.   Mr. Speaker, I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in support,  and I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, we have before us two pieces of  legislation regarding the ongoing humanitarian and political crisis  that is occurring in the country of Venezuela, which has been reduced  to poverty and near starvation due to the repressive regime of Nicolas  Maduro and that of his dictatorial predecessor Hugo Chavez.   I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. DeSantis, for introducing H.  Res. 259, of which I am an original cosponsor, and to applaud Mr. Engel  for highlighting the public corruption and threat to democracy in  Venezuela via his H.R. 2658, the Venezuela Humanitarian Assistance and  Defense of Democratic Governance Act.   I also would like to single out the lead Republican cosponsor of that  legislation, the gentlewoman from Florida and my friend and colleague,  Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her work over the years in calling attention  to the deplorable human rights situation not only in Venezuela, but  also in Cuba, Nicaragua, China and so many countries the world over.   As Ileana understands so well, it is the ideology of the Left--be it  hard core Communism, or the Socialism of Hugo Chavez and  [[Page H9663]]  now that of his understudy in oppression, Nicolas Maduro--which has  brought suffering to so many people.   The people of Venezuela deserve far better.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules  and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 259, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
