 Mr. President, it is a great privilege of mine to  rise and honor the legacy of one of the most influential, generous, and  inspiring West Virginians I have ever had the pleasure of calling a  dear friend: William Gaston Caperton IIII. My friend Gaston turns 80  years young on February 21, 2020, and it is an honor to celebrate his  legacy with my fellow West Virginians.   It would be difficult to find anyone as knowledgeable or dedicated to  our home State as Gaston. The son of Eliza and William Gaston Caperton,  Jr., Gaston was born and raised with his sister, Cary, in our home  State's capital, Charleston. I have always said there is no greater  accomplishment in the world than to be in a position to give back to  the community you love, that made you who you are. That is what made  Gaston the wonderful, inspiring, and generous person he was. After  attending Episcopal High School in Alexandria, VA, and the University  of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Gaston returned home to join the  family business. Under his leadership, the McDonough-Caperton Insurance  Group became the 10th largest privately owned insurance brokerage firm  in the United States. Along the way, he owned and operated a bank and a  mortgage company.   The people of the home State that Gaston and I share have an  exceptional can-do spirit, a neighborly love that is unrelenting, and  are grounded by the same core principle: to help others be the best  they can be. That is Gaston's legacy as a public servant and as a  leader. After a successful business career in finance and insurance,  Gaston was elected as West Virginia's 31st Governor in 1988 and quickly  revolutionized West Virginia's education system. During the 8 years of  his administration, the average teacher salary went from 49th in the  Nation to 31st. He launched one of the country's earliest and most  comprehensive basic skills computer initiatives, as well as invested  more than $800 million into building, modernizing, and improving school  facilities throughout the State. He also conducted an aggressive  program of international trade missions to promote the export of West  Virginia products. Gaston's focus on investing in the future paid off,  adding almost 90,000 jobs between 1989 and 1997, lowering the  unemployment rate to its lowest level in 17 years, and increasing total  investment by new and expanded businesses by more than $3.9 billion.   Throughout the years, we bonded over our passion for public service,  for inspiring the next generation of leaders, and we share the common  goal of helping the rest of the country discover all that West Virginia  has to offer. Gaston left office in 1997 and spent 2 years teaching at  Harvard and Columbia Universities before becoming the eighth president  of the College Board in 1999. As president, he helped transform the  century-old institution into a mission-driven, student-first operation  promoting college success and opportunity for all Americans. During his  13 years of leadership, the College Board touched the lives of students  in nearly 27,000 high schools and colleges, promoted the importance of  writing by adding a writing section to the SAT. and doubled the number  of students succeeding in Advanced Placement. Gaston's leadership also  renewed the organization's focus on education in a globalized  marketplace by initiating a new series of AP world language and culture  course, as well as embarking on a historic education exchange program  with China.   During his more than 20 years in government and education, Gaston  chaired the Democratic Governor's Association and the Southern Regional  Education Board, participated in the executive committee of the  National Governors Association, received 10 honorary doctoral degrees,  and has been presented with numerous awards, including the 1996  Computerworld Smithsonian Award for his tireless efforts to introduce  technology into the classroom, the 2007 James Bryant Conant Award for  his significant contributions to the quality of education in the United  States and the 2012 Policy Maker of the Year by the National  Association of School Boards of Education.   After retiring from the College Board in 2012, Gaston moved back to  his hometown and served on the board of directors of a variety of U.S.  corporations. He has two sons, Gat and John, and is the proud  grandfather of Eliza, Katie, Evie, Ella, and Genavieve.   I can't speak enough to what a good-hearted, wonderful person he  truly is. I always think of Gaston as true renaissance man; no matter  the circumstances, he kept a cool head and a warm demeanor, always able  to discern the most honorable path forward. He has always been one of  West Virginia's most proud representatives, no matter where life has  taken him. Again, it is a privilege to join the people of the Mountain  State in celebrating Gaston Caperton's life and legacy and to wish him  a very happy 80th birthday.                            ____________________
