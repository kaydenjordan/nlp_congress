 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to commend and welcome  President Trump to California, where, amongst other things, he is  looking at the technology with which to control our borders, an  obligation we have as a State, but more so as a country whose  jurisdiction it is.   We welcome legal immigration to our State and to our country, not  illegal immigration or the other euphemisms that are used, undocumented  immigrants, what have you.   Indeed, if we don't have borders, we don't really have a nation. So  let's get cracking on controlling our borders and having a legal  immigration process. It is better for the immigrants, it is better for  the security of our Nation, and it is better for its people. That is  all it is about. It is really that simple.                            ____________________
