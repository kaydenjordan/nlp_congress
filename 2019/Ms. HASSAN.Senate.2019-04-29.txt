 Mr. President, when his son was deployed to Iraq  in 2003, Thaddeus Luszey, Jr., and his wife Deborah of Hudson, NH,  began sending him care packages. Now, more than 10 years later, that  simple act has turned into a nonprofit organization called Operation  Care for Troops. Operation Care for Troops has sent nearly 110,000  packages to deployed servicemembers, providing them a friendly reminder  from home that they are not forgotten. For his dedication to supporting  the brave servicemembers who sacrifice so much so that the rest of us  may live in freedom and security, I am proud to recognize Thaddeus as  the April 2019 Granite Stater of the Month.   Thaddeus comes from a military family; his mother, father, and son  are all veterans. When his son was deployed in Iraq, Thaddeus sat down  with a friend over lunch who was also sending care packages overseas to  deployed servicemembers, and an idea was born: They would work together  to reach even more servicemembers. What started as friends, family, and  neighbors in garages putting together care packages has transformed  into a full-fledged organization with hundreds of volunteers. Operation  Care for Troops sends over a thousand packages four times a year,  including 3,000 stockings to troops over the holidays. Operation Care  for Troops also makes sure that servicemembers know that the people of  New Hampshire have them in their thoughts. Each package contains three  or four cards from schoolchildren and community members, ensuring that  no one goes without mail.   The organization does this all with the support of hundreds of  community volunteers and businesses who help supply and fill the  packages, a true embodiment of New Hampshire's all-hands-on-deck  spirit.   For these efforts, I am proud to recognize Thaddeus Luszey, Jr., as  the April 2019 Granite Stater of the Month.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the  impressive work of two Granite Staters, CSM (Retired) Michael Rice and  Kathy Rice.   Throughout his service in the New Hampshire National Guard, Mike and  his wife Kathy worked to ensure that servicemembers and their families  were well supported. Mike and Kathy were strong advocates for the men  and women of the New Hampshire National Guard, championing training and  support for the well-being of the soldiers and airmen and women. Their  knowledge of the military and the systems available to assist troops  and their families was an invaluable resource many relied on.   Following Mike's retirement in 2006, Mike and Kathy have continued  their service through countless volunteer endeavors, particularly in  helping veterans find employment. They worked as part of the employer  support to the Guard and Reserve and as transition assistance advisers,  dedicating their time and ensuring that our veterans have the resources  they need to succeed. They have also earned State and national  recognition for their work, including receiving the Association of the  United States Army's Mary G. Roebling Award for Distinguished Service.   Mike and Kathy attend every deployment and redeployment ceremony and  work tirelessly to provide baked goods, information for troops and  their families, and help to ensure that veterans receive the services  they have earned.   I thank Mike and Kathy for their service to veterans, military  families, and our country. Their selfless hard work honors those  Granite Staters who fought for the cause of freedom and for the  protection of our democracy and has truly made a difference in the  lives of so many.   I hope you will join me in honoring dedicated Granite Staters Mike  and Kathy Rice.                            ____________________
