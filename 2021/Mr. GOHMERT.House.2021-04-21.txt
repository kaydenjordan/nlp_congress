 Madam Speaker, I know it seems compassionate to those  who support this bill to say we want to give this young child whose  parents sent them up by themselves, give them a lawyer, help them out.   But the consequences for those of us that have spent a lot of time on  the border are very clear. It means, if you make this law, that the  representatives of the drug cartels, which are often gang members, they  can tell the parents, Look, I know it is a tough decision whether to  send your child alone, this little 3-, 5-, 8-year-old child up by  themselves, but the good news is that there are people in Congress that  have fought for and have gotten you a lawyer at the border for your  child.   So with the drug cartels, the truth is this child will likely be an  indentured servant for many years, either drug trade or sex traffic,  but they are going to be owned by the drug cartel, as far as what they  get to do in their freedom. This is not something we should be doing,  adding more to lure more unaccompanied children up to our border. We  are already in crisis mode.   As all of the Border Patrol that I have talked to over the years  explained, they are basically working now for the drug cartels. As they  have said, we are the logistics for the drug cartels. The cartels send  them up, get them to the border, and then we ship them wherever the  cartels want us to send them.   This is not as compassionate as it may seem. This is going to damage  millions of people.
