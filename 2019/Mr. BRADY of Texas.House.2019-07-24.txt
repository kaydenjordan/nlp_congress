 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 397, which is truly  unfortunate because I know the authors' goals here are very well- intended.   I have worked as a meatpacker; I have worked as a sheet metal worker;  and I have worked construction. I know how hard these union families  work, both for their wages and for their retirement.   It is why Republicans and Democrats agree we are in a multiemployer  pension crisis. When there are over 1.3 million workers covered by  these union-managed plans whose pensions are set to be drained entirely  over the next decade, that is a crisis. These figures only scratch the  surface. If we are to look at the bigger picture of every union-managed  pension, less than half the promises made by trustees to these union  workers are actually funded--less than half.   To put it simply, there is $638 billion promised to workers'  retirement that is absolutely imaginary. That is wrong.   This bill, I think, doubles down on the worst aspects of the pension  system that have these workers in a pickle today.                                time  1745    Congress has tried to kick the can down the road before. In 2006,  Congress waived the required contributions for plans that said: We just  can't make the contributions.   And what happened? Things got worse for the workers.   2007, plans were $193 billion underfunded. A couple years ago, it had  tripled. They were three times worse off.   PBGC--they are the Federal insurer of these plans--went from a  deficit of $739 million; their deficit increased seventyfold. That is  even worse for the workers.   So rather than continuing the status quo in today's partisan  exercise--and just be honest. Having nine Republicans does not make  this a bipartisan bill. And we already know, unfortunately, because it  is one party, this bill is dead on arrival in the Senate. Democrats  acknowledge it. Republicans do. Even some of the unions do.   That is why I think a solution needs to happen this year, getting it  to the President's desk so we say: Let's find a bipartisan solution to  offer certainty, stability, and accountability and save these union- managed plans.   We ought to be working together to ensure that the plans can make  good on their promises to our union workers. This means eliminating the  various gimmicks some of these plans are allowed to use.   Plans have to accurately measure their pension promises in a way  similar to insurance companies making those same promises. For example,  I don't understand: Why are promises to unions worth only one-third of  the pension promises made to workers who are working for a single  company? Aren't union workers just as important, and aren't those  promises just as important for them as other workers?   Equally important, we have folks on accountability. A promise is a  promise, and companies need to be on the hook for every pension promise  they made to their workers. And so, by the way, do the trustees.   Why do we allow the same people to operate the same way and leave the  same union workers behind? What sense does that make?   And, finally, one of the reasons we oppose this bill is we need to  prevent the severely underfunded plans from digging themselves even  deeper in the hole under the guise of protecting workers. We have to  wall off the contributions that fund these new promises that we know  will be broken instead of perpetuating what now is sort of a Ponzi  scheme: Retirees are paid out of the contributions that are supposed to  fund benefits to younger workers. That is double counting, and that is  what gets people in trouble.   I believe our union workers deserve better. The companies in these  plans deserve better.   This bill doesn't make these plans more stable. It doesn't end  underfunding. It doesn't make them secure for the long term. And our  biggest worry as Republicans, it doesn't solve the problem. So these  same workers, years down the road, are going to be in the same problem.  We haven't helped them.   I think our workers deserve better, which is why I strongly urge all  my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.   I give my commitment for the Ways and Means Republicans to work with  you, Mr. Chairman, to find a real solution. Our workers really do  deserve this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
