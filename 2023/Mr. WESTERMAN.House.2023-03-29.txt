 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Boebert amendment No. 127. One of  the  [[Page H1603]]  main goals of the Lower Energy Costs Act is to create certainty in the  Federal permitting process for those looking to invest in and build  projects that will power our future.   Litigation is one of the main drivers of the uncertainty and delays  associated with the NEPA process that holds back critical energy and  infrastructure projects. This amendment revises the time frame within  which a claimant can file a lawsuit seeking review of a permit,  license, or approval issued by a Federal agency for a major  infrastructure project, such as a highway project, from 150 to 90 days.   The purpose is to allow critical infrastructure projects to proceed  more efficiently without the prolonged threat of a lawsuit that could  delay or halt these essential transportation projects.   This amendment still allows a potential claimant a reasonable time  frame of 3 months to file a lawsuit and does not impact environmental  protections.   I support this amendment and encourage my colleagues to support its  inclusion in the bill.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. We have spoken  about the link between hard rock minerals and national security today,  but there is one resource highlighted by this amendment that must be  discussed, and that is uranium.  [[Page H1605]]    Domestic uranium is essential for national security, given its role  in nuclear deterrence and empowering the Naval Nuclear Propulsion  Program.   Uranium also supports the United States biomedical community because  it is vital to the production of medical isotopes.   As the gentleman has pointed out, the majority of our uranium supply  comes from Russia and former Soviet Bloc countries, unfortunately.   We have ample deposits of uranium here in the United States. We just  have to mine it and process it, and we need to use more of it to create  more nuclear power.   I thank the gentleman for bringing this amendment. I support it.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Madam Chair, I oppose this unnecessary amendment as it  would strike a provision in the bill that reinforces current law and  requires the Bureau of Land Management to resolve protests to oil and  gas lease sales within 60 days of payment by the winning bidder.   This amendment proposes a standard of accountability for Federal  agencies that is worse than the status quo. In current practice, the  BLM resolves most protests before lease sales even occur.   For example, when the BLM's New Mexico State office received formal  protests for their June 30, 2022, oil and gas lease sale, BLM was able  to review and respond to the protests by June 29, completing the  process in 42 days and before the sale even occurred.   Once a lease is bid on and won, current law requires leases to be  issued within 60 days following payment by the successful bidder.   This amendment strikes a good governance provision that does nothing  more than reaffirms current law.   Just yesterday, DOI Secretary Deb Haaland testified before the House  Appropriations Committee where she stated: ``Energy independence is a  priority to President Biden.''   If energy independence is a priority to President Biden, then House  Democrats should not be taking our Nation backward. Let's not undo  current law that is actually working.   For those reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I encourage my  colleagues to join me in opposition.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Madam Chair, I encourage opposition to this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise as the designee of the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. Feenstra), and I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in strong support of this  amendment. This amendment will prohibit the Communist Party of China  [[Page H1606]]  from acquiring any interest in American farmland or lands used for  American renewable energy production.   China has been aggressively acquiring foreign agricultural and energy  assets around the world, and the United States has not been immune to  this trend. Our country's food security and energy independence are at  stake, and we must take action to protect our critical resources.   In 2013, a Chinese company purchased 300 acres of farmland in North  Dakota. This acquisition caused concern among farmers and policymakers  in North Dakota and beyond.   This amendment directly addresses these concerns by prohibiting the  Communist Party of China, or any person acting on its behalf, from  acquiring any interest in American farmland or lands used for American  energy production.   It is crucial that we learn from past experiences and take necessary  measures to protect our domestic resources and ensure our food security  and energy independence.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and join  me in protecting our critical resources, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources.    Madam Chair, again, I support this amendment by the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Feenstra), and I encourage my colleagues to  support it.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  [[Page H1607]]  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Madam Chair, this amendment would require the  Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of Commerce to determine  the technological needs for their respective permitting programs and  report those needs to Congress annually.   The permitting process can be a significant barrier to economic  development and innovation in our country, made even worse if outdated  technology and bureaucratic inefficiencies are hindering the process.   While far from a total solution to our Nation's permitting woes,  identifying technological deficiencies that contribute to  inefficiencies could help Congress prioritize scarce resources to  modernize the permitting process.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise as the designee of the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. James), and I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. It is well known by  now that foreign nations, China in particular, are dominating global  supply chains for hardrock minerals like copper, nickel, lithium, and  dozens of others.   China's overwhelming presence in the minerals marketplace is not due  to an inherent advantage in mineral reserves but instead is the result  of a decades-long strategy to take control of dozens of commodities,  from mining to manufacturing.   For instance, China's ``go global'' strategy, which began in the  1990s, included $390 billion in outbound direct investments in the  mining sector.   Today, China is the primary global supplier of cobalt for batteries,  despite having very limited domestic reserves, through its aggressive  investment and processing capacity and foreign direct investment in  mines around the world.   China also has billions invested in nickel projects in Indonesia,  home to one-quarter of overall global reserves.   Nickel and cobalt are only two out of dozens of minerals that will  see surging demand in the coming years. Examples of China's mineral  dominance go on and on.   Just yesterday, DOI Secretary Haaland testified before the House  Appropriations Committee, where she agreed that electric vehicles and  renewables deepen our dependence on China. Congressman Reschenthaler  specifically asked Secretary Haaland if electric vehicles and  renewables deepen our dependence on China, and she replied yes.   We must not put China over America. We must return our Nation to  energy independence. H.R. 1 combats the crisis of Chinese control of  the global mineral supply chain.   My colleague's amendment is a great addition to H.R. 1. The amendment  directs the U.S. Geological Survey and the Departments of Defense,  Energy, and State to identify the mineral supply chains needed for  military, defense, and national security purposes that are at greatest  risk of disruption because of China.   Once identified, the administration must develop a strategy to bring  these supply chains back to the United States, including through  bolstering U.S. domestic mining, refining, processing, and  manufacturing.   This amendment speaks to the core of the bill under consideration  today, the need to increase the domestic production of energy and  minerals, a critical part of maintaining our national security.   I support this amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in  supporting its inclusion in the package.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).  [[Page H1608]]         Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. The  provisions of this bill, such as Representative Graves' BUILDER Act,  would streamline the inefficient and costly NEPA process. It is costly  in more than just dollars. It is costly to our environment. It is  costly in human lives.   As the gentleman explained, we can do better managing our forests.  When we keep these forests healthy, we are protecting human life. We  are protecting property. We are also protecting the very, very thing  that does more to support and help the environment than anything else,  and it is our forest.   It is a tragedy that we send up so much of our forest in smoke. This  NEPA process, although it is streamlining, will help to produce more  domestic energy. It will also help to build infrastructure. It will  help to take care of our national forest and Federal lands.   Madam Chair, this is a good amendment. I support it, and I encourage  others to support it.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman not only for  yielding me time but for bringing another commonsense and good  amendment that makes H.R. 1 even a better bill.   As he mentioned, similar provisions were enacted in 2018 to allow  electric transmission or distribution facility operators to remove  hazard trees that can threaten infrastructure and start a catastrophic  wildfire. That is what this amendment was built on.   Madam Chair, I have been to California. I have been to South Lake  Tahoe. I have seen the efforts and the fruits of the labor in the field  from the work of my colleague from California (Mr. LaMalfa) and our  colleague Mr. McClintock, who worked so hard to be able to get this  provision in previous legislation.   This has been used to thin the timber on power lines. Actually, these  provisions have helped stop wildfires from spreading. This works. This  should be added to, and we should be doing it everywhere we can to  prevent these catastrophic wildfires like the folks in California and  other parts of the West see all too often.   Madam Chair, I support this amendment, and I encourage everyone else  to support it.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment requires local units of  the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, and Forest  Service to open job positions related to permitting or natural  resources, including at local high schools, community colleges,  universities, and other institutions.   Madam Chair, I just have to commend the gentlewoman's district. I was  recently in the town of Hobbs, New Mexico, and I got to visit an  amazing facility called CTECH that is used to educate future workers in  that area. I have seen a lot of career and technical education  facilities, and this one is second to none.   It was funded by the industry in the oil and gas business. They gave  back to the community and built this remarkable facility. I believe  they said over 1,000 high school students per year are using this  facility. These are the places that are educating these future workers,  and these jobs should be advertised there.   We have heard from multiple sectors, including in the energy, mining,  and renewable energy spaces, about the permitting challenges they face,  and those challenges are magnified by a lack of sufficient qualified  personnel in State and local land management offices.   This amendment tasks the administration with performing outreach to  local schools and other institutions to help fill open positions in  their local offices.   While it is far from a total solution to the permitting challenges in  our country, this amendment could help improve permitting backlogs and  provide employment opportunities at the local level, including in rural  areas.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for her amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment, which would  strike provisions in the bill to incentivize responsible domestic  energy production, create jobs, and reduce energy costs for American  families.   This amendment would preserve the higher royalty rates for oil and  gas on Federal lands and waters that were just recently raised by my  colleagues across the aisle.   Democrat talking points ignore the reality of what it takes to  produce energy on Federal lands, while at the same time advocating for  increased royalties that will be passed on to consumers in the form of  higher energy costs.   The House Natural Resources Committee held a field hearing for H.R. 1  last month where we heard directly from operators that produce on  Federal, State, and private lands. Unfortunately, none of our Democrat  colleagues came with us to participate in that hearing or they would  have heard the facts.   It takes less than a week to obtain a drilling permit from the States  of Texas or New Mexico, and it takes over 180 days to obtain a permit  from the BLM. That is just one drilling permit. Operators sometimes  need 30 to 50 permits and right-of-ways from a Federal agency to  develop a project on Federal lands.   It is these delays and inefficiencies that demonstrate why the  royalty rate should be lower on Federal lands. The simple truth is, the  lower the royalty rate, the more interest there will be in energy  production, the greater our Nation's energy security, and the cheaper  energy process will be for all Americans. The Democrats know this.   Earlier this month, the Biden administration confirmed this fact in a  leaked Bureau of Ocean Energy Management memo on Cook Inlet lease sale  258. Their own memo noted that a lower ``16\2/3\ percent royalty may be  more likely to facilitate expeditious and orderly development of OCS  resources and potentially offer greater energy security to residents of  the State of Alaska.'' That was from the Biden BOEM administration.   Madam Chair, because I believe in promoting American energy security  and reducing our reliance on foreign adversaries for energy and mineral  resources that we should be producing here in America, I oppose this  amendment.   Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to join me in opposition, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to oppose this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, as much as I appreciate Mr. Levin and his  real sincerity and work on the committee, on this bill, and his  expertise in this area, I must oppose this amendment tonight and hope  to work with him on some additional legislation in the future.   This amendment would strike all of the provisions in division B that  increase domestic energy production and reduce energy costs for  American families. This amendment prevents division B from going into  effect until all of the Federal agencies impacted certify that they  have adequate funding and staffing to meet the timelines in the bill.   In response, I ask a simple question: When has a Federal bureaucracy  ever felt it has enough staff on its payroll or enough taxpayer dollars  to spend in its budget?   The answer is never, at least not as long as I have been in Congress  and I have talked to Federal agencies.   Even with the spending push by the Democrats in the so-called  Inflation Reduction Act--they have stated several times during the  debate on H.R. 1 that they have put a billion dollars out there to  speed up permitting--these Federal agencies are still asking for more  money and more staff, and permitting timelines are still ballooning.   Why?   Because the issue is not an issue of staffing or budget alone. The  underlying statutes and the processes are broken, and they must be  fixed. That is what H.R. 1 does. It addresses the underlying issues,  and it will expedite permitting for all kinds of projects.   This messaging amendment would prevent meaningful reforms in the name  of growing the Federal bureaucracy. For these reasons, I oppose this  amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in opposition.   Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Madam Chair, I urge opposition to this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  also thank her as a freshman Member for her proactive work on the  committee.   Representative Luna's amendment requires the Comptroller General to  have a report on all potential adverse effects of wind energy  development in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the South Atlantic, and the  Straits of Florida planning areas.   Until this report is published, the Secretary of the Interior is  prohibited from publishing a notice or holding a lease sale for wind  energy developments in the area.   As she stated, the report must evaluate the potential impacts of wind  energy development on military readiness and training activities, on  the marine environment, ecology and tourism, including the economic  impacts on communities adjacent to the planning areas.   We cannot compromise our military readiness and training activities,  which are crucial for national security.   By requiring a Comptroller General report, we can make informed  decisions about the potential impacts of wind energy development on our  national security, marine environment, and local economies.   Therefore, I support this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote in  favor of it.    Madam Chair, I again thank the gentlewoman from  Florida for yielding time.   I rise in support of this amendment. The renewable energy sector is a  rapidly growing part of our Nation's energy mix.   We have seen positive growth in wind energy and we hope to see it  evolve into a subsector of American energy exports one day.   To achieve this goal, we need to promote the development of a strong  domestic supply chain for wind infrastructure.   This amendment is a constructive step in that direction and expresses  the sense of Congress that we should develop our own domestic supply  chains rather than import critical components from China.   This amendment aims to prioritize the development of related  industries through port upgrades, cable manufacturing, and hiring of  vessels and crews for wind energy operations in the United States.   By promoting domestic production and expanding our supply chain, we  can create jobs, enhance our energy security, and strengthen our  economy.   Representative Luna's amendment will not only support our energy  goals but also promote economic prosperity.   I support this amendment as this policy is a positive step toward the  development of a strong and secure domestic supply chain for wind  infrastructure. I also encourage my colleagues to support this  amendment.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. Lee  of Florida) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Kim of California, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 1) to lower energy costs by increasing American energy  production, exports, infrastructure, and critical minerals processing,  by promoting transparency, accountability, permitting, and production  of American resources, and by improving water quality certification and  energy projects, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution  thereon.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
