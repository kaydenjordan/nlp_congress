 Mr. President, when I look back at the 8 years I have  been in the Senate, I can think of a lot of things I like about this  job. I have really gotten to know staff on both sides of the aisle, a  lot of Members on both sides of the aisle, being coached more than once  by Elizabeth and Leigh on parliamentary procedure and rules of the  Senate--those are all things I like about the Senate. But every year on  this day, there is one thing I don't like about the Senate, and that is  because 2 out of the last 10 years, Senate business has brought me here  instead of being home with my wife on Valentine's Day.   Mr. President, my wife and I have been married for 36 years, and our  first two babies--our two babies were born in Atlanta, GA, the  Presiding Officer's great State. My wife Susan has been my valentine  for 36 years, and I am away from her once again.   So if it wasn't a violation of the rules, I would pick up a sign just  like this that says ``I love my wife, and I wish her a happy  Valentine's Day,'' but that is against the rules, so I am not going to  do that. Instead, I am going to say: Susan Tillis, I love you, and  thank you for 36 great years.   Thank you, Mr. President.
