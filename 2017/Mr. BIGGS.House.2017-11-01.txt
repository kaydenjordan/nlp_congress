 Mr. Speaker, every November we commemorate Native American  Heritage Month. I am honored to share a long-standing partnership with  Indian Tribes located in Arizona and across the United States. This  includes our most recent efforts to extend the AMBER Alert program to  Indian Country, which will ensure that every family in Indian Country  is afforded the same resources to find a missing child.   Today I am especially grateful to recognize the valiant service of  Native American U.S. Marines during the Iwo Jima campaign:   Ira Hayes, a member of the Gila River Pima Indian community, is most  notably remembered as one of the servicemen who raised the American  flag over Mount Suribachi.   The Navajo Code Talkers were also irreplaceable during World War II.  The  [[Page H8309]]  Code Talkers effectively transmitted combat messages across enemy lines  to avoid interception and decryption.   Major Howard Connor said it best: ``Were it not for the Navajos, the  Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.''   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to highlight their contributions to  Arizona and the United States.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Arizona?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I am here this evening, along with my friend  and colleague, Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, as we advocate for the  passage of the Right to Try Act. This bill, which we introduced  together, has dozens of bipartisan cosponsors, including Members here  tonight.   We are both supportive of Senator Ron Johnson's efforts to champion  Right to Try in the Senate. He has been a tireless advocate of Right to  Try for years, and his bill has already passed the Senate with  unanimous consent. If you are watching the Senate very closely, you  will know that nothing comes out of there, and certainly nothing with  unanimous consent; so that tells how strong the sentiment is in favor  of this bill.   Our legislation allows terminally ill patients who have no further  options left--I repeat that, no further options left--the opportunity  to try experimental drugs that could save their own lives.   Yes, there are also provisions in our bill to protect both the  patients, as well as the pharmaceutical companies who want to  participate, but those provisions are secondary to the primary purpose  of this legislation. The primary purpose of the Right to Try Act is to  give brave patients across this country some choice over their own  destinies, when all other avenues are gone.   We want to give hope to these Americans, and we should all share that  same goal of doing everything we can for patients fighting to save  their lives. This policy has significant bipartisan support. The Trump  administration strongly supports Right to Try, and President Trump has  indicated he would likely sign this bill into law.   Time is of the essence, for time is one thing a terminally ill  patient does not have. And the status quo is not the answer. The FDA  and other agency officials claim that their own expanded access program  is working and continues to improve. There may be some truth to that,  but the program is simply not enough; and I know that because I have  talked to dozens and dozens of patients, family members, and advocates  who tell me it is not enough. They come to my office, they call me on  the phone, they write me impassioned letters.   These same advocates have ensured that Right to Try has become law in  38 States. Think about that for a moment. With one more State, you  could actually ratify a Constitutional amendment. And in half of those  38 States, Right to Try laws passed with unanimous support. In my home  State of Arizona, voters approved that initiative by 80 percent of the  popular vote.   At a time when pundits are claiming that our politics are broken, and  Republicans and Democrats can't come together on anything, here is a  cause that Americans of all political stripes can unite in.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Fitzpatrick; I appreciate all  that he has done and continues to do in this cause, this important  cause. He is a great leader in this, and I am grateful for all of his  effort here.   At this point, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for his  impassioned speech, his position, his comments regarding the bill, and  his desire to see it altered, but I do appreciate his support of the  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I am certainly grateful to have this opportunity to  yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Smucker; I appreciate his  comments and his willingness to participate this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Smucker; I appreciate his  comments and his willingness to participate this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues who have joined  us tonight to champion the cause and inquire how much time I have  remaining.  [[Page H8383]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Arizona has 15 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to mention how I came to  really be converted to the cause of right to try.   I served in the Arizona State Legislature with Laura Knaperek, who  was also serving in the legislature when I first met her. By 2014, she  was no longer serving in the State legislature. She was an advocate.  That year, Laura was in the fight of her life against ovarian cancer,  and her mission was to see right-to-try legislation passed into law.   In the end, her efforts for this cause succeeded beyond everyone's  wildest expectations when 80 percent of the electorate in Arizona voted  to enact right to try. But, unfortunately, Laura is not with us because  she lost her brave battle with cancer last year. Her legacy as a  tireless patient advocate lives on.   I will continue to carry on the fight not just for Laura Knaperek,  but for all those patients across this country who are battling against  the odds every day.   I am joined by those who are here tonight, those who have cosponsored  this bill, and many other advocacy groups, such as the Goldwater  Institute in Arizona that continues to fight for this.   I fight for Bertrand Might. Bertrand is a very special little boy. He  was the first person ever to be diagnosed with a rare, fatal genetic  disorder called NGLY1 that has left this 7-year-old paralyzed. Because  the disease was only identified by scientists in 2012 and only a few  people worldwide have been diagnosed with it, there is no cure and no  treatment available. Because the disorder is so rare, a drug may never  be developed to treat it.   But scientists have found that Bertrand responds to certain  investigational therapies. So Bertrand's family will have to rely on  trying those new investigational medications as long as they have  access to them. That is why we need this right-to-try legislation.   I fight for Jordan McLinn. Seven-year-old Jordan says he wants to  grow up to be a firefighter so he can save lives. He has Duchenne  muscular dystrophy, which could leave him paralyzed within 5 years and  shortens his life expectancy to only 20 years. There is a drug now  being used in clinical trials that is helping young people like Jordan,  but it could take another 7 years for that drug to be available on the  market. His parents cannot afford to wait for the FDA to give that drug  its final approval. He could be in a wheelchair by then. This  investigational drug could add years to Jordan's life, which would give  him the chance to save others.   We have already heard, when Representative Fitzpatrick discussed Matt  Bellina, his needs and his advocacy. We fight for him, and we fight for  Mikaela Knapp.   At 24, Mikaela was diagnosed with a deadly form of kidney cancer that  had already migrated into her bones before she even knew she was sick.  She went through every known treatment in a matter of months and  nothing worked. Her high school sweetheart, Keith, heard about a drug  under development that was successfully treating people with this same  cancer, but Mikaela was not allowed to enroll in the clinical trial.  Mikaela and Keith launched a social media campaign to try to get access  to the drug, but it wasn't enough. The FDA didn't help.    Mikaela died on April 24, 2014. Five months later, on September 4,  the FDA gave final approval to the drug that might have saved her.   I fight for Diego Morris. When he was 10 years old, Diego woke up  with a sore leg that his mom thought was just another sports injury,  but the pain didn't go away. They knew something was wrong, but they  never expected osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer.   After exhausting all treatments available, Diego's doctors  recommended he try mifamurtide, which wasn't available in the United  States but was being safely used and had been given the Prix Galien  Award, the gold medal for pharmaceutical development in England. The  Morris family wasted no time and made the move abroad to try to save  Diego's life. The treatments worked. Now Diego is back home in Phoenix  and back to playing his favorite sports.   We fight unitedly for the countless other patients who deserve a  right to try. We must act without further delay. Again, I thank those  who have been here to testify tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 14 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, November 2, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
