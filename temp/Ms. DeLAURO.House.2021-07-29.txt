This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Security       Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the Senate amendment to H.R. 3237  currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  but far too much time has been consumed already.   Mr. Speaker, 204 days ago, this building, this very Chamber, was  brutally attacked. A mob of violent insurrectionists invaded our  Capitol, hellbent on stopping the peaceful transfer of power.   For the first time in over two centuries, the temple of our democracy  was defiled and damaged.   The brave men and women of our Capitol Police protected us. Since  that fateful day, they have continued to work day in and day out, with  only the barest minimum of support. They have soldiered on with  physical, mental, and emotional trauma and have sacrificed their own  needs and those of their families for the safety and security of our  democracy. We need to respect their service.   The legislation the House passed 2 months ago was a very strong bill  that met the needs of the Capitol Police, who were so brutally  attacked, and the National Guard, who bravely responded. I am pleased  that the Senate amendment largely leaves those provisions intact, which  is why we are bringing it to the floor today.   However, the Senate bill falls short of what we need in key areas. It  does not include resources to prosecute the terrorists who attacked our  government, and it does not have enough funding to secure the Capitol  for the long term.   These needs will not disappear. As we pass this bill today, we know  that we are not finished, and we are committed to filling in the gaps  the Senate amendment has left.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not perfect, but time is running short, and  the immediate needs are dire.   In those harrowing moments of January 6, the men and women of the  Capitol Police protected us. They said yes. Now, we must protect them.  We must say yes. Vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
