 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when  the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 11 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr.  Lucy Greene for being awarded the Defense Community Champion Award by  the Valdosta-Lowndes Chamber of Commerce.   Dr. Greene has spent her entire career giving back to the community  and our education system.   After serving for 31 years as an educator, she became a strong  advocate in the fight to keep Moody Air Force Base open. Dr. Greene was  instrumental in successfully advocating for the base to remain open.   For her hard work, she was awarded the Defense Community Champion  [[Page H801]]  Award by the Valdosta-Lowndes Chamber of Commerce.   She also devoted her time to the Moody support group for Moody Air  Force Base in 1991, where her husband, Parker, was named executive  director.   I commend Dr. Lucy Greene for her tireless efforts as an educator and  advocate for our Nation's servicemen and -women.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Greene for everything she does.                            ____________________
