 Mr. Speaker, I rise again today to decry the majority's  war on the poor, especially those women who get up every single day and  struggle as mothers, often are caretakers for elderly parents, who are  juggling two and three minimum wage jobs at $7.25 an hour to take care  of their families, and then being told that they are welfare cheats  because they need assistance from programs like the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program in order to meet basic food needs. The  last time I checked, Mr. Speaker, food was not a luxury, but a basic  life necessity.   In a few weeks, this House will take up a bill which has been  designated H.R. 2, an enumeration which reflects the majority's  priorities. Now, as you recall, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1 was reserved for  the over $1 trillion tax giveaway we gave to corporations and to the  wealthy. And as has been noted earlier in our morning hour, we are  facing a sovereign debt crisis because that bill will thrust us into  trillions of dollars of debt in the future.   So what does H.R. 2 do?   H.R. 2 makes very harmful changes to the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program, cutting $23 billion in funding, reducing  eligibility, and to generate resentment against the poor so that these  draconian cuts will be tolerated by the public. After all, we have to  pay for H.R. 1 some kind of way, so H.R. 2 is the solution. The  numerous ideological and unproven policies that simply stigmatize and  punish the poor are what constitutes H.R. 2, along with the $23 billion  cut.   Now, just let me say, Mr. Speaker, I want to remind you that the  majority of SNAP participants are children, seniors, and people with  disabilities. These are individuals who will not be part of any  workforce. No matter how mean-spirited you decide to be, Mr. Speaker,  and no matter how many of these ill-advised work policies you put in  place, a 7-year-old cannot work; someone disabled cannot work; someone  68, 69 years old may not be able to find a job that an employer will  provide for them.   And of the rest of those who receive SNAP, let's talk about the  facts. More than half of SNAP households have at least one working age  disabled adult in it while receiving SNAP. More than 80 percent work in  the year before or after receiving SNAP. Work rates are even higher for  families with children where more than 60 percent work. Work, Mr.  Speaker, while receiving SNAP.   Yet, we have H.R. 2, which requires work requirements. And yet, we  talk about how to extend and make the  [[Page H3584]]  safety net better for farmers in our farm bill. But here comes more  proposals to restrict eligibility, reduce benefits, cap or reduce  funding, and alter SNAP's core purpose--to help struggling Americans  when tough times hit--and tough times are right now, Mr. Speaker.   The fact is that for low-income families, every single dollar counts,  no matter where these families live. If they are urban families, they  are rural families, tens of millions of Americans who are old and  young, hunger sees no gender, race, religion, or culture. And, Mr.  Speaker, there are hungry Republicans as well.   I just want to send a reality check to our colleagues who are running  around the country praising their tax cuts for the wealthy. Poverty and  joblessness remains a stark reality in our country, and the populations  that have the highest levels of poverty and unemployment, including  older Americans, are the ones most affected. Punishing disadvantaged  families will not break the grip of poverty.   Mr. Speaker, I urge us to reject these cuts.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 4  to ensure that the FAA is helping businesses that have been  historically discriminated against when it comes to government  contracting. And I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their  support.   Adoption of my amendment is a good start, but much more needs to be  done to address discrimination and related barriers that still exist.  This includes addressing the exclusion of any Federal DBE participation  requirements or goals for Passenger Facility Charge-funded projects. It  is critical that we don't miss the opportunity to address these  barriers.    I want to remind everyone that billions of dollars of transportation  contracts are at stake in this reauthorization. And for businesses that  have been historically discriminated against in transportation  contracting, they just want a chance to compete for these dollars.   In this reauthorization, Congress must continue to ensure that  qualified minority and women-owned businesses in every congressional  district can fairly compete for work.
