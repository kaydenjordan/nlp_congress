 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from California  for his leadership, especially in bringing before us the Protecting the  Right to Organize Act of 2019.   Right now, in my home State, the Virginia General Assembly is engaged  in a big debate about whether to repeal the right-to-work laws that  have dominated our State for so many years, a repeal I have long  supported.   That is why, today, I am proud to stand with my good friend and  fellow Virginian, Chairman  Bobby Scott, in supporting this bill, the  Protecting the Right to Organize Act.   Unions have been the backbone of a just and equitable economy. Their  hard work gave us the 5-day workweek. Their hard work gave us safer  working conditions. Their hard work helps deliver fair wages and better  access to healthcare. But this isn't just an economic issue. It is also  a question of civil rights. Society itself is freer when workers are  empowered to band together and negotiate for better pay, benefits, and  working conditions.   I might say, even in those States that are not right-to-work States,  it is hard to organize, but when you impose a right-to-work law, then  you have really stacked the odds in the ability of working men and  women to organize themselves.   This is Black History Month, and I am reminded of these words from  Dr. Martin Luther King: ``In our glorious fight for civil rights, we  must guard against being fooled by false slogans, such as `right-to- work.' . . . Wherever these laws have been passed, wages are lower, job  opportunities are fewer, and there are no civil rights. We do not  intend to let them do this to us. We demand this fraud be stopped. Our  weapon is our vote.''   Dr. King was right. Our weapon is our vote, and today, we are going  to exercise that weapon and strike a blow for working men and women and  for restoring the constitutional right of working men and women to  organize freely and benefit this economy and benefit the quality of  lives for people in communities all across this great land.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from California for giving me the  time. I urge passage of the bill, and I support the rule underlying it.                                time  1315
