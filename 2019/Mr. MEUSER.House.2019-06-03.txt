 Madam Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise today  to recognize the JROTC cadets from Pine Grove High School in Schuylkill  County, Pennsylvania, and their commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel  Michael Stefanchik.   These cadets are traveling overseas to Normandy, France, to help mark  the 75th anniversary of D-day and to honor the beginning of the march  to victory in World War II.   In addition to participating in the D-day memorial parade in  Normandy, they are taking part in the ceremonies in Brittany and the  American cemetery at Omaha Beach. These hallowed grounds are the  resting place for thousands of American heroes who gave the ultimate  sacrifice in defense of freedom and liberty and to save the world from  tyranny.   2,014 Pennsylvanians stormed the beaches of Normandy. It is a great  privilege to have these cadets from the Ninth District present to honor  and remember the bravery of countless ordinary Americans who faced  extraordinary times.   I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing these cadets'  achievement and remembering the great and lasting sacrifices made at  Normandy 75 years ago.                            ____________________
