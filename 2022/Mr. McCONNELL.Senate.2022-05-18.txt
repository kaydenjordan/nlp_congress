 Mr. President, Americans' concern about violent crime  is the highest it has been in 6 years, and the statistics plainly show  why that is. Between 2019 and 2020, the murder rate shot up by the  largest  1-year increase in over a century, and the rate has kept on rising.   Nearly 60 percent more law enforcement officers were killed in 2021  compared to 2020. Cities all across America set alltime record highs  for homicides last year. My hometown of Louisville, KY, was one of  those cities. We also now average more than one carjacking every 48  hours.   Innocent citizens across America know this situation has literally  spiraled out of control, but, unfortunately, the Biden administration  and Senate Democrats continue to team up and find new ways to go soft  on crime. The nomination and confirmation of Judge Jackson to the  Supreme Court crowns a deliberate effort by Democrats to make the  Federal judiciary literally softer on crime. They are specifically  intentionally stuffing the Federal bench full of men and women whose  starting perspective tilts toward sympathy for criminals rather than  victims.   Even the New York Times had to admit this ``concerted push by the  Biden administration'' to prefer nominees with ``experience in criminal  defense work'' is ``a sea change in the world of judicial  nominations.''   The Times continued:         The type of high-profile murder cases handled by some of       Mr. Biden's nominees would have been considered disqualifying       only a few years ago; now the president, who himself served       briefly as a public defender early in his legal career, is       actively seeking to name more jurists who have [that kind of]       experience.    So, Mr. President, we are not arguing that public defenders ought to  be excluded from the nomination process. Clearly, their work is  important. Everyone deserves a lawyer, even the most heinous criminals.  But the American people are not exactly clamoring for President Biden  to dramatically tilt the entire judiciary toward the criminal-friendly  perspective--least of all during this historic crime surge.   This week, with a long list of serious problems facing the country,  the Democratic majority has decided to spend floor time on another  judicial nominee with this one particular background, a second nominee  who appeared during her committee hearing to be unfamiliar with a basic  concept in trial law, and a third nominee whose  [[Page S2554]]  pro bono record includes helping sue the New York City government over  policing and trying to reverse another person's robbery conviction. So  I would urge Senators to oppose these controversial nominees.   I am proud to be one of many Republicans joining a new resolution  from Senator Cassidy begging this all-Democratic government to  prioritize solutions for the violent crime wave. To start, the  administration should stop this willful--willful--campaign to make the  judiciary systemically softer on crime. Innocent Americans can't afford  it.
