 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Peoria  County State's Attorney Jerry Brady, who was laid to rest this week.  Jerry Brady was an admired public servant in the Peoria legal community  and beloved by everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him.   Jerry grew up in Peoria, attending Spalding Institute High School and  graduating from Bradley University and Saint Louis University law  school.   In 1981, he became an assistant state's attorney in Peoria County and  went on to run a successful law practice for nearly 30 years, where he  served until his unfortunate passing.   Inside the courtroom, Jerry was known as one of the most principled  and hardest working legal minds in all of central Illinois. Outside of  the courtroom, he was known as a benefactor, friend, and role model  throughout the community.   Jerry was instrumental in numerous fundraising efforts to support the  Peoria community, including the recent completion of our veterans  memorial in downtown Peoria.   Jerry was a selfless public servant who left a profound impact on our  community, and Peoria, Illinois, misses him and will miss him in the  future.   As our community mourns his loss, my thoughts and prayers are with  his wonderful wife, Sue, and their three children. He will be missed.                            ____________________
