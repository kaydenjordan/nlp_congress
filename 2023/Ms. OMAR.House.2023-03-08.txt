 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support Congress' restoring  its constitutional authority over matters of war and peace.   No matter what else we are discussing here today, the plain and  simple truth is that Congress has not authorized military presence in  Syria. For far too long, we in Congress have neglected this key Article  I responsibility.   If my colleagues believe that we need the military in Syria, then  they should author an AUMF. They should debate that in committee, and  they should bring it to a vote on the floor. We must not continue to  hand over power to the executive branch when the politics get too  difficult.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support today's resolution.                            ____________________
