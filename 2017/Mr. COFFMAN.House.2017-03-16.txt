 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Today, as a veteran of both the Army and the United States Marine  Corps, I rise on behalf of all those who have called, written, and  stopped by my office seeking reform and accountability of the  Department of Veterans Affairs.   I, along with the chairman and my colleagues on the House Committee  on Veterans' Affairs, introduced H.R. 1259, the VA Accountability First  Act of 2017. Today the House will vote to ensure the VA can hold its  employees accountable for their actions and make sure that this agency  remains committed and connected to its sole mission of serving our  Nation's veterans.   Additionally, this bill would provide improved protections for  whistleblowers to ensure those brave enough to tell Congress and the  American people what is really happening at the VA are protected.   After the wait-time scandal in Phoenix and the over $1 billion cost  overrun at the Aurora VA hospital, it is time that we reform the VA's  culture of corruption and bureaucratic incompetence. This legislation  will help the VA meet our Nation's obligations to the men and women who  have made tremendous sacrifices on behalf of our freedom.
