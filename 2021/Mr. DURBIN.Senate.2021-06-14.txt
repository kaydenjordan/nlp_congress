 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, I just heard the Republican Senate  leader warn us not to initiate partisan investigations. It has only  been a few weeks since he personally vetoed a bipartisan investigation  of the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6 of this year.   For those of us who lived through that incident, we find it hard to  understand why a 9/11-style Commission, divided equally between both  political parties, is in any way a partisan investigation and why the  Republican leader, who has served for so long in the Senate, would not  feel awkward, in a way, walking through the halls of this Capitol and  seeing the men and women of the Capitol Police force who have sent us a  letter begging for a Commission to get to the bottom of what happened  on that day when 140 men and women in uniform were attacked by this  insurrectionist mob inspired by President Trump.   So when it comes to investigations, we have offered the most  sanitized version of an investigation that one could ever ask for.   So why are we renewing this request when it comes to the information  which is now before us? Well, on Friday, the DOJ inspector general  announced he would investigate DOJ's use of subpoenas to obtain  communication data from Members of Congress and the media, including  whether the Department of Justice complied with applicable internal  policies and whether its decisions were motivated by improper  considerations   What happened was, the previous President, Donald Trump, apparently  had some channel into the Department of Justice where he could call for  investigations and information and data to be collected about Members  of Congress. He highlighted two Democratic Members of Congress who  were, coincidentally, members of an investigative committee of the  House Intelligence Committee. And then it turns out, in the last 2  days, he called for an investigation of his own White House Counsel.   So it is very hard to follow who was in charge in the White House.  The Attorneys General at the time denied having any connection  whatsoever to these investigations, and certainly the White House  Counsel wouldn't have called for an investigation of himself. So who  was running the show? It is a legitimate question because it gets to  not only the issue of leaks, which is important, of course, but it gets  to the more fundamental question of separation of powers in this  government.   If Members of Congress are subject to investigation by a President  for something other than corruption, then certainly this can be  translated into political pressure on those individuals.   So I find it hard to follow the logic of the Republican Senate  leader, who denies an investigation of the January 6  [[Page S4507]]  mob violence on the Capitol--a bipartisan investigation--and then turns  around and says that the President could investigate Members of  Congress without accountability either. You wonder if there is going to  be the proper constitutional authority witnessed and exhibited in this  circumstance.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a separate issue, the Senate voted on  a bipartisan basis to invoke cloture on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's  nomination to the DC Circuit. Today, the Senate will confirm her to  that post.   Judge Jackson is the first of many circuit court nominees whom we  will confirm during this Congress. Given her credentials and record on  the bench, she is a nominee who deserves the support of Senators on  both sides of the aisle. I would like to take just a minute to  highlight why she is such an outstanding choice for the DC Circuit.   The importance of the DC Circuit cannot be overstated. This is what  another Illinoisan, President Barack Obama, said about the court: ``The  D.C. Circuit is known as the second highest court in the country, and  there's good reason for that. The judges on the D.C. Circuit routinely  have the final say on a broad range of issues involving everything from  national security to environmental policy; from questions of campaign  finance to workers' rights. In other words, the court's decisions  impact almost every aspect of our lives.''   Thankfully, in Judge Jackson, we have a nominee who will be ready  from day one to serve justice as a member of the DC Circuit.   Judge Jackson was born here in Washington, DC, and raised in Miami,  FL. Her parents, public school teachers at the time of her birth, gave  her a lifelong appreciation of learning and the law. They also  instilled in her a dignity and grace that was on full display, as the  Presiding Officer knows, when the judge appeared before the Judiciary  Committee in April.   A champion high school debater, Jackson later attended Harvard and  Harvard Law School before embarking on what can only be described as a  star-studded legal career.   She clerked on the Federal District Court, the First Circuit Court of  Appeals, and for Justice Breyer on the U.S. Supreme Court--a strong  resume in and of itself. She has also worked at several prominent law  firms, handling both trial and appellate work.   But her true calling has always been public service. In the early  2000s, Judge Jackson worked as special counsel on the U.S. Sentencing  Commission and later served as a Federal public defender in Washington,  DC. This experience inspired President Obama to nominate her to serve  as Commissioner and Vice Chair of the Sentencing Commission. In the  Senate, her nomination received unanimous support.   A few years later, Judge Jackson came before the Senate again when  President Obama chose her to fill a vacancy on the U.S. District Court  for the District of Columbia--once again, she was confirmed with  unanimous support.   Looking at the arc of Judge Jackson's career, I am struck by how much  time she spent focusing on the issue of criminal sentencing--an issue  deeply important to me and, I believe, many other colleagues.   From the Sentencing Commission to the Office of Federal Public  Defender, to the district court, Judge Jackson has grappled with legal,  intellectual, and moral challenges that come with sentencing policy and  decisions. Once confirmed, she will bring that vital experience to the  DC Circuit.   I also want to speak more broadly about her record on the bench. She  represents the best of the judiciary. Humble, hard-working, she has  written nearly 600 opinions, and each of them is guided by the same  principles: fairness, impartiality, evenhandedness, and an unyielding  fidelity to the law. It is no surprise, then, that she received the  grade of unanimously ``well qualified'' from the American Bar  Association, and it is no surprise that she has the support of legal  experts and advocates from different ideological and professional  stripes, including Judge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush appointee to  the DC Circuit; the Alliance for Justice; the National Council of  Jewish Women; the AFL-CIO; the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund;  and dozens--literally dozens--of former prosecutors and other Justice  Department officials appointed by Presidents of both political parties.   Let me close with a passage from a letter Judge Griffith wrote in  support of Judge Jackson. I read this letter during her hearing, and it  really stuck with me. Judge Griffith wrote: ``Although she and I have  sometimes differed on the best outcome of a case, I have always  respected her careful approach and agreeable manner, two indispensable  traits for success in a collegial body.''   Madam President, we will all benefit from that careful approach and  agreeable manner on the DC Circuit.   I will vote for Judge Jackson's nomination to the DC Circuit and urge  my colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
