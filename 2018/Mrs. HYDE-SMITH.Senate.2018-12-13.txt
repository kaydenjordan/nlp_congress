 Mr. President, I am pleased to commend MAJ  Paul V. Bankston for his dedication to duty and service as an Army  legislative fellow on my staff. In January 2019, Paul will transfer to  the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army, where he will serve  as a congressional budget liaison.   A native of Okeechobee, FL, Paul received a bachelor of science  degree in applied science and technology from Thomas Edison State  College. He also earned a master of arts degree in legislative affairs  from George Washington  [[Page S7582]]  University. Paul enlisted in the Army in 2000, rose through the  enlisted ranks to sergeant first class, and received his commission in  2008.   Most recently, Paul served as the Army legislative fellow on my  staff, and for the Honorable Senator Thad Cochran prior to that. His  operational experience in Africa and the Middle East, in addition to  his technical expertise in special operations, medical logistics, and  combat medical care, have been pivotal in helping to shape Department  of Defense appropriations for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.   He has served the State of Mississippi and the Nation admirably. The  staff and I have enjoyed the benefit of Paul's counsel and have truly  enjoyed working with him. Paul's leadership has brought great credit to  the army, and I appreciate and commend his commitment to continue to  serve our Nation.   It is a pleasure to recognize and thank MAJ Paul V. Bankston for his  exceptional service to our country. My staff and I extend our gratitude  to Paul and his family for their sacrifices and service to the Nation,  and we wish him well as he takes the next step in his admirable  career.                            ____________________
