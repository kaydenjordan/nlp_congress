 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment No. 172 would prohibit funds  made available by this act to require a member of the Armed Forces or a  civilian employee of the Department of Defense to receive a COVID-19  vaccine.   The fiscal year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act rescinded  Secretary Austin's memorandum requiring that members of the Armed  Forces be vaccinated against COVID-19.   Unfortunately, the NDAA did not prohibit future mandates. The last  mandate resulted in over 8,400 troops being kicked out of the military  for refusing this experimental vaccine, and we lost about 60,000  reservists. Countless individuals also decided not to enlist because of  this mandate.   While our military is failing dramatically to meet recruiting goals,  it is outrageous that the Department of Defense would condition  employment on receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.   For example, in 2022, the Army sought 60,000 recruits but only  enlisted 45,000. For 2023, the Army is aiming to recruit 65,000 new  members but is only expected to recruit between 50- and 55,000 Active- Duty members.   Additionally, young, healthy males are the least at risk of getting a  severe case of COVID-19 while they are the most likely group to have an  adverse reaction from the vaccine, making the mandate not just  counterproductive but potentially dangerous.                                time  1350    The Biden administration is already urging all Americans to get a  booster shot, despite no human-outcome data on the new shot. Congress  must preemptively stop all COVID-19 vaccine requirements before these  unelected bureaucrats try to take more control of our lives.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am glad we are talking about the  effectiveness and the readiness of our military. Again, 60,000  reservists left the military because of a mandate. Fortunately, we did  learn something from it and it was removed from the NDAA, and Austin  went along with it.   These are the mandatory vaccinations that all servicemembers are  required to receive before initial entry in basic training: adenovirus,  hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, measles, mumps, rubella,  meningococcal, poliovirus, tetanus-diphtheria, and varicella.   However, the main difference is that these other vaccines are much  different and more effective than the COVID-19 vaccine. Take measles,  for example. One estimate found that the measles vaccine is 85 times  more effective than the Pfizer COVID vaccine.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy),  my dear friend.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we don't have a single problem with this  being an option. If any servicemembers want to go and get an  experimental vaccination plugged into their arm, they are welcome to do  so.   What we are saying is that the dollars that are going to be issued to  the Department of Defense should not include any mandate for this  experimental vaccination.   In August of 2022, The Washington Post reported that 58 percent of  the deaths related to COVID-19 were among vaccinated or boosted  persons. This raises serious questions about even the effectiveness of  this vaccine.   I would also like to state that the COVID-19 vaccine requirements  also continue to ignore natural immunity. As renowned Dr. Marty Makary  testified in the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic this  year, ``Over the past 3 years, over 200 studies have shown that natural  immunity is at least as effective than vaccinated immunity. A recent  Lancet review . . . natural immunity is at least as effective as  vaccinated immunity, and probably better.''   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment No. 180 would prohibit the use  of funds being made available by this act from enforcing any COVID-19  mask mandates.   Now, I want to make sure that everyone understands there is a huge  difference between a COVID-19 mask mandate and having a section of a  medical facility that is quarantined off because of highly contagious  diseases or folks that are immune deficient. That has nothing to do  with the COVID-19 mandate. This is only about COVID-19 mandates.   Last month, Morris Brown College in Atlanta reinstated its COVID-19  mask mandate. They eventually rescinded the mandate, in large part due  to public outcry, but make no mistake, tyrants will go out of their way  to control our lives if we allow them to.   The simple fact is that masks don't work. A recent study confirmed  this fact, stating: ``Wearing masks in the community probably makes  little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness/COVID- 19-like illness compared to not wearing masks.''   This was obvious to anyone with common sense, but our experts lied to  us for the past 3 years about everything.   There are also negative consequences and potential safety concerns  for children being forced to wear a mask. There are almost 70,000  children that attend Department of Defense Education Activity schools.  We have seen the negative consequences of children masking, and  children of our servicemembers who are risking their lives  [[Page H4628]]  overseas should not be subject to this cruel treatment.   Nobody should be turned away for refusing to wear a mask, but the  real purpose of the mask mandate is for unelected bureaucrats to  control our behavior, which is unacceptable and something that I will  not tolerate.   Moreover, a potential mask mandate based on vaccination status would  create a division among servicemembers. There has been a lot of  discussion on enacting police policies that create cohesion among  members of the Armed Forces and stigmatizing some servicemembers by  forcing them to wear masks that would create a group of second-class  citizens. This would, ultimately, create division among enlisted  members.   The American people are sick of COVID-19 hysteria by unelected  bureaucrats and will not comply with any more unscientific edicts.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am glad that the gentlewoman from  Minnesota brought up the bill, the actual bill. ``None of the funds  made available by this act may be used to enforce any COVID-19 mask  mandates.''   Again, let me reiterate: Highly contagious diseases or folks that are  immune deficient have nothing to do with the COVID-19 mandate.   Here is the other thing. If someone is concerned or chooses to virtue  signal by wearing a mask, they are free to do so. They are absolutely  free to do so. If they have an immune deficiency and want to wear a  mask, they are free to do so, but do not impose the mandates on us  freedom-loving individuals who don't want to walk around covering our  faces up just to let someone else feel a little better about things.   We have problems right now with recruitment. The numbers are down as  much as 35 percent. We are missing goals dramatically. Approving  arbitrary mandates that don't help the military mission to be the most  effective fighting force on Earth is not the way that we are going to  get those numbers up.   Mr. Chair, this is a good amendment. It is going to help us with  recruiting efforts. It is going to help us make sure that our team  works together better, and I ask everyone in here to support it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment No. 73 would prohibit funds  from being used to enforce Secretary Mayorkas' memo prohibiting  workforce immigration enforcement.   With the stroke of a pen, Secretary Mayorkas eliminated a key method  of interior enforcement and required our Immigration and Customs  Enforcement agents, the ICE agents, to fight with one hand tied behind  their back.   Right now, there are over 16.8 million illegal aliens in our country,  and estimates suggest that upward of 65 percent of the illegal aliens  are employed.   Businessowners and ranchers in Montana work hard to ensure they are  in compliance with Federal immigration law, and this memo punishes law- abiding businesses that refuse to hire illegal aliens.   Additionally, Americans should not be expected to compete in the  labor market with illegal aliens who are depressing wages and keeping  good-paying jobs away from American citizens.   President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas' refusal to allow ICE to do  their job and enforce our Nation's laws is a clear dereliction of duty  and presents risk to our country's national security.   Simply put, my amendment would allow ICE agents to do their job  enforcing immigration law with the most effective methods possible.  Under President Trump, workforce enforcement operations were common  practice, making it clear to illegal aliens and the employers that  there would be consequences for breaking the law, putting all  businesses on a level playing field.   It is time we protect small business owners and workers and force  Secretary Mayorkas to let ICE do its job.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, Secretary Mayorkas acknowledges the  threat of illegal labor in his memo ending workplace enforcement:  ``Unscrupulous employers create an unfair labor market. They also  unfairly drive down their costs and disadvantage their business  competitors who abide by the law.''   These businesses are not abiding by the law. The illegal aliens who  are working there are not supposed to be employed. It is not fair to  the labor market. It is not fair to the Americans who wanted to have  these positions. It absolutely does suppress the wages and hurts  everyone.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  0015     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment No. 74 will reduce the total  amount of funds appropriated by this bill to move our country toward  fiscal responsibility, bringing spending toward fiscal year 2022  levels.   We all know that we are facing a $33 trillion national debt, and at  the spending levels that are being proposed by the appropriation bills  that we have been going over the last several days, we very easily  could be facing a $3 trillion addition to that debt by the time we add  the interest in.   It is clear that President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas have no  interest in securing our border or enforcing immigration law. Instead,  this administration is spending money to encourage illegal immigration  through illegal migrant parole programs and cooperation with far-left  NGOs.   Additionally, Secretary Mayorkas has issued countless memos  handicapping law enforcement efforts from ICE and CBP.   I have gone down there and visited the border myself several times.  As long as President Biden refuses to enforce immigration law and stop  the invasion at our southern border, DHS should not be rewarded with a  budget increase.   President Trump secured the border and provided for our national  defense with significantly less money. It is abundantly clear that  Biden's border crisis is a deliberate policy choice by this  administration and not a funding issue.   This country, again, is $33 trillion in debt. We cannot afford to  continue business as usual, primarily when President Biden and  Secretary Mayorkas use taxpayer dollars to prevent our border from  being secured.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, in 2020, the DHS bill appropriated $67.8  billion. In 2022, the DHS bill appropriated $75.538 billion. The 2024  DHS appropriation bill includes $91.5 billion.   While I certainly respect the work that has been done in that  committee, we all are going to have to take a haircut. If not, we are  going to add $3 trillion a year to the national debt. Over the next 5  years, that will rise to $50 trillion.   Madam Chair, $50 trillion in just 5 years, not 20 years, not 50  years, and it will cost 50 percent of the annual revenue in interest  payments alone to service that.  [[Page H4709]]    If you think that we are making difficult decisions right now, when  50 percent of the revenue that we collect on an annual basis is going  to service that loan, we are going to have to make massive changes to  the way that we run the Federal Government, and every single person in  the country is going to feel it. It is going to be dramatic pain.   All I am asking is that we reduce by $8.7 billion. I can't believe  that I am saying only $8.7 billion.   Again, I respect the work that has been done, but these are some  difficult decisions that need to be taken care of, and I am willing to  do my part to help us get there.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
