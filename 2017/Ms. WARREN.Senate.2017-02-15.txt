 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on December 8, Donald Trump nominated  Andrew Puzder to serve as Secretary of Labor. He was scheduled to come  before the HELP Committee tomorrow for his confirmation hearing. There  is some reporting suggesting that he is having some second thoughts,  and I sincerely hope that is true. The reasons Mr. Puzder is a terrible  choice for this job are literally too numerous to cover fully, but I  will at least give it a start.   If you work for a living, the Labor Secretary is very important to  you. This person is responsible for protecting the interests of 150  million American workers. He will be the person responsible for  enforcing the law that ensures that employers actually pay workers for  every hour they work and setting the standards to prevent workplace  injuries and even deaths.   Unfortunately, Mr. Puzder is not the kind of person the American  people can trust to stand up for workers. Since 2000, Mr. Puzder has  served as the CEO of the billion-dollar company CKE Restaurant  Holdings. You may know it better as the parent company of Carl's Jr.  and Hardee's. These two fast-food chains are known for paying very low  wages to workers. Mr. Puzder has a long record of cheating workers out  of overtime. He has paid out millions of dollars to settle claims when  he was caught cheating. We are not talking about isolated incidents.  They reflect the kind of business Mr. Puzder built. Mr. Puzder is a  frequent political pundit and commentator who has vocally opposed  higher minimum wages. He has also strongly opposed new overtime  protections that would give 4 million workers an estimated $1.5 billion  raise in a single year.   Mr. Puzder also delights in expressing personal disdain for his  workers. He bragged in his very first memo as CEO. He wrote that he  wanted ``no more people behind the counter unless they have their  teeth.'' Ha, ha. He said he would like to replace his workers with  robots because ``they are always polite, they always upsell, they never  take a vacation, there's never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex or  discrimination case.''   The Senate has an obligation to hear from those who are best  qualified to  [[Page S1180]]  tell America about Mr. Puzder's suitability to be Labor Secretary and  to stand up for American workers--his own workers. That is why many of  us asked the chairman of the HELP Committee to include Mr. Puzder's  workers in his confirmation hearing. When the chairman refused to do  so, we just went ahead and convened our own forum to allow those  workers a chance to speak.   Seventeen Senators attended. Those 17 Senators heard from Laura  McDonald, who worked as a general manager at Carl's Jr. in Tucson, AZ,  for 20 years. For years, she was forced to work extra hours without  pay. Employees like Laura are the subject of a major lawsuit against  Mr. Puzder's company, CKE, regarding unpaid overtime.   Those 17 Senators heard from Lupe Guzman, who is a single mother who  has devoted the last 7 years of her life to Carl's Jr. in Las Vegas,  NV. She has worked the graveyard shift for rock bottom wages. Seven  years of loyalty, and Lupe is still paid so little that she is on food  stamps to feed her kids. Lupe sat in front of the U.S. Senate and wept  openly about her terrible treatment at the hands of Mr. Puzder's  company.   The Senators also heard from Roberto Ramirez, who has worked in the  fast food industry for over 20 years, mostly at Carl's Jr. in Los  Angeles, CA. He worked regularly off the clock at Carl's Jr., meaning  they didn't pay him. Roberto even had a full paycheck stolen by his  manager.   For every Laura, Lupe, and Roberto, we found dozens of workers who  were afraid to speak out about the terrible conditions at CKE. We  compiled some stories from folks brave enough to speak up into a 20- page report detailing firsthand accounts of the men and women who work  for Mr. Puzder. Those stories are horrifying, and I will read some of  them later today.   Mr. Puzder's company has a truly atrocious record of treating his own  workers terribly. Indeed, he has dripping disdain for people who work  for a living. This alone disqualifies him to be Secretary of Labor.   But there is more. In recent weeks, it has come out that Mr. Puzder  employed an undocumented immigrant in his household for years, and he  didn't pay taxes on that employee. Yep, you heard that correctly. The  Trump administration, which bellows about building a wall and pounds  its chest about ripping millions of families apart with a deportation  force, threatens millions of DREAM Act kids with deportation, has no  problem putting a guy in charge of the Labor Department who cheats on  his taxes and employs undocumented workers. The hypocrisy of that is  pretty stunning, even for the Trump administration.   And then there is the controversy over alleged spousal abuse. Over 25  years ago, Mr. Puzder's first wife appeared on an episode of Oprah  Winfrey in a show about spousal abuse. I have watched the episode in  which she appeared, as I believe every Senator should. I found it  extraordinarily troubling.   Alongside his company's poor record of treatment of female employees,  his highly explicit and sexualized ads, and his snide comments about  sex discrimination, there is ample evidence that Mr. Puzder is a  terrible choice to head the agency charged with ensuring that women and  men are treated fairly in the workplace.   I understand that no matter who President Trump picks to run the  Labor Department, I am probably going to have a lot of issues with that  person, but this is different. Andrew Puzder should not be the Labor  Secretary. And if you ask the Senators in this body--Republicans and  Democrats--if you ask them behind closed doors with the cameras turned  off, you will have a hard time finding people who think this divisive  nomination is good for the country.   It has been suggested that Mr. Puzder is ``tired of the abuse'' that  he has received during this confirmation process. Well, I think the  workers at his companies are pretty tired of the abuse they have  received while being at the mercy of an employer who doesn't care about  them at all and who goes out of his way to squeeze them out of every  last dime. That is literally the opposite of what we need in a Labor  Secretary.   I was prepared to question him on these issues tomorrow, but I hope  it is true that he will withdraw his nomination before then.   Mr. President, I also rise today to express many concerns over the  appointment of Congressman Mulvaney as Director of the Office of  Management and Budget and to urge my colleagues to seriously consider  these issues before voting to confirm him.   One of the best ways to understand what a nation stands for is to  look at its budget. It is all right there. The budget tells who counts,  it tells who gets a chance, and it tells who gets cast aside.   The OMB Director prepares the President's budget. He safeguards the  President's promises by turning them into real commitments backed by  your tax dollars.   During the campaign, President Trump promised over and over again  that he would protect Medicare and Medicaid. He didn't imply it; he  didn't drop hints about it. No, he made the clearest, plainest possible  promise. He said: ``I am not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.''   But since the election, he has done a complete 180. He put up a  transition team website that just dripped with code words for cuts,  saying that he would modernize and maximize flexibility for these  programs. Gone were the unambiguous promises to protect Medicare and  Medicaid.   Then he started nominating people who have made it their life's work  to gut Medicare and Medicaid. His Secretary of Health and Human  Services has proposed cutting more than $1 trillion from these  programs, and now his nominee for OMB Director is someone who wants to  cut Medicare and Medicaid to the bone.   Congressman Mulvaney has voted to increase the retirement age for  Medicare. Hey, you have paid into that program with decades of hard  work? Too bad, just keep waiting.   He also wants to privatize Medicare, and he wants to slash and burn  his way through Medicaid--a program that is a lifeline for millions of  people--for parents of people in nursing homes, for people with  disabilities, for premature babies.   In his confirmation hearing, Congressman Mulvaney was asked whether  he would set aside his rightwing ideology to fulfill the President's  campaign promises to protect Medicare and Medicaid. The Congressman  could not have been clearer in his response: Forget all of that. Nope,  not interested. Mulvaney is still a true believer in Medicare and  Medicaid cuts, and whenever he has the President's ear, he will  continue to advance his own radical ideas for burning down these  indispensable programs.   President Trump also promised that he would not cut Social Security.  He guaranteed it. Here is his quote--many times: ``We're going to save  your Social Security without making any cuts,'' he said.   Here was his closer on that: ``Mark my words.''   OK. Nice words. But he could have picked someone--anyone--to run his  budget, and instead he picked Congressman Mulvaney--one of Congress's  most partisan crusaders against the Social Security program. He wants  to raise the retirement age to 70. Heck, this is a person who calls  Social Security a Ponzi scheme, and, boy, he is not messing around,  either.   During his confirmation hearings, Congressman Mulvaney doubled down  on his promise to rob American workers and retirees by gutting Social  Security. When pressed by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham about  whether he would urge President Trump to reconsider his promise not to  cut Social Security, hey, Mulvaney said that he absolutely would.   Is this just a mistake? Did President Trump just pick Congressman  Mulvaney by accident? The Congressman certainly doesn't seem to think  so.   At his hearing he said: ``I have to imagine that the President knew  what he was getting when he asked me to fill that role.''   Yes, Mulvaney himself believes he is being brought in to push for  cuts in Medicare and Medicaid.   Trump reverses his promise, a second person determined to cut  Medicare and Medicaid makes it into a key government role, and who will  pay the price? America's seniors, that is who.   Apparently, Congressman Mulvaney isn't satisfied with cutting  benefits for  [[Page S1181]]  Americans who have worked and paid into the program for their entire  lives. When it comes to abandoning American workers and families, for  him, that is just the beginning.   He has also called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ``a sick,  sad joke.'' Maybe he should spend a little more time talking to his  constituents and a little less time talking to bank lobbyists.   The CFPB has helped thousands of people in every State--including  dozens of people in Congressman Mulvaney's own district--recover  unauthorized fees on their credit cards and checking accounts. It has  helped them to correct errors on their credit reports. These are  students, seniors, servicemembers, and veterans, who may have spent  months haggling with their bank or student loan servicer over a wrong  charge, only to get quick and complete relief after they went to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   In total--the agency has only been up for about 5\1/2\ years now--it  has forced the largest banks across this country, many of those who  have been out there cheating consumers, to return nearly $12 billion  directly to the people they cheated. That is $12 billion that was  stolen by big banks, by payday lenders, by debt collectors, and is now  back in the pockets of the people who rightfully earned it.   The only sick, sad joke is that Congressman Mulvaney thinks we should  turn the big banks loose to prey on American families once again.   Under Congressman Mulvaney's budget, Americans who have been cheated  and scammed by huge financial institutions will just be cast aside.  Families who work hard for every dollar, only to have some ruthless  corporation steal their savings right out from underneath them, will be  cast aside. And the millions of Americans who have worked for decades  planning to collect Social Security or Medicare when they retire will  be told to just wait four more years. They will be thrown straight to  the curb. None of that--none of that--is what America stands for.   That is just the stuff that directly contradicts the President's  campaign promises. The stuff that is totally in line with the  President's campaign promises is genuinely scary too.   On the campaign trail, Donald Trump stated that he ``may cut the  Department of Education.'' Will Congressman Mulvaney stand up for  students? Unlikely.    Congressman Mulvaney's record shows that he is fine building a  Federal budget that crushes students who are trying to get a college  education. Students already pay too much for student loans, and  Congressman Mulvaney's solution is to force students to pay more. He  supports forcing more college students to borrow more money from  private banks that charge sky-high interest rates without any of the  basic protections Federal student loans have. He clearly wants to let  private banks and Wall Street squeeze as much cash out of hard-working  students as humanly possible to build their profits. In fact,  Congressman Mulvaney wants to help these giant banks out even more by  taking a sledgehammer to the Federal student loan program and making  Federal loan terms lousy for students. That is why he repeatedly voted  to eliminate subsidized student loans for low-income students and why  he helped block legislation to allow borrowers to lower their monthly  payments by refinancing their student loans to lower interest rates.  Not only has he voted to increase the interest rates the government  charges students, he has also voted to cut Pell grants to poor college  students. If Congressman Mulvaney had his way, millions more hard- working students would be shoved even deeper into debt at the start of  their working lives just because they couldn't afford the high cost of  college. Under his budget, students will just be cast aside.   In his confirmation hearing, Congressman Mulvaney also said he is  ``in lockstep'' with Donald Trump's plans to grow military spending,  but he said he would pay for that increase in funding with deep cuts to  domestic programs that working men and women around the country depend  on--programs that could easily include Head Start, which provides  opportunities for low-income children; the disaster aid, which supports  families in crisis after a hurricane or tornado; or resiliency programs  to protect America as worldwide climate changes.   Listen to that again. The children who attend Head Start can stay  home so Donald Trump can divert more money to military spending. The  people who get buried in a 100-year snowstorm can stay buried so Donald  Trump can divert more money to military spending. The people who live  near coasts and rivers and streams can be washed away by rising oceans  and other waterways so Donald Trump can divert money to military  spending--and this nominee, Congressman Mulvaney, is in lockstep to  make it happen.   Under President Trump's new one-in, two-out Executive order, it is  Mr. Mulvaney who would have discretion to give each agency a regulatory  budget and to approve any proposed regulations that increase that  budget. The order is supposedly designed to make life easier and to  make government work better, but Congressman Mulvaney isn't interested  in making government work better, and he is certainly not interested in  making life easier. In fact, he has spent his entire political career  working to cripple the agencies that protect American families-- American workers, American consumers, and American small businesses.  Nowhere is this clearer than in his attacks on the Federal agencies  that protect consumers, that preserve our environment, and that help  keep our country safe. He has worked to starve agencies of the  resources they need to do their jobs, voting to cut funding to law  enforcement, voting to gut the Social Security Program, and voting to  completely defund the organization that provides critical legal  services to low-income American children, families, seniors, and  veterans.   But it is not enough for him to starve agencies to the breaking  point. He has also supported radical bills to stop agencies from  issuing regulations that keep our air clean, our food safe, and our  economy from suffering another devastating financial crisis.  Congressman Mulvaney wants to require agencies to adopt a bill that  imposes the least costs on big businesses, even when those costs are  about making sure companies don't cut corners by cheating, poisoning,  and killing people. Look, if it is cheaper for a corporation to kill  you than it is for the corporation to redesign the product or clean up  their mess, Congressman Mulvaney stands with the corporation. I am sure  he would be willing to say something nice at your funeral about how  your contribution helped give the corporation record profits.   If all that wasn't bad enough, Congressman Mulvaney is ready to rock  and roll on secret money in politics. Washington is already awash in  dark money, but that is not enough for Congressman Mulvaney. He has  worked to open the doors even wider to secret spending in politics.  Over and over, he has voted to shield the identity of political donors,  keep them secret. For example, he opposed a rule that required  corporations applying for government contracts to disclose their  political contributions. Again, just think about that one for a minute.  He doesn't want corporations that bid for government contracts to be  forced to tell when they give money to help targeted government  officials. We already have a problem with money in politics. Mulvaney  just wants to make it worse.   Congressman Mulvaney's record shows one thing. He will make sure our  Federal Government works well for giant corporations and billionaires  who don't like to play by the rules, and he will cast aside the rest of  the public to do that. That is definitely not what our Nation stands  for.   I understand Democrats and Republicans have different priorities when  it comes to the Federal budget. I get that, but when one person wants  to slash Social Security for American retirees, to cut Medicare for  senior citizens, to gut health benefits for low-income families, to  drive up the cost of paying for college, and to gut programs that help  families in crisis and low-income children, all in the name of making  life even easier for giant corporations and billionaires--well, I think  it is clear that his priorities do not include the safety and security  of millions of Americans. That is a priority that should be at the top  of all of our  [[Page S1182]]  lists in the Senate, Republican and Democratic.   I will stand with the Americans whom Congressman Mulvaney will cast  aside as Budget Director, and I will vote no on his nomination.   Mick Mulvaney wants to slash benefits under Medicare, Medicaid,  Social Security, and countless other programs. These are just numbers  to him, but behind those numbers are real people. Real lives are at  risk with every decision he will make as the Budget Director. So what I  want to do is take the time I have remaining and share the stories of  just a few of the people who would be affected.   Lea from Plymouth wrote to me, worried that Congressman Mulvaney  would cut Social Security for her and for others in Massachusetts. Lea  had an interesting suggestion. Here is what she wrote:         I have just sent off an email message to Representative       Mulvaney regarding his spearheading of the cutting of Social       Security benefits.        I challenged him and many of his colleagues to do this:       Live on an income like mine--of $1,219.80--for one month.        Having received my first increase of $2.50 in several       years, it was offset by a Medicare cost increase of $11.50.       Do the math.        I hope you and the other Democratic members of both houses       fight like hell to raise our benefits.        We are definitely in for a bumpy ride for the next 4 years.       As the saying goes . . . ``it ain't going to be pretty!''        Thank you for listening.    Thank you, Lea. Thank you for writing.   I also heard from Janneke from Williamstown, who is worried about  several nominees working to cut Social Security. Here is what Janneke  had to say:         It is terrifying to consider either of these nominees,       Price or Mulvaney, being confirmed for the position to which       they have been nominated. They will work to undo, not to       strengthen, social security. This is a profoundly disturbing       possibility.        I urge you to do everything you can to oppose their       confirmation!    Thank you, Janneke. I will. I will keep fighting for your hard-earned  benefits.   Janet from Florence also reached out to me. She shared the inspiring  stories of her and her husband, and then she told me how worried she is  that cuts to Social Security and Medicare could be coming under  Congressman Mulvaney's watch. Here is what she wrote:         I am 60 years old and have always been employed--in higher       education jobs where I worked hard and long for modest wages,       frequently the case in women-dominated professions.        My husband is a childcare worker who works with infants and       toddlers. The work we do is meaningful and makes a societal       contribution.        At 60 and 64, we have always lived like graduate students.       We shop at the Goodwill, cook from scratch, bring our lunch,       and drive old cars--and bike and walk. We will each be       working until age 70, or longer, if our health permits. This       is fine. We are fortunate to live as we do. But with market-      based retirement funds and with family members needing our       support, we need Social Security, which is NOT BROKEN, to       remain, and be strengthened. And we need access to health       care, for ourselves, children, and grandchildren.        This is a plea from the fading middle class to oppose the       Price and Mulvaney nominations. We--and people far less       fortunate than we are--need your stout support.    Thank you, Janet. Thank you and your husband for all you do for your  community. I promise I will do my best to protect your benefits.   I have received hundreds of these types of letters--letters from  constituents who are scared that cuts to Medicaid and Medicare could  endanger their basic ability to survive, letters from constituents who  have seen how important these services are to thousands across the  State and millions across the country, constituents who aren't sure  where to turn and whom to blame. They just know they cannot afford to  lose these benefits, like a woman from Somerville, who wrote to me  about the work she does as an intensive care coordinator. Here is what  she had to say:         I am an Intensive Care Coordinator through Riverside       Community Care, a statewide human service agency that       delivers crucial mental health services to at-risk youth. In       my program, the Guidance Center Community Service Agency, we       specifically provide Child Behavioral Health Initiatives       (CBHI) services to youth in Cambridge, Somerville, Medford,       Malden, Waltham, Woburn, Wilmington, and other northern       towns.        I am extremely nervous that the new presidential       administration will attack Medicaid and put our programs in       jeopardy.        If you're not familiar with the CBHI wraparound model, I       can briefly explain why these services are so important. One:       we serve youth in poverty. Two: our services are community       based, so we go to the homes of the families we're serving,       so they don't need to rely on transportation. Three: we are a       form of outpatient care that prevents youth who are suicidal/      homicidal from needing hospitalization. Or, if they are       hospitalized, helping the family develop a plan for when       they're discharged. Four: Although the child with mental       health diagnosis is our identified client, the services       benefit the whole family. We understand that taking care of       children with special needs is taxing, so we identify       resources and services for parents as well. Five: we work       with state departments like Department of Children and       Families, Department of Health, and Department of       Developmental Disabilities. Six: our model works. I myself       rarely close a case without having had at least one goal       (identified by the family) met and there are growing       statistics about the benefit of having us in place.        I hope you can bring this argument where it needs to go to       ensure that we have a future here in Massachusetts.    I want to say on this one: Thank you. Thank you for writing, and  thank you for the work you do.   I am doing my best to bring this story. This is a story everybody in  the Senate should listen to. It is a story about how we reach out to  those who most need us and provide the kind of care they need.   Thank you. Thank you for your work, and thank you for writing.   I also received a letter from an occupational therapist from  Massachusetts. She told me all about the important work she has been  doing and how Medicaid has been crucial to that work. Here is what she  had to say:         As a constituent and occupational therapy practitioner, I       am writing to you to express my concerns about a major       restructuring of the Medicaid program.        Medicaid is an essential safety net program for the most       vulnerable in our society. In 2015, 39% of children received       health insurance either through the Childrens Health       Insurance Program or through Medicaid. More than 60 percent       of nursing home residents are supported primarily through       Medicaid. Additionally, Medicaid provides health care       services and long-term services and supports to more than 10       million people living with disabilities, and 1 in 5 Medicaid       recipients receive behavioral health services.        Restructuring of the Medicaid program through per capita       caps or block granting and significant cuts to the Medicaid       program would jeopardize the long-term health and       independence of current Medicaid beneficiaries. Thus I urge       extreme care and caution when considering a major       restructuring of the program or other significant changes,       waiver of mandatory services, or dramatic cuts.    Thank you for all the work you do, and thank you for writing and  making this important point about who uses Medicaid and how critical it  is to the basic support services that we provide.   Another constituent wrote to me about the amazing work that she does  in the Boston area for those with severe mental illness and how  Medicaid and Medicare help these people. Here is what she had to say:         I work with people with severe Mental Illness in the       greater Boston area. A majority of my patients receive their       therapy and medication through Medicaid and Medicare. Even       the thought of losing coverage heightens their anxiety. If       coverage is reduced or co-pays raised, they stand to lose not       only therapy and group interventions but also the medication       which is essential to avoiding higher levels of care. Given       the high rate of co-occurring physical and mental health       issues, the general health of my patients will be severely       compromised with any reduction in access to care.        Nearly 1 out of 3 people covered by Medicaid expansion live       with a mental health or substance use condition and people       with marketplace insurance plans have fair and equal mental       health coverage. With this coverage, people have access to       mental health services that support recovery.        As a constituent, I would like you to keep in mind that       Medicaid or insurance marketplace plans are helping all of       those who struggle with mental illness who, with accessible       supports, can lead healthier lives.    Again, thank you for the work you do, and thank you for writing. It  is a powerfully important point.   Congressman Mulvaney wants to slash these programs. That is why I  will be voting against his nomination.   I also received more personal stories from people like Michael from  Acton, who told me about his son. Here is what he wrote:         My particular concern is the attack on the ACA and Medicaid       and Medicare.        My biggest worry is my 27 year old son, Adam, who was born       with microcephaly. He  [[Page S1183]]       is a very loving person with a great smile, but functions       roughly at the level of a 12 month old. He currently lives in       a group residence and goes to a day habilitation program       during the week. Both of these programs are funded in part by       Medicaid. If Medicaid funds are cut, I worry that the day-hab       program will not be able to continue or, at the least, will       operate at a much reduced level. This would seriously degrade       the quality of Adam's life. I worry what will happen at his       already understaffed residence.        As it is, the staff at Adam's residence and day-      habilitation programs are paid very little wages to do very       tough jobs. Because of this, there is already a constant       problem of finding enough people to staff these. . . . jobs       if they are paid less or have to do even more work because of       lower staffing levels[.]        The prospect of what is coming scares me. What will my       son's life be like?    Thank you for writing, Michael. I appreciate it. I will be out there  fighting for Adam. I hope we can get a lot of people in the Senate to  do that as well. Thank you.   We also heard from Daniel Mumbauer, who is president of the High  Point Treatment Center in Massachusetts. Daniel has experienced  firsthand how Medicaid funds can change the lives of thousands of  people in Massachusetts alone. This is what Daniel wrote:         On behalf of High Point Treatment Center, I am writing to       urge and request your support in protecting the Affordable       Care Act and preserving Medicaid expansion in the 115th       Congress.        High Point served over 30,000 individuals last year. We       provide substance use disorder and mental health services to       adolescents and adults.        Recent health insurance data show that Americans with       mental health and substance use disorders are the single       largest beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid       expansion. Nearly one in three who receives health insurance       coverage through Medicaid expansion either has a mental       illness, a substance abuse disorder, or both. By repealing       the Medicaid expansion, this population of vulnerable       Americans would be left without access to lifesaving       treatment, driving up costs in emergency department visits       and hospital stays.        I am also writing to urge your support for the protection       of the Medicaid program from proposals to restructure       Medicaid as a block grant or capped program. These proposals       would reduce federal investment in Medicaid and leave       millions of Americans without access to needed mental health       and addictions treatment in our communities. Please work with       your colleagues to protect our nation's most vulnerable       patient population and preserve their access to treatment.    Thank you, Daniel. Thank you very much for writing, and thank you for  the work you do.   Congressman Mulvaney wants to eviscerate health programs that would  help Michael's son and the thousands who are treated at the High Point  Treatment Center. That is exactly the opposite of what we should be  doing.   I have also heard from many constituents worried about losing their  Social Security benefits under the new administration, like Kensington  from Hatfield, who is terrified that his mother, who depends on Social  Security, will lose her benefits. Here is what he wrote:         Last night scared me for the first time. My mother is 69       and depends on Social Security for her income and has severe       COPD and relies on medicare and medicaid for prescriptions       and medical supplies to help her breath[e]. She was crying       and is afraid of losing everything and that she will die. I       know it's extreme thinking, but without her medicine and       income it is unfortunately the truth. I didn't know what to       say to comfort her and that scared me! What can I say to ease       her mind and let her know that she will be OK. Will she be       OK?    Thank you, Kensington, for your note. Your mother is right to be  worried, and that is why I am fighting this nomination.   I have so many more stories--many, many stories--that I could read,  but I am running out of time here.   I want to say that Mick Mulvaney is dangerous to the American people,  and he is dangerous to the Federal Government. He will slash programs  right and left without worrying about the living, breathing people whom  he is hurting in the process. That is why I will be voting against his  nomination as Director of the Office of Management and Budget and why I  urge my colleagues to do the same.   Let's make sure that Mick Mulvaney never ends up as the head of the  Office of Management and Budget, never is in a position to put together  a budget to cut Medicare and cut Medicaid. Let's make sure that we keep  our government, our Medicare, our Medicaid, and our Affordable Care Act  working for the American people. That is what I will keep fighting for.   Mr. President, I yield.
