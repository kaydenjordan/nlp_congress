 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4470) to extend the authorization of the Chemical Facility  Anti-Terrorism Standards Program of the Department of Homeland  Security, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4470         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting and Securing       Chemical Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATION OF CHEMICAL FACILITY ANTI-                    TERRORISM STANDARDS PROGRAM OF THE DEPARTMENT                     OF HOMELAND SECURITY.         Section 5 of the Protecting and Securing Chemical       Facilities from Terrorist Attacks Act of 2014 (Public Law       113-254; 6 U.S.C. 621 note) is amended by striking ``2023''       and inserting ``2025''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4470.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4470, the Chemical  Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program, also known as CFATS, which  is the only Federal program that focuses on security at facilities with  chemicals of interest. The authority for this program expires in just 2  days.   While Congress continues to look at improvements and changes with  feedback from industry, it is imperative that we reauthorize the  program to remain in place to continue to provide stability to the  chemical facility industry.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Lee) for her  work leading this initiative. I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  4470, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the great State of Florida (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the  great State of Texas (Mr. Pfluger).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the  great State of Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Ohio.    Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers and I am prepared  to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4407 and to quickly  move this legislation to the Senate.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1501) to prohibit the Secretary of Homeland Security from  operating or procuring certain foreign-made unmanned aircraft systems,  and for other purposes, as amended.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1501.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1501. It is imperative that  the Department of Homeland Security is equipped to protect the Nation  against all threats. This protection includes ensuring that the  unmanned aircraft systems, or drones, that DHS uses and buys are not  made in foreign countries that do not align with our interests,  countries like China.   DHS requires the dominant, air domain capabilities that drones  provide to accomplish many of its land and maritime missions. DHS uses  drones for everything from surveilling the border to the Coast Guard  National Security Cutter's operational need for a persistent airborne  surveillance capability. Utilizing drones is a cost-effective way to  cover large areas of the homeland.   However, many of the commercial drones used in the United States are  manufactured in China, which dominates the United States' market. Of  the top 10 drone manufacturers that supply the United States market, a  single Chinese manufacturer towers over the others with nearly 77  percent of market share.   Because of this threat, several other Departments, such as Commerce  and Interior, have taken actions to ground their drone fleets until the  threat to U.S. Government data can be determined.   DHS has also issued warnings in recent years about Chinese-made  drones, specifically citing concerns that they may be sending sensitive  data to their manufacturers in China where it can then be assessed by  the Chinese Government.   Our colleagues in the Senate share our concerns. In fact, Senator  Rick Scott and Mark Warner have introduced similar legislation to ban  the purchase and use of these drones across the Federal Government, not  just at DHS.   Given the role drones have in protecting homeland security, it is  more important than ever to require DHS to assess its drone fleets.  Once DHS has identified the extent of the problem, we can then work  with the Department to find a suitable solution.                                time  1930    This bill would require DHS to provide a threat assessment report to  Congress on whether the agency has analyzed the threat of its drones  that are manufactured in covered countries. It would also require that  they report the number of these drones the department has in operation  and the extent to which the information gathered by these drones may be  a threat to the homeland or economic security of the United States.   Second, the bill would prohibit DHS from buying or using drones made  in a covered foreign country going forward.   I am proud to say that this bill was passed out of the House Homeland  Security Committee in a bipartisan fashion.   I thank my friend and colleague, Chairman Green, for being an  original cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation and Congressman  Cuellar for being a cosponsor of this bill. I am grateful that this  body passed this measure in a bipartisan fashion last Congress, and I  am optimistic that we will be able to do so again today.   Madam Speaker, with China looming as a growing threat on the horizon,  maintaining our homeland security is of the utmost importance. I urge  my colleagues to support H.R. 1501, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I, again, urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 1501, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3254) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish a process to review applications for certain grants to  purchase equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed any applicable  national voluntary consensus standards, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3254         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Inspector General Report.--Not later than three years       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Inspector       General of the Department of Homeland Security shall submit       to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report assessing the       implementation of the review process established under       paragraph (2) of subsection (f) of section 2008 of the       Homeland Security Act of 2002 (as added by subsection (a) of       this section), including information on the following:        (1) The number of requests to purchase equipment or systems       that do not meet or exceed any applicable consensus standard       evaluated under such review process.        (2) The capability gaps identified by applicants and the       number of such requests granted or denied.        (3) The processing time for the review of such requests.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous materials on H.R. 3254.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3254, the First  Responder Access to Innovative Technologies Act. It is a great piece of  commonsense legislation that will put in place a better process for our  first responders to access FEMA grants to purchase new equipment.   I commend my colleague across the aisle, Mr. Payne, for his work on  this legislation and supporting first responders. H.R. 3254 passed  unanimously out of committee in May, and I urge my colleagues to  support its final passage on the floor today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues in both the House and the Senate  to support this legislation, H.R. 3254, which would support our first  responders, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.
