 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on the Supreme  Court nomination, I want to just say a word about the terrorist attack  in London yesterday.   I was devastated to hear that two Utahans, Kurt and Melissa Cochran,  were victims in yesterday's attack. While Melissa is recovering, I was  heartbroken to hear that Kurt has since passed away from his injuries.   I just want to offer our most sincere condolences to the Cochrans and  ensure that we help them in any way we can.   I know all our prayers are with the victims and with their families,  friends, and loved ones.
