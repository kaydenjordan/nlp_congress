 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for her leadership on  this issue, and I thank the members of the committee for their hard  work.   Mr. Speaker, amateur and professional sports are an essential part of  American society. We spend over $50 billion each year on sporting  events. Billions more in revenue are generated from advertising,  athlete endorsements, and broadcast rights of thousands of sporting  events each year. The impact of sports in the United States is over  half a trillion dollars, and the effects on local, State, national, and  global economies are considerable.   In other words, there is a great deal at stake. The integrity of  leagues, coaches, athletes, and their sponsors is critical. Governments  around the world sponsor their athletes in amateur sports, most notably  in the Olympics. Scandals over the past 20 years involving doping and  the use of performance-enhancing drugs have tarnished the reputations  of players and coaches, and especially clean athletes who follow the  rules and do not use prohibited drugs and substances.   The widespread doping by Russian athletes at the 2014 Winter Olympics  led to Russia being banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics. Subsequent  investigation revealed a massive government-sponsored doping program  where a Russian drug testing laboratory director used a three-drug  cocktail of anabolic steroids to boost the performance of Russian  athletes. Even more distressing, Russian intelligence operatives  switched the steroid-tainted urine samples of the Russian athletes with  clean samples. In the end, 43 Olympic medals were stripped from Russia  for doping violations.   Federal law already contains penalties for kickbacks, bribery,  corruption, foreign corrupt practices, and related crimes. However, it  does not criminalize fraud through doping in international sport  competitions, nor does it provide protections for the victims of doping  fraud, such as athletes and whistleblowers.   H.R. 835 would enhance America's jurisdiction over international  sports and help ensure the integrity of athletes and coaches in the  Olympics and similar competitions.   Doping fraud conspiracies harm clean athletes and their coaches and  cosponsors. They also defraud those who pay to watch sporting events  and set an extremely poor example for our youth. It is time for the  United States to join several European nations and add another means by  which criminals engaged in doping fraud can be held accountable for  their actions and no longer tarnish the honor and image of clean  athletes.   This bill is a unique example of bipartisan efforts. I am encouraged  by the ability of Members and staff from both sides of the aisle to  craft legislation which will help root out fraud and corruption in  international sports.   As the lead sponsor of several other bipartisan pieces of  legislation, I look forward to finding more common ground for the  benefit of the American people. I am pleased to support this bill, and  I urge my colleagues to support it, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, again, I would say that this is  an important bill designed to restore integrity to international sport  competition. Right now, you only need to look outside in the Nation's  Capital to see that World Series fear has hit our Nation's Capital. As  we all watch with enthusiasm, we are reminded of the noble goals and  noble values inherent in sport and competition and look to preserve  those goals and values with the passage of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for his leadership  on this important issue.   The United States Constitution expressly calls for the protection of  creative works in order to promote innovation and creativity. Under  that lofty authority, Congress established the copyright system. As was  the hope, copyright-intensive industries have become critical to our  economy, reportedly contributing more than $1 trillion.   Unfortunately, in the system that we have today, many small  businesses and individuals are unable to enforce their copyrights  because they do not have deep enough pockets. It costs tens or hundreds  of thousands of dollars to hire lawyers to litigate a copyright claim  in Federal court.   Sadly, this forces individuals to stand idly by as thieves profit off  of their work. Our Founding Fathers wouldn't want a copyright system  that discourages creators. After all, they wanted to create a system  that fosters the creation of artistic works. That is why so many  members of the Judiciary Committee helped craft legislation to stop the  theft of copyrighted works and so many Members of the House have joined  in support of it.   H.R. 2426, the CASE Act, would establish a copyright small claims  proceeding within the Copyright Office to provide a less expensive  alternative to costly Federal court litigation.   The proceedings would be simple, conducted remotely, handled by a  panel of copyright experts, and limited to straightforward cases of  alleged copyright infringement.   Damage awards would be low, reaching a maximum of no greater than  $15,000 per work, with a total award for a case capped at $30,000.  Participation in such a small claims proceeding would be completely  voluntary, and anyone falsely accused of infringement could simply opt  out of the small claims proceeding.   The CASE Act includes a number of other safeguards to prevent abuse.  The Copyright Office is authorized to limit the number of cases one  person can file and will review the allegations for sufficiency before  forwarding them to the accused infringer.   If an accuser files in bad faith, he or she would have to pay fees to  the party falsely accused of infringement and be barred for 1 year.   Several other provisions of H.R. 2426 would protect against  inadvertent default judgments. They include requirements that the  accused infringer be physically served; the complaint warn the accused  infringer of the ramifications of not responding; and the accused be  given several notices and chances to respond to the allegations against  them.   Most importantly, before a default judgment can be granted, the  copyright owner must establish that their copyright was actually  infringed by the accused.   The bill is intended to provide a streamlined, inexpensive  alternative for parties to resolve small claims of copyright  infringement outside of court. H.R. 2426 accomplishes all of these  goals.   I am proud to join my colleagues--Congressman Jeffries, Ranking  Member Collins, Chairman Nadler, Martha Roby, Hank Johnson, Judy Chu,  Ted Lieu, and Brian Fitzpatrick--to provide an important avenue of  relief to the creators in our communities who provide such significant  support to our local economies.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman again for his leadership on this  issue, and I thank the chairman for his remarks.   Again, this bill is a purely optional system and allows anyone who  doesn't wish to participate to opt out. The Copyright Office considered  this feature in its report back in 2013 and highlighted significant  shortcomings of an opt-in approach, including concerns that such a  system would fail to capture infringers who choose to ignore a claim of  infringement and/or fail to return an affirmative written response  regarding agreement to participate in the system, as is currently the  case.   The opt-out system provided in the CASE Act does not change the  voluntary nature of the small claims process it creates. In fact, it is  simple, and respondents would be made aware of their right to opt out  as well as the consequences of opting out and not opting out, which  would be prominently stated and explained in the notice they receive.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I would say that this is a bipartisan initiative.  I would just add several different Members on both sides participated.  I want to thank all of them for their hard work. I want to thank the  staff for their hard work, as well.   This will go a long way toward furthering the protection of creative  works as our Founders intended in the U.S. Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his leadership  on this issue. I also want to thank Congressman Pappas for his  introduction of an identical bill in the House.   Many Americans may not be aware that more than 82,000 Americans are  listed as prisoners of war, missing in action, or otherwise unaccounted  for as a result of engagement in military conflicts. Displaying the  POW/MIA flag alongside the American flag invites everyone to reflect on  that somber number and appreciate the sacrifices people have made for  the freest country on the planet.   S. 693 would require the POW/MIA flag to be displayed whenever the  American flag is displayed on Federal properties, including the U.S.  Capitol, the White House, the World War II Memorial, the Korean War  Veterans Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, every national  cemetery and major military installation as designated by the Secretary  of Defense, and every U.S. post office.   I look forward to passage of this bipartisan bill and to seeing the  POW/MIA flag fly along with the Stars and Stripes to remind us that  freedom comes at a cost and we owe more than we know to the brave men  and women who gave their lives and their liberty for their fellow  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I commend those who have pursued the  introduction and passage of this important legislation. And along with  the comments of my colleague from New Hampshire, ``they will never be  forgotten,'' we will continue to fly the POW/MIA flag alongside the  American flag.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, time and again my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle have made it clear that this impeachment process is  nothing but a sad act of political theater.   The impeachment of a President, the attempt to insert the U.S.  Congress between the American people and the President they elected 3  years ago, the attempts by this House leadership to prevent the  American people from making their choice in the election next November,  this is a serious matter and must not be abused as a tool for partisan  gain or advantage in the next election.   I have witnessed Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, as a proud  member of that committee, repeatedly fail to find evidence to support a  case for impeaching this President.   Now, in the realization of this fact and at the expense of  fundamental fairness and due process, the Speaker has removed any  further investigation from the Judiciary Committee so that impeachment  can be conducted in secret and out of public view--no vote to proceed,  no public hearings, no access to testimony, no ability to call  witnesses.   This is a sham, and the American people won't have it any longer.                            ____________________
