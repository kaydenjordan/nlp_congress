 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Mann for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, as National Agriculture Month comes to a close, I am  reminded of a speech Paul Harvey delivered to the FFA in 1978. No truer  words have ever been spoken about America's farmers.   Listening to the speech brings back memories of the days spent  working with my stepdad on his farm. This is a tribute, again, to  America's farmers, the work they do. And when I read this speech, it  reminds me, I can see my stepdad those days working. But it is a  tribute to all of the farmers in our great country.   So here are a few of the excerpts that I really like from this  speech, and it goes like this.   It begins:         And on the 8th day, God looked down on his planned       paradise, and said, ``I need a caretaker.''        So God made a farmer.        God said, I need somebody who can shape an ax handle from a       persimmon sprout, shoe a horse with a hunk of car tire, who       can make a harness out of haywire, feed sacks and shoe       scraps. Whose planting time and harvest season will finish       his 40-hour week by Tuesday noon, and then pain'n from       tractor back, put in another 72 hours.        So God made a farmer.        It had to be somebody who'd plow deep and straight and not       cut corners. Somebody to seed, weed, feed, breed, and rake       and disc and plow and plant and tie the fleece and strain the       milk and replenish the self-feeder and finish a hard week's       work with a 5-mile drive to church.        Somebody who would bale a family together with the soft,       strong bonds of sharing, who would laugh, and then sigh, and       then reply, with smiling eyes, when his son says that he       wants to spend his life doing what dad does.        So God made a farmer.        Thank you to America's farmers. This is a tribute to the       work that you do every day on behalf of not just the United       States, but our world.
