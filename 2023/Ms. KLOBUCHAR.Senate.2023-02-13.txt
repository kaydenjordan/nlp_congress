 Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S.  Res. 57, submitted earlier today.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I rise with my colleague Senator  Smith, who will be speaking shortly, to recognize the life of Senator  David Durenberger, who passed away on January 31, 2023, leaving behind  his loving wife Susan, to whom he was married over 27 years, as well as  his four sons, two stepchildren, and 14 grandchildren.   Last week, I had the honor of attending Dave's funeral at St. John's  Abbey in Collegeville, MN. Attendees included Governors of both  parties. Governor Pawlenty was there, Governor Walz and Governor  Dayton.   It was a fitting venue because in so many ways, Dave was St. John's  College. He was raised there by his parents, George and Isabelle, both  of whom were faculty members. And as a student at St. John's Prep and  St. John's University, he grew up fully immersed in the Benedictine  values of faith, listening, respect, stewardship, and justice. Those  values shaped what he did.   Shortly after I won my first Senate race, Dave invited me to  breakfast, and there is actually a photo of us on the wall when we had  that breakfast in that restaurant. He had a few lessons he wanted to  share with me. He didn't sugarcoat anything. He said that Washington  can ``eat you up'' and that, too often, the value of stewardship is  missing.   He told me to join the prayer breakfast, because he said it was one  place where people could talk to each other, nothing would leak, and  you could build trust and take a moment and put things in perspective.   I did join the prayer breakfast, and 2 years later, as often happens  in these things, I was actually cochairing it with former Senator  Johnny Isakson, another good Senator we will miss very much.   Dave also gave me a small book called ``The Teachings of Jesus'' and  told me to keep it in my office, which I did. It is on my bookshelf.  And as he predicted, I did look at it in moments of good and moments of  bad.   One of the teachings stood out to me as I was reflecting on Dave's  life. From Matthew 5:16:         Let your light shine before others so that they may see       your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.    That is Dave. Through the bluster of Washington, Dave found ways to  bring his good work and his belief in public service to the rest of the  country.   Dave took volunteerism seriously. We saw it in how he lived his life.  He paired up with his then-Democratic colleague, Senator Paul  Wellstone, on the legislation that created AmeriCorps. As a result of  their efforts, millions and millions of Americans have gotten the  support that they have needed to better their communities.   Dave's devotion to stewardship is also clear when you look at what he  did to promote conservation. It was in that spirit that he worked to  successfully secure protections for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, for  Voyageurs National Park, and for the Mississippi River. He wanted his  grandkids and their kids to be able to experience the natural treasures  that Minnesotans have enjoyed for generations.   You simply can't talk about Dave's time in Washington without noting  what he did to advance the rights of those with disabilities. From his  faith, he carried with him the values of respect for all people, and  from his time in former Republican Governor LeVander's office, in  working on disability issues, he carried with him a steadfast  commitment to improving the lives of disabled people across the  country.   Once, through his work in the Governor's office, Dave visited a  hospital where he saw patients with disabilities, and in his words,  they were warehoused. Most of them, he said, didn't even have clothes  on. He knew that as a society we could and must do better, and in  Washington, he saw to it that we did.   As I know the Acting President pro tempore is aware, given the  leadership torch passed on to her, through his leadership on the  Americans with Disabilities Act, he helped to usher in a whole new era  of disabilities rights--one where people in wheelchairs weren't trapped  in their homes as a result of a lack of ramps, one where disabled  people weren't systematically excluded from the workforce, and one  where the destitute facilities that once motivated him to take action  were phased out in favor of community residential treatment and care  services.   In the years that followed, he found a loving partner in Susan, his  wife, whose dedication to mental health reform eventually led her to  write her book ``The Crusade for Forgotten Souls,'' a rich history of  the campaign to provide dignified care to Minnesotans with  disabilities. And Minnesota, back through the time of Hubert Humphrey,  when he gave his famous speech at the 1948 Democratic National  Convention, has always been ahead of itself and the rest of the country  when it has come to people with disabilities.   Dave, a Republican, carried on that torch from the other side of the  aisle. From the outside, Dave's work often looked like a manifestation  of faith in action, but the way he saw it, he was just doing his job-- the good deeds--in letting his light shine onto others.   When Dave left the Senate, it wasn't easy. It has been quite  documented what happened. He could have been bitter or he could have  just hidden away and ducked down and not taken responsibility, but he  didn't. He apologized and kept working. He taught. He would bring his  students out here on healthcare. He was an advocate for healthcare  reform, and he still spoke around the State. He showed us that that  kind of resilience only comes when something happens to someone where  they have to decide, Am I going to sink down further in a valley or am  I going to rise up on the mountaintop and do good again? That included  mentoring new Senators and new people in public office, which included  me.   He did good both while he was in the Senate, before he got here, and  then, of course, after he left. He had a higher purpose, and he found a  way, one way or another, to improve people's lives as a Senator, as an  educator, as a husband, as a dad, and as a grandpa. Dave lived every  day of his life trying to do good. He learned that, of course, growing  up at St. John's, but he brought it to this Chamber and beyond.   Today, Senator Smith and I are coming together to introduce this  resolution, which we are honored has passed, honoring Senator Dave  Durenberger, a man whose higher purpose led our country to a higher  ground.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Committee on Rules and  Administration has adopted rules governing its procedures for the 118th  Congress. Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 2, of the Standing Rules of  the Senate, on behalf of myself and Senator Fischer, I ask unanimous  consent that a copy of the committee rules be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             Rules of Procedure                          MEETINGS OF THE COMMITTEE         Rule 1.

This does not  [[Page S347]]       preclude any Member of the Committee from discussing       appropriate non-agenda topics.        Rule 5. After the Chair and the Ranking Minority Member,       speaking order shall be based on order of arrival,       alternating between Majority and Minority Members, unless       otherwise directed by the Chair.        Rule 6.

Rule 7. In general, testimony will be restricted to 5       minutes for each witness. The time may be extended by the       Chair, upon the Chair's own direction or at the request of a       Member.

Rule 10. Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(2) of rule XXVI of the       Standing Rules, 2 Members of the Committee shall constitute a       quorum for the purpose of taking testimony under oath and 1       Member of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the       purpose of taking testimony not under oath; provided,       however, that in either instance, once a quorum is       established, any one Member can continue to take such       testimony.        Rule 11. Under no circumstances may proxies be considered       for the establishment of a quorum.                                    VOTING         Rule 12. Voting in the Committee on any issue will normally       be by voice vote.        Rule 13.

The results of roll call votes taken in any       meeting upon any measure, or any amendment thereto, shall be       stated in the Committee report on that measure unless       previously announced by the Committee, and such report or       announcement shall include a tabulation of the votes cast in       favor of and the votes cast in opposition to each such       measure and amendment by each Member of the Committee.       (Paragraph 7(b) and (c) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules.)        Rule 15. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and       matters before the Committee.

Proxies will       be allowed in such cases solely for the purpose of recording       a Member's position on the question and then only in those       instances when the absentee Committee Member has been       informed of the question and has affirmatively requested that       he or she be recorded. (Paragraph 7(a)(3) of rule XXVI of the       Standing Rules.)                                  AMENDMENTS         Rule 16. Provided at least five business days' notice of       the agenda is given, and the text of the proposed bill or       resolution has been made available at least five business       days in advance, it shall not be in order for the Committee       to consider any amendment in the first degree proposed to any       measure under consideration by the Committee unless such       amendment has been delivered to the office of the Committee       and by at least 5:00 p.m. the day prior to the scheduled       start of the meeting and circulated to each of the offices by       at least 6:00pm.        Rule 17. In the event the Chair introduces a substitute       amendment or a Chair's mark, the requirements set forth in       Rule 16 shall be considered waived unless such substitute       amendment or Chair's mark has been made available at least       five business days in advance of the scheduled meeting.        Rule 18. It shall be in order, without prior notice, for a       Member to offer a motion to strike a single section of any       bill, resolution, or amendment under consideration.        Rule 19. This section of the rule may be waived by       agreement of the Chair and the Ranking Minority Member.                  DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO COMMITTEE CHAIR         Rule 20. The Chair is authorized to personally sign or sign       by delegation all necessary vouchers and routine papers for       which the Committee's approval is required and to decide on       the Committee's behalf all routine business.        Rule 21. The Chair is authorized to engage commercial       reporters for the preparation of transcripts of Committee       meetings and hearings.        Rule 22.

DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO COMMITTEE CHAIR AND RANKING MINORITY MEMBER         Rule 23. The Chair and Ranking Minority Member, acting       jointly, are authorized to approve on behalf of the Committee       any rule or regulation for which the Committee's approval is       required, provided advance notice of their intention to do so       is given to Members of the Committee.        Rule 24. The Chair, with the concurrence of the Ranking       Minority Member of the Committee, is authorized to subpoena       the attendance of witnesses and the production of       correspondence, books, papers, documents, and other       materials. Regardless of whether a subpoena has been       concurred in by the Ranking Minority Member, such subpoena       may be authorized by vote of the Members of the Committee.       When a subpoena is authorized, either by a vote of the       Committee or by the Chair with the concurrence of the Ranking       Member, the subpoena may be issued upon the signature of the       Chair or of any other Member of the Committee designated by       the Chair.                            ____________________
