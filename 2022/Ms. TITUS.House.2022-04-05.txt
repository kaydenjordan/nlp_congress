 Mr. Speaker, I stand to add my voice to the bipartisan  chorus of support for this bill, including the chairman of the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. DeFazio; Ranking  Member Graves; and the ranking member of my subcommittee, Mr. Webster,  for leading on this bill and working so hard to bring relief to not  only our communities but individuals who are hit by natural disasters  and other calamities like we saw during COVID.   Creating a Federal policy that supports projects focused on  mitigating risks and bolstering resilience is good government. There is  no two ways about it.                                time  1330    This legislation features a number of key provisions that will make  our Nation more resilient:   One, it increases State funding for predisaster mitigation. An ounce  of prevention is worth a pound of cure.   It expands assistance for Western States, like Nevada, that are at  the risk of wildfires, which we see coming more often, lasting longer,  and being more intense.   It also reserves funds to implement and enforce the latest building  codes and standards so when we do build back, we build back better, not  to the status quo ante.   It empowers families to proactively take mitigation measures into  their own hands, because they may know best what they need there at  home.   I strongly support this legislation. We must wake up to the realities  of climate change and the increasing intensity and cost of the natural  disasters that it causes. This legislation will help to make our Nation  more resilient, and I ask my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time.   The SPEED Recovery Act will expedite the approval process for FEMA's  small projects within the Public Assistance Program, or PA program.   I am proud to join Chairman DeFazio, Ranking Member Graves, and my  subcommittee ranking member, Mr. Webster, in bringing this bill  forward.   PA helps communities remove debris, implement emergency protective  services, and repair damage to public buildings and infrastructure.   The public assistance approval process can be lengthy and  complicated, and that is why, as you have heard, the 1988 Stafford Act  ordered FEMA to simplify the procedure for small projects that might  not have the capacity or resources to deal with the red tape and  complicated grant process.   The cost for completing a small project, however, is not the same as  it was in 1988 when this was first established. Stakeholders have  reported to Congress, and I heard during a hearing of my subcommittee  back in October, that the small projects the program was intended to  cover are now unqualified. This legislation will raise the qualifying  project threshold, and this updated threshold will speed the  postdisaster recovery process and help us to make our communities get  back on their feet.   I support this. You heard it; that it is commonsense legislation. I  ask my colleagues to do the same, use some common sense and vote to  support this.
