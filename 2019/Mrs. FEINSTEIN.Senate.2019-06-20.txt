 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the  Drought Resiliency and Water Supply Improvement Act, which Senator Cory  Gardner (R-CO) introduced today. I am the lead Democratic sponsor on  the bill, and Senators Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ)  are also original cosponsors.   Drought--increasingly severe and prolonged drought--is a stark  reality for California and the West. Climate change presents a triple  threat to our water supply:   Higher temperatures causing a dwindling snowpack, increased  evaporation and other effects that will reduce our natural storage and  runoff. This could decrease flow in the Colorado River by 20% or more  by mid-century and as much as 40% by the end of the century.   Longer and more severe droughts, including perhaps as much as an 80%  chance of a megadrought of 20 to 50 years' duration in the Colorado  Basin during this century.   Although this is more uncertain, the possibility of reduced overall  precipitation, perhaps 10-15% less in California's Sierra Nevada  mountains within the next 20-30 years.   We must respond to this challenge. The bill we are introducing today  does so in three fundamental ways:   It significantly increases funding for an ``all-of-the above''  solution to improve our water supply, including surface and groundwater  storage, conveyance, water recycling and desalination;   It reforms the Bureau of Reclamation's outdated project delivery  system to more quickly approve and more cost-effectively fund new  projects; and   It significantly invests not only in water supply projects, but also  in environmental restoration to help imperiled species adapt to climate  change as well.   Climate Change and Drought: I would like to say more about the  effects of climate change on two critical areas for California: the  Sierra Nevada Mountains, and the Colorado River Basin.   Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory scientists project that climate  change will cause a 54 percent drop in the Sierras' snowpack within the  next 20 to 40 years and a 79 percent drop by the end of the century.  This change alone could be devastating for California, because we  absolutely depend on this snowpack. The Sierra snowpack provides 30% of  our water supply and is our biggest reservoir. We need to start now to  provide substitute ways for storing precipitation in the Sierras,  whether through surface storage, groundwater storage, or improved  infrastructure to transport floodwaters to the best recharge areas.   This enhanced storage in its many forms will be helpful not only for  water users but also to maintain enough cold water for salmon. Cold  water reserves are critical to prevent salmon runs from being wiped out  during years of devastating droughts.   The outlook for the Colorado Basin is perhaps even more challenging.  The Colorado River provides a critical part of the water supply for 19  million people in southern California, but that water supply is  diminishing. Already in 2019 the water demands on the Colorado River  exceed average inflows to the river by 1.2 million to 1.5 million acre  feet each year.   That is a huge gap, and the Drought Contingency Plan that was just  negotiated among the 7 Colorado River Basin states represents just the  beginning of efforts needed to close even the existing gap. With  climate change, far more needs to be done, especially with warmer  temperatures and greatly increased evaporation in the Basin and with  the considerable odds of a megadrought of 20 to 50 years' duration.   The bill we are introducing today provides the Colorado River Basin  States with the tools to begin investing in a wide range of water  supply projects to meet this challenge. I believe this bill will be  critical for helping reach agreement in the next round of negotiations  for Colorado River drought contingency plans due to be completed by  2026.   Funding Authorizations in the Bill: In response to the water supply  challenges presented by climate change, the bill we are introducing  today significantly increases funding authorizations for a wide variety  of water supply and environmental restoration projects.   The proposed legislation builds on and doubles the 5-year funding  authorizations in the 2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the  Nation (WIIN) Act. The bill authorizes the following funding over the  next 5 years:   $670 million for surface and groundwater storage projects, and  supporting conveyance;   $100 million for water recycling projects; and   $60 million for desalination projects.   In addition, the bill authorizes $140 million for environmental  restoration and compliance projects. These projects include forest,  meadow and watershed restoration projects with water benefits and  projects to help restore threatened and endangered species affected by  Bureau of Reclamation water projects.   Low-Interest Loans for Water Supply Projects: The bill creates a new  loan program at 30-year Treasury rates (currently about 2.6%) for water  supply projects known as the Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and  Innovation Act (RIFIA). The loans would use existing criteria under the  successful WIFIA program (the Water Infrastructure Finance and  Innovation Act).   The Office of Management and the Budget (OMB) has approved loans of  $2.3 billion for WIFIA in fiscal year 2018 backed by appropriations of  just over 1% of that amount or $25 million in budget authority. OMB was  able to approve loans backed by just 1% of the loan amount because  there is a virtually non-existent default rate for water projects. Only  4 in a thousand water infrastructure projects default, based on a study  conducted by the Fitch credit rating agency.   Given OMB's experience that Federal outlays need only cover 1% of the  loan cost for water projects, the $125 million in authorized Federal  spending in the draft bill likely could support $12.5 billion in water  project lending authority.   Needless to say, $12.5 billion is a meaningful amount of Federal low- interest lending assistance for new water supply projects. And, because  RIFIA is limited to no more than 49 percent of total project costs,  that same $125 million in RIFIA budget authority will support no less  than $25.5 billion in new water infrastructure investments throughout  the west.   Need to Improve Reclamation's Project Delivery System: The bill not  only increases funding for drought resiliency projects, it expedites  their approvals and assists them more cost-effectively, stretching  taxpayer dollars further.   The traditional Bureau of Reclamation model for approving and funding  new water supply projects has involved the following:   Reclamation studies new projects in detail, which can take a decade  or more for major projects:   Once Reclamation's studies are complete, Congress authorizes projects  individually, which can take another 3-5 years or more in many cases;  and   Congress then funds 100% of the project construction cost over many  years of incremental appropriations, with project sponsors paying back  the federal government over 50 years at little to no interest.   One can quickly see that this model can end up taking decades to  construct significant new water supply projects. This is especially the  case given the limitations of Federal budgets and the increasing cost  of major projects in recent years. Given the tremendous challenge posed  by climate change to Western water supply, we need a nimbler and more  responsive model.   Mike Connor, the Deputy Secretary of the Interior during the Obama  Administration, testified in support of a new model during an October  8, 2015 hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources. Deputy Secretary Connor stated:         The traditional Reclamation business model, in which       feasibility studies, consistent with the 1983 Principles and       Guidelines for Water and Related Resources Development, are       first authorized, funded, and submitted to Congress, and then       construction is authorized and funded, does not always       address the needs of project sponsors at the State and local       levels. Moreover, given budget limitations and the       availability of other available financing mechanisms, the  [[Page S4175]]       historic federal role in financing water storage projects       through the Bureau of Reclamation must be revisited with a       greater emphasis on non-federal financing.    Changes to Traditional Model: In response to the concerns articulated  by Deputy Secretary Connor and others, the bill we are introducing  today, building on the WIIN Act, makes five significant changes to the  traditional Reclamation model. These changes expedite project approvals  and make more cost-effective use of available federal funding.   1) Congressional authorization no longer required:   First, the bill eliminates the need for Congress to authorize  individual projects. It can take 3-5 years for projects to get  legislatively approved or longer. In fact, zero new water recycling  projects have been authorized since 2009 due to the Federal earmark  ban.   While Congressional authorizations are no longer required, Congress  retains full veto authority over which projects get built through the  appropriations process. Unless Congress approves funding for the study  and construction of individual projects, Reclamation cannot proceed  with them.   The advantage of the appropriations process as an alternative  mechanism for Congressional approval is that it occurs every year. So  rather than waiting 3-5 years or longer for Congressional approval  under the traditional model, Congress decides each year whether or not  to fund proposed projects.   2) Non-Federal funding is required upfront:   Second, the bill no longer requires 100% federal funding upfront as  was necessary under the traditional Reclamation model. Instead, the  bill allows a maximum of 50% Federal funding for Federally-owned  projects, and a maximum of 25% federal funding for non-federal projects  that are built by States, water districts, or Indian tribes.   Federal dollars can be stretched further by the partnerships with  States and water districts that will be fostered under the bill. For  example, the proposed expansion of Los Vaqueros Reservoir in California  would be funded 50% by the State of California, which has already  conditionally awarded funding, in addition to potentially 10-25% by the  federal government and the remaining 25-40% by water users.   Multi-partner projects like the Los Vaqueros expansion will  frequently have multiple benefits. For example, much of the State and  Federal funding for the Los Vaqueros expansion would go to augment the  water supply of wildlife refuges that provide essential water for  migratory birds on the Pacific flyway. These benefits would complement  the project's water supply benefits for many Bay Area water districts.    3) Feasibility studies are expedited:   Third, for the non-Federal projects authorized by the bill, the  federal study process would be significantly expedited, and it does so  without waiving any environmental protection requirements. The bill  makes clear that federal environmental laws must be fully and strictly  followed.   Existing law, however, already addresses study procedures in parallel  circumstances when the nonfederal entities are building a project and  the federal government is only responsible for a minority of the  project cost, no more than 25%. In these circumstances, the Federal  government can and should expeditiously approve feasibility and other  preliminary studies. There is existing precedent for such projects in  the guidelines adopted by the Bureau of Reclamation for feasibility  studies for water recycling projects under the Title XVI program. Like  all the non-federal projects in this bill, these water recycling  projects are built by non-federal entities with a maximum 25% federal  cost-share.   The bill we are introducing today would direct Reclamation to model  its feasibility study standards for all non-federal projects based on  the Title XVI example. This will reduce delays in project approval and  get these projects built faster.   4) The new loan program is cost-effective:   Fourth, the low-interest loan program created by the bill is an  exceptionally cost-effective program. As I mentioned above, OMB has  validated that low-interest water project loans need to be backed by  Federal appropriations totaling only 1% of the project loan amount.   Federal funding of 1% of the loan amount will typically return 10-25%  savings in the repayment cost of the loans for the water districts  funding the projects. The total savings can be about 10% for AAA rated  districts, and 20-25% for AA-rated districts.   For example, the water users who are supporting the proposed Sites  Reservoir in northern California have estimated that the loans  authorized by this bill would allow them to pay only $512/acre-foot for  water delivered by the project instead of $682/acre-foot. This is a 25%  reduction in their costs.   Thus, the Federal government can provide a loan at 1% of the loan  amount and save the project sponsors 10-25% of the project cost. That  is an exceptionally cost-effective federal investment.   There are at least three significant reasons that the loans are so  beneficial for the project sponsors:   The sponsors pay about a 2.6% interest rate on their loans based on  today's rates, versus 4% or greater rates for the alternative of  municipal bond financing.   The districts would not need to start loan repayments until 5 years  after substantial completion of the project, a substantial cost saver.   Loans are for 35 rather than 30 years, lowering annual debt service  costs.   Significantly, the loans include all the taxpayer protections from  the successful WIFIA and TIFIA (Transportation Infrastructure Finance  and Innovation Act) programs. In particular, the RIFIA loans would be  limited to 49% of the project cost, and the federal loans would have  senior status in the event of any default. These provisions ensure the  taxpayer won't be harmed in any default where the project retains at  least 50% of its value, which is extremely likely for ratepayer backed  water supply projects.   5) Federal grants and loans work together:   Fifth, the combination of low-interest loans and Federal grants of up  to 25% of project costs for non-Federal projects can allow water users  to make up the difference where the Federal government is no longer  funding 100% of project costs up front. Many rural communities, and in  particular agricultural communities, are not able to pay 100% of the  cost of new water supply projects.   Under the bill we are introducing today, these communities will still  have to provide a significant cost-share for improving their water  supplies, and new water projects will have to be cost-effective enough  to justify that investment. However, the Federal government can help  build the best and most effective projects in increasing drought  resiliency by providing assistance through both grants and loans.   Environmental Benefits: The longer and more severe droughts coming  with climate change will adversely affect not just farms and cities,  but also the natural environment. The bill includes provisions to  improve species' drought resiliency as well.   The significant funding authorization of $140 million for  environmental restoration can be used to benefit many different  species, including fish, migratory birds, and forest species. Some of  the authorized uses of this funding include:   Improved habitat for salmon, Delta smelt and other fish species  adversely affected by the Bureau of Reclamation's water projects;   Additional water for wildlife refuges hosting migratory birds along  the Pacific flyway;   Improved stream gauges, monitoring and science to better understand  how to restore species and to operate Reclamation water projects with  reduced environmental impacts;   Assistance in implementing water-related settlements with State  agencies and state water quality laws; and   Forest, meadow and watershed restoration efforts that improve the  quality, timing, or other attributes of runoff to reservoirs or  groundwater storage facilities.   I want to say a little more about the new authorization for forest,  meadow and watershed restoration projects with water benefits. Wildfire  and drought are two of our biggest challenges in California, and we  need new tools to respond to them.   There are national forest lands and meadows upstream of many  reservoirs  [[Page S4176]]  in California that are at serious risk of catastrophic fire.   If treatments of these lands restore healthier ecological conditions,  it will improve water runoff into the downstream reservoirs and reduce  the risk of large sedimentation dumps into the reservoirs from  catastrophic fires.   Restoration of these lands may not be a top priority for the Forest  Service because that agency's mission does not emphasize water  benefits.   The bill being introduced today would authorize the Bureau of  Reclamation to contribute a portion of the cost of these projects. The  new funding source will in turn make these multi-benefit projects more  likely to be implemented.   I believe it is critical that we develop new tools like this one for  reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires, and improving our drought  resiliency.   I and the other cosponsors of today's bill are also looking for  additional ways to increase the natural environment's resiliency to  droughts in our states. We have circulated language for discussion and  potential inclusion in the bill that would provide additional funding  for ``natural water storage projects.''   These projects would help restore stream and river channels with  natural materials like wetlands. Like many other projects prioritized  by the bill, these projects could have multiple benefits, including  increased groundwater recharge, improved flood protection, and  increased floodplain habitat to benefit salmon and other species.   We look forward to receiving comments on ways to prioritize multi- benefit projects like natural water storage projects as we move forward  with the bill.   In addition, the bill makes clear that it must be implemented  consistently with all federal environmental laws, including the  Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the  Clean Water Act and all other environmental laws. All applicable state  laws must also be followed.   Offsets: Finally, the bill includes two provisions offsetting the new  spending authorizations within it:   It extends the existing WIIN Act provisions allowing water districts  to prepay their outstanding capital debts and convert to indefinite  length water supply contracts. These provisions are expected to bring  in additional revenue within the 10-year scoring window.   It sets up a process to deauthorize inactive water recycling project  authorizations.   Conclusion: California is home to more than 40 million people, but  our major state-wide water infrastructure hasn't significantly changed  in the past 50 years, when we had only 16 million people.   We must modernize the system or we risk becoming a desert state.   I believe that this bill will place California on a long-term path to  drought resiliency. Critically, this means putting in place  infrastructure to allow our cities, our farmers, and our natural  communities to withstand the severe droughts that we are projected to  face due to climate change.   I hope my Western colleagues will join me and the others who have  introduced this bill, because drought is a serious threat for all of  our states. Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                            ____________________
