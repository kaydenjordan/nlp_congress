 Mr. President, the Constitution charges the Senate  with giving advice and, if we choose, providing our consent to the  President's judicial appointments.   The President nominates somebody whom he thinks ought to serve on the  Federal bench, and then the nominee comes here to the Senate for a job  interview. Sometimes these job interviews make news because they go  spectacularly well.   When the Judiciary Committee subjected now-Justice Amy Coney Barrett  to a battery of questions a little over 2 years ago, she literally  dazzled the country with her force of intellect. At one point, hours  into a hearing, after being asked multipart questions about the finer  points of constitutional law, now-Justice Barrett was asked to hold up  the notepad she had been provided to keep everything straight, and it  was completely blank. She hadn't even touched it.   Justice Barrett is an intellectual outlier by any standard, but she  is an appropriate stand-in for the judicial nominees whom Republican  Senators confirmed from 2017 through 2020. As one left-leaning analysis  admitted in 2020, ``based solely on objective legal credentials''-- ``solely on objective legal credentials''--the last administration's  average pick for the Federal bench had ``a far more impressive resume  than any past president's nominees.'' They had more circuit court  clerkships, more Supreme Court clerkships--objectively, more experience  in the Federal judiciary.   Under President Biden, though, with his nominees, well, you might say  things have gone somewhat differently.   Last week, our colleague on the Judiciary Committee from Louisiana,  Senator Kennedy, was quizzing a panel of President Biden's nominees,  and he decided to try some very simple questions that should have been  beyond basic for anybody nominated to serve as a U.S. district judge.  He asked one nominee, currently a superior court judge in Spokane  County, WA, to simply explain what article V of the Constitution says.  That would be the article that explains how the Constitution gets  amended. Here was the nominee's response:         Article V is not coming to mind at the moment.    Senator Kennedy came back with another, even more basic question. He  asked:         How about article II?    As high schoolers across America learn each year, article II sets up  the Presidency and the executive branch. It establishes the President's  powers, including the power to nominate the person for the vacancy in  question. But this sitting judge drew another blank.  [[Page S154]]  Article II wasn't coming to mind either--goodness gracious.   Then she flunked yet another question about legal philosophy, and,  then again, she flunked still another question about the most  controversial Supreme Court case this term.   Apparently, when this particular nominee had been asked to list the  top 10 most impactful cases she had litigated in court, she could only  come up with 6. At no stage of her professional career has the judge  focused on Federal law. At no point had she ever even appeared in  Federal court.   So get this. In one of these six most significant cases she took, she  lost to a defendant who forewent legal counsel and took the risky step  of representing herself. This wasn't some rooky mistake either. The  nominee was over a decade out of law school when she lost to an  unrepresented party in one of her biggest cases.   Is this the caliber of legal expert with which President Biden is  filling the Federal bench--for lifetime appointments? Is the bar for  merit and excellence really set this low?   For years, now, Washington Democrats' rhetoric about judicial  nominations has often treated actual qualifications as an afterthought.  Democrats were not particularly impressed or moved by top-shelf  professional excellence or the academic brilliance that the last  Republican administration's nominees possessed, literally, in spades.  And, apparently, they don't count those qualities as particularly high  priorities now that they are the ones doing the nominating.   The American people deserve an impartial judiciary that is full of  the finest legal minds our country has to offer. The American people  deserve the best and the brightest.   Alas, but sadly, the Biden administration's questionable  constitutional judgment is not limited to some of their judicial  nominations. In one important constitutional case after another, the  Biden administration and his lawyers have come down on the wrong side  of the American people's rights and liberties and have gotten slapped  down in court as a result.   This last year, for example, in the Bruen case, the Biden  administration threw its weight behind unconstitutional New York State  restrictions on the Second Amendment that plainly violated citizens'  rights to keep and bear arms. President Biden sent one of his top  lawyers to help with the oral arguments, but the Democrats got the  Constitution backward and lost the case.   In West Virginia v. EPA, President Biden went all in trying to defend  massive unconstitutional overreach by his own Environmental Protection  Agency. His Solicitor General argued the case herself, but the  administration lost badly. The plain meaning of our laws and our  Constitution actually won out.   In Carson v. Makin, President Biden fought to maintain  unconstitutional anti-religious discrimination in school voucher  programs. Again, he lost, and the American people and their  Constitution won.   Washington Democrats had their blatantly unconstitutional vaccine  mandate for the private sector tossed out by the Supreme Court. They  had their obviously illegal top-down mask mandate for transportation  tossed out by a district judge. Oh, and, by the way, when the judge was  nominated, Democrats howled that she was unqualified. But with a  Supreme Court clerkship under her belt, she had incomparably more  experience in Federal court than the nominee who failed Senator  Kennedy's bar exam.   Over and over, on issue after issue, this Democratic administration  sides against the American people, against the Constitution, and  against the rule of law.   The American people deserve an administration that respects their  rights and liberties, that understands our Constitution, and that  chooses both policies and nominees accordingly.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
