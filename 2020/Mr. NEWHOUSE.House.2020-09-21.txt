 Mr. Speaker, this is a monumental day. I am proud to  rise alongside my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to speak out in  support of our legislation, which aims to address a crisis afflicting  our Nation: that of missing and murdered indigenous women.   I hail from the State of Washington, and I am very familiar with how  Native American Tribes are deeply integrated into the culture of the  Pacific Northwest, as well as our whole country.   I was raised just across the river from the Yakama Nation reservation  in central Washington, but I have got to say, I, like many others, was  not aware of the disproportionate murder rate indigenous women suffer,  10 times the national average.   At the end of 2018, this crisis and the need for a solution was  brought to me by the Tribal communities that I represent, and I was  made aware of just how devastating the shortfalls of our justice system  are for Native American and Alaska Native women and girls.   While the statistics we have are absolutely staggering--and you have  heard them--the fact of the matter is we don't even know the full  extent of the crisis.   In my home State of Washington, Native Americans make up about 2  percent of the State's population, but a recent report by the  Washington State Patrol shows that indigenous women account for 7  percent of the State's reported missing women. The families of dozens  of women still await answers as cases of missing or murdered indigenous  women remain open or turn cold.   Yet this crisis has gone on for decades, with little to no action by  the Federal Government. Complicated law enforcement jurisdictions have  caused many problems throughout these investigations, and far too many  Tribal law enforcement agencies lack the resources or access to  critical databases to help solve these cases, which is why, when  Savanna's Act failed to receive a vote on the House floor in the 115th  Congress, I was determined to bring forward solutions in order to get  this bill signed into law.   I was very proud to work with Representatives Torres and Haaland and  others, in collaboration with Tribes, the Department of Justice, and  many others, to improve upon that legislation. The product is a broadly  bipartisan bill that has passed unanimously in both the House Judiciary  Committee as well as the United States Senate.   We worked to create legislation that will bring focus to this crisis  and improve the coordination between Federal, State, local, and Tribal  law enforcement agencies.    This legislation aims to provide a sense of hope to the loved ones of  these women by developing guidelines and best practices for Tribes and  law enforcement agencies across the country, by enhancing reporting and  recordkeeping of crimes against indigenous women, and by improving  communication between law enforcement and the families of these  victims.   This bill and this effort to bring awareness to the missing and  murdered Native women across the country will go a long way to finally  delivering justice to our communities.   Tribes across the country, including those that I represent, have  thrown their support behind this legislation. In fact, last year, I  walked alongside the then-chairman of the Yakama Tribe, as well as  Councilwoman Lottie Sam, through the Halls of Congress, visiting  Chairman Grijalva, Subcommittee Chairman Gallego, as well as  Subcommittee Chairwoman Bass. These Yakama Nation officials traveled  across the country, Mr. Speaker, more than 2,500 miles, to advocate for  the passage of Savanna's Act and other legislation to address this  crisis.   The bill is named, as you have heard the story, in honor of Savanna  LaFontaine-Greywind, who was a 22-year-old member of the Spirit Lake  Tribe, pregnant with her first child, who was murdered in August of  2017.   Since the introduction of Savanna's Act in the House, the remains of  a Yakama Nation woman, Rosenda Strong, were found on the reservation.  Her horrific murder, today, remains unsolved.   Thankfully, justice was served upon Savanna's murderers. We owe the  same justice to Rosenda and all of the missing and murdered indigenous  women across this country.   The passage of this bill today will demonstrate a long-awaited and  necessary change. As I mentioned, this crisis has been going on for  decades. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have promised action  and failed to deliver.                                time  1400    I have been asked: What is different now? Why do you think progress  can be made?   And I can honestly tell you, the main difference I have seen is that  our Native communities are leading the charge. They have had enough,  and they no longer will suffer in silence.   Throughout central Washington and across the country, the families of  loved ones of thousands of missing or murdered indigenous women are  awaiting justice.   It is because of their voices and their strong advocacy that I am  here today, urging my colleagues throughout this legislative body to  support passage of Savanna's Act. And, finally, Mr. Speaker, we can  send this legislation to President Trump's desk to be signed into law.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from North Dakota (Mr.  Armstrong) for yielding to me on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support a  bipartisan piece of legislation that will finally foster progress  toward addressing the crisis  [[Page H4581]]  that we know is plaguing our Native communities across the country.   Despite unparalleled rates of violence, there is still no reliable  way of knowing how many indigenous women go missing each year nor whose  fate hangs in the balance of an unsolved murder case.   My congressional district in central Washington has been particularly  affected by this crisis. Since the year 2013, there have been 13 cases  of missing or murdered indigenous women on or around the Yakama  Reservation alone.   This number accounts only for the land surrounding one of the 29  federally recognized Tribes in Washington State, let alone the hundreds  of others across the country. This information is available only due to  the efforts and activism of local communities.   Tribal and community leaders have held multiple marches, vigils, and  community forums to raise awareness and demand action.   The diligent reporting of the Yakima Herald-Republic, our local  newspaper, has highlighted the response and activism on the ground by  creating an online hub to list open cases involving missing and  murdered women and providing resources for the community to report such  disappearances.   Recently passed State laws in Olympia have enhanced data collection  and improved communication between Tribal leaders, law enforcement, and  various State agencies.   These local leaders have given a voice to the crisis, and I am  heartened to see that the Federal Government is finally taking action.  For too long, indigenous women and Native communities have faced this  crisis all alone and suffered in silence.   The Trump administration has worked to bring this crisis to light,  creating an interagency task force between the Departments of Justice  and the Interior called Operation Lady Justice.   I was proud to welcome Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs Tara  Sweeney to central Washington last December, where she highlighted the  administration's effort to deliver justice to Native American  communities. But Secretary Sweeney echoed the concerns of local leaders  and myself by pointing out the need for congressional action.   By sending this bill to President Trump's desk, we are signaling that  we have heard them and that they are no longer invisible.   As Congress takes long-overdue action to address the crisis of  missing and murdered indigenous women, I urge my colleagues to join me  in supporting the Not Invisible Act.
