 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Illinois,  Representative Shimkus, for his steadfast leadership on this very  important issue.   I rise today, as well, to lend my support to H.R. 3053, the Nuclear  Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018.   Mr. Chairman, America lacks the necessary geological repository for  important nuclear power resources. Because of this, spent nuclear fuel  currently sits idle in over 100 communities across 39 States. This  deficiency has cost electricity ratepayers over $40 billion with little  to nothing to show for the exorbitant cost.   H.R. 3053 makes long overdue reforms to the Nuclear Waste Fund and  facilitates the formal licensing process for the repository at Yucca  Mountain. It provides a commonsense, bipartisan interim solution for  the safe storage of nuclear waste.   Most importantly, H.R. 3053 ensures that this safe, efficient form of  energy can continue to expand and be utilized in the United States,  such as Georgia's Plant Vogtle.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3053 is much-needed legislation that will finally  ensure the safe disposal of nuclear waste  [[Page H3900]]  in this country. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
