 Mr. Speaker, as the designee of the majority leader,  pursuant to House Resolution 5, I call up H. Res. 11, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 11.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 11, a resolution  Establishing the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between  the United States and the Chinese Communist Party. This select  committee will be charged with addressing the urgent threat to the  United States and our allies posed by the Chinese Communist Party.   Mr. Speaker, the ongoing threat posed by Communist China and the fact  that the CCP cannot be trusted as a global party has been apparent to  the American people for some time.   In 2019, at the behest of then-Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy,  House Republicans created the China Task Force to review Communist  China's actions and to make policy recommendations to protect U.S.  interests against the Chinese Communist Party. Republicans sought to  make this task force bipartisan and extended an open invitation to  Democrats to join us. Unfortunately, House Democrats chose not to  participate at that time. I hope they do at this time.   The China Task Force ultimately produced a report with more than 400  policy recommendations, many of them bipartisan. Today, we are taking  the next logical step with the creation of a select committee empowered  to investigate and respond to the counterintelligence and economic  espionage threat that threatens our very way of life. Make no mistake,  Mr. Speaker, the Chinese Communist Party has demonstrated time and time  again that it is more interested in being America's foe than America's  friend.   The events of the past 3 years have brought into stark focus how  Communist China's actions affect the United States and the rest of the  world. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began inside China's borders, the  world has experienced constant disruptions and chaos. Indeed, Communist  China's approach to the COVID-19 pandemic is emblematic of its approach  to many other things: attempting to cover up the pandemic's existence,  resisting all efforts to investigate its origins, committing horrific  human rights abuses, and refusing to work productively with the global  community to combat the pandemic.   It has also become apparent that far too many economically critical  supply chains are tied to China, which threatens our economic and  national security. We are dangerously dependent on China for basic  building blocks of our economy. The result is shortages of critical  products, like semiconductors and rare earth minerals, both of which  are largely produced in China today, along with the shortages of  pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment, which threatens our  ability to battle future pandemics. Our national and economic security  requires us to secure our vulnerable supply chains and, indeed, to  bring them back home to America.   Communist China has also undertaken aggressive actions designed to  expand their influence both in the United States and abroad. Communist  China is a prolific thief of American intellectual property, violating  countless patents, and failing to respect international and domestic  intellectual property laws.   They have undertaken a systematic effort to infiltrate American  colleges and universities through their support of the so-called  Confucius Institutes and other organizations designed to spread Chinese  propaganda.   Chinese spy networks operate both on American soil and in cyberspace.  And popular Chinese-owned apps like TikTok spread more propaganda and  take massive amounts of Americans' personal data back to the Chinese  Government.   In addition, the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative has spread the  tentacles of the so-called People's Liberation Army throughout the  world, particularly the developing world, and has ensnared dozens of  developing countries in debt-trap diplomacy.   Communist China continues to aggressively push into the South China  Sea and militarize small islands, threatening freedom of navigation in  this strategically important region. They relentlessly and aggressively  provoke Taiwan, an island that demonstrates to the world what a free,  democratic, and capitalist China could look like.   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is Communist China is a serious,  generational threat that we must address before it is too late. China  exhibits expanding economic and military power coupled with the  uncompromising rejection of our values and those of our allies.   That is why the Select Committee on Strategic Competition Between the  United States and the Chinese Communist Party is so critical. It will  be charged with reviewing our economic dependence on China and  restoring safe and secure supply chains, on reviewing China's actions  toward the United States and our allies, on restoring American domestic  institutions to protect them against Chinese infiltration and  propaganda, and so much more.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members on both sides of the aisle to join me  in support of this resolution so we can stand united against Communist  China.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H123]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished Speaker of the House of  Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), who is the chairman-designate  of the proposed select committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Zinke), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Spartz), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Waltz), my very good friend and distinguished veteran in service  to the United States and now in the Congress of the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Mills), my very good friend who also has rendered distinguished  service to our country in uniform.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith), my very good friend and a distinguished Member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I begin by thanking my friend for the debate and for his tremendous  work in holding China accountable in the human rights area.   I am certainly confident the Speaker will do as he said, and we will  have a committee both sides can be proud of.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution  creating a Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the  United States and the Chinese Communist Party.   It is beyond dispute that Communist China poses an urgent  generational threat to the United States' interests and values. America  has become far too economically dependent on China in recent decades,  and as a result, our supply chains have become dangerously fragile. We  must urgently take steps to secure our supply chains and bring them  home.   The Chinese Communist Party continues to push the envelope, both in  the United States and abroad. They steal American intellectual  property. They build spy networks and propaganda machines on American  soil. They threaten our allies in Asia and the South China Sea. They  have spread their influence throughout the developing world, seeking to  ensnare vulnerable developing countries in debt-trap diplomacy.   Mr. Speaker, the time has come for the House of Representatives to  take a comprehensive look at Communist China. We must build on the  excellent work done by the China Task Force in 2019 and 2020. We must  investigate China's actions and respond appropriately to ensure America  confronts this very grave threat.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on this resolution,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr.  Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.      The online version has been corrected to read: The question was  taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.  Mr. Speaker, as the designee of the majority leader,  pursuant to House Resolution 5, I call up the resolution (H. Res. 12)  establishing a Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal  Government as a select investigative subcommittee of the Committee on  the Judiciary, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 12.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 12, a resolution  establishing the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the  Federal Government.   This select subcommittee is modeled on the famous Church Committee,  which investigated the American intelligence community in the 1970s and  uncovered and exposed a wide variety of abuses, including many directed  against American citizens.   Similar to the situation that confronted America in the 1970s, in  recent years we have witnessed abuses of the civil liberties of  American citizens committed by the executive branch.   The select subcommittee will operate as a select investigative  subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee and will be tasked with  studying and reporting on the executive branch's authority to collect  information on or otherwise investigate citizens of the United States.   It will investigate how executive branch agencies work with and  exchange information with the private sector and other government  agencies to facilitate action against American citizens; how executive  branch agencies collect, compile, analyze, use, or disseminate  information about citizens of the United States; the laws, programs,  and activities of the executive branch as they relate to the collection  of information on citizens of the United States; and any other issues  related to the violation of the civil liberties of American citizens.   Mr. Speaker, it is undeniable that, in recent years, the executive  branch of the Federal Government has abused its authority and violated  the civil liberties of American citizens, often for political purposes.  There are many examples to point to, ranging from a father being  labeled a ``domestic terrorist'' for confronting a school board over  the sexual assault of his daughter, to the Federal Government's role in  suppressing information on Twitter, to the Department of Homeland  Security's plans to create a Disinformation Governance Board, and to  the revelations regarding the FBI's abuse of its Foreign Intelligence  and Surveillance Act authority.   All these examples and many more demonstrate how prevalent such  abusive actions have become.   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve to have confidence in their  government. They deserve to know that the broad powers granted through  the Federal Government to the FBI, to the Department of Homeland  Security, and to the intelligence agencies are not being abused. They  deserve to know that the executive branch is not positioning itself as  the final arbiter of what constitutes truth. They deserve to know that  they will not be labeled a domestic terrorist for advocating for their  children in front of a school board.   Mr. Speaker, it was Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis who stated  that ``sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.'' At the end  of the day, that is the purpose of the select subcommittee. It will  bring abuses by the Federal Government into the light for the American  people and ensure that Congress, as their elected representatives, can  take appropriate action to remedy them.   I have confidence that this select subcommittee will accomplish that  goal.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Jordan), who is my very good friend and the distinguished incoming  chairman of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Comer), my very good friend, the incoming chairman of the  Oversight Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Turner), my very good friend and the distinguished incoming  chairman of the Intelligence Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Zinke), my very good friend and a distinguished veteran  who served the United States in a variety of capacities, in and out of  uniform.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Mrs. Boebert), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Colorado.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from North Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger), my very good friend, who served the  country in and out of uniform.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock), who is my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the  great State of Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend that I am prepared to  close whenever he is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this  resolution creating the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the  Federal Government.   In the 1970s it was apparent from revelations in the popular press  that the American intelligence community had committed abuses as part  of their activities. In response, Congress created the Church Committee  which investigated these abuses and brought them into the light.  [[Page H143]]    Today, it is again apparent that the Federal Government has been  weaponized for political purposes. Like the Church Committee--which  this subcommittee is modeled on--the Select Subcommittee on the  Weaponization of the Federal Government will investigate the abuse of  Americans' civil liberties and bring them into the light. I am  confident that this subcommittee will do the American people a great  service. They deserve to have confidence in their government, and that  confidence starts with ensuring that the vast powers of the executive  branch are not abused.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on the resolution,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
