 Mr. Speaker, on May 21, 2023, NASCAR's All-Star Race will  return to North Wilkesboro Speedway for the first time in more than a  quarter century.   Since its inception in 1947, North Wilkesboro Speedway has hosted 93  NASCAR Cup races, and has attracted household names, from Richard Petty  to Dale Earnhardt, Sr.   Mr. Speaker, NASCAR's grassroots return to this historic track--its  former stomping grounds--is a testament to the rich history of  motorsports in western North Carolina.   Generations of North Carolinians and motorsports enthusiasts from  around the country will gather and watch history be made in North  Carolina's Fifth District.   Though this event is months away, the anticipation and energy within  the community are very palpable. We look forward to this event.                            ____________________
