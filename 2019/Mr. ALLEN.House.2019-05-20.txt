 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the importance of H.R.  2480, the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, which we  just passed in the House with overwhelming bipartisan support.  [[Page H3999]]    Although we are facing challenging times and political divide in our  Nation, one thing we can absolutely agree on is this: Child abuse and  neglect are heartbreaking, immoral, and simply inexcusable.   As many of you know, the opioid epidemic has devastated families and  communities across our country, which has been a major factor in the  recent uptick in child abuse and neglect cases.   H.R. 2480 assists States in addressing this recent increase in child  neglect by improving data collaboration between States, strengthening  accountability, supporting evidence-based services, and developing best  practices for reducing child neglect linked to parental substance  abuse.   Most importantly, it provides parents with parental education and  leadership skills developed to help keep them and their families safe  and together.   We have a duty to ensure that American children are protected from  maltreatment and neglect, and the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and  Treatment Act sets us on the right path to do so.                            ____________________
