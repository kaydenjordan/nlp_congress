 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 297, line 21, after the dollar amount insert       ``(reduced by $118,017,000)''.         Page 298, line 11, after the dollar amount insert       ``(increased by $118,017,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Garamendi) and a Member opposed each will control  5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I think we ought to be on a roll here, given the last  amendment being accepted on a ``yes'' vote.   This amendment would make America more secure by focusing our very  limited tax dollars on programs to keep nuclear material out of the  hands of terrorists rather than excess national laboratory  infrastructure spending.   According to The Washington Post, the world dodged a bullet when ISIS  failed to realize that it had the ingredients for a dirty bomb under  its control in Mosul for more than 3 years. This underscores the  importance of the need for U.S. leadership and resources to secure  nuclear material around the world.   My amendment would provide an increase of $118 million for the  Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, DNN, funding. DNN funding includes  critical programs such as the nuclear smuggling and detection program,  which works with partner countries to improve intelligence, law  enforcement, and border security capabilities to detect nuclear  material trafficking.   It also supports programs to improve the security of radiological  material around the world and to remove it from areas when nuclear  materials cannot be adequately and safely secured.   The Make America Secure Appropriations Act makes significant cuts to  these programs which keep nuclear material out of the hands of  terrorists and those who would then use that material to do us harm.  For example, there is a 30 percent cut from the nuclear smuggling  detection funding, a 79 percent cut from the highly enriched uranium  reduction programs, and, overall, a $150 million cut to this program.   At the same time, the underlying legislation would increase by 38  percent, a plus-up above what the administration recommended for the  weapons activities infrastructure recapitalization budget line. This  increase was not requested by the administration and is not supported  by the Senate. The underlying bill already includes a $59 million  increase in infrastructure recapitalization spending and a $71 million  increase over the fiscal year 2017-enacted level for maintenance and  repair facilities.   We can go on and on. We have heard discussions here already about the  trillion-dollar-plus expansion of the nuclear weapons programs.   Specifically, this money that I would move out of this particular  infrastructure recapitalization account is for the construction of a  new facility to build nuclear plutonium pits. These pits are presumably  going to be needed for a weapon that is almost certainly not going to  be built, which is the interoperable new bomb.   The interoperable weapon is to go on existing and remodeled rockets  for the Navy and for the Air Force, neither of whom thinks it is a  particularly good idea. So that program, should it ever come to pass,  could be delayed, and we could then use this $118 million now to deal  with a known problem.   If, in the future, we decide that we need to be able to produce  somewhere between 30 and 80 new pits a year, there is time enough to do  that. The account that calls for the maintenance of the existing  facilities will provide sufficient funds to meet all of the known  needs, with the exception of the interoperable nuclear weapon, which,  in all probability, is not ever going to be built or needed.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the time remaining.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the time remaining.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2 minutes  remaining.    That might be sufficient, Mr. Chairman, although I  doubt I will persuade the worthy chairman with whom we have had this  little tussle back and forth.   The fact of the matter is that there are two accounts to deal with  this issue of the nuclear sites and the maintenance of them.                                time  2145    One is a maintenance facility, which is plussed-up and sufficient to  maintain and upgrade the existing facilities, particularly the  plutonium pit, the metallurgical facility, as well as continue the  construction of the highly enriched uranium facilities.  [[Page H6443]]    Those are already available and that money is in those accounts. It  turns out that this money for recapitalization is for the construction  of a new pit production facility. The NNSA claims that it needs that  facility to build additional pits beyond the 20 to 30 that could be  constructed in the refurbished existing pit.   The need for the new pit production facility is specifically for the  interoperable nuclear warhead, which is not likely to be needed. And  should it be decided at a future date to be needed, there is plenty of  time to build the facility and construct the additional nuclear  plutonium pits. The bottom line is that this money is not needed now  for that facility.   Could the money be used in the nonproliferation?   It could.   Why were those agreements delayed?   Because of many different reasons, but the fact of the matter is that  those agreements are going to be going forward. The fact of the matter  is that there is a continuing problem of loose nukes and materials  around the world, which can cause a problem. The Mosul situation is one  of many examples.   The cuts that do take place in smuggling, in research, and the like  are serious. We ought to be paying attention.   Mr. Chairman, I look forward to the continuation of this discussion,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 53 Offered by Ms. Rosen    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 53  printed in House Report 115-259.
