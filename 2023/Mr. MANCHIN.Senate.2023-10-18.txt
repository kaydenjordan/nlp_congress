 Madam President, on October 17, 2023, in a speech  offered by Mr. Cotton on the Senate floor, Mr. Cotton erroneously  indicated that I was not a cosponsor to S. 3041, a bill to reinstate  certain sanctions imposed with respect to Iran. Prior to Mr. Cotton's  speech on October 17, 2023, I requested to be added as a cosponsor to  S. 3041 and was added on that same day. Please let the Congressional  Record reflect this.                            ____________________
