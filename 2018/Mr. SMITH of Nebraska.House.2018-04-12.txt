 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time, and I  certainly appreciate the chairman's long-term commitment to the issue  of a balanced budget.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, providing States  the opportunity to add a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution.   Let me also say that amending our Constitution is something we should  never take lightly. When drafting our foundational document, our  Founders intended it to provide not just the outline of our Federal  Government, but also to restrict the powers of each branch through a  system of strong checks and balances.   We must also understand this amendment, if ratified, is still just  one part of addressing our current fiscal situation. We must still do  the hard work of looking at spending. Reducing spending, reforming  entitlements for the future, and encouraging the economic growth and  opportunity needed to eliminate our deficits in the short term, and  certainly pay down our debt in the long term.   This is a very vital first step, Mr. Speaker, in getting our Nation  on better fiscal footing, but we have a long road ahead.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this resolution.
