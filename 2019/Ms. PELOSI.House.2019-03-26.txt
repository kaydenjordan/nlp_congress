 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  thank him for his enthusiastic defense of the Constitution of the  United States.   Madam Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues to uphold the  Constitution and defend our democracy once again.   The House and the Senate came together, in great unity and  bipartisanship, to pass Congressman Joaquin Castro's resolution to  reject the President's lawless power grab, yet the President chose to  continue to defy the Constitution, the Congress, and the will of the  American people with a veto.   At the birth of our democracy, amid revolution and war, Thomas Paine  wrote that ``the times have found us.''   Once again, the times have found us to defend our democracy.   The times have found us to restore the Founders' vision of balance of  power, checks and balances, coequal branches of government, and restore  Congress' role as Article I, the first branch; Article I, the  legislative branch.   The times have found us to honor our oath to support and defend the  Constitution and protect the American people.   We all know that the heart of our Constitution, the beauty of it all,  is that we have a system of checks and balances.   Our Founders did not want a monarchy. That is what they had rejected.  They wanted a democracy: coequal branches of government to act as a  check on each other.   This Congress of the United States acted to honor the Constitution  and our responsibility to protect and defend by passing legislation in  our appropriations bill, showing how, in a bipartisan way, Congress  would protect our borders.   We understand our responsibility to do that. We don't take that  responsibility lightly. We take it seriously.   Even when the President disagreed with us, he should have accepted  the bipartisan, bicameral decision to proceed. He had taken pride in a  shutdown of Government for about 1 month because he didn't get his way  on the border.   After 1 month, bipartisan, bicameral action by the Congress sent him  a bill almost exactly like what he rejected in the first place, and he  decided to reject Congress' wisdom and Congress' acting within its  authority to protect our borders in a serious, effective, values-based  way.   We don't take this vote here today lightly. Even when the legislative  branch disagrees with the executive, we respect the office the  President holds and his right to veto legislation.   But when those decisions violate the Constitution, then that must be  stopped. Many of our colleagues from across the aisle joined last month  to defend our democracy by passing Congressman Castro's privileged  resolution.   That happened in the House. That happened in the United States  Senate.   We call on all of our colleagues to simply show that same measure of  respect for our Constitution today.   We take an oath to the Constitution, not to the President of the  United States. We take an oath that we must honor.   The choice is simple, between partisanship and patriotism, between  honoring our sacred oath or hypocritically, inconsistently, breaking  that oath.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong, bipartisan ``yes'' to override this  veto.    Madam Speaker, this is very important. We are going to  observe the 40th anniversary of C-SPAN. Are you ready for that? Are you  braced for the excitement of it all?   If that is not enough for you, today is my birthday. No singing. I  thank you so much, and I will convey those good wishes to C-SPAN as  well.   Madam Speaker, our Founders envisioned a people's House that would be  transparent and accountable to the American people. The very first  House sessions were made open to the public so that the American people  could see our debates and have their voices heard.   I rise to honor an institution that powerfully honors that legacy,  ensuring that our sessions can be a townhall for the Nation: the Cable- Satellite Public Affairs Network, C-SPAN.   Since its founding 40 years ago, C-SPAN has offered tens of millions  of Americans a front-row seat to democracy, training an unblinking eye  on Congress and the campaign trail, Presidents and parliaments, and so  much more.   We all know C-SPAN is a pillar of our public discourse and a beacon  of unbiased reporting, an institution so committed to objectivity and  impartiality that its founder never once uttered his own name on the  air throughout 33 years of interviews, roundtables, and lectures.   I thank Brian Lamb for his service to our democracy.   C-SPAN has not only exposed our public debate, it has enhanced our  discourse, and in doing so, enriched our democracy: shining light on  government to keep our leaders honest and accountable, educating and  informing the public through gavel-to-gavel coverage, Book TV, American  History TV, C-SPAN Radio, the Video Library, and interactive resources  such as the C-SPAN bus--let's hear it for the C-SPAN bus--and renewing  the promise and purpose of our American democracy, a government of, by,  and for the people.   In the first speech ever televised by C-SPAN, our former colleague,  then-Representative Al Gore, spoke prescient words about its power.   Al Gore said:         The marriage of this medium and of our open debate have the       potential . . . to revitalize representative democracy,       offering a solution for the lack of confidence in government.    Our country has been strengthened by C-SPAN's progress to deliver on  that promise, revitalizing our democracy so that people can have  confidence that this institution works for the public interest.   On behalf of the House of Representatives, I did want to tell you  some C-SPAN stories about what children have said about what they have  seen when they have watched Congress in session, but I will save that  for another day.   On behalf of the House of Representatives, I thank the founder, Brian  Lamb, and the entire C-SPAN family for their enduring contributions to  the public debate and to our American democracy.   Congratulations on 40 years.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from California  (Mr. McCarthy), who is the minority leader.
