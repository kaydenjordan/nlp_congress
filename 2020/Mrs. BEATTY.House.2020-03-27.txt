 Mr. Speaker, the world is watching us. Today's $2  trillion aid is relief and economic security for all Americans.   We worked hard to provide healthcare disaster needs and to ensure  Americans, workers, and families come first: $350 billion in forgivable  loans to small businesses, independent contractors, like barbershops  and beauty salons, and more; first-time funding for not-for-profits and  churches, which we must include minority-led and minority-serving not- for-profits; and $1,200 in direct payments to individuals and couples,  $500 for children.   The Nation is watching us. Vote for this bill.
