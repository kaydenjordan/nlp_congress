 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Darien Councilman Morris Butler who passed away last month.   Mr. Butler served on the Darien City Council for 3 years where he  will be remembered as a kind man and as a man who would always fight  for what he thought was right.   My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Debra, his five daughters,  and his 10 grandchildren.   Mayor ``Bubba'' Hodge remembered Councilman Butler for his warm  smile, his love for his family, and his love for people in general.   The mayor said that he always felt warmth when he was around  Councilman Butler and now feels a void without his presence.   This is a trying time for the people of Darien as this is the second  councilmember that they have lost due to death in the last month, but I  know that the memory and the legacy of both of these councilmembers,  especially of Morris Butler, will not be forgotten.   Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Butler and his family.                            ____________________
