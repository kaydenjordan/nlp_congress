 Mr. Speaker, House Democrats have been fighting to  lower costs for hardworking American families every day. From the gas  pump to the grocery store checkout lines, we have reclaimed our  commitment to our mission of creating a fair and balanced economy where  Americans can thrive, and our efforts are starting to pay off in some  areas.   For example, gas prices continue to drop across the Nation, which  leaves a little more money in the pockets of American families,  allowing them to spend more on necessities like putting food on the  table.   We have passed a series of bills to lower everyday costs for  Americans, including the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act and the Consumer  Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act.   However, we need more.   We must continue to put people over politics and pass more  comprehensive legislation to help Americans thrive.                            ____________________
