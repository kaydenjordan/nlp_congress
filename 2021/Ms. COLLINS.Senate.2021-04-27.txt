 Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from  Michigan, Senator Peters, in introducing the Animal Freedom from  Testing, Experiments, and Research Act, known as the AFTER Act, to  promote the adoption or retirement of animals used for research by  Federal agencies.   In fiscal year 2019, the Federal government experimented on  approximately 38,000 animals for research purposes. These experiments  occurred across fourteen different federal agencies. The animals used  were mainly cats, dogs, monkeys, and rabbits. Tracking these animals  following experimentation is challenging. In many instances, animals no  longer needed for research are killed since many agencies lack formal  retirement or adoption policies. Recent peer-reviewed studies indicate  that research animals that are adopted, however, often thrive in their  new environments.   In 2013, led by Senators Harkin, Alexander, Cantwell and myself, the  Senate passed the CHIMP Act, which allowed for the retirement of  hundreds of primates that were formerly used in National Institute of  Health (NIH) experiments. In addition, the Departments of Defense,  Veterans Affairs, FDA, and NIH recently enacted successful animal  retirement policies. While I am encouraged by the Senate's past work on  primates and the recent policies developed by a few Federal agencies,  there are many other Federal agencies, including the Agriculture  Department, NASA, and the Environmental Protection Agency, that lack  formal policies for animals used in experiments.   The AFTER Act builds on successful policies at DOD, VA, and NIH by  directing all Federal agencies to promulgate regulations that would  facilitate the retirement of laboratory animals. The bill provides  flexibility for each agency to devise its own policy, with the goal of  ensuring that such animals, whenever possible, are retired and not  killed. Additionally, the AFTER Act requires that animals be evaluated  by a licensed veterinarian and pronounced both mentally and physically  healthy before leaving an agency. This will help ensure a smooth  transition to a new environment.   Our legislation also encourages Federal agencies to work with non- profit organizations to help place retired animals in sanctuaries and  shelters across the country, not just those closest to the research  facility. This would allow a State like Maine, which does not have  Federal research labs that use animals, to play a role in retiring  these animals and providing homes for them.   Mr. President, animals that are suitable for adoption or retirement  should not be killed by our Federal government. The AFTER Act would  provide the necessary direction Federal agencies need in order to move  forward with developing retirement policies. I urge all of my  colleagues to join in support of this important bipartisan legislation,  the Animal Freedom from Testing, Experiments, and Research Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Carper, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr.          Blumenthal, Ms. Warren, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Casey,          Mr. Reed, Ms. Smith, Mr. Booker, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr.          Merkley):   S. 1385. A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to establish  additional requirements for dealers, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
