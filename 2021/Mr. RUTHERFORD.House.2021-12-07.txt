 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Oklahoma for  this opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the previous question so that we  can immediately consider H.R. 1995, a bill to keep alien gang members  from entering the United States.  [[Page H6925]]    The crisis at the southern border continues to rage, with over  160,000 illegal aliens pouring into the country every single month.   In fiscal year 2021, a record-breaking 1.7 million illegal aliens  crossed our southern border, and that is only those who were caught.  How many others avoided authorities and successfully entered into our  country illegally?   Mr. Speaker, we know cartels are sending gang members across our  border and into our communities. I can tell you--and as a former  sheriff, I can assure you, Mr. Speaker--these gang members, these alien  gang members, are bringing violence and drugs, and they are straining  police resources in cities all across America. In fact, violent crime  skyrocketed in many cities last year, and much of that was tied to gang  violence.   I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can agree  that alien gang members should not be allowed into the United States. A  ``no'' vote on the previous question sends a message to those looking  to bring crime and violence into our country that they are not welcome  here.   Mr. Speaker, for the sake of my children, for the sake of your  children, for the sake of our children, I would ask all of my  colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to vote ``no'' on the previous  question and stop these illegal alien gang members.
