 Madam Speaker, 8 minutes, 46 seconds on George Floyd's  neck. ``I can't breathe.''   Say their names, Madam Speaker.   Breonna Taylor, Casey Goodson, Jr., Andre Hill, Eric Garner, Tamir  Rice, and so many more.   While we can never bring them back and we cannot undo the pain their  families, friends, and communities have felt, we can do everything in  our power if we unite and pass this bill.   As the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, I urge all of my  colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to join us.   Our power, our message, is to pass the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act.   The right should read the bill. The right should quote from the bill.  Show me those words in the bill to defund the police.   I will show you accountability. I will show you transparency. I will  show you justice.   The American people are calling on Congress to act. Yes, Black Lives  Matter.   Let's meet the moment and turn agony into action. Let's pass the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
