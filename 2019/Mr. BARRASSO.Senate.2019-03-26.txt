 Madam President.    Madam President, I object.    Madam President.    Thank you, Madam President.   Madam President, many Democrats have called climate change the  greatest challenge of our time.   House Representative Ocasio-Cortez is the Green New Deal's lead  sponsor. She calls climate change ``our World War II.'' She said: ``The  world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.''  Senator Schumer said that climate change is ``an existential threat.''   When the Green New Deal was introduced just last month, Democrats  lined up to support it, to cosponsor it, and to agree with it. Senator  Markey of Massachusetts called it ``the kind of generational commitment  that we need to transform our economy and our democracy.'' Every  Democratic Senator running for President of the United States is a  cosponsor--every single one.   When Leader McConnell called for a vote on the Green New Deal,  Senator Schumer said: ``Go for it. Bring it on.'' He said it right here  on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Presidential candidate Senator Amy  Klobuchar of Minnesota agreed, saying that she will vote yes. That is  how she said she will vote--will vote yes. We will see what she does  today.   Well, today, the Senate will vote on the Green New Deal. All Senators  will have a chance to go on the record, a chance to show whether they  support this radical approach. But rather than voting for the Green New  Deal that they introduced and cosponsored, it sounds like some  Democrats are trying to run away from a vote on something they  previously embraced.   If so many Democratic Party leaders support the Green New Deal, why  aren't they willing to vote for it and stand up behind it today? The  answer is obvious: The Democrats are ducking the vote. But why? The  answer is pretty simple: The Green New Deal is unaffordable, it is  unworkable, and it is unpopular.   When you add up all of the costs and the 10-year price tag of $93  trillion, that is enough to bankrupt America. The cost is astronomical.  It would hit every American really hard--about $65,000 per family per  year. That would empty just about every bank account in America. I  believe it would drive a stake right through the heart of our strong  and healthy and growing economy. The Green New Deal would massively  increase the role of government in our lives and the size of  government, the expense of government.   Let's be honest. The climate is changing. It continues to change. It  requires a serious response--a serious response. The Green New Deal is  not that response.   This plan would eliminate fossil fuels. It would require 100 percent  renewable energy, carbon-free energy, in just 10 years. The goal is to  meet all of our energy demands in the United States through ``clean,  renewable and zero-emission energy sources.'' We need more renewable  energy, but the goal of going from where we are to where they want to  be is absolutely impossible in the period of time outlined.   Robert Blohm from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation  wrote in the Wall Street Journal: ``An all-renewable power grid is  destined to collapse.''   America can't tolerate a collapsed power grid. Plus, it wouldn't  solve the problem. Turning off America's economy will not lower global  emissions. America is leading the way in reducing emissions--reducing  emissions.   Since 2007, U.S. energy emissions have fallen by 14 percent, while  global emissions continue to rise. In 2017 the United States produced  just 13 percent of global emissions and China and India together  produced over 33 percent. So emissions are going to continue to climb  until these countries take action. Emissions in the United States  continue to decline.   Shutting down our energy would also harm American workers. That is  why major labor unions oppose the Green New Deal. The AFL-CIO labor  union, which represents 12.5 million workers, says: ``We will not  accept proposals that could cause immediate harm to millions of our  members and their families.'' I agree.   Even former President Obama's Energy Secretary, Ernie Moniz, called  the Green New Deal impractical. He said it would hurt American progress  in reducing emissions. That progress came from innovation, not from  massive government taxation and regulation.   Congress must continue to support technologies like nuclear power and  carbon capture utilization--things that we know make a difference--and  we have done this in a bipartisan way in these areas. I want to  continue to work with Democrats to find real solutions. We have passed  legislation in a bipartisan way for advanced nuclear powerplants, for  carbon capture and sequestration, and for using the carbon in  productive ways, whether it is for medication or whether it is for  construction products.   The Green New Deal is not the solution for America. It is a big green  bomb that will blow a hole in our strong, healthy, and growing economy.  That is exactly why Democrats aren't voting for it. That is exactly why  Democrats  [[Page S1970]]  are ducking and dodging and distancing themselves from this so-called  Green New Deal, because it is a radical plan, and it is exactly why  Democrats are running away--running away--from the Green New Deal. I  think we are going to see it today--running away as fast as they can.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I know the vote is scheduled at 4  o'clock. I am happy to answer a question.    Madam President, as a matter of fact, I would say to my  friend, the Senator from New York, that he asked me those three  identical questions on this floor about 2 or 3 weeks ago, and my answer  today is the same as it was then. You are welcome to go back to the  Congressional Record. I recommended this to the Senator from New York,  and I bet I wrote in the New York Times in December that said: Yes, I  do believe that climate change is real, and, yes, I believe that humans  contribute to it, and, yes, I believe we have a responsibility to do  something about it.   I highlighted the role of innovation, not taxation or regulation, in  coming to those solutions. I highlighted legislation that has passed  the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and was even signed  into law by the President, something called the FUTURE Act, which works  on capturing carbon dioxide and using it productively. We talked about  a bill called the USE IT Act, which is now coming through the  committee. We are working on it. It has bipartisan support, and it  passed last session. It didn't get all the way to a signature. We  talked about the future of nuclear power and the advanced nuclear  powerplants that are being done, and we paved the way for the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission to do things because nuclear power has zero  emissions.   These are bipartisan pieces of legislation, passed with overwhelming  support by the Senate and the House and signed by the President. These  areas with carbon capture and nuclear power works are things that  actually President Obama's Secretary of Energy, Ernie Moniz, testified  to the Senate Energy Committee are the two things that actually can  work at scale. Anything else that the United States, I will tell you,  does unilaterally, will not contribute to a solution because emissions  from the United States are only 13 percent of all the emissions in the  world.   I would once again recommend to the Senator from New York an op-ed  that I had written about dealing with climate change through  innovation, not regulation or taxation, and I hope, in that way, that I  have answered the Senator's three questions.   I would say to the Senator from New York that if he is actually  serious about discussing climate change on the floor of the Senate and  looking for solutions, then, what he ought to do today is instruct his  Members--and I believe he may have instructed them to vote present--to  vote to get on the bill, to get on this to discuss it and to debate it.  But it doesn't sound like even the cosponsors are willing to stand up  and vote for something they have cosponsored. A dozen of them have done  it.   Three of them were leading a rally outside the steps of the Capitol  within the last couple of hours, with one Senator chanting: What about  the Green New Deal and having a vote on it? When do we want it? And the  crowd was chanting: Now.   It will be instructive to see how those Senators--and one of these  was a candidate for President--vote when their name is called as the  roll is called here on today's vote on the Green New Deal.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would  like to point out to my friend and colleague that the statement I had  made earlier about my belief goes back a long time--that the climate is  changing--to the point that one of his colleagues, Jeff Bingaman, a  Senator from New Mexico, chaired the Energy Committee when he and I  cosponsored legislation dealing with carbon and carbon capture and  putting together an XPRIZE-type program. This is something I have long  spoken about and understand.   I also hear the Senator from New York essentially trying to strip the  EPW Committee of the jurisdiction we have over climate change. That is  the wrong approach when we have made real progress working together not  just on bills but on bills signed into law that are making a difference  today.   This resolution the minority leader just introduced is an attempt by  the Democrats to once again duck and dodge and distance themselves from  the Green New Deal vote this afternoon. The Democrats seem to think  that adding a layer of bureaucracy is an answer to every problem. That  is the same instinct that gave us the Green New Deal. That climate is  changing and humans play a role in the changing climate, there is no  question in my mind about that.   I am going to continue to work closely with the ranking member of the  committee, Senator Carper from Delaware, to pass meaningful legislation  to promote nuclear power, carbon capture technologies, and to reduce  emissions.   So Democrats can't hide from the fact that every Democratic Senator  running for President has cosponsored the Green New Deal.   Here we are today, and I will just state that we have been passing  bipartisan legislation. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee  recently held a hearing on climate change. We do not need another  committee. We don't need the Green New Deal; we need real solutions.  For this reason, I object.    Madam President, I know that time has expired.   We had a hearing in the last couple of weeks. We had an expert in the  specific area of carbon capture come to show how much more effective  the technology has become. This is something I started working on 10  years ago. It is something researchers around the world are committed  to because we are finding value in that carbon to create products that  can be used either medically or for construction. The University of  Wyoming has an integrated test center right next to a coal-fired  powerplant, and the technology is there to take the carbon dioxide  right from the stack and use it, some for enhanced oil recovery, some  for production. They are continuing to work on the science of all of  this.   Certainly, there are the climate alarmists who are out there, and it  does seem that what they want to do is act immediately, drastically,  and unilaterally in ways that will not solve the problem. It will hurt  our country. It will hurt our economy. It will move the lifeblood of  the U.S. economy to foreign countries, and I will do everything I can  to make sure that doesn't happen.   Thank you. I know the time has expired.    Madam President, the Committee on Environment and  Public Works has adopted rules governing its procedures for the 116th  Congress.

A prospectus rejected by majority vote of the committee or       not reported to the Senate during the session in which it was       submitted shall be returned to the General Services       Administration and must then be resubmitted in order to be       considered by the committee during the next session of the       Congress.        (2) A report of a building project survey submitted by the       General Services Administration to the committee under       section 11(b) of the Public Buildings Act of 1959, as       amended, may not be considered by the committee as being a       prospectus subject to approval by committee resolution in       accordance with section 7(a) of that Act. A project described       in the report may be considered for committee action only if       it is submitted as a prospectus in accordance with section       7(a) and is subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) of       this rule.
