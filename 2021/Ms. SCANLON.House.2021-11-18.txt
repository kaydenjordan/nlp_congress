 Madam Speaker, for decades Congress has based economic  policy on trickle-down economics, eviscerating America's middle class  in the process. But today, we reject that approach. The Build Back  Better Act invests in American families, not hedge funds, in ways that  will benefit all of us.   I would mention two investments of particular importance to my  district in Pennsylvania: Children and veterans.   This bill builds upon the American Rescue Plan that we passed in  March to expand benefits for families and support for childcare. In  doing so, it will reduce child poverty more and produce generational  benefits to our country. The bill also makes long, overdue investments  in the aging infrastructure of our Veterans Administration; including  upgrading medical facilities and finally digitizing service records  that are required for veterans and their families to obtain the  benefits our Nation has promised to them.   With this bill, we can create real, sustained economic growth that  benefits all Americans, and I am proud to support it.
