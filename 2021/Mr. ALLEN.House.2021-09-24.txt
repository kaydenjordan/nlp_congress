 Madam Speaker, this country is going through crisis after  crisis.   The Border Patrol apprehended over 200,000 immigrants at our southern  border last month. August's border numbers are alarming and mark a 21- year high. The Biden administration cannot blame this surge on seasonal  trends as this number is a 317 percent increase from the same time last  year.   So what is the Biden administration doing to stop this ongoing border  surge?   Absolutely nothing.   In fact, over 43,000 illegal immigrants were released into the U.S.  last month.   This is a national security crisis. We don't know who is pouring  across our border, and, unfortunately, this is a humanitarian crisis to  the fullest extent.   Just last week, we saw tens of thousands of Haitians make their way  to  [[Page H5139]]  Del Rio with reports on the ground describing horrific conditions in  their makeshift camp as two women reportedly gave birth--including one  who later tested positive for COVID-19.   This crisis is one of the worst in history. It is time to finish the  wall, end catch and release, and secure our border.                            ____________________
