 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of  Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Jefferson, one of the original Tuskegee  Airmen, who recently passed away in our community. His remarkable  service figures prominently in our Nation's history. Jefferson served  as a fighter pilot with the Red Tail 332nd Fighter Group, 301st Fighter  Squadron in Italy during World War II. His unit bravely escorted  bombers into action, providing critical protection from enemy aircraft  without losing a single plane.   After the war, Jefferson served as an instructor in advanced flight  training at the Tuskegee Army Air Field, continuing the storied Air  Corps' legacy of excellence.   Lieutenant Colonel Jefferson received numerous awards for his bravery  and selfless service to our country, including the Purple Heart award.  We have lost a great American patriot and hero who should always be  remembered for his service to freedom for our country.                            ____________________
