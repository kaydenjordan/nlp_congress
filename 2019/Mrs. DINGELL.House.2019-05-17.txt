 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5,  the Equality Act.   All Americans, regardless of background, should have the ability to  live their lives with dignity and free from discrimination. Equal  treatment under the law is a fundamental American principle, and this  important legislation provides legal safeguards against discrimination  for LGBTQ individuals.   This is historic civil rights legislation that the House is  considering today. Specifically, it would modify existing civil rights  law to extend anti-discrimination protections to LGBTQ Americans,  including protections against discrimination in employment, housing,  access to public places, federal funding, credit, education, and jury  service.   As an original cosponsor of the Equality Act, I strongly support its  final passage. I am unfortunately not able to attend today's important  vote, but I am proud to support H.R. 5 and would have voted in favor of  this bill.
