 Mr. President, just a little less than 2 weeks ago,  President Trump released his proposed budget for fiscal year 2018,  which would begin October 1. He named his plan ``A New Foundation for  American Greatness.'' While unveiling this budget, Director Mulvaney,  the OMB Director, declared that ``We are no longer going to measure  compassion by the number of programs or the number of people on those  programs, but by the number of people we help get off of those  programs.''   When I read this and looked at the budget, I was reminded of the  story of the two hikers who got to the top of a mountain. They stood  near a big cliff and one hiker said: It is a beautiful vista.   The other hiker said: I am so exhausted from hiking all the way up; I  wish I could get down quickly.   The first hiker then said: Let me help you with that. And he shoved  him off the cliff.   That is what this budget does. It doesn't help people get off  programs through education and training; it shuts down the programs. It  shoves people off the cliff.   In this budget, millions of struggling, rural, middle-class, low- income, and working Americans are thrown off the cliff. They are thrown  out of these programs as these programs are just struck down, not  because programs have served their purpose and are no longer needed but  because the President wants to do two things. He wants to build a lot  more in terms of the military, and he wants to give a tax giveaway of  some $6 trillion in the budget, with most of it going to the very  richest Americans. This is not an ``America first'' budget; this is a  ``billionaires first'' and a ``rural and working Americans last''  budget.   We see this vision implemented through dramatic cuts to food stamps,  children's healthcare, job training, after-school programs, scientific  research, and other anti-poverty programs. One program after another  designed to help American families who are devastated will be  eliminated, all in the name of building a wall, building more missiles  and more bombs, and giving this massive, massive giveaway of the  Treasury to the privileged and powerful.   Now there is good news. The good news is that I think we are going to  have a bipartisan coalition we can build to defeat this budget. Even  some of our colleagues in the House Freedom Caucus, who often talk  about slashing government spending and eliminating programs, are saying  that this proposal and its impact on rural Americans and rural America  is draconian and unacceptable. It is not often that you hear folks  throughout the entire political spectrum come together to say the same  thing--that this budget is shortsighted and ill-conceived--but that is  where we are now.   This budget tells us a lot because a budget is an expression of  values. When President Trump placed this budget before us, we gained  insight into his values. What we quickly learned is that President  Trump doesn't place value on struggling and working American families,  helping them climb a ladder to a better point. What this budget does  tell us is that our President is all about raiding the National  Treasury for the privileged and the powerful--quite the opposite of  what we heard when he was campaigning.   Franklin Roosevelt once said that, as a nation, ``The test of our  progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have  much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have little.'' By  ``enough'' he meant, do we provide a ladder of opportunity for families  to get their economic footing, to be able to buy a house, to be able to  find a job, to be able to educate their children?   In this budget, President Trump puts out a different test. With this  budget, he is saying that the test of our progress is whether we  destroy programs for working Americans in order to fund a $6 trillion  giveaway to the privileged and powerful. That is Donald Trump's test of  progress, and I think we find very few in the country who might agree  with that vision of making economic and educational progress for  working Americans much more difficult. It is not an ``America first''  budget. It is not a foundation for American greatness. It is more akin  to a great train robbery, a great raid on the National Treasury to  benefit those who are already at the very top.   It is a budget that hurts children. It is a budget that hurts  struggling, hard-working Americans. It cuts 20 percent from the  Children's Health Insurance Program, critical for the health of our  children. Shouldn't every child in America have access to affordable  healthcare? That is a value I can get behind. But slashing healthcare  for children and making it harder for them to succeed in life--I can't  agree with that.   Let's make children hungrier by cutting the basic food stamp program  or school programs that 44 million Americans rely on, cutting it by  $193 billion. Making children hungrier doesn't help them learn. Helping  children learn is a value I can get behind. Making it harder for them  to succeed in school may be a Trump value, but it is not mine, and I  don't think it is shared by many Members of this Chamber.    We find that he proposes to get rid of the subsidization of interest  on student loans, making the cost of college even more unaffordable for  low-income and working graduates. He freezes the Pell grants that  already have not kept pace with inflation. He proceeds to wipe out the  Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program that erases student loans after  a decade of service to the public. All of this is about making college  more expensive. I can get behind the value of making higher education  more affordable, whether it is apprenticeship training, career  technical education, or a 4-year college program. I can get behind  making those programs more affordable, making community college  programs more affordable because some form of education, whether it is  in the technical education world or community college world or a 4-year  program--some aspect of that is important to virtually every job in  America.   Making it more affordable is what virtually every other developed  country has done. In Germany, going to a public university is free in  terms of tuition--not so here in the United  [[Page S3274]]  States of America. Our students are burdened by massive, massive debt.  It is growing and growing and growing. I can get behind the value of  saying we shouldn't make college a financial gauntlet because it is so  essential to the success of our children. But Trump has a different  value. His value is let's make it harder. Let's make it more difficult.  Let's put students further into debt. Those are not values I can  support. Again, I think very few in this Chamber would share in that.   The list goes on and on. This isn't just an attack on the ladder of  opportunity for working Americans; this is an attack on rural America.  During the last couple of years, I served as the ranking member of the  Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development and  FDA, and in that time I have seen the tremendous impact many of these  programs have had in providing opportunity and strengthening the  economy in rural America. I value making rural America stronger, but  that is not the value Trump put into his budget. He put into this  budget: Let's undercut, let's undermine, let's make it more difficult  for rural America. This is truly a ``rural America last'' budget.   It eliminates funding for Essential Air Service. The Essential Air  Service is essential to key small towns across our Nation, including  one in my home State. If the Essential Air Service is wiped out, the  economy of that town, Pendleton, would be dramatically impacted.   It slashes the Contract Tower Program that supports even more  airports--six of them in my State--rural airports that need that  contract tower support to be able to remain open. Small towns from  Aurora to Klamath Falls would be dramatically impacted.   How about rural infrastructure? He takes out the rural water and  wastewater disposal program. As I hold townhalls around my State--and I  go to every county every year, all 36. Before I hold a public townhall  where people can ask any question they want, I meet with the local  county commissioners, city commissioners, and all the locally elected.  In virtually every county, every year, I hear about the challenge of  water infrastructure, expanding the clean water supply or waste water  treatment. These two challenges are enormous. Yet here is President  Trump wiping out the rural water and wastewater programs.   How about critical housing programs? Well, here is the issue. In our  rural communities, often the economy is hindered by the lack of  availability of affordable housing. I have been in town after town  after town saying: We have interest by a company to move here because  of some of the key assets we have. Then they decide not to because they  don't have affordable housing in the community for them to be able to  hire the staff they need. So we have these programs at the Federal  level--direct single-family housing loans, direct multifamily housing  loans, low-income housing repair loans, farm labor housing loans, self- help housing grants. Here again, the Trump budget wipes them out.   The Community Development Block Grant Program provides flexible  strength for rural communities to address local problems. We talk a lot  about flexibility in the Senate, enabling local areas to decide how  best to use funds. The CDBG, the Community Development Block Grant,  does exactly that. Yet it is not valued by our President, who probably  doesn't even know what the program is, but he wiped it out.   How about the Rural Business-Cooperative Service that offers programs  to support business development and job training? It is gone too. His  budget slashes USDA's rural development programs by about $1 billion, a  little less than $1 billion. This is a part of the agency where  programs focus on supporting economic development, housing, and  infrastructure in rural communities.   Then we have the impact on rural healthcare. This budget impacts  rural healthcare in several different ways. It cuts the Rural Hospital  Outreach Grant Program that helps small rural hospitals get resources  to create collaboratives for long-term care facilities or with  ambulance services. It eliminates the State offices of rural health.   In addition, this budget destroys healthcare for 23 million  Americans, and many of those live in rural America. In fact, in Oregon,  about one out of three individuals, almost one out of three in our  small towns find healthcare through the Oregon Health Plan, the Oregon  Health Plan funded by Medicaid. Rolling back Medicaid would throw some  400,000 people off of healthcare in Oregon just by itself, and that  would make a huge impact in rural Oregon.   I have been holding a lot of townhalls in rural Oregon. This year I  have had over 12 in what you would see on a map as pretty red counties,  and people are coming up to me at townhalls and saying that they are  scared to death about this budget's impact on healthcare. They are not  just scared; they are terrified. And they are not just terrified; they  are angry because they finally have the peace of mind that if a loved  one gets sick, that loved one will get the care they need, that loved  one will not end up bankrupt. That is a huge improvement in quality of  life, but this budget from the President destroys that peace of mind.   It is not just impacting those who directly benefit from the Oregon  Health Plan; it also impacts everybody else in the rural communities  because the health plan has enabled our rural clinics and hospitals to  do much better financially.   Out in the northeast corner of my State--it is a very remote and  beautiful place--a person told me that his local clinic had gone from  20-some employees to about 50 employees, roughly doubling the  healthcare provided. Why were they able to do that? Because they had  had so much uncompensated care before people had access to insurance.  Now that has dropped dramatically, and their finances are much better.  So they are able to hire a lot more people and provide a lot more  healthcare to this rural part of the State. But that changes with this  Trump budget.   Let me list a few more details about some of these areas, starting  with the USDA Rural Development Water Programs.   Last year, 14 projects in my State received $10.7 million in loans  and $6.5 million in grants in order to provide reliable, clean drinking  water and waste disposal, affecting 12,000 folks in rural Oregon.  Vernonia, which is in northwest Oregon, relied on these programs so as  to finally improve the town's wastewater system--a project almost 20  years in the making. I have visited Vernonia a number of times. In 1996  it suffered a terrible flood, and then, again, in 2007, there was  another major flood. The floods overwhelmed Vernonia's wastewater  treatment systems and lagoons and caused overflows on public and  private properties as well as into the nearby Nehalem River. Thanks to  loans and grants from the USDA's rural water programs, the town of  Vernonia was able to purchase new equipment, upgrade its wastewater  systems, and protect the water for its residents. That is just one  community that has benefited.   Let's talk a little bit more about housing. The budget singles out  many housing programs to cut.   It eliminates the USDA Rural Development's direct housing loan  programs and most of the housing grant programs and community  facilities programs, which include programs like the rural Single  Family Housing Direct Loans, the rural Multi-Family Housing Direct  Loans, the self-help housing program, housing repair loans, and the  Farm Labor Housing Program.   With so many States and so many communities across our Nation  suffering from a shortage of affordable and available housing, how can  we consider it a positive thing to slice and dice these programs?   Last year, 6,000 rural Oregonian families were living in 211  affordable apartment complexes thanks to USDA financing. But keeping  these programs and strengthening our housing initiatives isn't just  good for our Nation's families. It is also critical for the economic  development of rural towns and communities. As I have mentioned so  often, I have heard from town leaders that they have a potential deal  within their grasp, and it falls out of their grip because of the  shortage of housing. We need to do better in this area, not worse.   Let's talk about another program--the Forest Service Collaborative  Forest Landscape Restoration Program.  [[Page S3275]]  This program is an all-lands approach to collaboratively encouraging  science-based ecosystem restoration of priority forest landscapes.   Let me put it more simply.   Often, in terms of forest health, we have a challenge. The work in  the woods can be quite expensive to improve forest health, and, often,  you have disputes between the environmental community and the timber  community on just how this should be done. A collaborative brings  together these elements--the environmental side and the timber side-- with the goal of both making the forest healthier and providing a  steady supply of sawlogs to the mill.   This is something that happened in the Fremont-Winema National  Forest, and it has given environmental and conservation groups  confidence that Fremont-Winema is on a track to having a healthier  ecosystem. At the same time, their work has helped to ensure that there  is a balance between the timber industry and environmental protection,  which means that timber is still coming and will keep coming to the  local mill, which will help to create local jobs, like at the Collins  Mill in Klamath Falls. That mill is able to continue employing more  than 80 workers because of the steady supply of logs that makes its way  from Fremont-Winema due to the eco-friendly forest management  practices.   This ``billionaires first'' and ``rural America and workers last''  budget is going to die here in the Senate because there is going to be  a bipartisan coalition of Democrats and Republicans who say that  undermining the success of our families in order to provide a massive  giveaway--a raid, if you will, on the National Treasury--and a handout  to the privileged and powerful is, simply, the wrong way to go. This  is, really, Robin Hood in reverse. This is a situation in which the  working families are undermined to provide a $6 trillion raid on the  Treasury, with most being given away to our richest American families.   I do not know that there is anyone in this Chamber who is not already  aware that we have massive income inequality here in the United States  of America. I do not think there is any Senator among the 100 Senators  of the Senate who is unaware that we have a massive wealth gap in  America. It has gotten larger and larger and larger until it has become  equal to that level or near that level at which it was before the Great  Depression. That is not a way for America to thrive--to raid working  families in order to provide even more giveaways to those who have the  most.   I must say that this budget does not surprise me. It does not  surprise me that the President submitted this. The President himself is  a billionaire. The President lives in that world of billionaires, and  he was persuaded to think that helping the billionaires to have even  millions more would, somehow, be good for America.   I would like to take the President to real working America so that he  may see the real impact on the ground of destroying rural health  clinics, see the real impact on the ground of destroying rural water  systems, and see the real impact on the ground of destroying rural  housing programs. We need to get the President outside of his  billionaire bubble and seeing the impact so that, somehow, he gets a  grip on what it means to guide this country in education policy and  economic policy and so that we strengthen that ladder of opportunity  rather than destroy it.
