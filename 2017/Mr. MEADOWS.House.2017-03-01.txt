 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 12, line 8, insert after ``action.'' the following:       ``OIRA shall maintain a log of each agency consultation with       OIRA before submitting the significant regulatory action for       review under this section, including the date of the       consultation, the name of each agency official involved with       the consultation, and a description of the purpose of the       consultation.''.        Page 22, line 19, strike ``and''.        Page 22, line 21, strike the period and insert ``; and''.        Page 22, after line 21, insert the following new paragraph:        ``(5) a list of each consultation described under section       3523(b).''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 156, the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the leadership of the  chairman of the full committee on matters of transparency and  accountability. I can tell you that there is no one who has a greater  definitive desire to make sure that we hold our government accountable  and certainly accountable to the American people.   So, it is with that goal in mind that I rise to ask my colleagues to  support an amendment that we are offering that would actually just keep  a log of any of the pre-review consultations with agencies that OIRA  actually has and conducts, and to publish that list upon completion of  review.   Dating back to some 2003, the Government Accountability Office had  made the recommendation about increasing this transparency at the  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. GAO actually made one  recommendation targeted at what they call informal review, Mr.  Chairman, that OIRA conducts before an agency actually formally submits  a rule for review.   Indeed, the GAO recommended that the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget should define a transparency requirement that  would be applicable to agencies and OIRA, in Section 6 of Executive  Order 12866, in such a way that would not include not only the formal  review, but it would also include the informal review period when OIRA  says that it has sometimes, considering some of the most important  facts as it relates to new rules.   This recommendation remains unimplemented today, and I can tell you,  Mr. Chairman, we have had a number of hearings where we have had this  particular group in. I know my colleagues, the gentleman opposite from  Virginia, and I believe that OIRA plays a critical role. And yet, at  the same time, some of these meetings were going on without the  knowledge, and even after the fact, when they went into effect, and we  had really no understanding of some of the deliberation that went on.   So this is just a great transparency, commonsense amendment, and I  would urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands, and, as a gifted  orator, and certainly a gifted attorney, I appreciate her compliments.  And although not all might agree with her assessment of the reasonable  fashion of which I craft particular amendments, I do appreciate the  fact that she recognizes it in this case.   She also knows that, in doing this, working in a bipartisan way, is  something that, on this particular committee, Oversight and Government  Reform, Mr. Chairman, we have had just a wonderful history of being  able to work in a real way. And so she certainly has my commitment to  continue to try to perfect the language in making sure that  transparency is held paramount.   That being said, I don't intend to withdraw the amendment because  there are two ways things get done here in Washington, D.C., slow and  never. And if we just remember that, this particular day, hopefully we  will put this in place.   But the esteemed gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands has my  commitment to work with her in a bipartisan way to perfect any language  in legislation  [[Page H1442]]  that may come up after this particular bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the two colleagues opposite for  their gracious remarks and understand their reluctance to support it  based on their concerns with the underlying bill. I, again, reaffirm my  commitment to work in a bipartisan way to make sure that transparency  is the key for the day.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Chaffetz    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5  printed in part B of House Report 115-21.
