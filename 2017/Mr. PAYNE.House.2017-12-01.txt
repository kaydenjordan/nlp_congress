 Mr. Speaker, today is the 29th World AIDS Day. Let us  commemorate those who lost their lives and commit to reducing the  37,000 new HIV infections that occur each year in the United States.   In my hometown of Newark, New Jersey, new HIV cases have been rising  among young people under the age of 25. According to experts, the rise  in new HIV/AIDS cases among young people in Newark is linked to the  opioid crisis.   Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of discussion lately about the  opioid crisis, but we forget that it is linked to so many other  issues--mental health access, poverty, communicable disease,  joblessness, and the list goes on.   Congress can help end the opioid crisis and the HIV/AIDS crisis here  in the United States soon. But to do that, we must increase funding for  healthcare access, mental health treatment, antipoverty programs,  disease control, education, and access to HIV PrEP medication.                            ____________________
