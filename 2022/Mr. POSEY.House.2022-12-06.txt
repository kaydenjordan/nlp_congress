 Louie, the first person who reached their hand out to me  when I got here was not you. It was Ron Paul. You were the second one.  I got to know you good through Ron Paul's lunches, his wonderful  lunches at his Liberty Caucus. I learned, before I ever heard you  speak, of what a true patriot you were.   I don't know that there has ever been a more consistent Member since  I have been here on principles, policy, and ethics than you, Louie  Gohmert. You have been a fearless voice for those that were voiceless,  something which every Member of Congress should aspire to be. You have  been an advocate for what is right about America and a fierce opponent  of what is not right for America.   Congressman Gohmert, you have always been well informed on a galaxy  of issues that come before this body, and as always, you have been more  than well prepared to fight for the good and against the bad.  [[Page H8788]]    An honest, pragmatic, free thinker for sure, Congress could surely  use more Louie Gohmerts, not fewer.   We are going to miss you, Louie. Godspeed. I don't know what we are  going to do without you.
