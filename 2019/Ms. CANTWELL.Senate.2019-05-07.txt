 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in  favor of confirming the three nominees before us for the Board of  Directors at the U.S. Export-Import Bank. All three of these nominees  are well qualified, with years of experience in relevant fields, and  all three have received support from Democrats and Republicans. In  fact, all three advanced out of the Banking Committee earlier this  Congress by a voice vote.   We must confirm these nominees to ensure that the Export-Import Bank  is once again fully operational. It is critical for jobs and for our  economy, not just in my home State of Washington but throughout the  United States.   I believe in an export economy. I believe the United States of  America manufactures and makes great products, and we should be  shipping them around the globe to customers in a growing middle class.  To do that, we have to have a functioning export credit agency that  works with the private sector as a tool to get more of our products to  markets where that kind of banking and assistance does not exist. If  the United States fails to participate here, customers receive products  from other countries--other countries that may not necessarily want  that foreign product over our U.S. product, but clearly the foreign  export credit agency support by creates an incentive for them to  purchase other products.   Since 2015, the Bank has not been fully operational due to the lack  of a quorum on the Board of Directors.   I am not going to go into a lot of why that has happened. I will just  say that if you truly believe in an export economy, you believe in  having a credit agency, such as the Export-Import Bank, existing as a  fundamental tool.   Basically what it has meant is that, with a lack of Board of  Directors, we have not been able to approve financing transactions over  $10 million--a situation that has left nearly $40 billion in limbo.  That is $40 billion worth of American exports unable to reach those new  markets and new customers. That is $40 billion worth of exports  supporting high-paying American jobs and economic output held hostage  every day that the Bank is not fully operational.   According to the National Association of Manufacturers, since the Ex- Im Bank lost its quorum in 2015, American manufacturers have lost  billions of dollars of sales, which meant the loss of at least 80,000  American jobs in manufacturing in 2016 and 2017 and a loss of at least  $119 billion in economic output.   Trust me, as I have followed this issue from U.S. equipment to  impacts to GE and to other companies, I have seen people lose business  simply because we haven't had a functioning credit agency to take the  best valued product--that is, some of the most high-priced U.S.  manufacturing product--and help get it to overseas markets.   At least 95 percent of the world customers live outside the United  States, and every day that the Export-Import Bank is not fully  operational, American manufacturers and small businesses lose  opportunities. These opportunities are lost throughout our country,  from Mack Trucks losing out on an opportunity to export Pennsylvania- manufactured vehicles to Cameroon, to the aerospace industry in my  State losing out on a commercial satellite deal in Asia, to impacts on  small businesses in the supply chain.   Losing these opportunities means losing high-paying American jobs. In  fiscal year 2013, when the Bank was fully operational, it supported  nearly 39,000 jobs in my State of Washington and over 200,000 in the  United States. In fiscal year 2018, without a quorum, the Bank only  supported 650 jobs in Washington and only 33,000 nationwide. That is a  decrease of nearly 84 percent. So we need to take action. Every day  that the Bank is not fully operational, American businesses lose ground  to their competitors.   I believe American businesses are some of the best in the world. They  make great products, and they can compete on any stage with other  countries. But without the Export-Import Bank, there is simply not a  level playing field.  [[Page S2663]]    There are more than 100 other export credit agencies worldwide  helping foreign companies reach new markets. Without the Export-Import  Bank, American companies are forced to sit on the sideline and watch as  other countries fill that void. In fact, China has done more export  financing in the last 3 years than the Export-Import Bank has done in  its 85-year history. What does that mean? It means that if other  countries continue to use credit support financing as a tool to help  products reach markets and the United States doesn't, they will have an  unfair advantage.   So it is not only time to confirm these nominees to ensure the  Export-Import Bank is fully functional, it is also important to make  sure we have a functioning Export-Import Bank. With its authorization  set to expire in September, we need to reauthorize the Export-Import  Bank so it can continue to provide new financing that supports American  jobs and American exporters.   For many U.S. companies, the Export-Import Bank guarantees financing  in emerging markets where private financing is very difficult or  impossible to obtain. These tools have been essential. For example,  Spokane-based SCAFCO makes grain storage bins, silos, and other  agricultural processing and storage equipment. It sells its product to  more than 80 markets around the world. We are very proud of that  company and what they have achieved. Financing from the Export-Import  Bank helped SCAFCO sell a grain storage system to Cambodia. Cambodia is  normally a very tough market for U.S. businesses to reach, but thanks  to the Export-Import Bank, SCAFCO was able to make the sale.   The Senate should not be in the business of making it harder for U.S.  companies to compete; we should be making it easier for them to  compete. We should not be putting American companies at a disadvantage  and costing American jobs. It is time to recognize that in order to  compete in a 21st-century global economy where there is huge growth and  economic opportunity outside of the United States, we have to have a  very aggressive export strategy.   I hope my colleagues will not only help us get these nominees finally  to support a functioning Export-Import Bank, but they will also work  very collaboratively to make sure the Bank does not expire again this  September.                                 S. Res. 144    Mr. President, I would like to turn to another subject. My colleague,  Senator Udall from New Mexico, was out here earlier, I believe--or  maybe he is coming later this afternoon--to remember the honoring this  past Sunday of the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered  Native Women and Girls. This is an important day to recognize because  this has become an epidemic in the United States.   Last year, the Seattle Indian Health Board released a report that  examined the number of murdered and missing Native women in urban  areas, where 71 percent of Native Indians and Alaska Natives reside.  These are urban centers in which they found at least 506 cases of  missing or murdered indigenous women and girls in 71 cities. One  hundred and twenty-eight were missing, and 280 were murdered.   The report found that Washington State has one of the highest number  of cases of murdered and missing Native American women. Two of my  State's largest cities--Seattle and Tacoma--are in the top 10  nationwide of cities with the highest number of cases. Seattle ranks  No. 1.   We are experiencing this crisis, and it is time that this report be a  wake-up call to action. We can no longer ignore these huge numbers. We  need to find answers.   One of the answers is in the legislation sponsored by my colleague,  Senator Murkowski from Alaska, Savanna's Act, which will improve the  response of local, State, and Federal-Tribal enforcement in cases of  missing and murdered Tribal women and girls. This is so important, and  that is why I have joined Senator Murkowski and Senator Cortez Masto as  a cosponsor of this legislation and am urging that the Senate pass it  immediately.   Right now, hours and days can be wasted in responding to this.  Savanna's Act will streamline the protocols and process between our  Tribes and law enforcement agencies, which will mean swifter action and  a more rapid pace.   Why am I bringing this up now? I know we also have to reauthorize the  Violence Against Women Act, but this legislation has good bipartisan  support in the Senate. We can pass this legislation very soon and send  it over to the House of Representatives. That way, it will be ready to  be put into the hands of our law enforcement, if it passes and goes to  the President's desk for signature--a tool that can be used now, not  delayed another 7 or 8 months until we get the reauthorization of the  Violence Against Women Act.   I thank my former colleague, Senator Heitkamp, for trying to push  this legislation at the end of the last congressional session. I hope  my colleagues will realize that the great bipartisan support that  existed in the Senate to move this legislation still exists. What is  different now is a House of Representatives that is very willing to  take up and pass Savanna's Act, and we should do that as soon as  possible.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
