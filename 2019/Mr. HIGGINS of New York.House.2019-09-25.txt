 Mr. Speaker, with each passing day, we see  an erosion of this country's ideals by a President who freely sidesteps  Congress, profits off his position, obstructs justice, and places  personal petty politics before national security.   The validity of these violations is not in question. They are  happening before us.   The Intelligence inspector general, who was appointed by President  Trump, said that the whistleblower complaint is of both urgent concern  and credible, and its public release is the National Intelligence  director's obligation to the American people.   An impeachment inquiry is necessary to protect the values included in  our Constitution and to deliver the truth Americans deserve.
