 Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to urge my  colleagues to oppose the confirmation of Michael Brennan to the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. By bringing Mr. Brennan's  nomination forward without my support, Chairman Grassley and Leader  McConnell are breaking with a longstanding Senate tradition that has  guaranteed a voice for home State Senators, regardless of party, in the  consideration of judicial nominees.   The blue slip is an important part of this institution and its  historic respect for the rights of each Senator, as well as the rights  of the minority party. As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr.  Grassley himself wrote in 2015:         This tradition is designed to encourage outstanding       nominees and consensus between the White House and home State       Senators. Over the years, Judiciary Committee chairs of both       parties have upheld a blue-slip process, including [most       recently] Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont . . . who       steadfastly honored the tradition even as some in his own       party called for its demise. I appreciate the value of the       blue-slip process and also intend to honor it.    Today, respect for that time-honored blue slip comes to an end. Not  only is Michael Brennan being considered on the Senate floor, but  tomorrow the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on a  nominee for a traditional Oregon seat on the Ninth Circuit for whom  neither Oregon Senator has returned a blue slip. I urge my colleagues  to recognize that while today's action disrespects my role as the  junior Senator from Wisconsin, tomorrow it may well be you. With the  majority's choice to end this tradition, each of us is diminished in  our own ability to represent the constituents who chose to send us  here.    I did not return a blue slip for Michael Brennan because his  nomination does not reflect the consensus between the White House and  home State Senators that the chairman of Judiciary Committee, Mr.  Grassley, praised in 2015. Mr. Brennan did not receive the requisite  support from Wisconsin's bipartisan judicial nominating commission,  which has been used in some form for nearly four decades to identify  candidates for Federal judgeships in my home State. Senator Johnson and  I have worked to continue this longstanding process during my tenure in  the Senate, and it has actually produced consensus nominees who have  been confirmed to two vacancies on our district courts and for two U.S.  attorney positions.   More troubling still is a fact made clear in Mr. Brennan's answers to  the Judiciary Committee's questionnaire; namely, that President Trump  never intended to respect that commission's work for this vacancy. The  White House interviewed Michael Brennan for the job on the very day our  bipartisan nominating commission began to solicit candidates for its  consideration.   Chairman Grassley has made an argument that the White House engaged  me in meaningful consultation regarding this vacancy. It is true that  White House Counsel Don McGahn called me to inform me that Mr. Brennan  was the President's choice. I urged him, instead, to consider consensus  nominees who could garner bipartisan support, including Donald Schott,  who earned the requisite support of Wisconsin's nominating commission.  He also garnered Senator Johnson's and my blue slips in the last  Congress as well as the support of a bipartisan majority of the Senate  Judiciary Committee. Sadly, he didn't come up for a confirmation vote  due to obstruction in setting the calendar--a choice by the majority  leader. Unfortunately, instead of nominating a consensus candidate,  President Trump chose to move forward in a partisan manner on this  vacancy.   Seven years ago, the U.S. Senate respected the prerogative of my  colleague and my senior Senator, Mr. Johnson--then a newly elected  Senator from Wisconsin--when he objected to a nominee for this very  vacancy whose selection he had not had a role in. Mr. Brennan himself,  at the time, coauthored an op-ed in our State's largest newspaper that  praised Senator Johnson's refusal to return a blue slip for that  nominee, Victoria Nourse. When President Obama made a second nomination  for this position in 2016, I am confident Senator Leahy would not have  allowed that nominee, Donald Schott, to have advanced in the Judiciary  Committee without my senior Senator's blue slip.   Today, I am not being accorded the same respect. Today, we send the  message that neither this nor a future President needs to respect the  role of home State Senators in the selection of judicial nominees. I  urge my colleagues  [[Page S2546]]  to oppose this action and this nominee and this dispensing with a time- honored tradition of this institution.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
