 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I know we are going to be voting soon, but  I wanted to comment. I hope that Democrats and Republicans can rise  above party to come together to protect our precious right to vote. I  know, in Vermont, we do that. We make it very clear that voting is a  right. Everybody can vote. We try to make it as clear and open as  possible. People can be in jail for a crime; they still have a right to  vote. We do not take it from anybody. You can vote right until the last  minute. You can get absentee ballots. As a result, we have an  overwhelming vote in Vermont--one of the highest percentages in the  country.   Some suggest, well, you do it to favor one party or the other. I just  point to the last election. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor are  elected separately in our State. We elected a Republican as Governor  and a Democrat as Lieutenant Governor. It went back and forth like that  all the way across the ballot.   It is just an example that we just want people to vote. And the  timing right now couldn't be more urgent. In the wake of the Supreme  Court's Shelby and Brnovich decisions, dozens of States are trying to  restrict access to the ballot for tens of thousands of Americans, even  millions of Americans--minority voters, the elderly, rural voters,  student voters, the disabled, and others. These are the people we  protect in my State.   The threats to the voting rights of any American are threats to all  Americans. Indeed, they are threats to America, itself.    I am glad the Senate has taken much-needed action this week on the  Freedom to Vote Act. It is a vital piece of legislation. It establishes  commonsense rules of the road for voting procedures and ensures equal  access to the ballot box for all Americans.   This bill is a compromise version of the original S. 1, and I note it  reflects good faith efforts to broaden support for the legislation here  in the Senate. I look forward to supporting this legislation on the  floor. I can only hope it doesn't fall prey to the knee-jerk  partisanship we have seen all too often lately in the Senate.   I am also proud to have recently introduced the John Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act. That is a bill I have long championed and  sponsored. This legislation would restore the core pillars of the 1965  Voting Rights Act that have been gutted by the Supreme Court's damaging  and strange Shelby and Brnovich decisions.   But it also would provide critical protections to Native American  communities across the country, including Alaska Native communities.  This bill would fundamentally restore the Justice Department's powers  to oversee and prevent harmful discriminatory changes to voting laws  and procedures.   How can anybody stand up and say, ``I am a proud American, but I am  going to let some of these legislative bodies do things that will stop  other Americans from voting''?   If you are a proud American and really mean it, then you want every  single American--I don't care what their political party is, they  should be able to vote.   I am working extremely hard to build bipartisan support for this  bill, which--especially the past few Congresses--has been  overwhelmingly bipartisan. I am optimistic we can arrive at a good  bipartisan compromise that can serve as a starting point for continued  bipartisan discussions here in the Senate.   You wouldn't know it if you listened to the partisan sound bites and  Twitter wars in the modern media era, but this goal--protecting our  right to vote--was never a partisan issue.   Our hero, a man I loved and was proud to serve with, John Lewis, once  said:         We all know this is not a Democratic or Republican issue.       It is an American one.    Well, truer words haven't been spoken. John Lewis was absolutely  right. This is an American issue. If you believe in democracy, you  believe in the right for everybody to vote. For those of us who run for  elected office, I have always fought in Vermont to make sure everybody  could vote, knowing that there were some sections of the State where  there may be a majority voting against me. I have always insisted  everybody be able to vote. That is democracy.   The core provisions of the act have been reauthorized five times-- five times. Every single time it was with overwhelmingly bipartisan  support in Congress. Republicans and Democrats alike voted for it.  President Nixon, President Reagan, President George W. Bush proudly  signed Voting Rights Act reauthorizations into law. Those Presidents-- Presidents Nixon, Reagan, George W. Bush--spoke of the profound  importance of the landmark law for our democracy.   In fact, just to show how it goes, the most recent Voting Rights Act  reauthorization in 2006--you know what the vote was in the U.S. Senate:  98 to 0.   Some people feel we couldn't get a vote like that to say the sun  rises in the East. But the fact is, every Republican, every Democrat  said we need this to make sure Americans vote. It is not a case of  saying Democrats vote or Republicans vote or Independents vote; it is  Americans vote and we want all Americans to.   You know, the toxic partisanship of American politics today has sadly  obscured what has united us across party lines for so long. The belief  that protecting our right to vote--the very right that gives democracy  its name--that is bigger than party or politics. It is the belief that  a system of self-government--a government of, by, and for the people-- is one that is worth preserving not only today, but for generations to  come. It is the belief the government exists to serve the will of the  people, not the other way around.   If I can just wear my hat as dean of the Senate--one who has been  privileged to serve here all these years--I ask Senators, let's get  back to doing things the way we have always done them: reaching across  the aisle in good faith, meeting each other in the middle, legislate to  protect the rights of the American people.   Even after all these years, I still have faith the Senate can serve  as the conscience of the Nation. I believe it can shine a light on the  path forward even on the most difficult, seemingly insurmountable  issues. I believe we can do that again now on the fundamental issue of  voting rights. So let's get to work. Our democracy--indeed our country  as we know it--may very well depend upon it.  [[Page S7097]]    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, Middlebury College, in my State of Vermont,  is known worldwide as an outstanding educational institution. What is  less well-known is that the college is also a leader in addressing  climate change.   The college first became carbon neutral not by simply purchasing  carbon credits, but by doing the hard work of actually becoming carbon  neutral, including the implementation of 123 individual efficiency  projects that are collectively saving the college nearly $1 million a  year. With that work complete, they set about securing their energy  entirely from renewable sources--first, with one of the largest  biodigesters in Vermont and, now, with a 5 megawatt solar array, that  will provide 30 percent of the college's electricity.   The project includes energy storage, which will benefit the electric  grid by spreading out when the power enters the grid. Perhaps more  importantly, that stored energy will also serve as a source of  emergency power for a nearby hospital, Porter Medical Center. The  project also involves two Vermont companies: Encore Renewable and Green  Mountain Power.   Earlier this month, it was an honor to join the groundbreaking for  the project, where Middlebury College President Laurie Patton shared  her vision for how to get to a better climate future. All should read  her impressive remarks at the event, and I ask that a copy of them be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   [[Page S7122]]                                                    October 12, 2021.        Good morning.        I am so happy to be here with you today, and it's my honor       to share this podium on a beautiful autumn morning with my       friends and colleagues Chief Don Stephens, Senator Patrick       Leahy, Chad Farrell of Encore Renewable Energy, Matt Murphy       of Green Backer Capital, Mari McClure of Green Mountain       Power, Lieutenant Governor Molly Gray, Middlebury Select       board chairman Brian Carpenter, and the College's own Simone       Ameer. Senator Leahy, as a professor of religion I already       made arrangements with the heavens for this weather--so you       didn't need to make the law!        We come together today as responsible stewards of this       planet and of this place we are blessed to call home--      Ndakinna [in-DAH-keen-AH], the town of Middlebury, the county       of Addison, the state of Vermont.        We gather to recognize the generations who came before us       in making this very place what it is today, and we do so in       service of the generations to come, to ensure that Ndakinna       [in-DAH-keen-AH], Middlebury, Addison County, and Vermont       remain places where the health of our environment is       paramount, and where our people can come together in concert,       rather than competition, to maintain a livable community and       planet.        When we at Middlebury announced our Energy 2028 initiative       three years ago, we laid out an ambitious ten-year plan,       pledging that in a decade's time we would sharply reduce our       energy consumption as an institution; reduce and then       eliminate our investment in fossil fuels; craft a large       educational initiative to continue our research and       scholarship into climate change--and, in perhaps our boldest       promise, rely completely on renewable energy sources to power       our Vermont campus.        The solar array project on which we break ground today       takes us one large step closer to realizing this goal, as it       is expected to provide nearly one-third of the energy needed       to power our campus. This groundbreaking comes on the heels       of the start-up of the largest anaerobic digester in the       Northeastern United States at the Goodrich Farm in nearby       Salisbury, another local project and partnership that is       supplying renewable natural gas to the College and community.        Each of these efforts--indeed, all of our efforts to meet       our Energy 2028 goals--are collaborative by design, because       we all have a stake in the outcome. Just as our plan was       crafted in a spirit of independence, in which no individual       part could work without the other, the same can be said for       our partnerships. Remove any one of us, and we're not here       today. Remove any one of us, and we're not here today.        In a few weeks, on a platform a little bit bigger than this       one and with just a few more people in attendance, the United       Nations Climate Change Conference will convene in Glasgow,       Scotland. The comparisons in scope between that and this,       here and there, may cause some to peer at us today and       wonder: what's the point? We're so small!        As I have written and spoken in the past, a local       initiative such as this one is exactly the point, the point       being that local wisdom and local practices are the ideal       conditions to help put out the fire that is consuming our       planet. The sun is one of the oldest symbols known to humans;       it is in the earliest cave paintings tens of thousands of       years ago, and in the earliest spoken prayers of more than       3000 years ago. It is only fitting that we should return,       indeed come full circle, to the sun to heal our planet.        We are so blessed to call this place home.        The Green Mountains rest behind me.        In my mind's eye, I can already envision the sheep that       will graze beneath the solar arrays, managing the vegetation       growing in these fields.        And up above, in a sky that Sabra Field herself could have       painted, a golden light will not only illuminate the beauty       of our surroundings but will allow us to take another       critical step toward building a sustainable future.        Thank you, everyone of you, for your help in building a new       world.                                                  Laurie L. Patton,      President, Middlebury.                            ____________________     Mr. President, these days, it is not uncommon for people  to frequently change careers, companies, or job paths. At one iconic  Vermont entity, though, Vermont Creamery, president and chief executive  officer Adeline Druart has dedicated more than 17 years to growing and  expanding the company's product line and brand. She was recently  featured on the Positive Enterprise Podcast, and hers is a story in  which all Vermonters can find pride and motivation.   The cheese and butter that Vermont Creamery produces is some of the  best in the world. As a Certified B Corporation, Vermont Creamery  follows a long Vermont legacy of investing in environmental  sustainability, local supply chains, and worker satisfaction. These  investments have clearly paid off. In 2017, Vermont Creamery was  acquired by Land O'Lakes, a century-old farmer-owned cooperative, and  has continued on an impressive path of conscious growth. With Land  O'Lakes' support, Vermont Creamery has expanded its facilities nearly  40 percent and is now a recognizable brand in grocery stores across the  country. In 2020, the company supported our community through the  pandemic, donating 12,000 pounds of food to hungry Vermonters,  providing hazard pay to their employees, and advocating for universal  childcare for Vermont's working families. They also converted their  Websterville-based facility to run on 100-percent renewable energy. And  these changes have only underlined their belief that consciously  crafted products made with the best ingredients just taste better.  Today, the beloved Vermont Creamery makes the No. 1 best-selling goat  cheese in the country.   Adeline Druart is responsible for so much of this impressive growth.  In the early 2000s, Adeline, then a student from France, came to  Vermont Creamery to complete an internship for her master's degree. She  just couldn't stay away. Adeline worked her way up the ranks at the  creamery, before being named president and CEO in 2015. In that role,  she has shown exactly what tenacity and hard work, when paired with a  people-first approach to business, can do. The mother of two young  sons, Adeline has reinforced Vermont Creamery's original family- oriented culture while steering the company's growth. She is an  inspiration to me, and I am so proud that she calls Vermont home.   Vermont is home to some of the finest agriculture, wood-based, and  other products in the country. We feature many of these at the annual  Taste of Vermont here in Washington, a tradition I hope to return to  next year. At the helm of so many of these Vermont companies are people  like Adeline. It is in these hard-working and creative leaders that we  can find great hope for Vermont's economic recovery and vibrant future.                            ____________________
