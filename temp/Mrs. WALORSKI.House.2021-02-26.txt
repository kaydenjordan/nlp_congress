 Mr. Speaker, I believe every person born or unborn is  worthy of our protection. A majority of Americans--nearly 60 percent-- believe that Federal tax dollars should not be used to pay for the  destruction of life. Hyde protections to prohibit taxpayer funding for  elective abortions have been in place in this country ever since  President Ford. Even President Biden supported them as a Senator. But  now House Democrats have abandoned nearly a half century of bipartisan  consensus.   I offered an amendment in the Ways and Means Committee to include  Hyde protections, which have saved more than 2 million innocent lives  in this $1.9 trillion bill. I also joined my colleagues in submitting a  similar amendment for floor consideration. Democrats rejected both.   This is a moment that calls for healing and not destruction, for  saving lives and not ending them, for bringing Americans together and  not tearing us apart. It is sad to see partisanship take priority over  the most vulnerable among us, the unborn.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in protecting innocent  life by opposing this bill.
