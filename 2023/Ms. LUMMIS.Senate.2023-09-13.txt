 Mr. President, I begin my remarks today with the words  from a song:         There's this one particular Harbor, so far but yet so near,       where I see the days as they fade away and finally disappear.    When a timeless, iconic American passes away, reflection sets in,  perhaps more so for those of us who are contemporaries, to that  timeless American's gift to our culture, to America as we know it, live  it, and find joy in it.   Today, I rise to pay tribute to Jimmy Buffett, a legendary singer- songwriter, author, and iconic American who created an incredible and  uniquely American musical genre that inspired us to celebrate life with  joy, to celebrate everything from a ``Cheeseburger in Paradise'' to a  ``Pencil Thin Mustache,'' to this ``One Particular Harbor.''   Jimmy Buffett's unique contribution to American culture spans his  early career, Bourbon Street performances in New Orleans, to sold-out  Red Rocks Amphitheatre, inspiring generations of Parrot Heads that were  drawn in by his extraordinary American perspective.   From remarkable creations like ``One Particular Harbor,'' ``Fins,''  ``We Are the People Our Parents Warned Us About,'' ``Son of a Son of a  Sailor,'' ``Jolly Mon,'' ``Cowboy in the Jungle,'' ``Stars on the  Water,'' ``Livingston Saturday Night,'' and, of course, ``Come  Monday,'' and ``Margaritaville,'' Jimmy Buffett chronicled an American  life of sunny gulf coast days, the sound of steel drums, extended happy  hours, and all the joys of the seas and the islands.   Commuting from Cheyenne to Laramie during law school and in need of a  break from law school lectures on cassette, I would pop in Jimmy  Buffett, roll down the windows, and be lost in lyrics like ``forget  your blind ambition and learn to trust your intuition, plowing straight  ahead, come what may.''  [[Page S4437]]    In an instant, Jimmy Buffett could transport a ranch girl in Wyoming  to a sandy beach in a wave-licked paradise, surrounded by friends,  sporting a tan earned over countless days of deep-sea fishing. He  invites us to escape the weight of the world, reminding us that it is  always ``5 o'clock somewhere.'' When you are by yourself and you cannot  wipe the smile off your face because of a song, that is pure Jimmy  Buffett.   What is so remarkable about Jimmy Buffett's music is its ability to  reach and relate to generations of people from all different times of  life. To be with Jimmy Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band in concert,  the sound of steel drums floating on a breezy summer night sky,  watching giant beach balls bouncing among Parrot Heads wearing Hawaiian  shirts and shorts, parents and grandparents with children on their  shoulders, all of whom are singing every word to every song--that was  also pure Jimmy. When so many voices are driving Americans apart,  Jimmy's voice called Americans back together.   So here is to Jimmy Buffett and his enduring legacy, sailing in the  sky alongside dolphins and the many manatees he saved through his  charities.   I conclude with Jimmy's own words from ``Jolly Mon'':         The night was filled with magic. They bid the sea goodbye.       They swam into the heavens. They stayed up in the sky. And       all the island people, when they wished upon a star, see the       dolphins and the Jolly Mon who tell them where they are.        Oh, Jolly Mon sing. Oh, make the heavens ring.    I thank Jimmy's friends Eric and Lisa Eisner and my brother Del  Lummis for helping with this tribute to Jimmy Buffett.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Aidan Jacketta, be granted floor privileges until September 24, 2023.
