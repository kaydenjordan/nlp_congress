 Mr. Speaker, I would like to associate myself with the  comments of my colleagues about the importance of our Nation's premier  outdoor recreation and conservation program, the Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   Over the past five decades, LWCF has helped protect our Nation's most  treasured places, including many in my congressional district like the  Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge and both the Richmond and  Petersburg National Battlefields.   As we know, authorization of LWCF is set to expire in 100 short days.  That is why the timing of this Special Order hour is so critical. If  Congress does not reauthorize LWCF, we will lose one of our most  powerful tools for protecting our Nation's natural, historical, and  cultural landmarks. If that happens, every State and district in our  country will feel the damaging consequences.   That outcome is unacceptable, which is why I am proud to cosponsor  H.R. 502, which is Ranking Member Grijalva's legislation to permanently  reauthorize LWCF. I also support robust funding for LWCF in the  appropriations bills.   For my constituents, preserving our lands and waters is personal.  Virginia's Fourth Congressional District is home to many beautiful  public lands and waters, along with many other sites that still need to  be protected.                                time  2145    Earlier this month, I toured the beautiful James River National  Wildlife Refuge with local nonprofits to highlight the need to  reauthorize the LWCF. My tour reminded me that there is no place quite  like the James, but my district is far from unique. Across our  district, LWCF has helped conserve precious ecosystems that wildlife,  people, and local economies needed to survive.   While preserving these lands is the right thing to do, it also makes  good business sense. In fact, outdoor recreation generates billions of  dollars for the Commonwealth's economy.   The same dynamic applies across the country. That is why I intend to  keep up the fight to reauthorize the LWCF. It helps communities protect  the places they love, and we owe it to our children and our children's  children to keep this tool in place.
