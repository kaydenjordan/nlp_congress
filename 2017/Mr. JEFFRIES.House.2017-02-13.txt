 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands for her very kind remarks and for yielding and for  the tremendous job that she and my classmate, Marc Veasey, have done in  leading this CBC Special Order hour over this 115th Congress during the  last few weeks.   We stand here today in the midst of Black History Month where many  African Americans throughout the country are asking the question: What  do we do now that the unthinkable has occurred?   As a community, as a nation, we have gone from the Presidency-- distinguished and dynamic 8 years--of Barack Obama to the current  situation where we have a swamp percolating at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  under the leadership of Donald J. Trump.   He began Black History Month by saying that he was convening folks  for what he called his little Black history breakfast. Those of us who  actually watched some of the coverage seemed perplexed by his reference  to the great Frederick Douglass as if he was still alive. If anyone has  any questions about the relevance of Black History Month, we can start  by noting that perhaps it is important to make sure that the Nation's  Commander in Chief understands the contributions that African Americans  have made to the United States of America, going all the way back to  the Boston Massacre, where one of its leaders, Crispus Attucks, was the  first American killed at the onset of the American Revolution in  connection with the Boston Massacre, challenging the unjust taxation  policies of the British Empire.   Now, the 45th President of the United States of America asked a  question over the last several months: What exactly do Black folks have  to lose?   Many of us were perplexed by that question, given his history, and  actually think that you have lost your mind if you come to the  conclusion that the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue has  any interest in making a positive difference in the lives of people of  color generally, African Americans specifically, perhaps because of his  own history.   We know that in the early 1970s The Trump Organization, of which he  was president, was sued by the Justice Department for racial  discrimination in the housing stock that they owned, where they were  denying African Americans and people of Puerto Rican ancestry access to  apartments, notwithstanding their economic qualifications to be renters  or co-op owners.   I would just note parenthetically that it was the Nixon Justice  Department--not the Kennedy Justice Department or the Johnson Justice  Department or the Carter Justice Department or the Clinton Justice  Department or the Obama Justice Department--that concluded that Donald  J. Trump and his organization was discriminating on the basis of race.   Those of us from New York understand that the current occupant of the  White House was the leader of the high-tech lynch mob designed to try  to get the wrongfully convicted Central Park Five sentenced to death,  taking out a full-page ad in some of the local periodicals in New York  calling for that. It turns out that all five individuals were  wrongfully convicted and spent years in jail for a crime they did not  commit. Donald J. Trump has never apologized for that reckless and  irresponsible action.   Then, of course, for 5 years he perpetrated the racist lie that  Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America, all designed  to undermine the legitimacy of the 44th President of the United States  of America, which is why here in Black History Month it is very  interesting to me that some of my friends on the other side of the  aisle question whether we, as members of the Congressional Black  Caucus, or others are being irresponsible in not giving the current  President a chance.   How dare you ask that question. From the beginning of the Presidency  of Barack Obama, you declared war on him. You followed a philosophy  that may be familiar to those of us who are familiar with the history  of the Deep South: obstruction today, obstruction tomorrow, obstruction  forever.                                time  2015    Mr. McConnell declared that his top priority was to make Barack Obama  a one-term President. And yet, he questions whether Americans, who are  part of the growing resistance movement, have failed to give Donald  Trump a chance. Let's be clear. He has zero credibility on the issue of  lecturing us about Presidential etiquette. We will decide what the  rules of engagement are when it comes to this current President. Pipe  down as it relates to talking to any of us about how to engage the  White House because he has no credibility on the issue. His obstruction  took place in the midst of two failed wars in the worst economy since  the Great Depression.   So we have got a lot of issues that we have got to sort out with this  current President here in Black History Month, both for the African- American community and for the broader community of Americans in blue  States, in red States, in urban America, in rural America, in suburban  America, in the north, the south, the east, and the west. And I look  forward to working with my colleagues in the Congressional Black  Caucus, and others, to tackle issues like criminal justice reform, to  fix the Voting Rights Act that was damaged in such an irresponsible way  by the Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder, and to work  to build an economy that works for all Americans, not simply the  millionaires and billionaires who dominate the Trump Cabinet.   I thank my distinguished colleague from the Virgin Islands (Ms.  Plaskett) for giving me the opportunity to share some thoughts today. I  thank my colleague, Marc Veasey, for his continued leadership. And I  look forward to hearing my distinguished colleague, Brenda Lawrence,  from Motown.
