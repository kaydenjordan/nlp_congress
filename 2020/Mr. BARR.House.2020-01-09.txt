 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to a  dangerous and partisan resolution offered by my Democrat colleagues  designed to handcuff our President and limit his constitutional  authorities as Commander in Chief to defend our Nation against Iranian  aggression.   The resolution before us today needlessly politicizes our national  security and shows that Democrats have once again put their partisan  agenda ahead of the American people simply because they do not like  President Trump.   Let's be clear. President Trump's decisive and defensive action to  eliminate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force commander,  Qasem Soleimani, is not the reason for the recent escalation between  the United States and Iran. The President ordered the strike because of  Iran's own escalation and aggression, for which General Soleimani was  largely and personally responsible.   For over 40 years, Iran and it proxies have been attacking U.S.  interests and our allies, but since the flawed Iran nuclear deal, under  which the regime received billions of dollars in sanctions relief, the  Islamic republic has used that economic windfall to accelerate its  support for terrorist proxies, restart its ballistic missile program-- in violation of U.N. resolutions--and cheat on its denuclearization  aims.   My colleagues have heard the quote of the late Senator Arthur  Vandenberg,  [[Page H69]]  chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that: ``We must stop  partisan politics at the water's edge.''   Senator Vandenberg, a Republican, who worked across the aisle with  Democrat President Truman in the early days of the Cold War was right.   This resolution is not safeguarding our Constitution, but attacking  our Constitution by attempting to divest a duly elected President of  his Commander in Chief powers, and in the process, emboldening our  enemies.   In fact, President Trump has demonstrated enormous restraint in his  targeted action against Soleimani making this vote entirely  unnecessary. There was no invasion of Iran, but a strike against a  terrorist in a country we had the legal authority to operate in under  the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force.   Mr. Speaker, you have heard many of my colleagues doubt the  applicability of that AUMF, so for those colleagues who are unconvinced  that that is a sufficient authority, consider the fact that even in the  absence of explicit congressional authorization for the Soleimani  strike, here is a helpful reminder: Article II, Section 2 of the  Constitution provides that: The President shall be Commander in Chief.  And it is true that the Constitution gives Congress the sole power to  declare war and the sole power of the purse to either fund or defund  military action, but dating back to the Prize cases in 1863, the  Supreme Court has long held that the President may act without Congress  to defend the Nation.   In recent years, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel has  opined that the Constitution authorizes the President as Commander in  Chief to order military action without congressional permission if the  President determines that the action would be anticipatory self-defense  or otherwise serves the interest of the United States, at least where  the nature, scope, and duration of the anticipated hostilities are  limited.   And that was what was the case here.   Specifically, the OLC has said the President's inherent  constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, his broad foreign  policy powers, and his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully  executed, empower him to deplore the armed forces abroad, without a  declaration of war by Congress or other congressional authorization.   The courts have generally declined to review the exercise of such  unilateral executive power.   The War Powers Resolution does not limit the President's power to act  without Congress. At most, it imposes a reporting and consultation  requirement that this President has complied with.   Furthermore, the War Powers Resolution applies only to the deployment  of significant bodies of military personnel and would not apply to a  drone strike.   Finally, according to OLC, `` . . . if our Armed Forces otherwise  lawfully stationed in a foreign country were fired upon and defended  themselves, we doubt that such engagement in hostilities would be  covered by the consultation and reporting provisions of the War Powers  Resolution.''   Of course, that is precisely the scenario here involving the  President's decisive strike against Soleimani in response to an attack  on our embassy.   Thank goodness we have a Commander in Chief who will not allow  another Benghazi on his watch. Don't forget, the Framers of the  Constitution specifically rejected a proposal that Congress be  empowered to ``make war,'' and implied power for the President to  ``repel sudden attacks.''   This was in recognition of the slow pace and inefficiency of  legislative proceedings under the Articles of Confederation. As Members  of Congress, we have a special duty to jealously guard legislative  prerogatives, including the power to declare war, and to provide a  check on the executive branch for overreach. But we also must have the  humility to acknowledge that Congress lacks the power to divest the  President of his Commander in Chief powers under Article II.                            ____________________
