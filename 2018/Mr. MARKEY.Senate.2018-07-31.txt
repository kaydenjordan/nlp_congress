 Mr. President, I wish to discuss H.R. 6147, which  includes the Fiscal Year 2019 Interior and Related Agencies  Appropriations bill. This bill provides critical funding for the U.S.  Geological Survey, USGS, and the Advanced National Seismic System,  ANSS.   In recent years, USGS funding for external grants for local  earthquake monitoring and research has become highly competitive and  does not always reach areas of need. In a solicitation from May 2017,  for example, USGS only funded approximately 15 percent of the grant  proposals that were submitted to the agency for funding in this area.   I am particularly concerned by USGS's reduction of funding and  utilization of local earthquake monitoring programs and ANSS partner  facilities in areas of moderate earthquake risk, particularly in the  northeast region of the United States.   It is true that most earthquakes tend to occur in zones where past  earthquakes have taken place. However, each year, there are earthquakes  that take place at unexpected locations, including in my home State of  Massachusetts. The Northeast is a region of high population density,  and the cities and towns in this region are often home to older  buildings that are situated on soft soil and vulnerable to earthquake  activity. This means that even small earthquakes can be felt by local  residents and can be misinterpreted another disaster or even as a  terrorist event if accurate and timely information is not readily made  available.   While we cannot yet identify the active faults in the Northeast,  earthquake data and research are pointing us toward those localities  where we need to look for active faults. Once these faults are found,  they can be studied to better define the probabilities of future  potentially damaging earthquakes in the Northeast and New England  region. Important advancements in understanding earthquake hazards and  in promoting earthquake risk reduction activities are realized because  of the efforts of local seismic experts at places like Weston  Observatory in my home State of Massachusetts. These external partners  play critical roles in delivering accurate earthquake assessments and  warnings to State and local emergency management agencies and the  general public.   I look forward to working with USGS to identify ways to expand  funding for research at ANSS partner facilities that will improve their  ability to deliver accurate earthquake assessments and products to  their local populations across the United States, including the  Northeast. As recently as 2011, a Northeast region stakeholder plan for  ANSS called for improved delivery of seismic information to users in  the region; an improved understanding of earthquake hazards in the  Northeast; improved education and outreach on earthquakes and  earthquake safety; and a multi-hazard approach to earthquake monitoring  in this region. The stakeholders also called for funding support to  local earthquake monitoring centers in the Northeast for these  activities. Damaging earthquakes are rare, but they have happened in  the past, and the evidence is overwhelming that they can happen again  at some point in the future.   In order to be fully prepared, I urge the USGS to begin now to  reinvest in local seismic monitoring programs and ANSS partner  facilities in the Northeast and in New England in particular.   Thank you.                            ____________________
