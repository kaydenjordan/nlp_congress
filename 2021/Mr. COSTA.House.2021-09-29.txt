 Madam Speaker, the time is now to make historic  investments in families, workers, and communities across the country.   Everyone, no matter who they are or where they live, deserves access  to modern, dependable infrastructure to maintain the quality of life  for Americans in the 21st century. That is why we must pass the  President's bipartisan infrastructure package tomorrow.   We are living off the investments our grandparents and parents made  generations ago. In many communities, that is no longer sustainable.   In my home State of California, we are suffering from the devastating  effects of climate change, historical fires, and droughts.   Farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, which I represent, also need an  infrastructure that reflects their ability to put food on America's  dinner table every night. The devastating dry conditions and the lack  of water have led many of them to fallow their fields, hundreds and  thousands of acres of productive farmland.   It is as simple as this: Without food from our farmers, Americans  don't eat. It is a national security issue. Therefore, we must fix our  broken water infrastructure system.   The only way to ensure farmers have the water they need to feed our  Nation is to build and improve more conveyance and storage facilities.   This infrastructure package will help that, as well as efforts that  we are pursuing under the reconciliation package. We need to capture  and improve and store water for times such as now.   In addition to that, we need to make other critical investments in  rural and underserved areas by expanding broadband. Broadband access  today is just like rural electrification was in the 1930s. No American  should be without broadband.   We also learned from the COVID-19 crisis that access to quality  healthcare is critical. It is critical that we have ample physicians  and nurses. We can make more protective equipment, but we can't make  more doctors and nurses. Therefore, we have a serious shortage of  healthcare professionals, and that is why a part of this effort to  build back America better is to provide medical schools and underserved  areas improved access to our broadband. That is critical. We must do  that.   In addition, investing in public transportation for our economy is  just as essential. The United States is trailing other nations when it  comes to investments in modern infrastructure and transportation like  high-speed rail. It is time that we bring our system into the 21st  century.   Finishing California's high-speed rail efforts, along with four other  corridors in the country, will help our climate, improve traffic  gridlock, and reduce emissions that pollute the air.   Climate change is an important part of this essential package of  investing in our infrastructure. We know, with the results of droughts,  fires, floods, and hurricanes, that the climate is changing, and we  need to provide tools to address that.   Without critical investments in this infrastructure package that we  will vote on tomorrow, our Nation will suffer. Making life better for  our constituents is my top priority and should be the priority of  Congresspeople throughout the country. It requires us to focus on the  health and development of our communities, and the economy needs us to  support this effort.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have remaining.    Madam Speaker, as we talk about building back better, let  me also note that we must pass a continuing resolution to ensure that  government stays operating.   Shutting down the government is not an option, and we should act upon  this in the next 24 hours to whatever extended date is agreed as well  as lifting the debt ceiling.   In the 17 years I have been here, I have never, under Republican and  Democratic administrations alike, voted to shut down government. That  is irresponsible, and therefore, we must also lift the debt ceiling.  This is, in fact, to pay bills that Congress in the previous  administration has already created, and we don't want to be deadbeats.   The impacts on our economy would be devastating in terms of even  contemplating shutting down government or not lifting the debt ceiling.                          Honoring Sherwood Boehlert     Madam Speaker, I was saddened to learn of our colleague  Congressman Sherry Boehlert's passing. I served with him during his  last term, as he was chair of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee.  [[Page H5515]]    Sherry was terrific. Sherry's focus on making sure that Americans  address the needs of science in a changing world was always at the  forefront as chairman of the committee. I went with Sherry on an  incredible trip to Antarctica to explore the impacts of climate change.   Beyond his contributions to the Congress and to the people of our  country, Sherry was an avid baseball fan. Sherry loved representing  Cooperstown and had the best baseball collection I have ever seen.   God bless you, Sherry, and your family.                            ____________________
