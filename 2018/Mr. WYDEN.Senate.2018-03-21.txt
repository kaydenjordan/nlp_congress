 Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on the  legislation before us, I wish to compliment our new colleague, Senator  Jones, on a superb maiden speech. I thought he was so gracious when he  remembered Senator Heflin. I served with Senator Heflin, and I think  Senator Jones is going to be very much in that tradition. I want to  take a quick minute and commend our new colleague for launching his  time in the Senate in an extraordinary way.                        Amendments Nos. 2212 and 2213    Mr. President, I call up amendments Nos. 2212 and 2213, as provided  for under the previous order, and I ask unanimous consent that they be  reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my hour begin  now for speaking on this subject. We are a bit behind, but not much. I  ask unanimous consent that the hour that has been assigned to me begin  at this time.    Mr. President, I stand on the Senate floor today in firm  agreement with my colleagues that the Congress must do more to combat  the scourge of sex trafficking. It is a profound and tragic failure of  American institutions that trafficking continues to plague our country  and, in fact, has actually increased.  [[Page S1866]]    Federal law enforcement has failed to root out and prosecute the  traffickers, even when they have been operating in plain sight. So,  too, have the big internet companies failed when it comes to sex  traffickers who operate on their platforms.   I fear that the legislation before the Senate now is going to be  another failure. I fear that it is going to do more to take down ads  than to take down traffickers. I that fear it will send these monsters,  these evil people who traffic beyond the grasp of law enforcement to  the shadowy corners of the dark web, a place where every day search  engines don't go, and it is going to be even easier for criminals-- these vicious traffickers--to find a safe haven for their  extraordinarily evil acts.   In many respects, this debate mirrors one the Congress went through a  little bit more than 20 years ago. Back then, I think it would be fair  to say that not many Senators knew much about the internet. In 1995,  this body had a laudable goal. The Senate said it wanted to protect  kids from accessing pornography online, but the result of those good  intentions was, unfortunately, a bad policy--a policy called the  Communications Decency Act of 1996.   Behind that policy was a fundamental misunderstanding of both the  architecture of the internet and the modern application of the First  Amendment. The law didn't just go after those targeting pornography to  minors. It took speech that was legal in the real world and made it  illegal online. And it produced a paradise for the legal trickster,  creating new ways to sue over speech and adversely affecting scores of  Americans, medical providers, artists, writers of literature, and more.   As should happen with poorly written policy, all but one part of the  Communications Decency Act was struck down by the Supreme Court. The  one piece of the law left standing was section 230, which I coauthored  with former Congressman Chris Cox. What section 230 was all about was  laying out the legal rules of the road for the web. There were  innovative new businesses sprouting up all over and novel forms of  communication and media connecting and informing people in new ways.  But it seemed clear that a quick way to strangle this promising set of  developments in their infancy was for these new companies to be held  legally liable for every piece of content that users posted on their  platforms.   When section 230 was written, nobody could have foreseen all of the  effects. Here is what we did know back then. First, we wanted small  businesses to start out focusing on hiring engineers, developers, and  designers rather than worrying about how they had to hire a team of  lawyers.   Second, we wanted to make sure that internet companies could moderate  their websites without getting clobbered by lawsuits. I think Democrats  and Republicans would agree that this is a better scenario than the  alternative, which means websites hiding their heads in the sand out of  fear that they would be weighed down with liability.   Third, we wanted to guarantee that bad actors would still be subject  to all of the Federal laws. Whether the criminals were operating on a  street corner or online wasn't going to make a difference, and we were  determined to state that explicitly.   Fourth, we wanted to protect the internet from the whims of State and  local legislators. This body has the authority to regulate interstate  commerce.   I would ask any of my colleagues to offer an example of how something  could be more interstate than the internet.   It may not satisfy some publicity-seeking local official when we talk  about the Federal Government's role here, but there is no question that  the role of the Congress, in its leading on something that is clearly  interstate in nature, is in the best interest of the American people.   For the most part, the framework worked better than I ever imagined  it would. As a result of section 230, the small, gutsy entrepreneur-- say an entrepreneur in North Carolina--who has a big dream of working  out of his garage has a real shot at succeeding. Marginalized groups of  vulnerable Americans have a better opportunity than ever to make their  voices heard because of section 230, and small nonprofits have the  ability to take their causes nationwide.   One scholar, David Post, even wrote that the 230 law created $1  trillion worth of economic value in the private economy. He said: ``It  is impossible to imagine what the Internet ecosystem would look like  today without it.''   My wife saw that article, looked at me and said: Well, dear, even a  blind squirrel occasionally finds an acorn.   Setting aside spousal kidding, to illustrate why the protection that  comes from section 230 is so important, I turn next to what things  would be like without it.   Imagine if you are starting a forum site that is dedicated to  discussing knitting. If ever there were a topic that sounded drama  free, that would be it. Yet suppose somebody goes on the site and  shares a pattern he didn't have the right to share. Suddenly, your  website is facing a copyright infringement lawsuit. Maybe the  controversy--knitting versus crocheting--gets overheated, and the users  start trading barbs. Suddenly, you have people slinging defamation  suits at your itty-bitty forum host. Then somebody is injured by an  automatic needle threader he reads about in a comment thread. Suddenly,  you are a codefendant in a liability suit--all because you didn't have  the protection of section 230.   Imagine how hard it would be to launch a platform that would be open  to the discussion of any topic when even the simplest, most narrowly  focused website on the internet can become a magnet for lawsuits. There  are not enough lawyers in the world to handle all of that litigation,  and my sense is we will have a lot of constituents who will say: Thank  God.   In the absence of section 230, the internet as we know it would  shrivel. Only the platforms that are run by those with deep pockets and  an even deeper bench of lawyers would be able to make it.   Moreover, section 230 is not just about hobbies and commerce. It  protects the coordination of free speech, particularly among vulnerable  groups of Americans. That is the reason organizations like the  libertarian Cato Institute, the progressive Human Rights Campaign, and  the ACLU have voiced serious concerns about the legislation before the  Senate. You sure don't see those three groups lined up side by side  very often, but they are here now. It is because, without the  protections of section 230, civic organizations that exercise their  right to free speech could be cowed by their more powerful political  opponents.   For this example, imagine that a nonprofit organizes a campaign in  support of a local ballot measure. It uses social media to build  awareness and promote upcoming rallies and events with online  discussion boards. Yet, without section 230, powerful interests that  are opposed to its work can just swoop in and effectively silence that  nonprofit with an onslaught of litigation. Hostile individuals could  pose as supporters and make comments on the nonprofit's website that  would expose the group to liability suits. I think it is pretty obvious  that there would be an enormous, chilling effect on speech in America.   I ask unanimous consent that the statements from the Cato Institute  and the ACLU that are in opposition to the legislation now before the  Senate be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   [From CATO at Liberty, Feb. 27, 2018]                       The Death of an Open Internet                             (By John Samples)         Today the House votes on the Fight Online Sex Trafficking       Act (FOSTA), a piece of anti-sex trafficking legislation. It       follows and incorporates an earlier effort by the Senate, the       Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA). The bill at issue       today is actually a last minute amendment by Representative       Mimi Walters (CA) that brings the worst elements of SESTA       into FOSTA, creating a hybrid bill far worse than the sum of       its parts. This bill has grave consequences for an open,       competitive internet and for some people who use it.        Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has long       shielded internet service providers from liability for user       generated content, facilitating the internet we know today.       FOSTA would likely reduce these protections. FOSTA creates a       new federal crime tied to the intent to promote sex       trafficking  [[Page S1867]]       using the internet. Alone, this might be considered an       acceptable, narrowly tailored measure. However, the Walters       amendment incorporates SESTA's ``knowingly'' standard of       liability, which withholds CDA Section 230 protections from       sites ``knowingly assisting, supporting, or facilitating''       sex-trafficking. SESTA's standard requires no intent to       facilitate sex trafficking, relying upon the mere knowledge       that one's app or blog has been used by bad actors.        Preemptive action, driven by effective platform moderation       and cooperation with law enforcement, remains the most       efficient way to combat online sex trafficking.       Unfortunately, FOSTA's incorporation of SESTA's ``knowingly''       standard would stymie this collaboration. If a platform       attempts to prevent sex trafficking by removing and reporting       offending user generated content, it risks establishing that       it had knowledge of the content, rendering it liable for       anything that might slip through the moderation process.       Instead of encouraging platforms to combat sex trafficking,       SESTA's ``knowingly'' standard punishes private attempts to       prevent the problem, and cripples broader attempts at       effective content moderation.        A combined FOSTA/SESTA would benefit established social       media platforms and trial lawyers at the expense of an open       internet while doing little to prevent sex trafficking.       Facebook may be well resourced enough to cope with the       increased legal risk imposed on hosts of user generated       content, but their nascent competitors are not. Attempts to       avoid running afoul of the ``knowingly'' standard will likely       lead to greater reliance on automated filtering.        Other issues have not received the attention they merit.       Libertarians (and others) often distinguish law from       morality. What is immoral need not be illegal. American law       in many jurisdictions does not honor that distinction and       criminalizes exchanging sex for payment. Some members of       Congress seem pleased this bill will better enforce those       laws against people who voluntarily engage in such exchanges.        The consequence of doing so, however, should please no one.       Members believe this bill will likely drive women who sell       sex for a living off the internet. For them, that is a       feature not a bug of the bill. But those engaged in the sex       trade are unlikely to give up their work. Instead they will       end up on the streets. Why does this change of venue matter?       Between 2002 and 2010, Craigslist introduced an ``erotic       services'' section on its front page which was used almost       exclusively to advertise illegal sex services. Three       economists found that this section led to a 17.4 percent       reduction in the homicide rate of the women in the relevant       jurisdiction. They also noted ``modest evidence'' that the       Craigslist section reduced female rape offenses. The       economists concluded this reduction in violence came from the       women moving indoors and matching more efficiently with safer       clients. This potential increase in violence and murder       should give pause to even those who deem selling sex immoral.        Congress has worked on these bills for some time through       their committees. Now both bills have been thrown together,       brought to the House floor, and are expected to become law,       all in a week or so. Instead of this rush, the House       Judiciary Committee could have finished its work, and the       whole House debated and voted on the measure. The Senate and       House then could have conferred and perhaps produced a bill       acceptable to all. That would be ``regular order'' for       Congress in lawmaking. It has once again been ignored.                                   ____                                   American Civil Liberties Union,                                     Washington, DC, March 12, 2018.      Re Oppose H.R. 1865--The ``Allow States and Victims to Fight           Online Sex Trafficking Act''.       Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators: The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)       writes to express its opposition to H.R. 1865, the ``Allow       States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act,''       also referred to as FOSTA, which passed the House on February       27 and may be considered by the full Senate in the coming       days or weeks. The bill is a serious, yet unsuccessful,       attempt to stop the use of the Internet for sex trafficking       without hindering online freedom of expression and artistic       innovation. Tech experts say that a thriving Internet       requires retaining certain liability protections for online       platforms providers. Victims' rights advocates, on the other       hand, say the sex trafficking problem requires narrowing       those protections. The bill misses the achievable legislative       opportunity to do both, and in particular leaves the Internet       exposed to the uncertain impact of changed protocols on the       part of platform providers.        For nearly 100 years, the ACLU has been our nation's       guardian of liberty, working in courts, legislatures, and       communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and       liberties that the Constitution and the laws of the United       States. With more than 2 million members, activists, and       supporters, the ACLU is a nationwide organization that fights       tirelessly in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, DC       for the principle that every individual's rights must be       protected equally under the law, regardless of race,       religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or national       origin.        The risks to the Internet as the world's most significant       marketplace of ideas outweigh the uncertain benefit of the       bill to the fight against sex trafficking. Accordingly, ACLU       opposes the bill. While the language of H.R. 1865 has been       improved to address some of the ambiguities creating the most       significant risks, ACLU remains concerned that the bill, if       enacted, will foster an atmosphere of uncertainty among       online platform providers. This uncertainty will inhibit the       continued growth of the Internet as a place of creativity and       innovation.        The ACLU has long supported maintaining the statutory       immunity provisions of section 230 of the Communications Act       of 1934 in order to promote freedom of speech and expression.       Section 230 became one of the key factors enabling the robust       expansion of Internet-based speech, communications, and       commerce. It is a critical factor in maintaining the       Internet's diverse ecosystem of speech and art and advancing       economic and political dialogue. The rationale for liability       protections for online providers is that they should not       suffer criminal or civil liability merely for creating online       fora to which others may post content, even when some of       those communications turn out to be offensive or even       unlawful. Any liability should be on those who create and       post that content.        We opposed FOSTA's predecessor bill, an onerous bill that       would have drastically curtailed protections for online       publishers. FOSTA was revised in the House through the       efforts of a broad cross-section of victim advocates, law       enforcement, and tech experts. The current version creates a       new federal facilitation of prostitution crime, but would       still impact liability protections for online providers. As       finally approved, it also incorporated key aspects of the       Senate version of the bill.        ACLU opposed the Senate version of the bill, the ``Stop       Enabling Sex Traffickers Act'' (S. 1693, SESTA), but also       acknowledged improvements incorporated prior to final       committee approval. In particular, the modified version of       SESTA heightened the intent standard needed to establish a       criminal violation--a key distinction separating a typical       online platform provider from one that might inject itself       into the online content being posted to its platform. Also,       in authorizing state prosecutions notwithstanding the federal       liability protections for online platforms, the bill would       limit state prosecutions to those where the behavior violated       the federal law.        The changes to both the House FOSTA bill and the Senate       SESTA bill were the result of concerted advocacy efforts by       Internet and other tech experts who testified about the       critical importance played by section 230 protections. In the       days before the section 230 protections were adopted over two       decades ago, online providers were subject to lawsuits for       allowing the posting of content. The threats were so       financially significant that providers would simply bar the       posting of third party content, knowing they could never       fully insulate themselves from liability except by blocking       all content that might be offensive to some. Since the       adoption of section 230, online providers have been free to       curate their sites' content without fearing liability for       what others post.        Even with the improvements in both bills, ACLU continued to       oppose both measures because the risks to the vibrancy of the       Internet as a driver of political, artistic, and commercial       communication is real and significant. Moreover, there is       little to suggest that current law could not be used to find       and punish the bad actors who are truly facilitating online       sex traffickers. In fact there is at least one pending       federal court case that makes this very argument. There are a       host of state laws outlawing such behaviors and current       liability protections are intended to protect only those who       are simply providing a channel for others to use, not those       who are determining what is posted and who have a malicious       intent to do harm to others. Finally, ACLU is concerned that       the scope of the bill's language will encompass the actions       of sex workers who have no connection to trafficking       whatsoever within its enforcement, including effective harm       reduction and anti-violence tactics. Such an outcome is       directly contrary to the aims of bipartisan criminal justice       reformers who seek to limit the over-federalization of crime       where such crimes already exist at the state level.        For the foregoing reasons, the ACLU opposes H.R. 1865 as       approved by the House of Representatives. It poses a risk to       freedom of speech on the Internet as we have come to know it       while purporting to solve a problem that could be addressed       in other ways.        If you have questions or comments about ACLU's position on       this legislation, please contact First Amendment advisor       Michael Macleod-Ball.            Sincerely,                                                       Faiz Shakir,                                       National Political Director.     Mr. President, the fact is that section 230 was never  about protecting the incumbents. I have spent my time in public service  taking on a wide array of powerful, established interests. When I wrote  this policy, I never envisioned a Facebook, but I did hope it would  give the little guy and  [[Page S1868]]  his startup a chance to grow into something big. The bottom line--the  central point here--is that it worked.   Despite the fact that section 230 undergirds the framework of the  internet as we know it today, there is a significant effort underway to  try to take it down, to collapse it. That is, largely, because the big  internet companies--the biggest ones--have utterly failed to live up to  the responsibility they were handed two decades ago. I am going to  explain exactly what I mean.   For these big companies, section 230 is both a sword and a shield. It  offers protection from liability, but it also gives companies the  authority and, more importantly, the responsibility to foster the sort  of internet Americans want to be proud of. In years of hiding behind  their shields, these big technology companies have left their swords to  rust. Too many companies have become bloated and uninterested in the  larger good, and when they have taken positive steps, as Wikimedia has,  for example, their practices haven't been adopted by their peers.   I will describe one case study that was reported last week by the  tech news website Motherboard.   In 2012, the website Reddit, on which individuals form communities  where they share and discuss content, cracked down on users who posted  nonconsensual photos of women. These have come to be known as  ``creepshots.'' The website Tumblr did not sufficiently police the same  inappropriate content, so these reprehensible communities simply  relocated from Reddit to Tumblr, and this creepshot problem lived on.  That is how easy it is for the creators of vile content to move from  one platform to another.   Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously observed that he  couldn't define hardcore pornography, but he knew it when he saw it.  Congressman Cox and I may not have known exactly what content we  intended for sites to be able to take down when we wrote section 230,  but I sure know it when I see it. Far too often, the big internet  companies refuse to know it even when they see it.   A huge amount of that which populates social media networks each day  is every bit as destructive and socially corrosive, if not more so,  than the pornography at issue in that famed Supreme Court case. It is  the creepshots, the sex trafficking ads, the conspiracy videos about  school shootings, and anti-vax nonsense--nonsense that endangers the  public health and more.   The tech giants state that no one could track the millions of posts  or videos or tweets that cross their services every hour. Nobody is  asking them to do that--nobody. Section 230 means they are not required  to fact-check or scrub every single post or tweet or video, but there  have been far too many alarming examples of algorithms that drive vile,  hateful, or conspiratorial content to the top of the sites that  millions of people click on every day. Companies seem to aid in the  spread of this content as a direct function of their business models.   It is perfectly reasonable to expect some greater responsibility from  these giant, multibillion-dollar corporations that were able to thrive  as a result of protection that they were guaranteed by law. That was  the idea behind section 230. That doesn't carry any obligation to  suppress free speech, but it is definitely about being a responsible  citizen, a responsible member of the community.   Sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Tumblr constitute the entire  internet for millions of users who click through the same group of  sites every single day. They have an undeniable role to play in  fostering a civil environment. Their failure to do so could very well  mean that the internet looks very different 10 years from now, not just  for those who spread hateful and conspiracy-driven filth, but for the  millions of decent people who use the internet to learn, to find  entertainment, and to keep in touch with loved ones.   There was a time when the biggest internet companies had mottos like  ``Don't be evil.'' Perhaps it is time for them to aspire to a more  modest motto: ``Don't spread evil.''   With all of that said and done, it is not just the internet companies  that fail to properly respond to the challenges of our times. When it  comes to sex trafficking, which is the underlying issue the Senate is  working on today, our country has failed the victims at almost every  level.   (Mr. COTTON assumed the Chair.)   For example, the Justice Department could have and absolutely should  have investigated the website backpage years ago for its role in  promoting sex trafficking; but the fact is, the Federal Government fell  down on the job.   Backpage's activities were no secret. In the absence of action by the  Department of Justice, a Senate subcommittee, led by our colleagues  Senators Portman and McCaskill, conducted their own investigation and  subpoenaed key documents. Among those documents were emails that  appeared to show that backpage was actively working with sex  traffickers to create advertisements. That meant backpage was not due  protection under section 230. In fact, a lawsuit in Boston was given  the go-ahead based on that precise finding. It has been widely reported  that the Justice Department now has its own investigation underway,  although it is coming years and years too late. This should have  happened eons ago. This is only one example of where the government's  efforts have fallen short.   Now, following what I have described, the twin failures of the big  technology companies and Federal law enforcement, this body is  responding to a very serious moral challenge with flawed policy  changes. In my view, the legislation before the Senate will prove to be  ineffective, it will have harmful, unintended consequences, and it  could be ruled unconstitutional.   I take a backseat to no one when it comes to policies that fight sex  traffickers, bring them to justice, and help the victims of their  hideous crimes. I have used my position on the Senate Finance Committee  to be one of the authors of laws that support victims and provide  ongoing funding paid for by those convicted of crimes against children.  I have worked with our colleagues, Senator Cornyn, Senator Portman,  Senator Klobuchar, to write laws to improve the child welfare system to  help prevent kids from becoming victims in the first place. I put my  record up against any Member of this Congress when it comes to passing  laws that while definitely not going far enough, begin the effort to  provide the tools to fight this scourge, but the bill before us today  is not going to stop sex trafficking. It is not going to prevent young  people from becoming victims, and I am going to describe why that is  the case.   First, as I mentioned earlier, the Department of Justice takes the  view that an important provision in the bill is unconstitutional. In my  judgment, that is another issue that Congress ought to address before  sending a bill to the President's desk, but instead it looks like  everybody will drive it through as is.   Second--and this is an astounding development--the legislation before  the Senate is going to make it harder, not easier, to root out and  prosecute sex traffickers. Let me read what the Department of Justice  has said recently that proves that this bill is going to make it harder  to root out and prosecute sex traffickers. The Department of Justice  recently said this legislation would ``effectively create additional  elements that prosecutors must prove at trial.'' Colleagues, I will  just state we are heading in the wrong direction if we have legislation  that would raise the burden of proof in cases against sex traffickers.  Imagine that, with nationwide concerns about the evils of sex  trafficking, the Department of Justice has said this bill would  actually raise the burden of proof in cases against sex traffickers.   The Department of Justice wrote a letter to Chairman Goodlatte of the  House Judiciary Committee that lays out the concerns I have just  described.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the Justice Department letter.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S1869]]           U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Legislative             Affairs, Office of the Assistant Attorney General,                                 Washington, DC, February 27, 2018.      Hon. Robert W. Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter presents the views of the       Department of Justice (Department) on H.R. 1865, the ``Allow       States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of       2017.'' The Department supports H.R. 1865. We applaud House       and Senate legislative efforts to address the use of websites       to facilitate sex trafficking and to protect and restore       victims who were sold for sex online. The Department       appreciates this opportunity to provide technical assistance       to ensure that these goals are fully met through narrowly       tailored legislation. The Department also notes that a       provision in the bill raises a serious constitutional       concern.        Every day, trafficking victims in America appear in online       advertisements that are used to sell them for sex. The       Department works diligently to hold the traffickers       accountable for their crimes but faces serious challenges.       This is due in part to the high evidentiary standard needed       to bring federal criminal charges for advertising sex       trafficking, but also because the Communications Decency Act       (CDA), codified at 47 U.S.C. 230, bars our state and local       partners from bringing any criminal action that is       inconsistent with that section. H.R. 1865 addresses both       issues and would take meaningful steps to end the industry of       advertising trafficking victims for commercial sex.                             TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE         Section 3(a) of the bill creates 18 U.S.C. 2421A, a new       federal offense that prohibits the use or operation of       websites (and other means or facilities of interstate       commerce) with the intent to promote or facilitate       prostitution. The bill also provides for an aggravated felony       if the defendant recklessly disregards that the crime       contributed to sex trafficking as prohibited by 18 U.S.C.       1591(a). Section 2421A would stand as a strong complement to       existing federal laws.        However, the Department notes that Section 2421A as       originally drafted is broader than necessary because it would       extend to situations where there is a minimal federal       interest, such as to instances in which an individual person       uses a cell phone to manage local commercial sex transactions       involving consenting adults. Therefore, the Department would       support amending the language of Section 2421A so that       Congress can clarify its intent to target traffickers using       or operating interactive computer services, as follows (with       a corresponding change to 2421A(b)): ``Whoever, using a       facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce or in or       affecting interstate or foreign commerce, owns, manages, or       operates an interactive computer service, as defined in       Section 230(f) of Title 47, United States Code, or conspires       or attempts to do so, with the intent to promote or       facilitate prostitution shall be fined under this title,       imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or both.''        The Department believes that any revision to 18 U.S.C. 1591       to define ``participation in a venture'' is unnecessary.       Section 1591 already sets an appropriately high burden of       proof, particularly in cases involving advertising. Under       current law, prosecutors must prove that the defendant       knowingly benefitted from participation in a sex trafficking       venture, knew that the advertisement related to commercial       sex, and knew that the advertisement involved a minor or the       use of force, fraud, or coercion. See Backpage.com, LLC v.       Lynch, D.D.C., Civil Action No. 15-2155, Docket 16 (Oct. 24,       2016). While well intentioned, this new language would impact       prosecutions by effectively creating additional elements that       prosecutors must prove at trial. In the context of the bill,       which also permits states to bring actions for conduct       equivalent to Section 1591, we are also mindful that this       language could have unintended consequences as applied by the       states.        Section 4 of H.R. 1865 also sets forth critical revisions       to the CDA to permit state prosecutors to bring criminal       actions related to sex trafficking and the use of the       interact with the intent to promote or facilitate       prostitution. The Department believes that the existence of       this exception to the CDA will alter the landscape of the       industry involved in advertising prostitution.                            CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN         We note that Section 4 of H.R. 1865 states that the changes       to the CDA ``shall apply regardless of whether the conduct       alleged occurred [sic], or is alleged to have occurred,       before, on, or after such date of enactment.'' This raises a       serious constitutional concern. Insofar as this bill would       ``impose[] a punishment for an act which was not punishable       at the time it was committed'' or ``impose[] additional       punishment to that then prescribed'' it would violate the       Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause. Cummings v. Missouri, 4       Wall. 277, 325-326 (1867); see Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U.S. 167,       169-170 (1925); U.S. Const. art I, 9, cl. 3. The Department       objects to this provision because it is unconstitutional. We       would welcome the opportunity to work with Congress to       address this serious constitutional concern.        Thank you for the opportunity to present our views in       support of this legislation. We hope this information is       helpful, and we look forward to continuing to work with       Congress on this important legislation. Please do not       hesitate to contact this office if we may provide additional       assistance regarding this or any other matter. The Office of       Management and Budget has advised us that from the       perspective of the Administration's program, there is no       objection to submission of this letter.            Sincerely,                                                   Stephen E. Boyd,                                        Assistant Attorney General.     Mr. President, that is not the only problem when it comes  to enforcing this law. The bill before the Senate is focused on taking  down online advertisements, not on catching criminals or protecting  victims. Taking down the ads doesn't mean the pimps and predators will  stop and say: Oh, good; we see what the Senate is doing. We are now  going to start following the rules. When the ads come down, colleagues,  the criminals will go as fast as they can to the darkest corners of our  society. Instead of stopping trafficking, the bill is going to push it  to the dark web, the dark alleys, and overseas. You can't get to the  dark web with traditional search engines.   Career Federal law enforcement officers, the expert investigators,  are the people who know how to root out the traffickers under these  circumstances. They have expertise that State and local law enforcers  don't have. So my view is, by handing new authorities to local  officials, the bill moves in the wrong direction.   In my view, the right approach is to make sure career, expert Federal  law enforcement officers and investigators have the resources they need  to get the job done. One of the amendments I will be offering today  provides $20 million a year for 5 years to the Attorney General to  spend in coordination with the FBI and Homeland Security to investigate  and prosecute those who criminally facilitate sex trafficking. The  bottom line, if Senators want law enforcement to do a better job of  stopping those like backpage, my amendment gives the right people the  resources they need to bring these monsters to justice.   I heard my colleague from Alaska, Senator Sullivan, a good friend,  talk at some length about how important it was to have resources to  fight the scourge of these traffickers who get more and more  sophisticated. They are people who are very clever about staying out in  front of the law. When they are on the dark web, it is going to take  resources to fight them and put them behind bars. So our colleague from  Alaska, Senator Sullivan, sure ought to be for this amendment because  this amendment offers real money right now to prosecute these monsters  and get them behind bars.   Finally, the bill before the Senate punches a hole in the legal  framework of the open internet. I don't every single day quote the  editors of the ``Wall Street Journal,'' but I have always had a motto  that I will shout out anybody when they are right. The Journal recently  summed up the impact of the bill. They said this is definitely going to  be an online ``lawsuit bonanza.'' They predict any website that  ``should have known'' criminal activity took place on its platform will  be a target for lawsuits. Any message board or chat room where users  interact with each other can become a new target for litigation.   Without specific protections for companies that make good-faith  efforts to find and stop criminal behavior on their platforms, this  legislation could actually punish companies that try to moderate their  users' posts but let something slip through. Just by looking for  illegal material, a website could be setting the table to be sued over  anything they didn't find.   The second amendment I will be offering would clarify this issue. It  is what is known as the Good Samaritan clause, and we felt strongly  about it several decades ago. The companies decide, as a result of a  poorly written bill, that their only option is to put their blinders on  and ignore vile, illicit content. That is bad for everybody except for  the criminals. So I want to eliminate that uncertainty, and I want  particularly these small startup companies that are so important for  our future to know, without a doubt, that they have the right to  moderate the content users post.   So, in technical language, what this amendment says is, neither the  presence nor the absence of an attempt to moderate content online can,  by itself, trigger liability.  [[Page S1870]]    The Journal raised more than the Good Samaritan issue. Just as bad,  by passing this exception to section 230, courts might make it harder  to prosecute websites for other crimes. Here is what the Wall Street  Journal editor said: ``If Congress provides a carve-out for sex  trafficking, courts might conclude that Section 230 was intended to be  applied narrowly for other crimes and make it harder to prosecute  websites [that are] complicit.''   I do fear this bill is going to set off a chain reaction that leads  the Congress to cut away more categories of behavior from section 230,  dismantle the legal framework that has given the United States the  position as a tech economy superpower. This position did not happen by  osmosis. It happened because 20 years ago there was an effort to try to  lay out a sensible legal foundation, a sensible legal basis for the  internet, and that is what is under attack today.   If this legislation that chips away at section 230 is a bad idea for  the internet, if you are following this debate, you probably want to  know why the biggest internet companies are big cheerleaders for it-- the big companies like Facebook. It is because it will pull up the  ladder in the tech world, leaving the established giants alone at the  top.   As I said, section 230, from the beginning, was all about giving the  little guy the best possible chance to succeed. That is what this has  always been about. The big guys can take care of themselves. We want to  have a policy that encourages innovation for the startups. That has  been a bedrock of my time in public service. Chipping away at the law  that is going to curtail the culture of innovation and bare-knuckled  competition that has been the defining characteristic of the internet  for more than two decades doesn't make any sense to me.   The companies that have reached the top of the internet's economy are  kind of worried about whether they are going to be able to keep their  place at that altitude. Regulators once feared that Microsoft would  dominate the way Americans interacted with the internet, but then a  little company called Google appeared on the scene. Facebook, a half- trillion-dollar company got out of its infancy by displacing a  competitor called MySpace.   I think colleagues ought to know that these established companies  would do just about anything to avoid being displaced themselves.  Facebook is trying to make clear that they will do just about anything  not to become another MySpace.   Today, Facebook is under attack for allowing the Russians to  interfere with our elections. They are under attack for giving hate  groups a platform to spread their bile. They are under attack for  giving conspiracy theorists, through their algorithms, a platform to  lure in the unsuspecting. They are under attack for collecting,  monetizing, and storing far more personal information than their users  ever suspected. It is a great tool for connecting with family and  friends, but it is also something a small team of well-caffeinated  coders could duplicate and improve upon in terms of its functionality  without a lot of difficulty and without some of the baggage Facebook  has picked up over the last 6 months.    So how do they stay on top? One way is to acquire the competition.  Young people always tell me that nobody under 30 uses Facebook. The new  generation certainly uses Instagram, so they might not even know that  it is part of the same megacompany bought out by Facebook. But you  can't buy everybody, so then you go to the oldest trick in the book-- make it harder for new companies to get in the game. You don't have to  compete if there is no competition, and that is where this legislation  comes in.   If internet startups are no longer protected by section 230 and they  are exposed to the threat of near constant litigation, it is going to  be a lot tougher for them to secure injections of funding and grow.  Fewer venture capital firms will be willing to risk their deep pockets  if their early-round investments are swallowed up by legal fees instead  of paying for coders. But in the eyes of the giant, established  corporations, a world without section 230 isn't seen as much of a  threat. The $50 million a year in liability statements for these big  companies is a drop in the bucket for them. It is the cost of doing  business. And it is an added benefit if the cost is too high for new  companies to be able to get in the game.   The biggest of these internet companies are trying to hold on to  their position at the top with all their might, and they are certainly  very interested in using the government to do it. That has been true of  a lot of industries before them, and it should come as no surprise that  it happens again in the technology area.   The Facebooks of the world will tell you how important section 230  was to the innovation of the last 20 years. Yet there are technology  companies like IBM that haven't done a lot of innovating for the last  20 years that want to see section 230 done away with entirely for  trumped-up reasons. So, for business, let's not mistake what this  debate is all about for a lot of these big, multinational companies. It  is not about right or wrong; it is about dollars and cents.   So what does the future hold? As the Wall Street Journal observed, a  lawsuit bonanza is in the works. It is pretty ironic that a Republican  Congress and a Republican President are going to create the biggest new  source of opportunities for trial lawyers in decades.   For the technology business, this bill means bigger is better--not  better for innovation, not better for consumers, but better for the  profits of those lucky enough to have reached the top of the mountain  first.   It is safe to expect a slew of proposed new exceptions to section  230. When somebody is injured, they and their families want recourse,  but our legal system is woefully bad at delivering justice. It is  unfortunately far better at facilitating deals--often unjust deals-- because numbers are far easier than doing right. This failure means  that a line of injured parties will be petitioning to seek the sort of  recompense only their Member of Congress can provide.   For America, section 230 is very likely the reason we have a  multitude of billion-dollar internet employers and the Europeans have  exactly zero. Where countries aren't hiding behind the trade barrier of  the great firewall or other artificial market forces, American  innovation has won out over the rest of the world.   I think it is pretty hard to see our country thrive and prosper  without the kind of legal foundation I have described today, without  these 230 protections. And a whole host of scholars have pointed out  that this is a unique law in the world. It is the case where the United  States got the temperature right from the beginning, and it has led to  our dominance in tech. But if the United States goes out and puts all  those cracks--those potential cracks, the real cracks--into the  foundation of section 230, I would wager that there are plenty of other  countries that are going to change their laws to siphon away our  companies and take the jobs they create.   The fact is--and I am not sure we in the Senate think about it every  day--we are in a fight for the internet literally every day. Our  internet companies aren't engaged in the fight. Their interest is  currying favor with nations with which they wish to do business. The  Chinese, the Iranians, the Russians, even our European allies are  maneuvering to impose a more repressive view of speech and expression  on individuals around the world, and unfortunately it has a lot of  allies here at home.   Free speech has never been free, and it is often not popular. It was  wrested from the grip of a dominating state, and it ought to be--it  must be defended by every generation, lest the state reclaim control.   Today, in my view, the Senate is looking at taking a real step  backward and down a path that this body will regret.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the  pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I believe strongly that Congress must do  more to combat the scourge of sex trafficking and bring these monsters  to justice and actually put them behind bars.   I have heard my colleagues from the other side talk again and again  about how more resources are needed to fight this evil. This is the  only proposal offered to actually put more dollars into the hands of  prosecutors to get the criminals behind bars, and it is going to be  harder to prosecute them now that they have moved to the dark web.   My colleague has said that prosecutors are against it. It is because  my colleague has worked as hard as he could to tell prosecutors that if  anything like this is added, it is going to die in the House. Let me  just tell my colleague that when we put in more money to prosecute  these monsters and it passes, the other body will pass it in about 15  minutes.   I urge my colleagues to vote for the only amendment that actually is  going to put these criminals behind bars because we are putting real  money into that effort.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak to the  body for 1 minute.    Mr. President, in my view, it is clear that when  colleagues face so much political headwind, they don't feel comfortable  supporting something I know they all believe in very deeply. I believe  every Senator believes there ought to be real money to go after sex  traffickers. I have spoken to colleagues on both sides of the aisle,  and they have taken a real pounding on these amendments. My sense is  that there would also be opposition to what I think is another  practical, good idea, which is the Good Samaritan amendment.   As I have stated, because I anticipate having to turn back to this  topic in short order after the effects of this bill become clear, I am  going to save this topic for a vote at that time.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No.  2212.    Mr. President, with that amendment having been withdrawn,  I ask unanimous consent that there now be 2 minutes for debate, equally  divided, prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. President, as I stated several hours ago, I stand  firmly with colleagues who believe more must be done to fight the  scourge of sex trafficking and, particularly, to put these monsters  behind bars. The bill before us, in my view, takes a flawed approach.  What is going to happen is that the criminal sex trafficker is going to  head toward the dark web. This is a place you cannot access with a  traditional search engine. It is going to be harder when they are in  the shadowy corners of our country, of the internet, in order to  prosecute them. It is also going to chip away at the foundation of the  net, which is so important for vulnerable people. It is why the Human  Rights Campaign Fund has made it  [[Page S1872]]  clear that they are opposed to the bill. We shouldn't be putting at  risk vulnerable groups and small startups.   Given that, I believe that this bill, which will clearly pass, will  be something the Senate will come to deeply regret. I will be opposing  the bill.
