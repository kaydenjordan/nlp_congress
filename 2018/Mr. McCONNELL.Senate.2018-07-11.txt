 Mr. President, yesterday I had an opportunity to meet  with Judge Brett Kavanaugh as we begin preparations for his  confirmation process to the Supreme Court. It is really impossible not  to come away impressed. Judge Kavanaugh is the real deal. He has the  all-star legal resume and the top-light academic credentials. His  extensive judicial record is defined by fairness, thoughtfulness,  thoroughness, and analytical precision. I was already confident the  President had made an outstanding choice. Now I am even more confident.  My colleagues here and Americans around the country won't have to take  my word for it; just look to one of Judge Kavanaugh's former professors  at Yale Law School. Here is what Professor Akhil Amar wrote in the New  York Times: ``It is hard to name anyone with judicial credentials as  strong as those of Judge Kavanaugh.''   Current faculty at Yale Law described him as a ``true intellectual,''  ``a leading thinker,'' and ``a wonderful mentor and teacher to our  students.''   Even at Harvard, his alma mater's archrival, a scholar agrees that  Judge Kavanaugh is ``a generous, honorable, kind person.''   Ask the legal professionals who have clerked for him on the DC  Circuit. They are in a better position than most to speak to his  writing as a jurist. In a letter to our colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee, 34 of them share that Judge Kavanaugh ``drafts opinions  painstakingly, writing and rewriting until he is satisfied each opinion  is clear and well-reasoned, and can be understood not only by lawyers  but by the parties and the public.''   As the confirmation process gets underway, I have a distinct feeling  this isn't the only testimony of this sort that we will be hearing.  Judge Kavanaugh seems to impress everyone with whom he crosses paths-- at least those who haven't blindly announced in a fit of partisanship  their opposition to this nomination before he was even named.   I am glad that President Trump has made such a strong selection, and  I look forward to our colleagues in the Judiciary Committee taking up  this nomination.   Mr. President, speaking of the personnel business, we are continuing  this week to process President Trump's qualified nominees for other  important positions in the judicial and executive branches. Yesterday,  we confirmed the  [[Page S4882]]  22nd circuit court judge since January of 2017.   Now we are considering Brian Benczkowski, the President's choice to  serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division at the  Department of Justice. His resume includes distinguished service in  five different leadership positions at the Department of Justice under  three Attorneys General. His nomination has won praise from a number of  former Justice Department officials who served under Presidents of both  parties. Their letter describes this nominee as ``a tireless worker . .  . a fine leader and colleague . . . honest and a straight shooter.'' I  look forward to voting to confirm him later today and to continuing to  confirm more of the President's team.                                  job growth    Mr. President, on one final matter, last week, the Labor Department  released its monthly jobs report. As has become a pattern, it contained  good news about the state of job opportunities across our country. In  June alone, our economy created 213,000 new jobs, with contributions  from nearly every sector. That continues a prolonged streak of strong  jobs performance month after month, quarter after quarter.   The pro-growth, pro-jobs policies of this united Republican  government--from historic tax relief to sweeping regulatory reform--are  helping unleash this wave of new opportunity and new prosperity for  America's workers and middle-class families.   More than 600,000 Americans entered the workforce last month alone-- another sign that the Obama-era stagnation continues to lose its grip  on our communities. The rate of hiring reached its highest level in  more than a decade. Here is another promising sign: the rate at which  Americans are quitting their jobs voluntarily. Economists tell us this  is an important sign of a healthy job market because it indicates  workers are moving upward, seeking better pay or superior benefits at a  different employer. That number just hit its highest level in more than  17 years.   More jobs; more opportunities; more Americans coming off of the  sidelines and getting back into the workforce; more Americans moving up  the ladder to bigger and better things and opening up their current  positions for other jobseekers at the same time--helping to produce  conditions like these is what Republicans had in mind when we chipped  away at the regulatory rust that kept American job creators from doing  what they do best. That is what we had in mind when we used the  Congressional Review Act a record 16 times to relieve bureaucratic  bloat that had forced job creators and entrepreneurs to cut back or  close up shop. That is what we had in mind when we overhauled our Tax  Code so it better rewards workers and more strongly encourages job  creators to deepen their roots in American soil. Republicans are proud  of this thriving job market, and we are proud that our policies are  playing a part in making it happen.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Thursday, July 12; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Ney nomination; finally, that notwithstanding rule  XXII, all postcloture time on the nomination expire at 1:30 p.m.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order, following the remarks of Senators Rubio and Merkley.
