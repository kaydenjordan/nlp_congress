 Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in support of H.R.  1430, and I appreciate the primer that we were just given from the  other side on what an emergency is.   I would remind my good friend on the other side that, on November 8,  2016, the Americans stood up and said: We have an emergency. We need to  change directions. And they elected Donald Trump to be President to do  just that. So that is a good reminder.   Mr. Speaker, our constituents have a right to know whether or not EPA  regulations are based on sound science and if they benefit the American  people.   Keeping in the vein with what I just said, we have a better way.  Speaker Paul Ryan has put out his plan for A Better Way. Donald Trump  has been elected for that better way. The American people deserve a  better way.   This is called the HONEST Act, which I am proud to be a cosponsor of.  It is a better way. It is simple and straightforward. It is a message  to government bureaucrats they cannot propose costly new regulations  without providing sufficient transparency. As my good friend from  Washington said: Why would anybody be opposed to transparency and a  right for the American public to know?   Opponents of this bill apparently think Americans do not deserve to  know the truth, not to mention the ``science'' behind EPA burdensome  regulations.                                time  1245    Trust me when I say Americans deserve the truth from the very start.   Mr. Speaker, EPA's regulatory agenda should not require secret  science, much less 30-year-old data, in order to sell it to the  American people. The other side likes to claim that there are a lot of  scientists behind this climate change theory, but they won't release  that data.   So what are they hiding behind?   By the way, I remember Mark Twain said that sometimes the majority  simply means that all the fools are on one side.   Mr. Speaker, it is long past time for Congress to increase the  transparency of the EPA. This HONEST Act will do exactly that by  prohibiting the EPA from proposing or finalizing regulations based upon  data that is either outdated, it is not transparent, nor is it publicly  available for review.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for bringing this important  legislation to the floor today, and I thank the fine gentleman from  Washington State (Mr. Newhouse).
