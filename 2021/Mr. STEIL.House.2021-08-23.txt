 Madam Speaker, I rise to sound the alarm of Bernie  Sanders' and Speaker Pelosi's spending spree. Let's not forget that  earlier this year Biden and Pelosi have already spent trillions of  dollars. Speaker Pelosi has brought us back to Washington late in  August, but not to address the crisis in Afghanistan.   No, she brought us back to push through another $4.5 trillion in new  spending. If we printed that amount of money in bills, it would fill  50,000 semi-trailers. 50,000 semi-trailers of cash, that is what is  before us. Who is ultimately going to pay for this? American families,  American workers, American farmers, through higher taxes.   And as the cost of everything from school supplies to food to gas  continue to go up, all of us will feel the pain of this wasteful  spending spree through higher prices.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this wasteful spending  plan.                            ____________________
