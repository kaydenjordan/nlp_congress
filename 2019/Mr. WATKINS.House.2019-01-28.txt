 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is Kansas Day. As Kansas  celebrates her 158th birthday, I would like to take a minute to  celebrate her.   Our State motto is ``Ad Astra per Aspera,'' through hardships to the  stars. This motto captures our State and the spirit of our people.   We have had frontiersmen, space explorers, and leaders in agriculture  and digital technology.   We have won sports championships and Academy Awards.   Leaders like Eisenhower, Dole, Roberts, and Pompeo have helped make  the world a better place.   From our history of Bleeding Kansas to Brown v. Board of Education,  we are never afraid to fight for what is right.   For 158 years, Kansas, you look great.                            ____________________
