 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, with every study, every research paper,  every scientific breakthrough, we have come to understand that most  Americans realize that there is more to healthcare than those who are  sick and those who aren't. Really, we can't just focus our treatment on  those that are unwell.   It is a shortsighted strategy, and unfortunately, the one this  country has been employing for far too long before the Affordable Care  Act.   Why would we only try to treat the problem once it has already  occurred, when we can work to prevent it in the first place?   The keys to prevention are a healthy living environment and swift  access to care, helping us deal with healthcare issues before they  become acute. And this approach will save money.   With that in mind, I am offering my amendment to appropriate funds to  study how to help bring social and behavioral aid programs under the  same roof as our traditional healthcare providers.   We know there is a link between healthy living, housing, and food  security. If we already allocate funds to programs to help facilitate  healthy living, why don't we house them in the same place that we are  housing these health centers?   This works. I have seen it.   A holistic approach like this will demonstrate to people in rural,  underserved, or underprivileged communities that no matter how  seemingly dire their situations, there are paths to healthy living.   Sadly, we see daily reminders that where someone is born or where  they live can determine so much in their lives.   My home State of Massachusetts is a leader when it comes to  healthcare, but it is not without its own disparities. In some corners  of my district, the average life expectancy is less than 70 years of  age, while elsewhere in the Commonwealth, it could be over 90 years  old.   There is no easy answer to why that is the case. It is a combination  of means, education, environment, and access to healthcare.   Clearly, there needs to be more progress. Education and access to  information can help to lift people into healthier circumstances.   If health centers had specialists who had experience dealing with  SNAP and WIC, more families would receive nutritional advice and more  young mothers would be able to raise healthier babies.   In those same centers, if we had people who could really help with  housing concerns, we would be able to get more people into stable  situations and off the street corners and away from homelessness.   For those dealing with brain diseases like addiction, integrating  mental health services could help improve access to comprehensive  treatment.   In my district, I have seen firsthand the great work done by the  Greater New Bedford Community Health Center and the Outer Cape Health  Services in Harwich, Massachusetts, where they try to incorporate these  services, and actually successfully incorporate these services that  impact social detriments of healthcare all under one roof.   I am also excited to note that this coming Friday, the Outer Cape  Health Services is reopening and expanding a comprehensive healthcare  center in Wellfleet to better serve an underserved rural community over  90 minutes away from the closest hospital.   But nationwide, existing resources can only get us so far.   We are on the verge of a breakthrough, and we need to find out how  Congress can take us beyond this tipping point.   That is why my amendment is important. We need to know how much our  health centers need to plan and what they need to successfully tackle  social determinates of health alongside traditional healthcare  services.   My amendment provides the Health Resources & Services Administration  with the resources that will allow them to study this.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lee).                                time  2200     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman, and I urge my  colleagues all across the Nation, if you are in a rural area, if you  are in an underserved area, this is important for all of us.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
