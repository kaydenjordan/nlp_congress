 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding  time to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 2-week continuing resolution.  This short-term CR is a necessary stopgap to keep the government  operating until we can finalize an agreement for the top line numbers  and finish our work on all 12 appropriations bills.   As some of my colleagues have noted, the House Appropriations  Committee completed its work several months ago, passing all 12 of the  bills out of this Chamber back in September, about 80 days ago. The  other Chamber has not made the same progress, and the resolution before  us today will buy us a little time to negotiate with our counterparts  who are behind.   Once our budget deal is done, we will be able to begin those  negotiations, and I am very confident we will be able to quickly finish  our work.   I cannot overstate the importance of getting all 12 appropriations  bills conferenced and across the line, but I would be remiss if I did  not emphasize the critical operations funded in my bill. A final FY18  bill for the Department of Homeland Security is necessary to ensure our  Nation is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other  threats.   Mr. Speaker, the American people count on us to get the job done. I  urge my colleagues to support this short-term CR to avert a government  shutdown and allow us to complete our work.
