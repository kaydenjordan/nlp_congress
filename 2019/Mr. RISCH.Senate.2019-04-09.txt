 Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record at this point the notifications which have  been received. If  [[Page S2320]]  the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                  Japan--Standard Missile (SM)-3 Block IB         The Government of Japan has requested to buy up to fifty-      six (56) Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IB missiles. Also       included are missile canisters, U.S. Government and       contractor representatives' technical assistance, engineering       and logistical support services, and other related elements       of logistics and program support. The estimated cost is       $1.150 billion.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by improving the       security of a major ally that is a force for political       stability and economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region.       It is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Japan in       developing and maintaining a strong and effective self-      defense capability.        The proposed sale will provide Japan with increased       ballistic missile defense capability to assist in defending       the Japanese homeland and U.S. personnel stationed there.       Japan will have no difficulty absorbing these additional       missiles into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor for the SM-3 Block IB All Up Rounds       will be Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, Arizona. The prime       contractor for the canisters will be BAE Systems,       Minneapolis, Minnesota. There are no known offset agreements       proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require annual       trips to Japan involving U.S. Government and contractor       representatives for technical reviews, support, and oversight       for approximately five years.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-13       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The proposed sale will involve the release of sensitive       technology to the Government of Japan related to the Standard       Missile-3 (SM-3):        The Block IB is an iteration of the SM-3 family. It has       distinct features over the older Block IA variant previously       sold to Japan including an enhanced warhead which improves       the search, discrimination, acquisition and tracking       functions in order to address emerging threats. Once enclosed       in the canister, the SM-3 Block IB missile is classified       CONFIDENTIAL.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that Japan can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Japan.                            ____________________
