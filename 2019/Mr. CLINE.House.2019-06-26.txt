 Madam Speaker, today I would like to recognize James  Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia.   JMU was recently announced as having the highest postgraduation  employment rates out of all of Virginia's colleges and universities.  This is an outstanding accomplishment for one of the Commonwealth of  Virginia's largest colleges.   Institutions like JMU educate students and prepare them for  opportunities that they might not have had without a college degree.  Graduates of 4-year colleges have completed the work and are now tasked  with the responsibility of finding employment. Fortunately, for recent  graduates, demand for talent is high and unemployment is at a record  low.   Congratulations to JMU on this monumental achievement.   Go Dukes.                            ____________________
