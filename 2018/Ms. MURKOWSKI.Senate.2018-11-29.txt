 Mr. President, today I wish to give special  recognition to Lawrence P. Cotter on the occasion of his retirement.  Larry is a great friend and dedicated Alaskan whose contributions to  our State are significant and lasting, benefiting our State's fisheries  and rural communities to this day and into the future.   As a resident of Alaska for almost half a century, Larry's work has  taken him from fish processing plants to the halls of our State capitol  and beyond. After arriving in Alaska in 1974, he spent over 4 years as  a seafood processing worker in Juneau and 8 years as a labor organizer  and representative for processing workers and longshoremen.   Larry shaped critical fisheries policy through his service on the  advisory panel to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, of  which he was a member for 6 years. This service was followed by an  additional 6 years as a voting member on the Council during a critical  time in the development of our Nation's domestic fisheries. Larry  worked to ensure that foreign fishing in our exclusive economic zone  was phased out and that our domestic fishing and processing  capabilities were stepping up to replace the foreign fleets.   This shift to an all-domestic fleet allowed the United States to  finally harvest our fishery resources for the sole benefit of American  fishermen and processors. It was also during this period that  allocation issues among U.S. fisheries interests were first coming to  the forefront. These were challenging and exciting times, during which  Larry's leadership thrived. His legacy in Alaska fisheries cannot be  overstated.   Most recently, until late this year, Larry served as the founding CEO  of the Aleutian Pribilof Island Community Development Association, or  APICDA. As one of six community development quota organizations in  western Alaska, APICDA has used the benefits of Bering Sea and Aleutian  fishery resources to support its member communities in some of the most  rural and remote parts of Alaska.   In helping to develop, implement, and sustain the CDQ program, Larry  did perhaps his best work, accomplishing goals that will have positive  impacts on western Alaskan communities for generations to come. Larry's  visionary work on the formation of Alaska's CDQ program has benefited  all of the participating communities through workforce, infrastructure,  and economic development.   Many observers, myself included, have correctly noted that Alaska has  the best managed fisheries in the country, and I know we could not have  achieved this hard-earned status without Larry's tireless dedication to  making our seafood industry truly sustainable.   Thank you, Larry, for your tremendous contributions to sustainable  fisheries and to the participation of our coastal communities in those  fisheries. I wish you a restful retirement and the best of luck in your  future endeavors.                            ____________________
