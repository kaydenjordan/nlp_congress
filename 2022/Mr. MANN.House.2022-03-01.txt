 Madam Speaker, in preparation for reauthorizing the farm  bill in 2023, I rise today to deliver the next installment of my Farm  Bill Impact Series where I am highlighting various aspects of the farm  bill that deserves Congress' awareness and support.   If America is going to thrive, the people who feed, fuel, and clothe  America must thrive, and the farm bill contains certain programs that  have been critical to the success of agricultural producers in my  district and the food security of our country. This week, I am talking  about crop insurance.   I believe that crop insurance is one of the most important programs  within the farm bill, and my conversation with producers, farm  economists, and crop insurance agents have shaped my understanding of  how critical it is to reauthorize the crop insurance title in full for  2023.   Crop insurance helps producers manage the risks that they face every  day from weather, pests, disease, and market volatility; it has also  been one of our Nation's best public-private partnership programs  between the government, private industry, and agricultural producers.  Crop insurance does two things: it benefits farmers and it benefits  Americans. Crop insurance never replaces a good crop, but it lets  producers stay in the game if disaster strikes and it helps to ensure  that our country continues to be the most food-secure nation in the  world.   I recently spoke with two Kansas farmers to get their thoughts on the  importance of crop insurance. One of them said to me, ``I spend a lot  of time thinking about the agronomic and economic strength of my farm.  Crop insurance is the most important tool in my toolbox for ensuring my  farm's economic strength in the face of my two biggest challenges: the  weather and the global market. For small family operations like mine,  banks want to see crop insurance before they will give you a line of  credit because they want to know that you can remain resilient as an  operation through times of volatility.''   Another Kansas farmer told me, ``The very first year I was not sure  that I wanted to take out insurance. My mom convinced me to manage my  risk and so I did. That year was extremely dry in the spring, and my  first crop of wheat only made 12 bushels to the acre. If I didn't have  crop insurance, that year would have put me in a deep hole, and I would  have missed my equipment payments. I have never forgotten that, and I  have carried crop insurance every year since.''   There are countless stories just like these that testify to the  importance of crop insurance, without which the government would be  continually considering ad hoc disaster relief programs for farmers.  Crop insurance is a market-based approach to risk management with a  proven track record. The more we reduce the impact of risk and  volatility in agriculture, the more food secure we become as a nation,  and the more food secure we are, the stronger and freer we are.   I support whatever directly benefits farmers, ranchers, and ag  producers in this country because they are the lifeblood of America.  They keep us food secure, and therefore, free and self-determining as a  nation. That is why I support crop insurance within Title XI, and why I  am bringing awareness to it now, to ensure that this program remains  strong in the 2023 farm bill.   I will be back on the floor soon to deliver another installment of my  Farm Bill Impact Series and highlight more programs and titles within  the bill that I believe this Congress must understand and support to  ensure that agriculture thrives in America.              President Biden's First State of the Union Speech     Madam Speaker, tonight the President will give his first  State of the Union speech in this very Chamber. Unfortunately, our  country is far weaker and has greatly declined in the 13\1/2\ months  since President Biden took office.   His heavy-handed COVID mandates have decimated workforces and hit  certain industries, like healthcare, especially hard. Crime is rising  on our streets, which is a direct result of efforts to defund the  police. Biden's open border policies will result in approximately 2  million apprehensions in a single year.   Our debt is approaching $30 trillion with no end in sight. Inflation  and the rising cost of practically everything Americans need to live is  wreaking havoc on our people, especially those on fixed incomes. Supply  chains are in disarray.   The administration's needless war on domestic oil and gas production  has led to dramatic increases at the pump and has caused the United  States to once again, unfortunately, be a net oil importer.   President Biden's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan cost  American lives and weakened our standing in the world. This weakness  then emboldened Russia and resulted in Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and  all the while we are doing far too little to stand up to China.    The list goes on and on. America badly needs its President to quickly  and dramatically reverse course so that the state of our Union is  something that we can all be proud of and that will once again be  strong.                            ____________________
