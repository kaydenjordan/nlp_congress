 Mr. President, the John S. McCain National Defense  Authorization Act of 2019, NDAA, provides crucial resources to our  Armed Forces and our national defense. Although I have serious concerns  with this law, many of its provisions play a vital role in  strengthening our national security.   I championed numerous initiatives in this law that directly benefit  the people of Maryland and our nation as a whole. The NDAA increases  pay for our brave men and women in uniform by 2.6 percent. It  authorizes essential funding for Federal agencies in Maryland,  including the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command. It  includes resources for important infrastructure projects in Maryland,  such as cleanup efforts in Edgewood and Aberdeen Proving Ground and  road improvements at Fort Meade. It also ensures that the mission of  the Defense Information Systems Agency and those working on it at Fort  Meade will continue and protects thousands of jobs from potential loss.   I also support the NDAA's reforms to the Committee on Foreign  Investment in the United States. These reforms, which I debated and  supported in the Senate Banking Committee, balance our ability to  maintain an open environment for foreign direct investment and to  protect our national security. The reforms are essential in responding  to foreign nations that strive to gain a strategic advantage over the  United States through the acquisition of our advanced technologies.   However, I find several elements of this law detrimental to our  national security. For instance, the law eliminates the requirement for  congressional authorization for the development of low-yield nuclear  weapons. It also authorizes $65 million in funding for a new low-yield  submarine-launched ballistic missile, an unnecessary new weapon that  increases the risk of miscalculation and unintended escalation.   In addition, the NDAA authorizes over $716 billion in defense funding  for fiscal year 2019, a $133 billion increase in the defense budget  since President Trump assumed office. I look forward to working with  the Defense Department to ensure additional funds are prioritized to  improve readiness, enhance training, and focus our procurements on  tomorrow's challenges--particularly those in the information space--but  this steep expansion in military spending may reduce the Pentagon's  incentives to address cost overruns of weapons systems. This dramatic  increase in defense spending follows massive tax cuts for the wealthy  and proposals from the administration to slash healthcare and other  basic needs for middle-class families, which sets a fiscal course that  weakens the Nation's long-term prosperity and security.   Furthermore, in his fiscal year 2019 budget request for the Defense  Department, President Trump elevated the possibility of great power  conflict with China. Secretary of Defense Mattis reiterated this in the  2019 National Defense Strategy, asserting that China was a  ``revisionist power'' and ``strategic competitor using predatory  economics'' to its advantage. Despite this, Republican conferees  stripped a bipartisan provision that imposed tough sanctions on ZTE--a  Chinese telecommunications company that has stolen U.S. technology,  repeatedly violated our laws, and poses an espionage threat.  Republicans removed this critical provision at the request of President  Trump, who tweeted his intention to provide ZTE with sanctions relief  because ``Too many jobs in China lost.'' I remain deeply disappointed  that Republican conferees caved to White House pressure and ZTE's  lobbying efforts at the expense of the American people and our national  security. I will continue to work with like-minded colleagues in the  Senate to hold ZTE accountable.   Ultimately, however, the benefits of this law--for our country, for  our security, and for the American people--outweigh my concerns;  therefore, I voted in support of the fiscal year 2019 NDAA.                            ____________________
