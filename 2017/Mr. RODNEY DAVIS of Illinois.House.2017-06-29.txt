 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a  true American hero, Ray Heckler, who is being laid to rest in Arlington  today with full military honors.   Ray began his service to his country as a private in the Army, and  retired after 40 years as a command sergeant major in the Illinois  National Guard in Urbana. During his time in the Army, he served in  Germany, Berlin, Japan, Paris, Africa, Morocco, Casablanca, and Marcel  in France. He was awarded the Bronze Star in France for his heroic and  praiseworthy service on the field of battle.   Remembered by those closest to him as being a helping hand whenever  needed, Ray spent time with his community by working to construct and  rehabilitate homes through Habitat for Humanity.   It is my honor to recognize Mr. Heckler and his devotion to our  country. My thoughts and prayers are with his family as they mourn the  loss of a truly courageous and selfless man.   Rest in peace, Ray Heckler.                            ____________________
