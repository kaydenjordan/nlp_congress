 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk  about the rising crime in America and specifically in Democrat-run  cities.   This year, 12 American cities have already broken records for murder,  and the year isn't even over. Every one of those cities is run by  Democrats.   Last summer, Democrat cities adopted a rallying cry, and that cry was  ``defund the police.'' Joe Biden said America was ``systemically  racist.'' He said police funding should be ``redirected.'' Nancy Pelosi  talked about ``shuffling . . . money around.'' Kamala Harris, our Vice  President, said America should ``reimagine public safety.''   Well, lots of Democrat cities put those slogans into practice. Bill  de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, cut the New York City Police  Department by $1 billion. The Los Angeles City Council voted to cut  police funding by $150 million. San Francisco cut $120 million from  police over 2 years. Nearly two dozen cities across the country  defunded the police. Again, these are all cities run by liberal mayors  and administrations. As a result, last year, America experienced the  largest surge in homicide ever recorded.   According to the Major Cities Chiefs Association, 63 of America's 66  biggest cities saw at least 1 category of violent crime go up last  year. Minneapolis cut police funding, and homicide nearly  [[Page S9228]]  doubled. New York City police funding and homicide went in opposite  directions: The funding for police went down, and homicide went up by  half. Last year's historic increases in homicides was evident. This  year, homicide has gone up even more. The number of police killed in  the line of duty is also up.   Here in Washington, DC, President Biden has effectively endorsed the  ``defund the police'' movement. He did that by stacking his  administration with supporters of defunding the police.   The Secretary of Labor of the United States, confirmed by this  Senate, cut funding for police when he was mayor of Boston.   The No. 3 official at the Department of Justice, confirmed by this  Senate, the Democrats in this Senate, testified that she supports  ``calls from Black Lives Matter . . . activists to decrease police  budgets and the scope, role, and responsibility of police in our  lives.''   Joe Biden's Secretary of the Treasury called for an economics  professor to be fired because the professor said he opposed defunding  the police. It had nothing to do with what he was teaching. It wasn't  because of a problem with his work in the classroom. But Janet Yellen  said his comments against defunding the police were ``extremely  troubling.''   She went on to say:         It would be appropriate for the University of Chicago . . .       to review [that professor's] performance and suitability.    Well, Janet Yellen is not known for being a crime expert. She is a  well-connected, well-known liberal. The university bowed to Janet  Yellen and put the professor under investigation. This is Janet Yellen,  who was confirmed to be Secretary of the Treasury under Joe Biden.   In October, Joe Biden was asked if police officers should be fired if  they weren't vaccinated. He didn't hesitate. He immediately said: Yes,  fire them. These are officers who have been putting their lives on the  frontline every day since day one of the pandemic. Joe Biden's mantra  for the police: Vaccinate or terminate.   This is happening all across America. For example, more than 150  Massachusetts State Police have resigned over the vaccine mandate. Joe  Biden would rather see unvaccinated police sit at home than let them  continue doing the job they have done all through the pandemic. The  last thing we need to do right now is reduce the number of police  officers on our streets.   Last week, Democrats in this body gave another promotion to an anti- police liberal. Every Democrat--every Democrat--in this Senate voted to  confirm Rachael Rollins as the top prosecutor in the State of  Massachusetts. Why does this matter to anybody outside of  Massachusetts? Well, because Rachael Rollins is the face of the rogue  prosecutor movement. This is the movement led by George Soros and other  powerful liberals. They have invested millions of dollars in electing  radical prosecutors. They have succeeded in major cities. We have seen  it in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. Once these  prosecutors get into office, they impose radical leftwing policies. The  result has been chaos and carnage from coast to coast.   As the district attorney in Boston, Rachael Rollins announced she  would not prosecute 15 different crimes, laws on the books. She would  not prosecute 15 different crimes, including shoplifting, trespassing,  and resisting arrest. Rachael Rollins is supposed to be a prosecutor.  Her job is to enforce the law. Instead, she has nullified the law.   Joe Biden saw this lawlessness, and he was so impressed that he gave  her a big promotion. Every single Democrat in this Senate has given her  their stamp of approval. So has Vice President Harris. Every Republican  voted no on this radical nominee, so the Vice President was needed to  come to the Senate to break the tie. There is already talk of Rachael  Rollins' getting even more promotions in this very radical, extreme,  dangerous, and scary Democratic Party.   Mark my words: Rachael Rollins is the first rogue prosecutor to be  given a Federal job. She will not be the last. With Democrats in charge  in Washington, Rachael Rollins' policies are coming to a neighborhood  near you.   So it is worth asking, how are these policies working out in liberal  big cities? Not well, no. San Francisco followed the Rachael Rollins  model. They tried legalizing shoplifting; how about that? Now San  Francisco looks like a city from the Dark Ages.   Here is how the Associated Press described it last week:         San Francisco residents and visitors scurry past scenes of       lawlessness and squalor.    In August, San Francisco broke city records with 3,700 reports of  retail theft. Now there is a mass exodus of retail stores from San  Francisco.   Last year, twice as many people in San Francisco died from drug  overdoses than from coronavirus. The local news reported this week  about people leaving their cars unlocked in San Francisco to prevent  their windows from getting smashed out. Even the Democrat mayor spoke  recently about the ``rein of criminals who are destroying our city.''   San Francisco is one of the wealthiest cities in the world. It is the  hometown of the Speaker of the House and is now a homicide haven on the  west coast. Yet, in just a few years, liberal policies have turned what  had been a beautiful city into a war zone.   Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, admitted just yesterday that  ``there is an attitude of lawlessness in our country'' today. Then she  added, ``It springs from,'' as she said, ``I don't know where.''   Well, Nancy Pelosi should look at her own city. It is painfully  obvious. The fact that roars out from liberal city to liberal city is  this: The lawlessness comes from the policies of the Democratic Party.  Criminals seek opportunity, and when criminals see that opportunity,  they pounce.   Look at Los Angeles. This is another city with a rogue prosecutor. In  just 10 days last month, looters stole $340,000 worth of goods from  stores. In one case, police arrested 14 of the looters. And then what  happened? They were all released. Now they are all walking free.   Austin, TX, made some of the largest police funding cuts last year.  This year, Austin has seen a 70-percent increase in murder. It is one  of the largest increases in homicide in America.   In Kamala Harris's hometown of Oakland, the city council voted to  defund the police in June. Now murder in Oakland, the Vice President's  hometown, is up by two-thirds since just 2019.   Last month, a toddler was shot and killed while he slept in the back  of his mother's car on the Oakland freeway. Even leftwing Oakland has  now had enough. The city is now planning to reverse the cuts to police.  For the toddler, it is too late. The damage that took that innocent  life from that family can't be undone, can't be repaired. The family  will never be reunited.   It is time for the Democrats to wake up, to wake up before it is too  late for so many others.   Democrats have controlled the Senate now for 10 months. Yet they have  done nothing to improve law enforcement in America. They have done  nothing to reduce crime. In fact, Senate Democrats have only tried to  reward criminals. Forty-nine Senate Democrats sponsored a bill to give  voting rights to felons as soon as they walk out of their jail cells.   The American people reject this bill and Democrats' entire agenda.  Voters are speaking out. Just last month, voters rejected defunding  police in the cities of Buffalo, New York, and even in Minneapolis.   New York City has just elected a former police officer as its mayor  who used the issue of crime and law and order as a winning issue in the  campaign. People are tired of what the Democrats are force-feeding the  American people.   The lessons should be screamingly obvious. The American people don't  want Democrats' soft-on-crime agenda. Americans want safe communities.  They want Democrats and all Americans to stop coddling criminals, to  stand for public safety, and to stop this reckless Democrats' war on  police.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
