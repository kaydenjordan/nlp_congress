 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1001 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1001         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the concurrent resolution       (H. Con. Res. 119) expressing the sense of Congress that a       carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy.       All points of order against consideration of the concurrent       resolution are waived. The concurrent resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the concurrent resolution are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the concurrent resolution       and preamble to adoption without intervening motion or demand       for division of the question except one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1001, providing for further  consideration of the concurrent resolution, H. Con. Res. 119,  expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental  to the United States economy. The rule provides for consideration of  the concurrent resolution under a closed rule.   Mr. Speaker, my district in central Washington demonstrates the  strength in utilizing a diverse portfolio of energy sources, while also  working on the forefront of energy innovation in clean energy solutions  for the future.   From the mighty Grand Coulee Dam, which is the largest hydroelectric  power producer in the United States, to the Chief Joseph Dam, to the  series of lower Snake and lower Columbia River dams, our region is  undoubtedly blessed with low-cost, clean, reliable, and renewable  hydropower.   In fact, hydropower provides our State with almost 70 percent of our  energy needs. Improvements made to this technology to improve the  efficiency, the safety, and the productivity of hydro demonstrate the  importance of constantly improving our energy technologies.   Now, while we do rely heavily on hydropower, Washington also utilizes  an array of other energy sources, both produced and imported, including  oil, natural gas, coal, and a number of renewable energy sources such  as wind and solar.   My district is also blessed with the only nuclear generating station  in the Pacific Northwest, and that is the Columbia Generating Station,  which is operated by Energy Northwest. Columbia produces 10 percent of  the electricity generated in Washington and is a reliable, clean energy  producer not dependent on weather conditions like some renewables are.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, while I am sure you are fascinated by  this brief rundown of Washington State's source of energy, you may be  wondering why I am speaking about such matters with the resolution  before us today.   The resolution says, quite simply, that it is the sense of Congress  that a carbon tax would be detrimental to the United States economy--a  simple statement. And while I could be spending my time listening to  many ways a harmful tax would harm our economy and the American people,  I thought I would also offer a demonstration of the many resources we  have at our disposal for strengthening America's energy dominance.   Many of my colleagues, much like myself, support what we can call an  ``all of the above'' energy approach. We believe government should not  be picking winners and losers and should not be placing the thumb on  the economic free-market scale. A carbon tax would be exactly that, a  devastating hammer to what is currently an economy on the rise.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution offered by the  majority whip, Representative  Steve Scalise from the great State of  Louisiana, to oppose a carbon tax carbon tax as a solution to address  carbon emissions and climate change, because, quite frankly, Mr.  Speaker, it simply is not a solution.   However, that is not to say that I oppose reducing carbon emissions.  My constituents and the people of the great Pacific Northwest most  certainly want a clean, healthy environment, and we should be doing  everything we can to limit emissions. But a burdensome new tax that  would fundamentally bring our innovative energy sector and growing  economy to a standstill is not the answer.   Further, a carbon tax fails to recognize the diversity of our Nation  and the different energy resources that exist in the United States.  Quite frankly, the resources that exist in the State of Washington  certainly may not be present in the State of North Dakota or Louisiana  or Massachusetts.   We should be making clean energy more affordable, not making  traditional energy sources more expensive. We should be cutting  burdensome regulations that constrain the development and deployment of  energy, whether it be nuclear, fossil fuels, or hydropower. These  regulatory burdens should be removed and reformed to spur clean energy  innovation with the power of markets, not within the hands of  government bureaucrats.   Mr. Speaker, we, in central Washington, have another prize gem in our  backyard. I am proud to represent the people that work at the Pacific  Northwest National Laboratory. This premier Department of Energy lab is  on the forefront of energy innovation. From enabling safe and  sustainable fossil fuel exploration production, transportation,  conversion, and end use, to transforming the U.S. power grid to meet  economic, environmental, and security priorities for the 21st century,  our national labs like PNNL delivers distinctive science and technology  solutions for efficient and sustainable energy.   I am a proud member of the House Appropriations Energy and Water  Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee where we continue to  prioritize strategic energy research and development that will increase  U.S. economic growth, innovation, and competitiveness.   Congress should continue to work on utilizing and empowering public- private partnerships to rapidly develop new technologies and then let  the market catalyze its growth and commercial liability. There are  great examples of these efforts taking place in the innovative high- tech communities of the Tri-Cities, Washington, where experts from the  private sector are partnering with research and support offered by PNNL  to develop grid-scale storage solutions and small modular reactor  technologies, fundamentally transforming the future of nuclear power  generation and battery storage technologies.    Mr. Speaker, my constituents want energy security and want a clean  environment. They want economic growth, job creation, and they want to  keep their low-cost electricity. The way to a cleaner, more prosperous  future for our Nation's energy needs is not through more government  bureaucracy. It is through empowering American innovation. That is why  a carbon tax is wrong for my district in central Washington State. It  is wrong for the entire State of Washington, and it is wrong for the  United States of America. We need to innovate, rather than regulate the  future of America's energy dominance.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side seem to be focused on  closed versus open rules. We hear that time and time again. They are  ignoring that the structured amendment process has routinely been used  by both parties when they were in the majority.   This majority has made it a priority to make in order amendments for  floor consideration, which, I might point out, a majority of those  amendments have been Democratic-sponsored or cosponsored. In fact, as  of July 12 of this year, Republicans in this Congress, the 115th  Congress, provided for the consideration of more than 1,650 amendments  on the House floor: 745 of those were Democrat amendments; 630 were  Republican amendments; and 280 were, proudly, bipartisan amendments,  Mr. Speaker. So by no means are we stopping the process. That doesn't  even count the thousands and thousands of submissions that Members  make, both Republican and Democrat, to committees for consideration.   Mr. Speaker, I take exception to the fact that this is a totally  closed process. It is open for participation by every Member of the  House who represents constituents across this country.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  West Virginia (Mr. Jenkins), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I will reiterate my earlier announcement  that all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only, and I will not  yield for any other purpose.    Mr. Speaker, getting back to the resolution at hand  about moving away from regressive taxes and top-down, Big Government  regulation, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sessions), the chairman of the Rules Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers on this side of the aisle,  but before I reserve my time, I just want to remind my good friends on  the other side of the aisle that my colleague and good friend from  Illinois, Mr. Quigley, did offer this amendment in the Appropriations  Committee just last week. We did spend a great deal of time debating  and discussing this idea.   As the good chairman from the Rules Committee said, and I will  repeat, of the funds that were appropriated, there were $380 million  appropriated for the Election Assistance Commission, which was the last  of the final payment of the $3.65 billion originally authorized under  the Help America Vote Act of 2002. Of these 2018 funds, there are still  39 percent of these dollars available to the States.   There is no crisis. The money is available to States that want those  dollars for assistance. In fact, to date, my latest information, Mr.  Speaker, there are still 19 States yet to submit an application.   So there is no crisis. There is help available. States have an  opportunity to receive the resources necessary to make sure we have  what all American people want, that our elections are held with the  utmost honesty and integrity.   Mr. Speaker, as I said, we have no more speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, as tempting as that sounds, I think that  the adequate 30 minutes per side is enough for both of us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from Maine, as well as the  gentleman from Vermont, getting back to the debate at hand.   I just want to share a few things that I have learned from a recent  poll conducted by the Institute for Energy Research. They found that a  resounding 85 percent of respondents agreed that we should not make  energy more expensive.   Even more tellingly than that, though, when asked whether they  trusted the Federal Government to spend the money from a tax on carbon  emissions wisely, only 18 percent of the respondents felt that they  would, while 74 percent said that they did not feel that way.   An overwhelming 73 percent of respondents agreed that the last thing  that we need is higher taxes or more bureaucracy. And, lastly, 85  percent of respondents feared that consumers will wind up paying the  cost associated with a tax or regulation, exactly what we have been  saying.   The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, the American people remain  profoundly skeptical of government intrusion into the free markets, and  like I said before, a carbon tax would be wrong for our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?   MR. McGOVERN. I yield to the gentleman from Washington.    We are prepared to close on the Republican side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to engage with my good  friend and colleague from the State of Massachusetts, especially on a  particularly important issue such as carbon tax.   It is my feeling and the feeling of the majority of this House that  we need to move away from aggressive taxes and top-down Big Government  regulation. We need to get behind innovative-centric solutions that  remove bureaucratic barriers to clean, affordable, and reliable energy  technology and allow for real global carbon emission reductions.   Our affordable and reliable energy supply must be the focus, along  with a cleaner environment and a stronger economy. A carbon tax simply  would not yield those kinds of results.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and support the  underlying legislation, H. Con. Res. 119, which is simply this:  Expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental  to the United States economy.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows            An Amendment to H. Res. 1001 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to  [[Page H6486]]       clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into       the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union       for consideration of the bill (H.R. 12) to modernize voter       registration, promote access to voting for individuals with       disabilities, protect the ability of individuals to exercise       the right to vote in elections for Federal office, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committees on House Administration, the       Judiciary, Science, Space and Technology, Veterans' Affairs,       Oversight and Government Reform. After general debate the       bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute       rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 12.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.                                time  1345
