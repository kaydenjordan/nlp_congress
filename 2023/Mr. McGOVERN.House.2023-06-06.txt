 Madam Speaker, House Republicans nearly caused a  catastrophic default on our debt all because they wanted to tighten the  screws on America's poorest families, and now Speaker McCarthy says:  ``Let's get the rest of the work requirements.''   He basically said taking away food from hungry people was ``one of  the best nights I have ever [had].''   So, let me be just as blunt: SNAP work requirements don't work. They  do the opposite. Any Member who disagrees can reach out to my office,  and I will provide him or her copies of many, many studies.   Second, as attention turns to the farm bill, which we all know must  pass with bipartisan support, I want to be up-front about my red lines:  SNAP work requirements are off the table. Cuts to SNAP are off the  table. Changes that hurt America's small farms and family farmers are  off the table.   There will be no farm bill without serious investments in the  national strategy put forward by the Biden administration to end hunger  and diet-related diseases.   GOP leadership may care more about tax cuts for billionaires than  food for everyday families, but House Democrats do not, and we will  keep fighting to end hunger now.                            ____________________
