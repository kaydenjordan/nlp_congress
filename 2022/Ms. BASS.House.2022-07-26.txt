SEC. 302. EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATIONS UNDER THE INTERNATIONAL                     MEGAN'S LAW.         Section 11 of the International Megan's Law to Prevent       Child Exploitation and Other Sexual Crimes Through Advanced       Notification of Traveling Sex Offenders (34 U.S.C. 21509) is       amended by striking ``2018 through 2021'' and inserting       ``2022 through 2026''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6552, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6552, the  Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection  Reauthorization Act of 2022.   I thank the ranking member of our Subcommittee on Africa, Global  Health, and Global Human Rights, Representative Chris Smith, who I have  worked closely with for many years to develop this bill. This joint  effort has served as a daily reminder that collaboration in Congress is  both imperative and far from finished when it comes to combating and  eliminating human trafficking.   This legislation is the overdue reauthorization of the Trafficking  Victims Act of 2000, which expired last September. To continue this  essential fight to end global human trafficking, this measure must be  passed by the House today so that more than 20 years of work is not  undone.   This bill is especially important in the wake of the COVID-19  pandemic, when virtual K-12 education made it harder for teachers to  identify and report human trafficking, prosecutions of traffickers were  delayed as courts closed, and the demand for social services for  survivors increased as many of them lost their jobs and homes.   Critically, this reauthorization strengthens provisions in the  original bill that protect and support trafficking victims while  reauthorizing $1 billion to fund programs across the Departments of  Justice, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services that are  dedicated to addressing human trafficking and aiding victims.   This funding includes $35 million in housing assistant grants for the  victims of human trafficking, which offer temporary housing that  provides trafficking survivors with meaningful alternatives to living  with their abusers. It also funds education programs on trafficking  warning signs for educators and law enforcement personnel who may  otherwise unknowingly encounter trafficking victims. It further  requires greater accountability measures to protect people who are  trafficked while appropriately punishing traffickers.   In the U.S., the populations most vulnerable to human trafficking  include migrant laborers, minorities, people with disabilities, those  in the LGBTQ community, and especially runaway and homeless youth and  those in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems. In regard to  sex trafficking, which is where the child welfare system comes in, the  average age of the victim is 12 years old.   As a former healthcare professional and chair of the subcommittee, I  have been a champion of child welfare issues throughout my time in  Congress. I have seen too many instances of human rights violations  against children and other vulnerable populations falling victim to the  abuses of human trafficking, both in the U.S. and around the world. We  must take this issue seriously and continue taking a whole-of- government approach to addressing it.   Sometimes, however, we focus on the international and forget that  this is a problem right here in many cities around our Nation. The  Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection  Reauthorization Act adds several new provisions to the original  legislation that will substantially improve our efforts against  trafficking here at home while only slightly modifying existing  provisions that have been successful throughout its passage.   One important example is the modifications made to existing HHS  grants that would train elementary and secondary school teachers,  children, guardians, and trainers in the recognition and response to  child trafficking. Child trafficking in the U.S. is not labor  trafficking, but it is sex trafficking. This section now focuses  authorities to ensure that grantees will use proven best practices,  trains personnel with equitable approaches, and identifies service  gaps, among other things.   It also calls on State child welfare agencies to prioritize the  implementation of protocols to report information on missing and  abducted children to the National Center for Missing and Exploited  Children and law enforcement.   Additionally, the bill requires States to submit annual reports on  child sex  [[Page H7086]]  trafficking victims to Health and Human Services, which is one of the  many steps that we can take to trace, track, and find those missing  and, hopefully, create a system that prevents further disappearance of  our youth. It is our job to protect those in this country who cannot  protect themselves, especially children in the child welfare system.  When we remove them from their parents and from their homes, then we  the government become the parents, and we cannot be guilty of neglect.   H.R. 6552 strengthens anti-trafficking efforts abroad. Human  trafficking is the second largest criminal industry worldwide, with  more than 25 million people, women and girls being the largest  identified demographic. These numbers are alarming, and I am humbled to  be part of a measure that will focus on expanding prevention efforts at  USAID by taking steps to further integrate counter-trafficking in  persons activities into already existing international development  programs.   This bill moves not only to support those who have already fallen  victim but also to prevent further trafficking and bring perpetrators  to justice. We must swiftly pass this bipartisan measure to protect  those who are the most vulnerable among us. It is our duty to stop this  heinous crime whenever and wherever it is discovered, whether it be  here in the United States or abroad.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, June 14, 2022.       Hon.

Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       6552, Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and       Protection Reauthorization Act of 2022, as amended. I       appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6552, the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims  Protection and Reauthorization Act, as amended, should be supported by  every Member participating in today's vote. This overdue  reauthorization strengthens laws that not only support those who have  already fallen victim but also prevents the future risk of trafficking  both at home here in the U.S. and abroad.   We must supply housing for victims so that they can have a safe place  to go when they leave their abusers. We also must ensure that child  welfare and foster children are prioritized, particularly young women,  girls, and those in the LGBTQ community are protected and aided with  resources. Without housing these children often have no choice but to  return to their pimps, their traffickers.   Our departments must have the funding they need so they can offer the  best training and personnel to respond to this crisis. It is our duty  as public servants to protect the vulnerable and stop this heinous  crime when and where it is discovered. Human trafficking is a heinous  violation of human rights, and we must do everything in our power to  combat it, and that includes passing this bill.   Again, I thank the staff who have worked very hard on this. I  especially thank the ranking member, as we have worked together for 12  years. As my time in Congress draws to a close, I am very happy that  this is one of the last pieces of legislation that we can move forward  on together.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
