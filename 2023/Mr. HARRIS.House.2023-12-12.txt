 Madam Speaker, one of the greatest threats to our  national security is a woke military.   Nothing exemplifies a woke military as much as the National Defense  Authorization Act that is going to come before this body out of a  Conference Report that allows transgender surgery to continue to be  funded in the U.S. military.   I can guarantee you that Russia and China aren't using their military  dollars to pay for transgender surgery.   Here in the United States, we are, and we will. If this House and the  Senate passes the Conference Report, that will be the official U.S.  policy.   Madam Speaker, that is not defense of the Nation. That is a woke  military that endangers our Nation's security.                            ____________________
