 Mr. Chairman, I will start by stating the obvious fact  that it seems astonishing to even have to state: Men and women are  biologically different and just by a boy calling himself a girl, it  doesn't make it so.   It is amazing but telling that the same people who scolded us about  following the science during COVID have attempted to do anything but  follow actual science when it comes to men and boys in women's sports.   Boys shouldn't be dunking on girls during a high school basketball  game or hitting home runs in a girls' softball game. No sane person can  argue that men and women do not have different physical  characteristics, strength, and speed. There is a reason why girls and  boys have different sports teams.   I played sports in high school, and I am sure glad that we weren't as  lost as a society as what we seem to be today. What has gone so  horribly wrong in our society where those of us who are not okay with  our daughters and granddaughters sharing a locker room or a bathroom  with boys are the ones that are considered to be crazy by the liberal  elites, sports leagues, and woke corporations.
