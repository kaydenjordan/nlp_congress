Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special  Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, this coming Monday, May 29, marks the  2-year anniversary of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act,  called the JVTA.   Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives and the  Senate worked together in a bipartisan manner to write this  comprehensive, massive law to fight human trafficking. Basically, we  said in this legislation that modern-day slavery will not be tolerated  in the United States, and that message was made loud and clear when the  law was signed 2 years ago.   Since that time, there have been wonderful successes by providing  victims with help and services that they need to recover, and by  capturing and charging both the traffickers and the buyers according to  our law.                                Debbie's Story    Mr. Speaker, Debbie grew up in an idyllic American neighborhood.   The middle child of a close-knit military family living in the  suburbs, Debbie could have never imagined that she would be forced into  sex slavery.   One cool Phoenix night, Debbie's mother thought nothing of letting  her young daughter meet a friend in their front yard one night to play.   Busy with dishes and other children inside, her mother didn't realize  that her young daughter, clad in her cartoon pajamas, was being  abducted by two men in front of their house.   These deviants threw Debbie in the car, drugged and gang raped her.   They held a loaded gun to her forehead and threatened to pull the  trigger if she ever tried to escape.    For 60 days she was forced to have sex with countless men.   Thankfully for Debbie, a lucky anonymous tip led police to a hotel  room where they found Debbie tied up and stashed under a bed.                             Cheryl Briggs' Story    Cheryl Briggs grew up in an abusive home, sexually and physically  abused by her father.   Her mother left when Cheryl was very young to escape the abuse.   At the age of 12, Cheryl didn't know what else to do to get away from  the father she feared, so she ran away.   She began hitchhiking with truck drivers and anyone who would take  her.   This led her to a ride with a motorcyclist and into human trafficking  hell.   He took her to a biker club filled with men who took advantage of  her.   He became her trafficker.   She was forced to dance at a strip club by day and sold on the  streets at night.   She was trapped in the world of human trafficking.   Cheryl didn't know how to get help.   She had no one to call and no one to provide for her.   No one came to rescue her.   That is until a patron at a strip club found out that she was only 15  and helped her escape.                                 Lena's Story    In her formative years, Lena wore turtlenecks and baggy clothes to  school every day.   Why did she do so?   To hide the bruises that covered her entire body.   When her abusive foster mother lost custody, Lena ran away.   She was just 13 years old.   After bolting from the front lawn at the Houston middle school, she  ran into a friendly-looking stranger.   This man offered to look after her, protect and love her.   Human traffickers manipulate the vulnerabilities of their victims, he  knew that Lena would do anything to feel loved.   For the next 3 months, Lena was trafficked to countless buyers.   He kept her on the move, switching from motel to motel to evade  detection.   Finally, after tracking a BackPage advertisement her trafficker  posted, police located Lena.   They arrested her trafficker in the hotel next door. With her help,  the police ultimately charged her trafficker.   Debbie, Cheryl and Lena are all human trafficking survivors.   The things they had to endure are more horrific than most of us can  even imagine.   But they survived, they overcame this tragedy.   It was for survivors like these women that Carolyn Maloney and I  drafted the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act two years ago.   This far-reaching legislation, led by Senator John Cornyn and Senator  Ron Wyden in the Senate, made it clear that Congress would no longer  turn a blind eye to this scourge in our society.   We wanted to ensure that victims were treated like victims, given the  care and help they needed to overcome the evil inflicted upon them.   We also wanted to make sure that the traffickers and the buyers were  both brought to justice.                           Houston Super Bowl Story    This past February, my hometown of Houston, Texas, hosted the 51st  Super bowl.   For most Americans the Super Bowl is a fun filled day spent with  friends and family cheering on a favorite team.   But for trafficking slaves and potential trafficking slaves, if can  be a very dangerous time.   Studies show that big events like Super Bowls create large upticks in  the trafficking and purchasing of sex trafficking victims.   In order to counteract this, The Department of Homeland Security, as  part of its Blue Campaign Initiative, began preparing months in  advance.   DHS agents came to Washington, DC and briefed me and other members of  the Texas Delegation on their anti-trafficking strategy for super bowl  weekend.   Through the Blue Campaign, DHS raises public awareness, forges anti- trafficking partnerships and brings suspected human traffickers to  justice.   I commend the Blue Campaign for collaborating with local, state and  federal law enforcement agencies in preparation for the Super Bowl.   As a direct result of this large multi-agency operation, over 750  people were arrested across 15 different states.   At least 86 victims were rescued, and many more were likely spared  being forced into the trafficking industry.  [[Page H4564]]    Having personally worked closely with the Blue Campaign on this, and  many other operations, I see firsthand the important role DHS has in  fighting the scourge of human trafficking.   This DHS Blue Campaign Authorization Act will ensure that this  critically important program continues to provide safety to victims and  justice to their traffickers.                        Success of JVTA at 2 Year Mark    Over the last two years, more than 65 defendants have been charged  with federal human trafficking violations.   Of those, 10 were buyers.   Without demand, there would be no market.   JVTA gives law enforcement the critical tools it needs to capture and  prosecute criminals who purchase sex from minors or trafficking  victims.   Long gone are the days where buyers could anonymously purchase sex  from trafficking victims and simply return to their normal lives.   JVT also allows a federal judge to impose an additional assessment of  up to $5,000.   This money then goes into the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund.   This fund provides victims with increased access to services and  resources.   It forces the criminals to pay the rent on the courthouse, forces  both the buyer and the trafficker to pay for the system they created.   They inflicted pain and suffering on innocent people, they should be  the ones to pay.   JVTA also clarified that the U.S. Marshals Service can assist local,  state and federal law enforcement in the search and rescue of missing  children.   Since the implementation of JVTA, U.S. Marshals have helped rescue  102 children.   As JVTA continues to be implemented, and prosecutors and judges are  trained on the new tools it offers them, we will continue to see more  and more traffickers and buyers held accountable for their crimes.   We will also see a system that treats victims like victims, providing  them with the care and support they need to become survivors.   And that's just the way it is.    Tonight we have this Special Order, and we have  several Members who are going to speak on this. The first Member who  will speak is Representative Wagner. She has served in the House since  2013, and she has, herself, worked extensively on human trafficking  issues. She is a cosponsor of the Shame Act that I have sponsored, and  we have worked together. I am honored to introduce her as our first  speaker on this very important issue of the human trafficking after 2  years of the legislation being signed. I yield to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. I would like  to ask a couple of questions if she doesn't mind. I know she has other  appointments, but I wanted to ask her a couple questions. I would like  to know how has the trafficking situation in her home State of Missouri  decreased, or how has this legislation helped?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. I would like  to ask a couple of questions if she doesn't mind. I know she has other  appointments, but I wanted to ask her a couple questions. I would like  to know how has the trafficking situation in her home State of Missouri  decreased, or how has this legislation helped?    I thank the gentlewoman for her comments. I also  wanted to compliment her on her tenacious work of going after  backpage.com and making that resource unavailable for those traffickers  and those buyers. I want to commend her for that.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman being  here and making such powerful comments.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard). She is an Iraqi  war veteran and a former member of the Hawaii House of Representatives.  She is working specifically, among other things, in the area of the  juvenile justice system, trying to reform that.  [[Page H4565]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii  for her work on this. As you can tell, this is a bipartisan effort.  When we took this legislation 2 years ago and brought it to the House,  there were 11 bills that came to the House of Representatives, and they  almost all passed unanimously. Then they were sent to the Senate, and  the Senate combined them into two bills. The same over there, almost  unanimous; and then back over to the House, and the final passage was  almost unanimous once again. It is a bipartisan effort, and I thank the  gentlewoman from Hawaii for her work on this and her service to our  country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Smucker). He is one of our newest, if not the newest, Members of  Congress. He served in the Pennsylvania State Senate for a good number  of years.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for his comments, and now for his work on this issue of  trafficking.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho),  another Ted here in Congress. Ted Yoho is serving Florida's  Congressional District 3. He is vice chairman of the U.S. House Foreign  Affairs Committee, and the chairman of U.S. House Asia and the Pacific  Subcommittee. He has supported many bills on this issue of trafficking  and has worked very hard in his home State of Florida to bring  awareness to this.    Mr. Speaker, how many minutes do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 8 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, how many minutes do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 8 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore). She, like the women in Congress, who I have  given a lot of credit for all of this trafficking legislation, is very  concerned about victims of family and domestic violence.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her strong  comments. I know where she stands on the issue of victims of violence.   Mr. Speaker, the 2-year anniversary of the Justice for Victims of  Trafficking Act will be Monday. As a former judge and co-chairman of  the Victims' Rights Caucus, with Jim Costa from California, this is an  important issue. I bet most Americans have never heard of the Justice  for Victims of Trafficking Act because it was passed with bipartisan  support, overwhelming support. Things like this don't make the news  because we are not fussing and feuding between the two sides.   But it is a very important piece of legislation for our country. It  goes after the trafficker. It makes sure they get arrested, and they go  to prison where they belong. It also goes after the buyer, the person  who hides and tries to buy young children on the marketplace of sex  slavery. But it rescues victims and turns them into survivors. That is  why this legislation is important.   The average age of a trafficking victim in the United States is 13.  That means some are younger than 13. And it is a menace and a scourge  that we, in the House of Representatives, along with our friends in the  Senate, are going to make sure that the legislation is appropriate to  solve this epidemic. That is why we are reminding individuals that we  have this piece of legislation that is passed, and other pieces of  legislation as well.   The last thing I wanted to mention is part of the Justice for Victims  of Trafficking Act allows Federal judges to impose a fee on the  trafficker or the buyer, and that money goes into a fund that helps  victims of trafficking. That is a great idea. Make the criminals pay  the rent on the courthouse by this type of restitution program.   I want to thank all of the people who helped out tonight. There is a  lot more to be said about the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act.  We are going to continue to bring awareness of it to the American  public.  [[Page H4567]]    I can tell you one thing, though, traffickers and buyers know about  this legislation. With the help of local and State and Federal law  enforcement, we are going to stop this sale of our children and adult  women here in the United States for money.   And that is just the way it is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 14 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, May 25, 2017, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
