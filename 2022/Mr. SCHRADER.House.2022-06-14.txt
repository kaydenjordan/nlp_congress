 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to former  Sheriff John O'Brien, who passed away on June 1 at the age of 74. John  was a beloved fixture of the Lincoln County community in my district,  where he was known for his dedication to the people he served.   A dedicated Oregon State Beaver, after graduating from OSU, John was  drafted in the U.S. Army in 1970, and served in Vietnam where he earned  a Vietnam Service Medal and Bronze Star. He returned home and joined  the Lincoln County Sheriff's office as a patrol deputy in 1973. It was  here that John would find his calling, serving his community and the  department for 30 years, the last 9 as sheriff, until his retirement in  2003. After retiring from the Sheriff's office, John worked for the  Pacific Northwest region of FEMA, assisting with disasters in Oregon,  Alaska, Washington, and New York City.   All who were close to John could attest that he cared about people in  an extraordinary way. His generous spirit touched everyone in his life.  John dedicated his time to making life better for those he served. He  will be missed by all who knew him.   He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Priscilla, as well as his  kids, Eric and Erin, and his four grandchildren. I hope they can all  find peace during this difficult time as well as mourn the loss of an  extraordinary member of this great family.                            ____________________
