 Mr. Speaker, I commend our Republican leadership today  for listening to our conference and putting back into the continued  resolution the needed disaster relief for the southern States and for  the West Coast, and the border security measure demanded by most  Americans in this country.   To not do so, to just accept the product that the Senate punted over  here, would have been a travesty and a dereliction of our duties here,  I think, in the U.S. House of Representatives. These are very important  things that need to be done and need to be accomplished, with the  caravan amassing on our southern border and the security measures that,  although heroically done so far by our Border Patrol folks, need to be  augmented with this asset.   Heaven knows, our southern States, having been affected by  hurricanes; and farmers depending on decisions to be made in this  place; and, on the West Coast, with the fires in my own district, the  stability needed from the funding that would come from a disaster  relief package, I am really pleased to see the work of the House today  put this back out there and send it over to the Senate, where I hope  they will have the guts to actually deal with it.                            ____________________
