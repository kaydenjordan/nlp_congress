 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Alabama for  the time and the work on this bill.   Mr. Chair, I also want to thank Mrs. Wagner from Missouri for  sponsoring this bill, along with the help of our friends on the other  side.   You notice, Mr. Chair, that everybody who is in line, mostly, who are  here to speak are women, and I want to congratulate the women in  Congress, because they have taken the lead for making sure that we stop  this scourge of human sex trafficking.   Mr. Chair, I also want to thank the different groups, victims groups,  throughout the country who have continued to give us input on what we  can do to make laws better. I call those groups the victims posse,  because they are here all the time rounding us up, talking to us about  what they want and think is necessary to make life better for victims.   Mr. Chair, according to most, Alexa was a normal and well-adjusted  15-year-old girl, teenager, but like many young people, she struggled  with insecurity and loneliness. So when a handsome and sympathetic man  reached out to her on social media, she was immediately taken in by his  kind and comforting words.   Most Americans don't realize that the evils of human trafficking are  all around us. Traffickers lurk on the phones, on computers, and on the  internet, constantly searching for vulnerable victims to lure into  their traps.   After months of manipulation, Alexa agreed to meet her new online  friend. As soon as she got into his car, she realized that this person  was a different person than she believed him to be. He chained her and  forced her to have sex for money, and he committed this evil numerous  times.   Technology has changed our world in countless positive ways, but it  has also given human sex traffickers a direct avenue to our children  and their lives. We, as a society, must work harder to capture these  criminals and shut down their online schemes. Only then can we protect  others from Alexa's fate.   This is our job. This is our duty. We must stop the trafficking  network. Not in our town, not in our city, and not in our State.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, Jane was 9 years old--9--when she was  first trafficked in Brownsville, Texas. For 3 years, Maria Losoya  trafficked the child. That is her right there. She trafficked Jane from  town to town in south Texas. Losoya filled her own pockets by selling  Jane at the marketplace of modern-day sex slavery.   Mr. Speaker, filthy criminals steal children like Jane's youth,  innocence, and they try to steal their souls. Jane's story finally came  to light when she alerted authorities at her school in 2015. Now she is  trying to cope with the guilt and shame of her past.   Mr. Speaker, it is not Jane who should be ashamed; it is the  dastardly human traffickers like Maria Losoya who should be ashamed.  That is why my legislation, the Shame Act, gives Federal judges the  ability to publish the names and photographs of convicted buyers and  sellers of our children. Buyers and sellers will no longer be able to  hide in plain sight under the cloak of being anonymous. Those who sell  and buy the innocence of children should be shamed for all to see.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
