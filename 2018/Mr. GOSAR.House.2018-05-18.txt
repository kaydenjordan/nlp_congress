 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered  by my good friend and colleague, Mr. Johnson of Louisiana.   This good governance and commonsense amendment will reduce costs  associated with consultation and allow important projects to move  forward while ensuring these actions don't negatively impact species  and result in more private contributions that help recover endangered  species.   In recent years, local landowners showed unprecedented support for  lesser prairie chicken conservation and committed approximately 4  million acres and more than $26 million toward these efforts.  Unfortunately, current practices do not allow conservation measures  that take place outside of designated critical habitat to count in  relation to Federal actions.                                time  1030    This arbitrary interpretation results in less conservation efforts  for species and stifles private investment that would otherwise be  encouraged if the totality of habitat conservation measures underway  were allowed to be considered.   Last year, Senator John Barrasso pointed out that, of the more than  1,600 species of animals and plants listed on the Endangered Species  Act since 1973, only 3 percent have been recovered. That is 3 percent.  This is failure by any definition or reason.   This amendment encourages voluntary conservation that will help  recover threatened and endangered species. Property owners, States, and  local communities should be encouraged to be part of the solution, not  pushed aside in favor of Federal micromanagement.   I applaud Representative Johnson for his strong leadership and  tireless efforts to improve an outdated system that is failing to  protect species and failing to consider the totality of conservation  measures underway before moving forward with new Federal actions.   I urge adoption of this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered  by my good friend and colleague, Mr. Banks.   The previous administration's Waters of the U.S. rule, commonly  referred to as WOTUS, attempted to assert Clean Water Act jurisdiction  over nearly all areas with even the slightest connection to water  resources, including manmade conveyances. The Obama administration  threatened the very livelihoods of farmers, ranchers, small businesses,  water users, and property owners when unilaterally enacting this  overreaching water and land grab by executive fiat.   Contrary to claims by the Obama administration, this regulation  directly contradicts prior U.S. Supreme Court decisions which imposed  limits on the extent of Federal Clean Water Act authority. Although the  agencies maintained the rule was narrow and clarified the Clean Water  Act jurisdiction, it would actually aggressively expand Federal  authority under the Clean Water Act while bypassing Congress and  creating unnecessary ambiguity. In fact, even the agencies admitted,  when announcing the final rule, that WOTUS would expand agency control  over 60 percent of our country's streams and millions of acres of  wetlands that were previously non-jurisdictional.   Moreover, the rule was based on incomplete scientific and economic  analysis. In recent years, the House has voted at least five different  times to block or reduce the damage associated with the Obama WOTUS  rule. In January 2016, the House and Senate passed legislation blocking  WOTUS, utilizing the Congressional Review Act, and put a bill on  President Obama's desk that he subsequently vetoed.   WOTUS is a dream-killer for future generations and will result in  significant job losses as well as considerable harm to our economy.  Congress must take action today to repeal this fundamentally flawed  mandate once and for all. I applaud Representative Banks for his strong  leadership and tireless efforts to protect the livelihoods of farmers,  ranchers, businessmen, and other local stakeholders by repealing this  unconstitutional power grab.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this lawful and necessary amendment.
