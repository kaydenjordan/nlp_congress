 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for bringing this  vital legislation to the floor.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will ensure that no pregnant woman  is unfairly forced out of their job or risk their health just simply to  earn a paycheck. Our mothers deserve these Federal protections.   I believe that we all want to support our working mothers. Allowing  these simple accommodations can make the  [[Page H2327]]  difference between being forced out of a job and providing a living for  themselves and for their families.   Twenty-seven States have already passed laws that require certain  employers to provide accommodations to pregnant women. It is time for  Federal action to ensure that all pregnant women are protected from  discrimination and can continue to support their families.   This legislation is supported by both women's health groups and the  industry.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from major employers  and leaders in the business community across the country that are  voicing support for this legislation.     Open Letter in Support of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act From                      Leading Private-Sector Employers                                                     March 15, 2021.        Dear Members of Congress: Women's labor force participation       is critical to the strength of our companies, the growth of       our economy and the financial security of most modern       families. The private sector and our nation's elected leaders       must work together to ensure that working women and families       have the protections and opportunities they need to       participate fully and equally in the workplace. Twenty-eight       leading companies from across states and industries have come       together in support of pregnant workers and their families by       calling on Congress to pass H.R. 2694, the bipartisan       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, without delay.        More than 40 years ago, Congress passed the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act of 1978, which made it illegal to       discriminate against most working people on the basis of       pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions. Since       that time, 30 states and the District of Columbia now require       certain employers to provide accommodations to pregnant       employees at work. It's now time to clarify and strengthen       existing federal protections for pregnant workers by passing       the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This bill would ensure       that pregnant workers who need reasonable accommodations can       receive them and continue to do their jobs.        As a business community, we strive to create more equitable       workplaces and better support pregnant workers and their       families every day. We urge the passage of the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act as an important advancement toward       ensuring the health, safety and productivity of our modern       workforce--and the workforce of tomorrow.
