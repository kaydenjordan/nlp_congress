 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a pillar of my district's  activist community, Gary Karnes.   Throughout his extraordinary life, Gary was the conscience of the  local Democratic Party and a cornerstone for promoting, protecting, and  perpetuating the values of our country.   Gary was born to be an activist. He walked with JFK in the 1950s; he  protested the Vietnam war in the 1960s; he stood with farmworkers in  the 1970s; and throughout his life, he always fought for peace, human  rights, and dignity.   The thing about Gary, though, is he knew that American activism is  not just about yelling and screaming or just being outraged. Gary  understood that it is about doing the hard work, of walking precincts,  banging on doors, and bringing out the votes. This included his work of  supporting over 70 election campaigns throughout his life.   Mr. Speaker, it was not just his advocacy and principles that shaped  our local Democratic Party, but Gary Karnes' work and personality added  to the collective story of what we stand for as a community, and that  is why Gary Karnes helped strengthen our democracy.                            ____________________
