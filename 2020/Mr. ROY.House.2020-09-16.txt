I have two questions, Mr. Speaker:   Where is the NBA? Where are those names? Where are the names I just  read of the 43 police officers who have died in the line of duty this  year? I want to know that. I want to know where those names are.   My second question is: Where is the Speaker? Where is the Speaker of  the House? Where is this body? Why aren't we on the floor voting on a  resolution honoring these fallen 43? Why aren't we standing up for law  and order? Why aren't we standing up for security in our streets? Why  are we instead turning over this country to mob rule?   These names matter too, Mr. Speaker.
