 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Food Safety  Administration Act, which I am introducing today, along with Senator  Dick Durbin.   The FDA regulates almost 80 percent of our food supply. Consumers and  industry depend on the FDA to perform its regulatory role. Every year,  nearly 48 million people get sick from foodborne illness, resulting in  128,000 Americans being hospitalized and 3,000 dying. This is  preventable and costly.   Between inadequate responses to recalls, a failure to implement a  culture of outbreak prevention, and proposed rules and initiatives that  languish for years, FDA's food program has struggled in its role to  protect consumers.   Food safety is a second-class citizen at the FDA. As highlighted by  the infant formula crisis, there are dire consequences when food safety  is not prioritized. The FDA has the authority to appoint a deputy  commissioner of foods with a background in food safety but has yet to  do so. This affects all aspects of FDA's food program.   That is why I am introducing this bill that will establish the Food  Safety Administration under Health and Human Services and incorporate  the existing food programs within the FDA into a separate agency. This  will increase leadership and accountability, strengthen oversight of  the food supply, and enhance the industry's ability to operate  effectively.                            ____________________
