SEC. 7. TRANSITIONAL AND SAVINGS PROVISIONS         (a) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Restated provision.--The term ``restated provision''       means a provision of law that is enacted by section 6.        (2) Source provision.--The term ``source provision'' means       a provision of law that is replaced by a restated provision.        (b) Cutoff Date.--The restated provisions replace certain       provisions of law enacted on or before May 6, 2021. If a law       enacted after that date amends or repeals a source provision,       that law is deemed to amend or repeal, as the case may be,       the corresponding restated provision. If a law enacted after       that date is otherwise inconsistent with a restated provision       or a provision of this Act, that law supersedes the restated       provision or provision of this Act to the extent of the       inconsistency.        (c) Original Date of Enactment Unchanged.--A restated       provision is deemed to have been enacted on the date of       enactment of the source provision.        (d) References to Restated Provisions.--A reference to a       restated provision is deemed to refer to the corresponding       source provision.        (e) References to Source Provisions.--A reference to a       source provision, including a reference in a regulation,       order, or other law, is deemed to refer to the corresponding       restated provision.        (f) Regulations, Orders, and Other Administrative       Actions.--A regulation, order, or other administrative action       in effect under a source provision continues in effect under       the corresponding restated 54 provision.        (g) Actions Taken and Offenses Committed.--An action taken       or an offense committed under a source provision is deemed to       have been taken or committed under the corresponding restated       provision.        (h) Legislative Construction.--An inference of legislative       construction is not to be drawn by reason of a restated       provision's location in the United States Code or by reason       of the heading used for the restated provision.       SEC. 8. REPEALS.
