 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I was a sophomore in high school when Congress gave the  green light for war in Iraq. Nearly 20 years later, I am here as a  freshman Member of Congress, urging my colleagues to repeal that  authorization.   For over half my life, Republican and Democratic Presidential  administrations have used the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military  Force as a blank check for war and the justification for aggressive  military actions in the Middle East.   Young people today have never known a time when our country was not  fighting overseas or conducting strikes on poor and Brown nations. It  is time for that to stop.   The American people are tired of endless wars. We need a more  peaceful and productive foreign policy grounded in diplomacy and human  rights, and we, finally, have an administration that agrees.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
