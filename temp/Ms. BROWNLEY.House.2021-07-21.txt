 Madam Speaker, today, we mark 200 days of the 117th  Congress and 200 days of delivering for the people.   From day one, House Democrats have prioritized the needs of everyday  Americans, working families, and our children. We have delivered  transformative, lifesaving legislation that focuses on our recovery  from this pandemic.   The American Rescue Plan has been successful in getting shots in  arms, workers back to work, and money in the pockets of families, and  children back to school. This was one of the biggest jolts to our  health and our economy in history, and we cannot let up on our efforts.   We must build on this momentum and pass President Biden's American  Families Plan and the American Jobs Plan, and we must seize this  moment, rebuild strong, and rebuild by making bold, sustained  investments in our Nation and in our future.                            ____________________
