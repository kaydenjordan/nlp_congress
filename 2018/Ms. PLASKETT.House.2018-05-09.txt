 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the  outstanding achievements of Mrs. Elizabeth Mae Thomas de Lagarde.   Mrs. de Lagarde, one of four children, was born to Reverend Ernest  Thomas and Antoinette Miller Thomas. She married her late husband,  Henry W. de Lagarde, and that union brought forth four children, nine  grandchildren, and ten great-grandchildren. Mrs. de Lagarde holds a  bachelor or arts degree from Howard University and served in many  capacities at Charlotte Amalie High School for 31 years.   As a contributor to the quality of life in St. Thomas, she served on  numerous boards, including the National Association of Secondary School  Principals; American Association of Retired Persons; Delta Sigma Theta  Sorority, Inc.; the Cathedral Church of All Saints; and countless  others.   The Virgin Islands community and I are grateful for the impact she  has had with her career and the indelible mark she has made.   Congratulations, Mrs. de Lagarde, and happy 100th birthday to you and  all of your contributions to the people of the Virgin Islands.                            ____________________
