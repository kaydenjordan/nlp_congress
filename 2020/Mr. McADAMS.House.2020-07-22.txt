 Madam Speaker, Utah is blessed with many treasured  national areas, from parks and trails to red rock canyons. Conserving  these places is more important than ever, and today, we take landmark  action by passing full funding for the Land and Water Conservation  Fund. This successful conservation program has given us, at no cost to  the taxpayer, decades of vital funding for national and State parks,  wildlife refuges, and recreational areas.   State and local officials rely on the money to improve local parks  and trails, which see increased demand along the rapidly growing  Wasatch Front. Utah has five of the country's most beloved national  parks, including Zion National Park, which has quite literally been  loved to death and has a $67 million backlog in deferred maintenance.  This bill provides some desperately needed funding to fill that  backlog.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud today to be voting for this legislation and  the promise it holds for our economy and an excellent quality of life  in Utah for my children and for future generations.
