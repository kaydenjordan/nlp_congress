 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution.  President Biden struck the right balance by instituting a temporary  freeze on solar tariffs.   The Inflation Reduction Act has already led to the announcement of  more than 45 gigawatts of domestic solar manufacturing capacity, and  work has already begun.   In 2021, there were only 7 gigawatts of domestic manufacturing  capacity, but it takes time to build out manufacturing capacities. It  doesn't happen overnight.   This 2-year bridge gives the solar industry the time needed to  reorient supply chains away from China to produce panels domestically.   That is why the President's position is supported by leaders who do  the work: organized labor from IBEW, LIUNA, the carpenters, and the  operating engineers, as well as a variety of other organizations in the  environmental community and the National Taxpayers Union.   The solar industry itself strongly supports the administration's  position. Kenneth Cooper, president of IBEW, characterized the  President's action as a carefully crafted compromise that would provide  market certainty to allow American companies to continue deploying  solar panels.   H.J. Res. 39 is a backward-looking resolution, he said, looking to  reopen a settled matter rather than create a solution.  [[Page H2572]]    It is not just organized labor. Members of the environmental  community say that this resolution could destabilize the solar supply  chains, harm ongoing deployment, threaten high-quality solar  construction jobs, and impede our Nation's decarbonization goals.   The National Taxpayers Union opposes this proposal, saying that  Congress should not, ``increase energy costs via the Congressional  Review Act.''   Many of us in Congress have worked for years to achieve the policy  victories contained in the Inflation Reduction Act.   We share the goal of pushing back against China and have supported  legislation to do precisely that. Now is not the time to undermine our  efforts in producing a robust supply chain in solar.   I encourage my colleagues to consider the overwhelming evidence and  reject this legislation when it is called for a vote today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I respectfully disagree with the  gentlewoman from West Virginia. This would not help American industry.   I include in the Record statements from nine American stakeholders in  the industry who relied on Commerce's regulations to make significant  business and economic decisions.       Re. Please Oppose Retroactive Duties and Protect American           Clean Energy Jobs and Investment with a ``No'' Vote on           the Auxin CRA (H.J. Res. 39/S.J. Res. 15)        We are writing to respectfully ask that you oppose H.J.       Res. 39/S.J. Res. 15. Enactment of this resolution would       impose over $1 billion in retroactive duty liability,       increase energy costs for consumers, cost thousands of       American jobs, and hamstring efforts to reduce greenhouse gas       emissions.        Last year, a single company filed anti-circumvention       petitions with the Department of Commerce (Commerce). The       threat of duties ranging from 50 percent-250 percent on solar       panels and cells from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and       Cambodia called for in the petitions abruptly froze solar       supply chains. A significant number of domestic solar       projects experienced cancellations or delays as a result.        To address this disruption, after Commerce accepted the       petitions and initiated a set of investigations, President       Biden issued an emergency declaration that included a       temporary 2-year pause on potential duties arising from the       investigations. This pause allowed planned solar projects to       move forward while the investigations proceeded.        American stakeholders subsequently relied on Commerce's       regulations to make significant business and economic       decisions. Nullifying Commerce's rulemaking as provided for       in H.J. Res. 39/S.J. Res. 15 woul1enalize companies, acting       in accordance with the law, by imposing large (up to 254       percent), unanticipated retroactive duty liability for these       stakeholders--back to April 1, 2022. Going back on this       federal commitment would create a chilling effect on American       business, setting a terrible precedent that undermines       America's competitiveness in the global marketplace.        Passing H.J. Res 39/S.J. Res 15 would also stall or cancel       planned solar projects, eliminate 30,000 jobs, including       4,000 manufacturing jobs, and $4.2 billion of investment in       domestic solar projects. 4GW of planned solar projects       representing roughly 14 percent of the industry's anticipated       deployment in 2023 would be cancelled. This in turn would       increase CO2 emissions by 24 million metric tons.        American businesses need certainty and a bridge to domestic       manufacturing. Right now, only about one-third of U.S. demand       for solar panels (including both crystalline silicon and thin       film photovoltaic panels) can be met with domestic       production, and domestic manufacturers are sold out for the       next 2-3 years. It is our preference to source solar panels       domestically, and we are heartened by the rapid expansion of       domestic solar manufacturing that is currently occurring.       However, ramping up this production capacity across the solar       supply chain will take time, and the temporary 2-year duty       pause provides a necessary bridge to the point where domestic       production capacity is more capable of meeting demand.        For these reasons, and to avoid needless disruption in the       solar marketplace, we respectfully ask that you oppose H.J.       Res. 39/S.J. Res. 15. Thank you in advance for your       consideration.            Sincerely,        Solar Energy Industries Association        American Clean Power        American Council on Renewable Energy        Edison Electric Institute        E2        Silicon Valley Leadership Group        Clean Energy Buyers Association        Advanced Energy United        Coalition for Community Solar Access.     Mr. Speaker, they say nullifying Commerce's  rulemaking as provided for in H.J. Res. 39 would penalize companies  acting in accordance with the law by imposing large, up to 254 percent,  unanticipated retroactive duty liability for these stakeholders going  back to April 1, 2022.   Going back on this Federal commitment would create a chilling effect  on American business, setting a terrible precedent that undermines our  competitiveness in the marketplace.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas, (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from Terry  O'Sullivan, the general president of LIUNA, the Laborers' International  Union of North America.   His statement is on behalf of a half million members of the Laborers'  International Union in strong opposition to this proposal: ``This CRA  resolution comes at a time when our Nation is looking to bolster its  wind and solar industry, steering away from more harmful energy  sources. Our union has never seen this much solar construction work,  and future construction already on the books, within the renewable  energy industry, and it is now all at risk if the CRA is passed.''                                                         LiUNA!,                                      Washington, DC, April 19, 2023      Hon. Jason Smith,      Chairman, House Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Ways and Means,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Neal: On behalf of       the 500,000 members of the Laborers' International Union of       North America (LIUNA), I write in opposition to the       Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution regarding solar       panel manufacturing. This resolution will have a harmful and       disruptive impact on our members' jobs within the solar       industry.        Our nation's energy industry directly employs tens of       thousands of LIUNA members across the country. These jobs       span across all sectors of energy production including,       natural gas, nuclear, hydro, and renewables. By way of the       Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), The Biden Administration has       brought good-paying union construction jobs into the       renewable industry. Because of this, our members have seen a       significant and rapid growth within the renewables sector, in       particular the solar industry. These jobs are finally good       jobs, with family-supporting wages and benefits.        Repealing President Biden's moratorium, however, will bring       several solar construction sites to a halt, leaving our       members without a paycheck. We recognize that the Department       of Commerce's investigation found some solar panel producers       committing trade violations. Of course, in time, this will       need to be addressed.        This CRA resolution comes at a time when our nation is       looking to bolster its wind and solar industry, steering away       from more harmful energy sources. Our union has never seen       this much solar construction work, and future construction       work already on the books, within the renewable energy       industry, and it is now all at risk if the CRA is passed.        I urge you to oppose the Congressional Review Act being       marked up today in committee.        With kind regards, I am,            Sincerely yours,                                                  Terry O'Sullivan,                                                 General President.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from James T.  Callahan, general president of the International Union of Operating  Engineers, and Douglas J. McCarron, general president of the United  Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.   The statement indicates, among other things: ``Repealing President  Biden's proclamation will result in retroactive duties and tariffs that  would jeopardize 30,000 construction and 4,000 manufacturing jobs. . .  . We are not prepared to stand by and let some partisan dispute  eliminate Operating Engineers' jobs and slow the deployment of clean  energy.''         For immediate release: April 19, 2023.     Carpenters and Operating Engineers Unions Oppose Legislation That                        Eliminates Thousands of Jobs         Washington, DC.--The following statement was issued today       by James T. Callahan, General President of the International       Union of Operating Engineers, and Douglas J. McCarron,       General President of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and       Joiners of America, regarding their unions' opposition to       legislation that will eliminate thousands of American jobs:        Last year, the Department of Commerce opened a       circumvention inquiry, alleging that four Southeast Asian       countries were circumventing tariffs and duties on solar       cells and modules from the People's Republic of China. The       inquiry generated massive uncertainty in the domestic solar       market by suggesting possible retroactive tariffs as high as       250 percent. This threat resulted in a drop of 20 percent       fewer solar construction and installation jobs across the       United States.        President Biden took action to preserve these jobs, issuing       Emergency Proclamation 10414 to prevent tariffs on any solar       module and cell imports from the four countries until June       2024. House Joint Resolution 39 will repeal the President's       Proclamation and eliminate thousands of jobs in the American       solar industry.        ``Repealing President Biden's Proclamation will result in       retroactive duties and tariffs that would jeopardize 30,000       construction and 4,000 manufacturing jobs;'' said James T.       Callahan, General President of the International Union of       Operating Engineers. ``We are not prepared to stand by and       let some partisan dispute eliminate Operating Engineers' jobs       and slow the deployment of clean energy:''        ``President Biden's Proclamation saves Carpenters' jobs and       smooths the development of the domestic solar manufacturing       industry. Today, we're seeing the American manufacturing       sector respond to incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act       and develop homegrown solar modules,'' said Carpenters Union       General President Douglas J. McCarron. ``Now is not the time       to disrupt the solar industry and layoff thousands of union       workers just as we're getting a foothold in the burgeoning       solar business.''        The International Union of Operating Engineers and United       Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners urge Congress and       members of the Ways and Means Committee to vote against House       Joint Resolution 39, which will repeal the administration's       Proclamation and eliminate thousands of union jobs, slow the       deployment of renewable energy, and generate unnecessary       greenhouse gases.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Staten Island has it backwards. The  fact is that there is a process underway to review the challenges of  the circumvention. There will be a report within the next year, but  what the President did was put a pause on that to allow American  industry to reorient and to catch up because otherwise they do not have  the capacity.    I quote a strong representative of working men and women, the general  president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of  America, Douglas McCarron: ``President Biden's proclamation saves  Carpenters' jobs and smooths the development of the domestic solar  manufacturing industry. Today, we are seeing the American manufacturing  sector respond to incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act and develop  homegrown solar modules.'' According to this international union  president, ``Now is not the time to disrupt the solar industry and lay  off thousands of union workers just as we are getting a foothold in the  burgeoning solar business.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Flint, Michigan  (Mr. Kildee), a strong and effective voice, for whatever he advocates.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, there was a reference about false choices. Well, it is a  false choice that we adhere to our interests and goals at the expense  of throwing out of work thousands of American union workers and  disrupting opportunities to smooth the supply chain.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from 10 leading  environmental organizations that says: ``While the Commerce Department  investigation of tariff circumvention was being conducted, the  administration sought to provide enough lead time for domestic solar  panel manufacturing and supply chains to rapidly expand operations to  meet demand, bring certainty on the prices of imported panels to solar  companies deploying clean energy, and job stability for those workers  installing panels.''                                                    April 17, 2023.        Dear Member of Congress: The undersigned groups write to       express our opposition to the Congressional Review Act (CRA)       resolutions of disapproval (H.J. Res 39 and S.J. Res 15)       aimed at reversing President Biden's temporary suspension of       tariffs on certain solar cells and panels from manufacturers       in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Passage of these       resolutions could destabilize solar supply chains, harm       ongoing deployment of large scale solar projects, threaten       high-quality solar construction jobs, and impede our nation's       decarbonization goals.        Proclamation 10414, issued by President Biden in June 2022,       gave the U.S. Department of Commerce authority to issue       regulations suspending new solar tariffs until June 2024       while the department proceeded with its investigation into       claims that facilities in the Southeastern Asian countries       were circumventing existing tariffs on Chinese solar       companies. The Commerce Department subsequently issued rules       implementing the  [[Page H2576]]       delay, and H.J. Res 39 and S.J. Res 15 would nullify that       rulemaking.        Our organizations support both a shift to cleaner and       fairer supply chains for clean energy, as well as the rapid       deployment of clean energy in order to meet the urgency of       the climate crisis. Thanks in part to the expansive       investments in clean energy manufacturing and high quality       job standards included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA),       we are now well positioned to achieve both of these goals.       The administration's strong implementation of the IRA's       domestic content provisions is a critical piece to further       drive manufacturing buildout in the U.S. However, passage of       these CRA resolutions would undermine the ability of the U.S.       solar industry to succeed in accelerating the shift to more       clean energy on the power grid.        The President's decision to pause tariffs for two years is       providing U.S. businesses with much-needed certainty after       several months of project cancellations and delays last year       due to the Commerce Department's investigation, which caused       solar deployment to decline by 30 percent--10 gigawatts below       expectations.        We have already seen more than $13 billion in domestic       solar manufacturing announcements since the passage of the       IRA. While more buildout is needed, this demonstrates that       domestic investment is headed in the right direction.       Additional panel shortages, as we saw during the Commerce       Department investigation, would once again debilitate U.S.       utility-scale solar projects and jobs. And if a CRA       resolution rolls back the President's two-year tariff pause,       then debilitating shortages and lost investment capital could       begin this year.        Beyond the harm to solar deployments across the U.S., there       is the larger issue of the CRA being the wrong tool for       Congressional oversight. Congress has always had the power to       create, modify or eliminate rules using the regular       legislative process. The CRA provides a more extreme path by       repealing a rule in its entirety and preventing an agency       from issuing a new rule that is ``substantially the same,''       an undefined phrase that can essentially freeze the       regulatory process.        In this instance, while the Commerce Department       investigation of tariff circumvention was being conducted,       the administration sought to provide enough lead time for       domestic solar panel manufacturing and supply chains to       rapidly expand operations to meet demand, bring certainty on       the prices of imported panels to the solar companies       deploying clean energy, and job stability for those workers       installing panels. Passing these resolutions could prevent       future administrations from being able to find appropriate       solutions to other tariffs and trade challenges.        For these reasons, the undersigned organizations urge you       to vote NO on H.J. Res 39 and S.J. Res 15. Thank you for your       attention to this matter and for considering our views.            Sincerely,        League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense       Council, Sierra Club, Climate Action Campaign, Environmental       Law and Policy Center, Clean Energy for America, Chesapeake       Climate Action Network, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense       Fund, Union of Concerned Scientists.     Mr. Speaker, somebody listening from the sidelines  would think that there is a great deal of disagreement between my  honorable friend from Missouri and me. That is not the case. We share  many of the same goals, as he knows, with legislation that I am  proposing to try to rein in some of the egregious abuses of the  Chinese.   What we are disagreeing about today is to undercut a process that is  working with the Department of Commerce for accountability. The goal  here is for another year to be able to work the process through. I have  no doubt that we are going to end up essentially in the same place but  without compromising the ability of organized labor and workers to be  able to have jobs without undercutting the opportunity for the  businesses to be able to cope with these changed circumstances and to  be able to develop a supply chain, which you cannot do overnight. But  over the course of the next year or so, we can make significant  progress. That is our goal. We don't think that we have to punish  American companies and American workers to achieve that goal.   I am convinced that over the course of the next year, we will be  largely in the same place after that process is finished with the  Department of Commerce. In the meantime, we are not going to have  American workers and businesses pay the price for this, frankly,  unfortunate demonstration of political messaging. We want to reach the  same goal. We don't want to punish workers and industry while we get  there.   Having this additional year requested by the Biden administration  that would be achieved by sustaining his veto is a reasonable outcome  and I think gets us where we want to be.   Mr. Speaker, I respectfully suggest that we reject this resolution,  allow the process to work, do not penalize American workers, and  strengthen supply chains so that a year and a half from now, we can, in  fact, be in the same place, having a robust domestic industry and  enforcing our goals and objectives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
