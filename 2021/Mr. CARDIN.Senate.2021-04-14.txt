 Mr. President, Americans were horrified to witness a  recent series of mass shootings involving the Asian-American and  Pacific Islander community. On March 16, 2021, mass shootings occurred  at three spas and massage parlors in the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Eight people were killed, six of whom were Asian-American women, and  one other person was wounded. The suspect was taken into custody that  day and has been charged with multiple counts of murder. The  investigation is continuing as to whether the suspect should be  additionally charged with hate crimes, if he deliberately targeted  Asian Americans with this senseless violence.   Unfortunately, this mass shooting is not an isolated incident in the  United States in terms of hate speech, hate crimes, and violence  against Asian Americans in our communities. Sadly, some political  figures have used the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to fan the flames of  hate by promoting stereotypes, fear, and xenophobia. Irrationally  blaming Asian and Asian-American neighbors for the pandemic is simply  wrong and reprehensible and can have deadly consequences.   Let us remember that our Asian-American brothers and sisters are an  integral part of the United Nations on so many levels. Our immigrant  story and our diversity are some of our unique strengths, not  weaknesses, of the United States of America.   There are about 23 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in  the United States, constituting 7 percent of the population of our  country.   There are approximately 2 million Asian-American owned businesses  that generate over $700 billion in annual revenue and employ millions  of workers.  [[Page S1924]]    Two million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are working on the  frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic as first responders and in  healthcare, law enforcement, transportation, supermarkets, and other  service industries. Our Asian-American brothers and sisters are putting  their lives on the line every day to help protect our communities  during the pandemic. That is why it is so despicable to see the rise of  anti-Asian rhetoric and hate speech by political leaders and others,  which inevitably gives oxygen to extremist groups and individuals and  gives license to individuals to commit hate crimes and acts of  violence.   The use of anti-Asian terminology and rhetoric related to COVID-19,  such as the ``Chinese virus,'' the ``Wuhan virus,'' the ``Kung flu''-- phrases often used by former President Trump and some of his  followers--has perpetrated an anti-Asian stigma. The use of anti-Asian  rhetoric has resulted in Asian Americans being harassed, assaulted, and  scapegoated for the COVID-19 pandemic.   Since January 2020, there has been a dramatic increase in reports of  hate crimes and incidents against those of Asian descent throughout the  Nation. According to a recent report, there were nearly 3,800 reported  cases of anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID-19 between March  2020 and February 2021.   On April 3, 2021, the New York Times ran an analysis article on the  rising tide of Asian-American violence entitled ``Swelling Anti-Asian  Violence: Who is Being Attacked Where.''   The article stated:         Over the last year, in an unrelenting series of episodes .       . . people of Asian descent have been pushed, beaten, kicked,       spit on and called slurs. Homes and businesses have been       vandalized. The violence has known no boundaries, spanning       generations, income brackets and regions. . . . Those cases       include the fatal attack of a Thai man in January, as well as       the assaults of a 91-year-old man in Oakland's Chinatown and       an 89-year-old woman in Brooklyn. Those episodes, and       other[s] . . . have terrified the Asian community.    The article continues:         But there is no ambiguity about the cases The Times       collected: These are assaults in which the assailants       expressed explicit racial hostility with their language, and       in which nearly half included a reference to the coronavirus.    This article pointed out some sobering statistics when it comes to  hate crimes. Over the last year, hate crimes as classified and reported  by the police rose at a faster pace against people of Asian descent  than hate crimes overall. In New York City and Boston, hate crimes  overall fell while anti-Asian hate crimes spiked.   In New York City alone, the number of hate crimes with Asian-American  victims reported to the New York Police Department jumped to 28 last  year, up from 3 in 2019, and so far this year, the Department is  actively investigating or has solved 35 anti-Asian bias crimes.   Congresswoman Grace Meng, of New York, said:         We've gone from being invisible to being seen as subhuman.       We just want to be seen as American, like everyone else.    On April 9, 2021, the Washington Post ran an article examining the  effect of mass shootings on marginalized groups and how trauma ripples  through those communities.   The article stated:         March 16 marked a turning point for many Asian Americans:       It was the day their community was stricken by a mass       shooting, becoming the latest minority group to suffer an       attack that killed several of its own . . . There's a       specific kind of grief that arises from being targeted, one       that more and more marginalized people in the United States       know too well. The shooting survivors and victims' family       members span geographies, races and religions, but they are       bonded by the shared trauma they have experienced.    The article continues:         These tragedies often leave many in those communities who       weren't directly affected feeling unsafe and traumatized.       After a shooting, many members of these communities say they       felt hyper-aware of their race and an escalated sense of fear       that the same could happen to them or those they love. A mass       shooting seems less senseless or inexplicable when it's       directed at one of your own.    I recall with sorrow that in 2018 a gunman killed 11 Jewish  worshipers at the Tree of Life in Pittsburgh.   The article continues:         Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said his synagogue       practices the ``ministry of presence''. . . . After mass       shootings, synagogue members reach out to the affected       communities and let them know that they're present, they're       listening.    The Georgia massacre ``increases the fear level now of all Asian  Americans who prayed, ``Am I next?'' I know how that feels to have your  community wonder, ``Am I next?'' said Myers, a survivor of the  deadliest attack against Jews on American soil.   In recent weeks, flyers have recirculated at Asian-American  restaurants--posted in the synagogue's Squirrel Hill neighborhood after  the 2018 Pittsburgh shooting--to show their support for the Jewish  community.   One read:         Many of our business members have thrived in this city,       particularly in Squirrel Hill, and if we shared in this good       fortune, then we bear the burdens.    It was a reminder that Asian Americans and Jews share similar status  as minority communities in the United States and now as communities  affected by mass shootings.   I was pleased that, shortly after taking office, President Biden  issued a Presidential memorandum, ``Condemning and Combating Racism,  Xenophobia, and Intolerance Against Asian Americans and Pacific  Islanders in the United States.''   We need to stop the hate. Referring to this global pandemic by  anything other than its appropriate, medical names has inflamed the  worst stereotypes, fear, and xenophobia in the face of a health crisis.  Irrationally blaming Asian or Asian-American neighbors and random  strangers is simply un-American. The Senate and every person in this  country needs to call out the hate, bullying, and scapegoating whenever  we see it and work together as one community to overcome COVID-19.   In my home State of Maryland, I was pleased to see that, last week,  Governor Larry Hogan announced the formation of a statewide workgroup  charged with developing strategies, recommendations, and actions to  address the rise in violence and discrimination targeting the Asian- American community   Governor Hogan named the former U.S. attorney for the District of  Maryland, Robert K. Hur, to chair the workgroup and spearhead the  effort. Mr. Hur was the first Asian American to serve as our U.S.  attorney in Maryland's history, and I had the pleasure of working with  him extensively on a number of criminal matters and civil rights issues  during his tenure.   I also want to commend the work of our current acting U.S. attorney  in Maryland and our FBI Special Agent in Charge, Jennifer C. Boone.  They put out a recent statement which condemned bigotry and hatred  against the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community and  encouraged members of the public to report to law enforcement incidents  of violence, threats, and harassment.   Shortly before the shootings in Atlanta, the U.S. Attorney's Office  for Maryland, on March 10, 2021, launched its Civil Rights Unit to  ensure that the full spectrum of criminal and civil statutes are  employed in addressing hate crimes and discrimination; to conduct  outreach to government, not-for-profit, and private entities in  Maryland; and to help provide training and resources to local and State  law enforcement in Maryland.   Today, I rise in support of S. 937, the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act,  introduced by Senator Hirono of Hawaii. I am proud to be a cosponsor of  this important legislation. I urge the Senate to pass this legislation  without further delay.   This legislation would direct the U.S. Department of Justice to  designate a DOJ employee to assist with the expedited review of COVID- 19 hate crimes reported to Federal, State, and/or local law  enforcement. The legislation would provide guidance for State and local  law enforcement agencies to establish the online reporting of hate  crimes or incidents and to have online reporting available in multiple  languages; expand culturally competent and appropriate public education  and the collection of data and public reporting of hate crimes; and  issue guidance detailing best practices to mitigate racially  discriminatory language in describing the COVID-19 pandemic, in  coordination with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the  COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, and community-based organizations.  [[Page S1925]]    In the 117th Congress, I was privileged to be named as the chairman  of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as  the Helsinki Commission. I additionally serve as the Special  Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance for the OSCE  Parliamentary Assembly.   Over the past year, the world has suffered the crippling impact of  COVID-19, which has disproportionately affected our most vulnerable  citizens. Racist violence has, once again, reared its ugly head in many  OSCE participating States, including our own. I pledge to continue  working with the Helsinki Commission and the OSCE to shine a spotlight  on discrimination, racism, and anti-Asian violence both at home and  abroad as we work together with our partners in the United States and  around the world to share best practices and combat this scourge  against our democracy and freedoms we hold so dear.   In 2019, at the annual meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in  Luxembourg, I chaired a section dealing with anti-Semitism. One of the  key findings that came out of that section was that every community  needs to work together. We are all in this together. An attack on one  community is an attack on all of us and the freedom of all of us, and  we must join in unity to speak with a clear, strong voice against any  of these hate activities.   We now need an all-hands-on-deck approach to combat anti-Asian bias,  prejudice, discrimination, hate crimes, and violence. In working  together--all communities--with our local, State, national, and  international partners, along with our allies in the private sector and  faith community, we can stem this dangerous trend and give a sense of  peace and security back to our Asian-American brothers and sisters. It  starts with our taking up the legislation before us and passing it  promptly   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
