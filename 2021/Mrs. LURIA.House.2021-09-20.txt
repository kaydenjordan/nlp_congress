 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Veterans'  Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2021. Simply put, this is  a well-deserved and necessary pay raise for our disabled veterans.   I am proud to represent a district with eight major military  installations, including Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval  station in the world.                                time  1645    Ours is a community where one in five people is either active duty  servicemembers, veterans, or a military family member.   Our veterans, no matter where they were deployed or in what capacity  they served, swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. They  risked their lives thousands of miles away to keep America safe. And as  a 20-year Navy veteran myself, I am proud to support this bill to  ensure that every veteran can continue to use their benefits they  earned in service to our country.   The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2021, the  Senate companion to my House bill, H.R. 3909, enhances benefits for  wartime disability compensation, compensation for dependents, clothing  allowance, dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses,  and compensation to children. It increases the same way that Social  Security benefits increase to meet the rising cost of living.   We have seen costs for disability care, clothing, and childcare  increase over the years, and it is vital that we continue to provide  benefits that actually meet the demands our veterans face every day.   Providing quality benefits to our veterans and their dependents can  change lives, and Congress must honor the commitment to those American  heroes who served.   Again, I urge swift passage of S. 189 so that we can responsibly  assist our Nation's veterans once again.
