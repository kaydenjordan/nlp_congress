 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, the document before us is a partisan exercise to deliver  large tax cuts to the wealthy. Working Americans will see their taxes  go up, and our children and grandchildren will have to pay back the  debt Republicans will create to finance these tax cuts.   While they promise the American people revenue neutral tax reform  that will simplify the Tax Code and close costly loopholes, the budget  they are ramming through will borrow $1.5 trillion to finance these  cuts. It will precipitate cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and other safety  net programs upon which middle-income families depend.  [[Page H8246]]    It proposes to eliminate the deduction for State and local taxes,  increasing the tax burden on over 500,000 people in my home State of  South Carolina.   This document threatens the earned income tax credit; lowers the  ceiling on middle-income savings; and eliminates the inheritance tax,  which only affects those with estates valued over $11 million.   It creates a pass-through for businesses that pay zero corporate  taxes, effectively giving the owners of these companies a lower  individual rate than the people they employ.   If the Republicans would engage us, we could produce a bipartisan tax  plan that would expand the earned income tax credit for single  individuals and the child tax credit for working families.    Mr. Speaker, we could produce a bipartisan tax plan that  would end the preferential treatment of investment income, which  undermines working Americans while enriching wealthy investors.   We stand ready to engage with the other side. Until then, we will be  resolute in our opposition to this unfair, immoral document.
