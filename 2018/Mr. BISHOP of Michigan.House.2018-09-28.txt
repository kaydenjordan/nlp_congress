 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  6 which will make great strides toward ending the opioid crisis once  and for all.   I am pleased this package includes my bill, the STOP Act, which is  targeted legislation to help stop synthetic opioids like fentanyl and  carfentanil from entering our country through the international mail  system.   I want to make sure I thank all the parents, educators, law  enforcement, emergency response personnel, healthcare professionals,  victims, and those suffering from addiction who have been working with  me to ensure this legislation gets signed into law. Your hard work has  made a real difference.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my colleagues for their support,  and I urge a ``yes'' vote on the underlying bill, H.R. 6.
