 Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, my district tragically  lost the life of another police officer in the line of duty. We mourn  the loss of St. Croix County Sheriff's Deputy Katie Leising.   No amount of words can express the loss that Wisconsin has felt for  our fallen heroes this year. Katie Leising, Emily Breidenbach, Hunter  Scheel, and Peter Jerving dedicated their lives to protecting us, and  my prayers are with the friends and family of the fallen.   This cannot continue. In spite of these tragedies, many lawmakers  still continue to vilify police at every turn and even call to defund  them while allowing criminals to stay on our streets.   Let me be clear: Our law enforcement needs our support now more than  ever.   I thank all of Wisconsin law enforcement. These past few months have  been tough, but we will get through them together.   Violence toward our police officers is something that we will not  tolerate, and please know that Wisconsin's Seventh District stands  behind law enforcement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation,  which is long overdue.   For the last 2 years, this administration has systematically and  deliberately erased our border. They have unleashed a tidal wave of  illegal aliens and deadly drugs into our communities.   They have enriched the cartels and human traffickers.   They have disrespected the millions of legal immigrants who followed  our laws and came here the right way.   They have pushed our local hospitals and schools to the breaking  point and forced you, the American people, to pick up the tab.   Mr. Speaker, that ends today. This bill would restart border wall  construction, add more Border Patrol agents, crack down on people  gaming our asylum laws, and end the failed policy of catch and release.   I am also pleased that this legislation includes a measure I authored  to end the administration's flagrant abuse of parole.   As everyone in this Chamber knows, parole authority is limited. It  allows for the admission of foreigners without a visa under very narrow  circumstances for urgent humanitarian reasons on an individual case-by- case basis.   It was intended to accommodate, for example, a young child seeking  immediate lifesaving medical treatment that is only available here in  the United States, but that is not how President Biden has used it.  Instead, he has converted this narrow avenue into an open borders  superhighway, indiscriminately admitting more than 1 million illegal  immigrants over just the last 2 years.   This is not just wrong, it is reckless.   It is time to restore the rule of law, and it is time to restrain the  dangerous impulses of this administration.   Mr. Speaker, Americans are tired of the chaos. They deserve an  immigration system that puts the safety and well-being of Americans  first, and that is exactly what this bill does. I ask for a ``yes''  vote on the bill.   I will close by thanking the gentleman from California (Mr.  McClintock), who did such a stellar job of shepherding this bill  through the Judiciary Committee and now onto the House floor.
