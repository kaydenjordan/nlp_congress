 Mr. Speaker, on International Women's Day it is fitting  that I rise today to honor and remember Mrs. Betty Griffo of Rome, New  York, who served our community with distinction.   Mrs. Griffo passed away this January at the age of 94 surrounded by  her loving family.   Betty was a hardworking seamstress for 15 years and a woman of great  faith, having been a long-time member of the Church of Saint John the  Baptist, where she impacted so many lives through her intentions and  rosaries.   Betty's personal struggle to fight and defeat cancer is a stirring  example of her courage and tenacity. Betty's compassion for others is  revealed by her commitment to help so many others through her  involvement in the Relay for Life organization.  [[Page H1342]]    Betty's legacy of community service has been passed down to her son  and my longtime colleague and friend, New York State Senator Joseph  Griffo. Betty instilled her wisdom, tenacity, and compassion in Joe,  who employs those key qualities each day that he serves us in  government.   We are so grateful to Betty, her late husband Joe, and their son,  Senator Joe Griffo, for their kindness and generous service to our  community.   My deepest condolences to the Griffo family on the loss of Betty  Griffo, a beautiful mother, aunt, sister, and deeply devoted community  volunteer.                           Recognizing Logan Henyan     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Logan Henyan, the  Congressional App Challenge winner for New York's 22nd Congressional  District.   Logan is not your typical App Challenge participant. I say that, not  because he isn't well versed in coding, he certainly is. I say that  because Logan is only an eighth grader at Chenango Valley Middle  School.   Logan's ``Study Buddy'' app is a student-to-student application. It  provides students with much-needed assistance, and it does so while  building lasting friendships.   New York's 22nd District has a rich history in the technology sector.  It is the birthplace of industry giants like IBM and Singer-Link. The  tradition continues now at the Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome,  New York, the Marcy Nanocenter, and perhaps most importantly, in the  minds of the next generation of inventors and innovators like Logan.   And so I ask my colleagues to please join me in congratulating Logan  Henyan and all the competitors in this year's Congressional App  Challenge. Thanks to these young people, our future is a bright one.                        Recognizing National TRIO Day     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National TRIO Day,  which recently took place on February 26.   National TRIO Day recognizes the vital support and assistance that  students around the country receive through federally funded TRIO  programs. TRIO identifies students from disadvantaged backgrounds and  provides them with the skills, training, and support to excel  academically and personally.   This National TRIO Day, my team attended a TRIO Day celebration at  the newly named Utica University, a great institution in the heart of  my district. Students who benefited from TRIO-funded programs shared  their experiences alongside faculty mentors and community members.   We are honored that in our community, Utica University operates a  Student Support Services program that guides 140 low-income and first- generation students through their academic development. The program  ensures students meet basic college requirements and successfully  complete their post-secondary education. All of this is made possible  by TRIO grants.    It is a privilege to see firsthand the positive impacts of the TRIO  program in our community. Thank you to Utica University President Laura  Casamento, a friend, for her vision and leadership.   I strongly support TRIO's mission, and I applaud my colleagues in  this Chamber for their continued bipartisan support of this proven  program.                            ____________________
