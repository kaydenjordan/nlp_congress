 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about Bristol  Borough, Pennsylvania, a picturesque town in my district situated along  the Delaware River midway between Philadelphia and New York. Since  1824, Bristol Borough has embraced the motto ``Welcome Friend'' after a  sign greeted Marquis de Lafayette on his ``Farewell Tour of America.''  Bristol Borough continues to welcome newcomers to an incredibly caring  community of residents and leaders pushing the town into the future.   Bristol Borough's history closely parallels the economic, commercial,  and industrial history of the United States. In the late 1960s, U.S.  Steel Corporation closed their facilities just up the road, and  thousands of employees lost their jobs. In turn, downtown Bristol  Borough lost an incredible amount of traffic. But what the people did  not lose was their passionate desire to improve their town, restoring  its former glory with an eye to an even brighter future.   Mr. Speaker, the people of Bristol Borough are tough, resilient, and  they have grit. Small-business owners in downtown Bristol are  revitalizing their town, and they have been noticed. As a finalist in  the nationwide Small Business Revolution, Bristol Borough shines a  spotlight on the vital impact small businesses have on our economy, our  communities, and our daily lives.   As a member of the House Committee on Small Business, I pledge my  commitment to pursue policies that protect and foster these small  businesses and that make Bucks County truly a great place to live.                               Opioid Epidemic     Mr. Speaker, heroin and prescription opioid abuse  are devastating communities across  [[Page H1133]]  our Nation. From Levittown to Lower Salford, no part of my district is  left unaffected by this epidemic. Last year in Bucks County, opioid- related deaths rose by 50 percent. In Montgomery County, opioid  overdoses claimed a staggering 240 lives.   Mr. Speaker, every fatality represents a family crushed by the  overwhelming loss of a loved one. As lawmakers, we have the  responsibility to act. Passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and  Recovery Act and the 21st Century Cures Act were monumental first steps  in countering the opioid crisis, but we must continue to press the  issue from all sides, from the trafficking of narcotics across our  border to preventing the overprescribing of painkillers.   Congress alone cannot solve this problem. We must be ready and  willing to work with State and local leaders, law enforcement,  healthcare professionals, and educators in our districts. We are all  stakeholders in this challenge. Together, we can eradicate this  epidemic, we can protect our families, and we can free our communities  from this menace.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all the members  of the freshman class--members of both political parties and of every  political background--who have joined us tonight in signing the  commitment to civility pledge: love thy neighbor, no exceptions. Seeing  46 Republicans and Democrats make this public commitment is encouraging  for this Chamber and for the constituents that we serve.   We can all agree that our Nation is facing some serious challenges.  From increasing opportunity in an evolving economy to keeping our  families safe from threats at home and abroad, the list in front of  this body is heavy enough, and the last thing we need is to make that  problem-solving even tougher. A statement made on the Senate floor last  week offered a stark message: it is simply not possible to exist as a  nation when half of its citizens hate the other half. If we are willing  to end friendships or block our family members because of Facebook  posts, we are not heading in the right direction.   Despite the incredible responsibility entrusted to each of us by  those whom we represent, this Congress has not been immune to the  hardening of political division. However, we must not accept our  current discourse as the new normal.   Yet there is hope. There is hope because the Members standing with me  tonight and those who have joined our pledge are willing to say, first  and foremost, we are Americans, and the person I may disagree with-- even vehemently--is still an American. Just because someone has  different viewpoints or policy priorities or a different letter next to  their name does not make them our enemy.   This Congress can and must play a part in restoring the civility and  respect that makes productive dialogue possible. I am not saying we'll  agree on everything, but a spirit of mutual understanding, mutual  respect, and mutual cooperation is the bedrock for making our  government and our communities work.   Whether we are elected officials, moms, dads, neighbors, community  leaders, students--or anyone--we must remember that there is more that  unites us than divides us. That is a commitment I am willing to make my  colleagues and constituents this evening.   Again, I want to thank my colleagues, the gentleman from Louisiana  and the gentlewoman from California, for all their work. I look forward  to working with our awesome freshman class going forward.
