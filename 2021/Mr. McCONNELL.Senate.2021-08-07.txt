 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will decide whether  to move the bipartisan infrastructure bill closer toward a final vote.   Like I said before, I am quite confident that, out of 100 U.S.  Senators, there are 100 of us who believe the bill is imperfect. This  isn't exactly the bill I would have written on my own in my office, and  99 of my colleagues would say the very same thing. This is a compromise  product crafted by colleagues with big, principled differences in a  Senate with the narrowest possible split.   But in my view, what our early statesmen called ``internal  improvement'' is a core government responsibility. The American people  need roads, bridges, ports, and airports to build their businesses,  build their families, and build their lives. Republicans and Democrats  have radically different visions these days, but both those visions  include physical infrastructure that works for all of our citizens.   As the Kentucky Farm Bureau wrote to me recently, the investments  this bill will make are not just necessary; in many cases they are  overdue. Our country has real needs in this area.   There are many outstanding amendments that are important, that would  improve this legislation, and that deserve votes before the Senate is  asked to vote on the final passage of this bill. The full Senate  deserves its full chance to shape this important legislation. I hope  Senators can work together in a bipartisan way to get more amendments  up and continue improving this important bill. Our colleagues on both  sides deserve to be heard.                            ____________________     The Democratic leader is indicating, in a few days, he  will thrust the Senate into an ultrapartisan showdown over the  staggeringly reckless taxing-and-spending spree that Democrats want to  ram through later this year.   The size and the scope of Chairman Sanders' socialist shopping list  will make every disagreement we had in landing the infrastructure  compromise look like a rounding error--new permanent welfare with no  work requirements, reams of Green New Deal mandates, massive tax hikes  that shrink wages and kill jobs, government meddling in childcare that  would privilege certain families' choices over others, amnesty for  illegal immigrants in the middle of a border crisis.   At a time Democrats' spending already--already--has inflation  hammering American families, Republicans could not be more eager to  debate our colleagues on all of these subjects. We can't wait to get  Democrats on record over many more trillions--trillions--of dollars and  reckless borrowing to fund socialist spending on radical policies that  families are not asking for.   Our philosophy is the polar opposite. Republican policies would  create good jobs, strong wage growth, and stable prices for middle- class families, just like our country had just a year and a half ago-- the most pro-worker economy in a generation, just a year and a half  ago.   Republicans want to give working families the tools and the  opportunity to build the lives that they want. Democrats want to force  them to live the lives the Democrats want.   The stakes in this debate could not be higher, and very soon the  country will see it aired out here right on the Senate floor.   The Democratic leader will be putting the full radicalism of the far  left right here on this floor. He is making every one of his Members  vote on nothing less--nothing less--than Chairman Sanders' dream  shopping list. Every American family will know exactly where their  Senator stands                            ____________________     On one final matter, I have already discussed how the  Biden administration has nominated a proud and proven opponent of  American's constitutional rights to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms, and Explosives.   I don't think there could be any more evidence that David Chipman is  the wrong choice to serve as the top Federal administrator of firearms  policy. He has a long record of hostility to lawful gun owners, a  variety of complaints from those who worked with him in the past.   How could it get worse?   Mr. Chipman has suggested radical and sweeping steps, like banning  private sales that are lawful, overriding State laws, and imposing  sweeping restrictions on a class of weapons he has yet to clearly  define.   Among some current and former ATF agents, he has earned a concerning  reputation as a ``bully'' and ``activist'' whose extreme views threaten  to undermine the trust the Agency needs to conduct oversight. And  sources within the ATF have also come forward describing alleged  racially discriminatory comments the nominee made in the workplace  regarding personnel decisions.   So even a few days ago, it was not difficult to realize this is an  instance in which the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, should take a  pass. But somehow, in just the last few days, it has actually gotten  worse.   Earlier this week, news reports indicated that Mr. Chipman had failed  to disclose to our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee a TV  appearance he made several years ago. This wasn't just any TV  appearance; Mr. Chipman had granted an interview to a propaganda  network overseen by the Chinese Government.   A new letter to the Senate, signed by seven former career ATF agents,  summed it up this way: Mr. Chipman's views and record would ``create  serious and long-lasting problems for the Bureau and the effective  execution of its law enforcement mission.''   The Senate has spent quite enough time flirting with this profoundly  misguided nomination. The American people deserve a trustworthy steward  leading the ATF, with a record of respecting their rights and  respecting his or  [[Page S5995]]  her colleagues. It is long past time the Biden administration revisit  this decision and send us somebody who fits that description.                            ____________________
