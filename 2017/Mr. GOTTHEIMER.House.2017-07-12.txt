 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bipartisan  amendment to reauthorize the Suicide Prevention and Resilience Program  to 2019.   This is a critical program that provides members of the National  Guard and Reserves, as well as their families, with training in suicide  prevention, resilience, and community healing resources.   We simply cannot allow this critical suicide prevention program to  expire, not for the men and women who are or have been on the front  lines. Our Nation's veterans deserve the best care after putting their  lives on the line to protect the freedoms we hold dear.   My bipartisan amendment reauthorizes and extends this program to  improve safety and ensure continuity and peace of mind for the men and  women who serve.   Just one soldier lost to suicide is too many. We should do everything  in our power to help as many servicemembers as we can.   National Guardsmen and Reservists face unique challenges. They are  citizen soldiers who do not live on a base. They often leave their jobs  and families on a moment's notice to suit up to protect us.   Even a great Guardsman or Reservist may not know when and how to ask  for help, yet these men and women still need access to support systems  and community networks to help identify potential mental health issues.  That is why it is critical that we extend this program to protect the  well-being of all of our soldiers.   I am proud to offer this amendment in honor of those who serve in the  New Jersey Guard and Reserve and across the Nation, as well as for  their families.   I thank my colleague, Congresswoman McSally, for her leadership on  this issue and for her advocacy on behalf of all servicemembers.   I also thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for their  important work on this critical legislation. I look forward to coming  together as Democrats and Republicans to defend our Nation and protect  all of those who serve.
