 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to mark a moment in history  for the First State, your neighboring State, to celebrate the first  U.S. Navy vessel to be named after Delaware in more than 100 years.   In 2 days, I will be joined by the Secretary of the Navy, the First  Lady of the United States, and what will feel like half of Delaware at  the Port of Wilmington to commemorate the commissioning of the Virginia  Class of nuclear submarine, the USS Delaware.   And while the vessel was first officially commissioned underwater and  underway on a mission at sea due to the COVID restrictions on April 4,  2020--a first in Navy history--a first in Navy history--this weekend,  we will get to give the USS Delaware, its crew, and the people of  Delaware a fitting celebration above the surface of the water.   It has been a long time coming for the USS Delaware. So many people  across Delaware and in the Navy have worked hard not just for weeks,  not just for months, but for years to make this weekend a reality for  our State and the crew.   I would be remiss not to mention my wingman in the U.S. Senate,  Senator Chris Coons, and our wing-woman in the U.S. House of  Representatives, Lisa Blunt Rochester, as well as our Governor John  Carney for their long-standing support for the USS Delaware. They will  be joining us on Saturday to celebrate.   You probably wouldn't be surprised to learn that SSN 791--that is the  number assigned to the USS Delaware, is not the first Navy vessel to  bear the name ``Delaware.''   The first USS Delaware was launched in 1776. Its role? Delaying the  British Fleet's approach to Philadelphia and thus impeding the ability  of the British to resupply their army in our War of Independence. That  was the first USS Delaware.   The sixth USS Delaware was completed in April of 1910. Armed with ten  12-inch guns, it was the most powerful battleship in the world at the  time. Over 100 years would pass before another US Naval vessel would  bear the name ``Delaware.''   Then, one day in 2012, I came across a letter to the editor from a  constituent in Delaware whose name is Steven Llanso. He wrote to the  editor. He said: You know, it has been a long time since a ship was  built and named after the State of Delaware. Maybe somebody should do  something about it.   I thought about it for a while. I thought about it for a couple of  weeks, actually. I pulled my staff together and said, ``Why don't we do  something about this?'' And they said ``Let's do,'' and we did.   The next week, I was on the phone with then-Secretary of the Navy Ray  Mabus, former Governor of Mississippi--us both being former Governors-- and a long-time friend, and he would go on to become the longest  serving Secretary of the Navy in the history of our country.   I explained the situation to Secretary Mabus. He graciously heard me  out and agreed 100 years was a long time. Before we hung up, he said to  me, ``Let me think about it, Tom. I will get back to you in a couple of  months.'' And true to his word, 3 months later, he gave me a call and  said that over the next several years, the Navy would begin  construction on not one, not two, but three, maybe four Virginia Class  nuclear submarines, and the first one off the line would be named the  USS Delaware.   Now, I was talking on a mobile phone, but if I had a landline--if I  was talking with him through a landline, I could have reached through  the landline and kissed him. I was so happy. And I didn't do that. But  it was a wonderful moment, one that I relished in, and I certainly do  today. He is a great friend, a great leader of the Navy then and a  patriot, and he has done so many things for our country. So thank you,  Ray.   So this weekend, almost a decade since I first spoke with then- Secretary Mabus, I will have the honor of finally introducing the  newest USS Delaware to the people of Delaware. And there is a whole lot  of it to take in.   The USS Delaware is a Virginia Class U.S. nuclear submarine. The  Delaware will carry 26 MK-48 torpedoes, which enable it to conduct the  sub's more traditional role of tracking and, if necessary, sinking  enemy submarines, as well as a wide range of surface vessels.   The Delaware is also designed for versatile operations in shallow  water, closer to land, performing reconnaissance activities, delivering  Special Forces. It is also configured to launch Tomahawk cruise  missiles which can be launched while the Delaware is on patrol. The  Tomahawk can strike targets nearly 1,000 miles away with pinpoint-- pinpoint--accuracy.   This is one hell of a fighting machine. You know, they have a saying  down in Texas you have probably heard. It says ``Don't mess with  [[Page S1893]]  Texas,'' and I would just add to that, to our adversaries, ``Don't mess  with the USS Delaware because, if you do, we will eat your lunch. I  promise.''   And, oh, yes. There are 136 crewmembers aboard the USS Delaware. They  hail from 20 States across our country. Almost half of the States are  represented in the crew of our sub. The crew also includes 15 officers  and 121 enlisted men, a dozen or so who are chief petty officers. My  dad was a chief petty officer for nearly 30 years, World War II and  beyond. And he always told me when I was a midshipman, he used to say,  ``Tom, the chiefs run the Navy.'' And you know, they did, and my guess  is they still do.   But in addition to having an opportunity to introduce the crew of the  USS Delaware to the people of Delaware this weekend, we will also have  an opportunity to introduce Delaware to the crew of the State that they  are representing.   With tongue in cheek, I like to describe Delaware as the 49th largest  State in the Union, and it is comprised of three counties and 1 million  people. We are about 100 miles from north to south and about 50 miles  from east to west along our southern border with Maryland, the  Presiding Officer's State.   Native Americans, including the Lenape Indians, lived in Delaware for  hundreds of years before the Dutch arrived some 400 years ago and  established Lewes, DE, the first town in the first State, located where  the Atlantic Ocean meets the Delaware Bay.   A quick story: The Dutch were not all that kind to these Native  Americans who lived in that greater area which is now Lewes. And the  Native Americans literally wiped out the Dutch colony. Later on, the  Dutch would come back in greater numbers, be more kind to the Native  Americans, and the colony of Lewes grew and prospered.   The British looked askance at this and worried about the growth of  this Dutch colony surrounded by British settlements and forces. One  night, the Dutch went to bed to sleep in Lewes, DE, and the Brits  burned the town to the ground. The next morning, when the Dutch  surveyed what happened, there was one house still standing, the Ryves  Holt House, believed to be maybe the oldest permanently standing house  in North America. The Ryves Holt House is now a part of a national  park.    Later on, in 1631, the first Swedes and Finns sailed by what would  become the Port of Wilmington. Their sailing ships--the Kalmar Nyckel  and the Fogel Grip--took a turn to the west for a couple miles on a  smaller river that they named the Christina after Sweden's 12-year-old  child queen. Along its banks, they established the colony of New  Sweden, where Wilmington stands today. The church they built there is  believed to be perhaps the longest continuously serving church in North  America--Old Swedes church--and believe it or not, there are now more  Swedish-Americans than there are Swedes in Sweden.   Fifty-one years later, William Penn would sail up the Delaware, past  Wilmington, past the Port of Wilmington now, to what is called Penn's  Landing, about 25 miles north of Wilmington, and carried with him the  deeds from the King of England to what would later become the Colony of  Pennsylvania and something called ``the Lower Three Counties.'' That  would be us, Delaware. But the real Penn's Landing, ironically, was in  what is now New Castle, DE--not Pennsylvania, but New Castle, DE.   And there is a legend. Legend has it that not only did he stop there,  but he spent the night in Delaware. And later on, he was asked why did  he stop in Delaware, and he said, ``Tax-free shopping.'' ``Tax-free  shopping.''   A few hundred years later, up the Christina River, 10,000  shipbuilders, mostly women, would build many of the ships, including  destroyer escorts and troop landing ships that enabled us to emerge  victorious in World War II. And that is only part of the storied  history that the USS Delaware joins today.   Throughout Delaware history, the letter ``C'' has figured  prominently. Our first settlers planted corn--a lot of it. They raised  chickens, a lot of them, and fed them corn. Our State bird is, believe  it or not, the ``fightin''' blue hen. Today, there are nearly 300  chickens for every person who lives in the First State of Delaware.  Later, we become known as the ``Chemical Capital of the World.'' Thank  you, DuPont, for hundreds of amazing, amazing inventions. Delaware's  coastline is not large, but the last I checked, it was home to the most  five-star beaches than any other State coastline in America--and one of  them is Rehoboth. And Rehoboth is a name that is translated to mean  ``room for all.''   Not long ago, we built more cars in Delaware per capita than any  other State. Not surprising is that they were Chryslers and Chevrolets.   And while we have no sales tax, Delaware is the home of incorporation  of half the Fortune 500 and half the New York Stock Exchange. So  corporations are important to us. While I don't know what credit card  is in the wallet of most of the people on the floor today, there is a  good chance it is issued by a bank with operations in Delaware.   Now, that is a lot of C's, but even our political leaders have gotten  into the act with names like Carvel, former Governor; Castle, former  Governor; Carney, current Governor; Coons, our senior Senator; and  Carper, his wingman. And even though Joe Biden didn't start out as one  of the C-boys, he was close, just off by one letter. Joe Biden has  ended up, as you know, as our Nation's Commander-in-Chief. That is a  lot of C's put together in a very nice way. Not bad for a scrappy kid  from Scranton, PA.   By far, the greatest contribution that Delaware has made since the  founding of our country occurred on December 7, 1787, when Delaware  became the first State to ratify our Constitution. I like to say we are  the first to ratify, followed shortly thereafter by Maryland,  Pennsylvania, and others; but for 1 whole week, Delaware was the entire  United States of America. We opened it up and let others in. And I  think for the most part, it turned out pretty well, at least until now.  But the Constitution that we ratified on December 7, 1787, would become  the most enduring Constitution in the history of the world and by far  the most replicated.    You know, none of us are perfect--certainly not me--and our  Constitution was not perfect either; but over time, we have made it  better, a lot better. Along with the Bill of Rights, it provides a  framework, if you will, and a path that has made our country the envy  of much of the rest of the world.   But at the end of the day, our Constitution and our Declaration of  Independence are words on a piece of paper without the resolve made  real by the commitment and sacrifice of men and women who wear and have  worn the uniform of our country.   Let me end with this. I suspect that most of my colleagues remember  studying the Constitution in school--maybe in grade school, maybe in  middle school. I remember it. In fact, my sister and I had to learn and  actually recite the Preamble in middle school. As you know, it begins  with something like this:         We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more       perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic       Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the       general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to       ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this       Constitution of the United States of America.    The Preamble of our Constitution doesn't say ``in order to form a  perfect Union''; it says ``a more perfect Union.'' Why is that? Because  as citizens of our great country, it is up to each of us to do our part  to ensure that the arc of American history bends toward perfection and  justice, even knowing that we will probably never fully achieve it.   The men who serve and will serve aboard the USS Delaware will bear  our State's namesake literally for decades to come, maybe a half- century or more, in defense of our Nation. The crewmembers are  answering the call of our Nation written over 230 years ago. Through  their sacrifice, through their service, may we grow even closer to that  more perfect Union. We are--I know I am--grateful for their service  today.   May God bless and protect the crew of the USS Delaware, both now and  in the decades to come, and may each of us live our own lives in ways  to ensure  [[Page S1894]]  that America remains a nation worthy of their sacrifice so that a  government of the people, by the people, and for the people will not  perish from this Earth.   USS Delaware, long may she sail.   And before I yield back my time, I guess we have been joined on the  floor by our friend and colleague, John Cornyn from Texas. And Senator  Cornyn, I think maybe before he arrived, I used the phrase--I  acknowledged the phrase, ``Don't mess with Texas.'' ``Don't mess with  Texas.'' And I went on to explain all the weapons systems that the USS  Delaware has on board. It is a pretty amazing, incredible submarine.  And I said: It is all right not to mess with Texas, but you better not  mess--for our adversaries, you better not mess with Delaware, either.    With that, I yield the floor to my friend from Texas, Senator Cornyn.
