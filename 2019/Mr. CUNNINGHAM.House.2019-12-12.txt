 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to  ensure that the VA and the veterans that it serves are able to take  advantage of lower drug prices made possible by H.R. 3.   I am proud to support the underlying bill, which will result in lower  drug prices for millions of Americans, but we cannot forget those who  have sacrificed so much for our country. Veterans have earned our  support, and they should never have to compromise on healthcare.   H.R. 3 will establish a fair price negotiation program which will  enable the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with  drug companies and obtain a fair price for Medicare recipients as well  as the privately insured. My amendment would simply allow the VA to  purchase drugs at the same price if it is lower than what they would  otherwise pay on their own.                                time  1230    Put simply, everyone deserves to pay a fair price for their  lifesaving medication.   This is not just about fiscal responsibility. It is about moral  responsibility. The hard-earned tax dollars Americans are willing to  put toward caring for their veterans should be spent on veterans, not  on lining the pockets of drug companies.   The Lowcountry is home to over 80,000 veterans, and I want them to  know that when they seek VA care, they are receiving the best care at  the best price. I, for one, refuse to allow Big Pharma to profit off  our veterans. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me  in ensuring our veterans have access to the lowest possible drug  prices.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleagues on the Committees  on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and Education and Labor for  their work on this historic piece of legislation, which will save  lives. I also thank Chairman McGovern and my colleagues on the Rules  Committee for ruling my amendment in order.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote to lower the exorbitant cost of  prescription drugs for every single American.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
