 Mr. Speaker, over the last 2 years, members of the  Judiciary Committee and my committee, the Criminal Justice  Subcommittee, which I serve as the ranking member, have worked  extensively with groups all over the Nation to reauthorize the Violence  Against Women Act, and we have done so in a bipartisan and nonpartisan  manner.   The bill is written. It was introduced on July--just a month ago--26,  2018.   Victims are waiting for the reauthorization that will improve the  Violence Against Women Act. In fact, law enforcement are waiting,  victims are waiting, those who have experienced sexual assault and  sexual harassment.   And I would just tell my friends on the other side of the aisle,  Republican leadership needs to put that bill on the floor of the House  and put it on the floor now.   Again, this is not a partisan bill. It has been crafted and supported  by faith organizations and advocacy groups for women and victims. It is  supported by law enforcement.   So, Mr. Speaker, we can do our job and we should do our job. When we  come back from our recess that we work in our districts, let us put on  the floor the Violence Against Women Act and let's vote for it now.                            ____________________
