 Mr. Speaker, as we recognize National  Bible Week, we have the chance to reflect on the wisdom and guidance  that the Holy Scripture provides to us as we seek to govern.   It was Benjamin Franklin who said: I know that my redeemer lives. And  if a sparrow cannot fall without His knowing, surely an empire cannot  rise without His aid.   We see evidence of God's love and providence in so many aspects of  our American lives. From our military, who have kept our Nation safe,  to the doctors and researchers who have developed lifesaving medicines  and cures because they have the freedom to innovate, to the miners,  rail workers, and manufacturers who have built a strong and prosperous  country, and to the farmers and producers who till our soil and grow  the food that we rely on, there is abundant evidence that we are truly  a blessed Nation.   May God continue to bless these great United States of America.                            ____________________
