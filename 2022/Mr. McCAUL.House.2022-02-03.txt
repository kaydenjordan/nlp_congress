 Madam Speaker, if we adopt the motion to recommit, we  will instruct the Committee on Science to consider my amendment to  ensure that this bill will not fund the Chinese Communist Party.   I ask unanimous consent to include the text of my amendment in the  Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to recommit.    As I said yesterday, the generational threat of the  Chinese Communist Party is a test, not only for our national security  but for American values. Sadly, this bill fails that test.    The CCP exploits our economy. They are building hypersonic weapons on  the backbone of U.S. technology, and they are using American  intellectual property to further their genocide.   A substantive bill to counter the CCP isn't just a security issue. It  is a moral issue. Yet, this bill takes no meaningful steps to keep U.S.  technology out of the hands of the CCP's military.   Even worse, my Democratic colleagues have refused safeguards that  would stop this money from financing slave labor and genocide in the  Xinjiang province.   Madam Speaker, I, therefore, urge my colleagues to reconsider this  Trojan horse bill and to adopt my straightforward amendment. It would  stop huge sums of U.S. taxpayer dollars from going to the Chinese  Government, from funding their genocide. It would stop research funds  in this bill from being used by entities like the Wuhan Institute of  Virology.   Madam Speaker, this is the test of our time. We must not help the CCP  build the future of global energy on a foundation of slave labor and  genocide.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand on the right  side of history and to support my motion to recommit.
