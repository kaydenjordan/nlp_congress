 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this combined rule  that will enable the people's House to consider both the World Bank  Accountability Act and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act.   Before I speak about why I support this rule, I do want to respond to  the other gentleman from Colorado saying that this House is not doing  the people's business. In fact, this House is dealing with year-end  spending, and we are doing it right now. We are working on immigration  reforms. To suggest otherwise is simply not true.    In fact, on year-end spending, this House passed all appropriations  bills ahead of time, ahead of schedule, before the end of the fiscal  year. Those bills were sent over to the Senate.   This House also dealt with the issues related to the Children's  Health Insurance Program, dealt with community health centers and a  whole range of other issues. Those pieces of legislation went over to  the Senate.   So the issue is really with the Senate, it is not with this House.   Furthermore, this House has passed historic tax reform that has  become law. It has passed over 16 Congressional Review Acts rolling  back Obama-era regulations and rules that were holding back our  economy. The result is millions of jobs were created and the best  economy we have seen in a decade.   So it is just simply not true to suggest that this House is not doing  the people's business. We are dealing with some important additional  issues this week. We can do both: plan for the year-end spending  debates with the Senate and also reauthorize the World Bank.   The World Bank's mission is to reduce poverty around the globe.  However, during congressional oversight hearings, it has become clear  that the World Bank is falling short of its antipoverty mission.  [[Page H427]]    As early as 1992, outside reviews of the World Bank--and, later, its  own reviews--concluded that a ``pressure to lend'' on staff, through  the staff evaluation process, has created perverse incentives for some  World Bank employees to focus on loan volume in order to receive a  raise or a promotion rather than what really matters, which is poverty  reduction outcomes.   In addition, there are numerous examples of where the very group of  people that was supposed to be helped through World Bank assistance was  actually harmed by a corrupt government or its cronies. From violent  evictions to rape, to murder, the list of human rights violations goes  on and on.   One of the most egregious examples of human rights violations was the  Uganda crisis, where contractors were sexually abusing a dozen or more  girls, and it took the World Bank years to stop it. Even more  perplexing, the World Bank's country manager for the Uganda project  was, disturbingly, promoted to become World Bank country director for  the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where allegations, not  surprisingly, of sexual and gender-based violence have resurfaced in  2017.                                time  1300    For these reasons and more, I support the World Bank Accountability  Act, which requires the World Bank to fix its problems or face a 15 to  30 percent reduction of the U.S. contribution to the World Bank's  International Development Association fund, or, as it is commonly  called, IDA.   More specifically, the bill authorizes $3.3 billion for IDA over the  next 3 years and mandates that the World Bank must align its incentives  for employees with the World Bank's goals of poverty reduction, ending  the ``pressure to lend'' problem that is pervasive today. Throwing  money at this problem is not the answer, but getting results and doing  so without these kind of terrible, horrific scandals is critically  important.   The legislation also requires the World Bank to fix failures  identified in the Uganda sexual abuse crisis so that nothing like that  ever happens again.   Additionally, the legislation requires the World Bank, through its  various tools, to support property rights, due process of law, and  economic freedom. The World Bank must also demonstrate that none of its  resources have been used to fund terrorism, and must also improve its  ability to detect and minimize corruption. If the World Bank does all  of these commonsense reforms, then it will receive its full U.S.  contribution for IDA. But if it fails to do this, then the World Bank  doesn't deserve the full funding backed by U.S. taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I also am a strong supporter of the Home Mortgage  Disclosure Adjustment Act. This much-needed legislation exempts  community financial institutions, such as small banks and credit  unions, from the onerous doubling of Home Mortgage Disclosure  Adjustment Act reporting requirements if they make 500 or fewer  mortgages and 500 or fewer home equity lines of credit each of the  preceding 2 years.   The lenders I have spoken to say that, without relief, they will have  to devote more resources to compliance costs, rather than deploying  more capital into our economies to benefit working families and  businesses.   Instead of having to collect superfluous redundant data, let's allow  and liberate our community financial institutions to do what they want  to do, and what they should be doing, in their core mission, and that  is serving their customers and providing loans.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Emmer for his hard work on the Home  Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act. I thank Chairman Hensarling also  for his leadership on both of these bills.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support both of these important  pieces of legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I  thank him for his support and leadership in bringing my legislation to  the floor.   As Chairman Hensarling has already noted, H.R. 3326 passed the House  Financial Services Committee by a unanimous vote of 60-0. No amendments  were offered by any of our Democratic colleagues during that markup. So  it is disappointing to me that the ranking member is standing in  opposition today, despite voting for this bill in committee and then  waiting half a year before proposing any changes.   Nonetheless, I want to address the gentlewoman's criticism of the  withholding mechanism in this legislation, because she seems to share a  philosophy endemic at the World Bank, which basically says this: money  equals impact. But this runs counter to the evidence we have heard  again and again during multiple oversight hearings.   It also runs counter to how the World Bank itself operates with its  borrowers. The World Bank lends to poor countries by attaching  conditions. People can disagree if that conditionality is too much or  too little, but the World Bank affects behavior by telling governments  that there are no blank checks. The ranking member knows this, and it  goes without saying that there are many elements to World Bank  conditionality that the ranking member and her Democratic colleagues  passionately support, but if the gentlewoman from California would  never tolerate the World Bank writing blank checks to governments, it  is odd that she wants Congress to write a blank check to the World  Bank.   Here is how a former, longtime senior staff member of the World Bank  put it in testimony before our subcommittee last Congress: `` . . . the  reality is that bank staff are assessed by the volume of their lending,  dollars of money lent. And that is just a poor indicator of impact on  poverty. You have impact on poverty sometimes when you don't lend at  all.''   This perverse lending culture at the World Bank has been documented  for at least a quarter century and documented by the World Bank itself.   Mr. Chairman, I want to draw your attention to a 1992 bank management  review entitled, ``Effective Implementation: Key to Development  Impact'', commonly known as the Wapenhans Report, which details a  pressure to lend that distorts staff incentives at the expense of  management and project implementation. Again, this is from 1992.   Well, fast forward to 2014, and a report by the bank's own evaluation  office entitled, ``Learning and Results in World Bank Operations: How  the Bank Learns,'' concludes that the pressure to lend is alive and  well.   In addition to focusing on better incentives and management at the  World Bank, H.R. 3326 requires the World Bank to more effectively  support secure property rights, due process, and economic freedom. As  distinguished academics such as Nobel economics laureate Angus Deaton,  New York University's William Easterly, and the University of Chicago's  James Robinson have found, foreign aid makes little positive difference  if we are indifferent to the poor's right to exert control over their  livelihoods, own land and other assets, and be free from arbitrary  government interference.    Now, Mr. Chairman, if the World Bank supports a corrupt government,  that doesn't mean that it is going to help the condition of the  impoverished in that country that is denied economic freedom.   Why doesn't the ranking member support these commonsense principles?  If the bank doesn't lend with the rights of the poor in mind, then the  ranking member's concerns about withholding money aren't serious. If  money is being squandered and it isn't helping the poor to begin with,  why would you not want to withhold it?   Again, our Democratic friends love conditionality at the World Bank;  they just had a change of heart when a Republican-sponsored bill is  holding the World Bank to high standards. So let no one watching this  debate be fooled by crocodile tears.   Let me close by touching on the national security elements of this  bill, which the ranking member also plans to vote against.   H.R. 3326 incentivizes the World Bank to strengthen its work to fight  violent extremism and keep state sponsors of terrorism away from World  Bank resources. This latter provision was a direct result of bipartisan  discussions that we had in our subcommittee, so it is shocking to see  anyone on the other side of the aisle oppose the legislation.   Finally, this bill would also ensure that the U.S. oppose World Bank  financial assistance to countries that knowingly fail to enforce U.N.  Security Council sanctions against North Korea. Our committee passed  nearly identical language as part of the Otto Warmbier North Korea  Nuclear Sanctions Act, which I am proud to have sponsored, and the  provision benefitted directly from input from my subcommittee ranking  member, Ms. Moore. The committee vote, yet again, was unanimous on that  bill, and the House went on to pass it by a vote of 415-2.   It boggles the mind that any Member of this body would vote against  that language as part of H.R. 3326.   In closing, if the ranking member is upset that we take the interests  of the poor more seriously than the interests of the World Bank, then  so be it, but I believe the World Bank's interests and the poor's  interests should be aligned, not just in theory, but in practice, and  if they are not, it is the World Bank that should look at itself in the  mirror.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3326.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from  Texas really has presented rather hollow arguments that have no place  in this debate. This is about our humanitarianism and about our  strategic position in the world.  [[Page H443]]    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Velazquez).    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  although I am not opposed to the amendment.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition  to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Palmer). Is the gentlewoman opposed to the  amendment?   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Yes, I am opposed to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition  to the amendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman).   While the amendment speaks to reducing government barriers to  entrepreneurship, the real-world impact of adopting this amendment  would be to enlist the World Bank in the business  [[Page H450]]  of really what they are going for, diminishing labor standards.   The World Bank's prior ``doing business'' report is a prime example  of why we must reject this amendment. The World Bank should be  encouraging sustainable and inclusive growth, not policies that  diminish workers' rights. So I would urge all Members to oppose this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Barr).    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from South Carolina for  his very thoughtful amendment. His amendment addresses an issue dear to  our heart, and that is economic freedom. By making the bill even more  explicit in its support for entrepreneurship, his contribution makes a  good piece of legislation better. Still, it is important to remember  that the poor, wherever they may be in the world, can succeed if their  government lets them, and that is a principle we should all  wholeheartedly support. I hope the World Bank will subscribe to it as  well.   I would just say one other thing about the debate that has transpired  here today. This is hardworking American taxpayers' generosity. It is  their charity. It is the American taxpayers trying to help people who  live in impoverished countries.   It is unfair to hardworking taxpayers and it dishonors the generosity  of the American people to not hold the World Bank accountable.   I applaud the gentleman, Mr. Norman, for his amendment, which will  unleash entrepreneurship in these lesser developed countries.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the  balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Connolly    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2  printed in part A of House Report 115-518.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  although I am not opposed.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Kentucky is  recognized for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his  efforts, and I am willing to accept his amendment.   The language he proposes would ensure that the Treasury keeps  Congress updated on the World Bank's efforts to ensure that certain  visa holders at the World Bank are aware of the provisions of current  law.  [[Page H451]]    This addition to the bill is unobjectionable. I am pleased to support  it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 8, line 13, insert ``(a) In General.--'' before ``The       Secretary''.        Page 8, line 13, strike ``should'' and insert ``shall''.        Page 8, line 16, insert ``financial'' before ``assist-''.        Page 8, line 17, after ``ance'' insert ``, other than       assistance to support basic human needs,''.        Page 8, line 24, strike the close quotation marks and the       period that follows.        Page 8, after line 24, insert the following:        ``(b) Waiver.--The President may waive subsection (a) for       not more than 180 days at a time with respect to a foreign       government if the President reports to the Congress that--        ``(1) the failure described in subsection (a) by the       foreign government is due exclusively to a lack of capacity       of the foreign government;        ``(2) the foreign government is taking effective steps to       prevent the failure from recurring; or        ``(3) the waiver is vital to the national security       interests of the United States.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 693, the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Barr) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a straightforward amendment  that would simply make this bill's language more consistent with  legislation the House has already passed with an overwhelming  bipartisan majority.   As reported, H.R. 3326 calls on the Treasury Department to oppose  World Bank assistance to IDA countries that knowingly fail to enforce  U.N. Security Council sanctions against North Korea.   As the U.N. Panel of Experts has concluded, lax enforcement,  including in developing countries eligible for IDA support, has  significantly undermined the effectiveness of U.N. sanctions against  the Kim regime.   All my amendment does is change the word ``should'' to ``shall,''  making U.S. opposition to World Bank assistance for those countries  mandatory. At the same time, the amendment adds Presidential waiver  authority so that the administration can exempt countries that may be  facing limits to their government capacity or which are making an  effort to correct their enforcement failures. There is also a national  interest waiver included in this provision.   The Financial Services Committee has already passed this stronger  mandatory provision in the Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions  Act, which I am proud to have sponsored along with my subcommittee  ranking member, Ms. Moore from Wisconsin. Ms. Moore's input was  important to making this provision both tough and flexible enough to  incentivize foreign countries to work harder on sanctions enforcement.   Our committee passed the Otto Warmbier sanctions bill unanimously,  and it passed the full House in October by a vote of 415-2. Again, this  is a minor change to align this bill's language with a policy that the  House has already endorsed on a bipartisan basis.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues' support.   Before I conclude, I do want to just make a general comment about the  wisdom of this legislation and the approach to enforce accountability  on the World Bank. We heard some of the arguments from our friends on  the other side of the aisle--our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle. I would just say, on a bipartisan basis, we are the guardians  and the custodians of the American taxpayers' charity. We are the  guardians of their hard-earned income that they pay in the form of  taxes to their government, and they ask us to be wise stewards of those  tax dollars.   These taxpayers work hard to pay their taxes. So when that money  comes to Washington, they expect when we are fighting poverty in Third  World countries with their tax dollars that we make it work because the  American people--and we all agree here--want to fight poverty in these  Third World countries.   We want to make sure that these Third World countries are not either  knowingly or unknowingly supporting circumventing these sanctions  against North Korea.   We want to make sure that they are promoting economic freedom and  actually helping people rise out of poverty and achieve their God-given  potential in these countries that need our humanitarian assistance.   So for goodness' sake, let's support accountability at the World Bank  so that we don't have rape, murder, and violent evictions associated  with World Bank projects, which is what everybody knows the testimony  has been in our oversight.   This is not about turning our backs on the poor. It is about standing  up for the poor. It is about making sure that the money that our  taxpayers are giving to the World Bank is actually helping alleviate  poverty and not exacerbating the problems in these poor countries.                                time  1615    If the Bank can't undertake the reforms in this bill--again, reforms  that the minority supported--then, by definition, the Bank's money is  not benefiting the poor. If it is not benefiting the poor, how could  withholding a portion of it be punishing the poor?   For goodness' sake, let's honor the charity of the American  taxpayers. Let's not dishonor it. Let's honor it by actually making  reforms to the World Bank so that it can fulfill its important mission  and not undermine its important antipoverty mission.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Hensarling), the distinguished chairman of the full committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition  to the amendment, though I do not intend to oppose it.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman is recognized  for 5 minutes.   There was no objection.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, this amendment,  offered by the gentleman from Kentucky, Representative Barr, would make  changes to section 4 of the underlying bill dealing with opposing World  Bank assistance for governments that fail to enforce U.N. Security  Council sanctions against North Korea.   These changes are welcome and would bring this section of the bill in  line with a provision that was adopted on a bipartisan basis in the  Financial Services Committee as part of our commitment in the Otto  Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions Act.   Just as the bipartisan measure that was passed through our committee  included a clearly defined waiver authority, the amendment offered by  Representative Barr would add, in this same waiver, provisions to the  underlying bill. In doing so, the amendment not only makes section 4 of  the bill consistent with the approach used in  [[Page H452]]  other contexts, but, more importantly, it ensures that we allow the  President to waive the withholding of assistance for countries that  fall short in applying sanctions on North Korea when such failure is  due exclusively to a lack of capacity of the foreign government and the  foreign government is taking effective steps to prevent the failure  from recurring.   While I do not believe the underlying bill should become law in its  current form, I do believe we should take a consistent and thoughtful  approach to cutting off World Bank assistance to the poorest countries  that are unable to fulfill their U.N. Security Council obligations.  This amendment would address this concern.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for giving credit to Ms. Moore  for her work and her assistance with the work that was being done to  deny North Korea any kind of assistance from any of our allies, as I  understand it. This is not something that is done by the Republicans or  the Democrats. This is truly bipartisan. We all feel the same way about  North Korea, and we all feel that the sanctions should be honored. We  all feel that no country, in particular those countries that we are  supporting, in any way should do anything to give support to North  Korea.   In saying that, let me also point out that we don't come to this  floor with any kind of empty rhetoric, talking about all of those  countries are corrupt and somehow all of these countries in Africa and  other places that are very poor are somehow disregarding the fact that  the United States is being of assistance to them. Most of them know  that their lives oftentimes depend on our generosity. They love us and  support us. They want to emulate us.   They get a little bit confused when we have people who charge them  with being corrupt and irresponsible and noncaring and not having an  appreciation for what the citizens of the United States are doing for  them. That is not the kind of rhetoric that we need in order to enhance  our posture or our image with our constituents and have them believe  that we are saving them from these poor countries who are getting  taxpayer money and don't care about them. That is not true.   I cringe when I hear that kind of rhetoric on the floor of Congress.  I cringe when I hear us using our position, our influence, to send a  message that somehow we don't trust, we don't believe, we don't honor,  and we don't respect many of those very, very poor countries. We are  talking about 77 of the poorest countries in the world.   You will see ads on television, from time to time, of nonprofit  organizations that are trying to save the lives of little children who  are dying from malnutrition. You see them every night, and they tell  you: Send $21; send some money to this organization so we can save  these children who are dying because they don't have clean drinking  water, who are dying because they are victims of malaria, who are dying  because they don't have any healthcare whatsoever, living practically  outdoors. When we see these ads, many people are responding, joining in  with their government to show our humanitarianism and helping the least  of these.   I want us to take credit, but I want us be respectful. I want us not  to join in calling names. I want us to say to the President of the  United States: ``Don't keep doing this.'' I want to say to the Members  on the opposite side of the aisle: ``You are better than this, and you  don't need this for your reelection. You don't need this to send a  message to your citizens that you are saving them from poor, corrupt  countries.''   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).   The amendment was agreed to.
