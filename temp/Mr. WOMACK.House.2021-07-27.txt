 Madam Speaker, my thanks to the ranking member for the  time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this package of appropriations  bills.  [[Page H4049]]    As the ranking member of the Appropriations Financial Services and  General Government Subcommittee, I have great respect for my colleague,  Chairman   Mike Quigley. We work well together, and that is saying  something because he is a Cubs fan, and I am a Cardinal fan.   The bill we are debating today, Madam Speaker, is packed with  unjustifiable spending and ignores our unsustainable fiscal trajectory.   In light of unprecedented pandemic spending, it was my hope that this  fiscal year we would prioritize making the tough choices necessary to  chart a responsible fiscal path forward. Instead, the Financial  Services division of the bill proposes a 20 percent increase in  discretionary spending over fiscal year 2021 and numerous agencies  funded receive a double-digit percentage increase over last year.   Those numbers are unconscionable, Madam Speaker, when you consider  the fact that this country is well over $28 trillion in debt.   I noted with interest the comments of the overall chairwoman when she  talked about the moral test of government. Madam Speaker, to me the  moral test of government is for us to do our work and to take care of  the urgent needs of our country, but not burden future generations in  the course of doing so.   Furthermore, my colleagues on the other side continue to call for  trillions in new government spending, and a new GAO report came out  just recently that says more than $1 trillion of the spending that we  have commissioned through the coronavirus phenomenon remains unspent.  Not just that, this spending has created an inflationary spiral that is  affecting every taxpayer budget in my district.   There are also several controversial policy changes included in the  FSGG division, such as allowing D.C. tax dollars to fund abortions and  removing the prohibition on Federal employee health benefits funding  for abortions. These policy changes are no-goes and make this bill and  minibus, as a whole, dead in the water.   Again, I oppose this package of appropriations, including the  Financial Services division due to the radical increases in spending  and these partisan policies.   But, Madam Speaker, I do look forward to working across the aisle  with both my counterparts in the House and in the Senate to come up  with a bill and a compromise that will actually work for America.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Hern), my friend from Tulsa.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), who is all the way from Grandfather  Mountain, North Carolina, the ranking member on the Education and Labor  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert), a freshman from Silt,  Colorado.    Madam Speaker, it is a great pleasure to yield 1 minute  to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence) from Columbus, Indiana, and a  respected member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.  [[Page H4058]]         Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on  both sides.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), my friend who serves on the  Agriculture and Education and Labor Committees, from a city unlike any  other, Augusta, Georgia.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Hern).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining  on both sides.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, you have heard from Members of Congress from all  across our country, and there was a purpose in me identifying their  hometowns.   These are people who represent real American lives, and they are in  touch with their constituents on a daily basis, in Augusta, Georgia;  Tulsa, Oklahoma; Grandfather Mountain, North Carolina; Silt, Colorado;  Lincoln, Nebraska; Columbus, Indiana; and in my hometown of Rogers,  Arkansas. They all understand when the Federal Government is on a  spending spree because they feel it in their own pockets.   We are feeling it today with unrivaled inflation that is the result  of trillions of dollars of taxpayer money flowing into this economy.  The money that is going to the cities and counties, it was so much  money that we had to do it in two tranches. Some of it has gone out  this year, but there is so much that we have to wait until next year to  send out the remaining $185 billion or so--money that these counties  and cities didn't ask for and, in many cases, don't even need. In fact,  they are taking suggestions on how best to spend it.   Yet, here we are today, talking about a bloated discretionary bill  that is going to further burden future generations by adding to  deficits and debt.   Madam Speaker, the interest on our debt this year is going to  approach $350 billion. Let me say that again: $350 billion net interest  on the debt, which would pay for more than half of the titles that we  are debating here today of around $600 billion.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and rise in opposition for a number of reasons, some of which we will  detail in a more articulate way here as the debate continues. But  suffice it to say that we have thrown a lot of money at the economy of  the United States of America. While I realize that part of our function  in government is to fund the discretionary programs of the U.S.  Government--and that is an important function of our Committee on  Appropriations--we have seen the other side take the opportunity to  capitalize on a real crisis moment in our country, that being the  coronavirus phenomenon.   Trillions and trillions of dollars have gone out the door, fueling  inflation and creating real problems for people at home who are  experiencing rising costs in virtually everything that a consumer would  purchase, from gasoline to groceries. You name it, those costs are  escalating.   It is not for any reason other than the fact that we have poured  trillions and trillions of dollars into the economy while at the same  time these very same policies have caused a lot of people not to work.  We have incentivized this notion that they could stay at home and made  it more lucrative than actually going to work.   The people that we are going to ask to make things, build things, and  produce things are the very people that haven't been functioning. As a  result of that, the supply chain has been weakened. So, now, because of  simple supply and demand, there are fewer products, and those products  are going higher. As I say, simple supply and demand philosophies.   But here we are today, basically adding about 20 percent across the  spectrum of these seven titles of discretionary budget. A lot of these  are very, very good programs, programs that we have all supported in  the past. But with the amount of money that has gone to the coronavirus  phenomenon, and the fact that a lot of that money has not been spent--I  think the report this week by the GAO was $1 trillion of unobligated  funds out of coronavirus. Here we are, adding insult to injury by  compounding the problem by adding more to the nondefense discretionary  side of the budget.   Now, we will reserve the argument for a little later on what we are  doing to national security by not pumping dollars into national  security against the known threats that we have around the country. But  as I said, we will save that argument for another day.   We are going to argue and continue to argue that this is spending way  too much money. The American people know that. That is why there has to  be an adult voice in the room to bring these subjects to the light of  day, and that is what our purpose will be today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Issa), a distinguished Member--and may I say a freshman  Member, although he is a returning Member from before--a respected  member of Committees on Foreign Affairs and the Judiciary and the  former chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform in the  Congress of the United States.    Madam Speaker, as a testament to the gentleman's  amendment, I am a proud cosponsor of that particular amendment and I am  pleased that he has offered such.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good), who is a member of the Budget and Education and  Labor Committees.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time, Madam Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Valadao).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), my friend from Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, a  general, who is a very respected member of the Foreign Affairs and  Transportation and Infrastructure Committees.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I will just take the remaining few seconds of my time  just to say this. As an appropriator, I am not a big fan of how all of  this is being choreographed and structured, but I also recognize that  time is not on our side. People witnessing this event, probably are not  real sure what these en blocs are all about, but it is a simple way to  save a little bit of time.   Frankly, I think we ought to get back to regular order, where we can  have a full-throated debate, an open rule, if you will, and just talk  about each one of these very important issues one by one, and truly  represent the will of the American people. That is what the Congress is  here for. It was what it was built for.   However, I do recognize that given the political circumstances we are  in today, and the fact that we don't have a lot of time, that this is  what we are left with.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the en bloc and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I won't belabor the point that I made a  few minutes ago that I am not a big fan of this process, but there does  come a time in the process where we come to some agreement on things,  and I guess we are at that stage of the game.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pearland, Texas (Mr. Weber).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Tipton, Michigan, Michigan's Seventh District (Mr.  Walberg), a valued and respected member of the Education and Labor and  Energy and Commerce Committees.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from San Angelo, Texas (Mr. Pfluger), a very distinguished  member of the freshman class of this Congress, a member of the Foreign  Affairs and Homeland Security Committees. I am proud of his service to  our country in uniform as a pilot of that F-22.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished Republican leader of our  conference, all the way from Bakersfield, California.
