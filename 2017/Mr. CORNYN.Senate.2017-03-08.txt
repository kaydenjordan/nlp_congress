 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week our colleagues in the House  released a plan to clean up the mess left in the wake of the  ObamaCare's failed promises. The bill known as the American Health Care  Act represents the next step forward in keeping our promise to repeal  and replace ObamaCare, which continues to fail Texans and folks all  across the country.   Instead of helping more Americans and more Texans by providing more  healthcare choices, ObamaCare has actually led to dwindling insurance  options in a lot of counties across the country. In fact, it is  estimated that almost 40 percent of counties in Texas have just one  option on the exchange this year. It is hard to shop, it is hard to  compare, and it is hard to get the benefits of competition when there  is only one option because of ObamaCare.   So that is actually the opposite of what the President and the  advocates for the Affordable Care Act promised. That is what happens  when government interferes with the market and  [[Page S1658]]  takes a one-size-fits-all approach to our Nation's healthcare. The fact  of the matter is that the path that President Obama put us on is not  sustainable. It is hurting families and burdening job creators and is  taking a tremendous toll, and Americans are paying the price.   I know some of our colleagues across the aisle are relishing the fact  that Republicans, the majority, are now taking this step to keep our  commitment to repeal and replace ObamaCare. They are sitting back and  hoping that we fail. But the fact of the matter is that we would be  having this debate no matter who won the Presidency last November 8,  because ObamaCare is in a meltdown mode. It is unsustainable, and we  would be dealing with our broken healthcare system no matter who won  the White House on November 8 of last year.   One of my constituents wrote me earlier this year about her daughter.  She said that before ObamaCare, back when she could choose the policy  that she wanted, she was paying about $190 a month for health  insurance, and she had a $500 deductible. Well, that sounds pretty  reasonable--not great, but not terrible either. Then came ObamaCare.  Now her daughter, who unfortunately lost her job in the interim, must  pay almost $400 a month with a deductible that is more than $6,000. I  don't know many people who can write a check for $6,000 when they have  an unexpected healthcare crisis. So in essence, she is being forced to  self-insure and has been denied the benefit of even the insurance that  she has, even though her premium has gone up more than double, and, of  course, her deductible is now $6,000.   So to our friends across the aisle who seem to be relishing this  moment where we are actually undertaking the hard work of working  through a repeal and replacement program, I would say to them that  ObamaCare is certainly no gold standard. It is the opposite of what we  need to help our Nation's healthcare woes. There is no doubt that it is  a failed piece of legislation, full of empty promises, and one we have  to scrap.   So with the American Health Care Act, starting today in the House of  Representatives, we will repeal ObamaCare and deliver better, more  affordable healthcare choices to the American people.   This bill actually also improves Medicaid. That is another big part  of what ObamaCare did. It forced more people onto Medicaid, which is  frankly not the best quality healthcare insurance or coverage that  exists.   I remember back during the ObamaCare debate, I actually introduced an  amendment in the Finance Committee saying that if Congress passed  ObamaCare, Members of Congress needed to be put on Medicaid--my theory  being, not that it was such great coverage, but that if Members of  Congress were on Medicaid, we sure would take every step necessary to  actually improve it and make sure it works.   But this legislation actually does improve Medicaid and puts it on a  sustainable path for the future by working with the Governors, because  Medicaid is a shared Federal-State responsibility. But right now, it is  growing by leaps and bounds. It is at the consumer medical inflation  rate plus two, which means it is growing much faster than the economy  and, unfortunately, putting unprecedented burdens on our State  governments. For example, I know, talking to some Texas legislators,  they said it is easily the second--and, if they weren't careful, the  largest--expense item in the Texas State budget--Medicaid, or the State  share of Medicaid.   Of course, Medicaid was designed to help the most vulnerable in our  communities and enjoyed broad bipartisan support. Along the way, it  became less about serving those who needed it and more about unchecked  government spending, as I mentioned a moment ago. So what the American  Health Care Act does is it actually puts Medicaid on a budget. It  doesn't cut current spending in Medicaid; it just says that it will  grow at a slower rate, and it sends much of the authority to work out  the best healthcare delivery systems to our State Governors and  legislators. It gives States more flexibility along the way so they can  use resources to serve the specific needs of their citizens. I know in  my State we frequently will come to Washington and ask the Health and  Human Services Department and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services, or CMS, for a waiver so we can actually use the Medicaid  money and to spend it most effectively--to build either a medical home  or to deal with chronic diseases, or some other flexibility we need in  order to deliver quality healthcare to our constituents. But the gall  of having to come to Washington, DC, and asking permission on how to  spend your own money is just too much.   I believe, actually, the American Health Care Act is the most  significant entitlement reform in decades. That is something we should  all applaud--putting Medicare and Medicaid on a more sustainable path,  not continuing to spend money that we don't have, and racking up annual  deficits and adding to our national debt, which now is in the $20  trillion range, with no end in sight.   Both Federal and State governments spend a significant amount of  money on Medicaid every year. As I indicated, last year nearly one- third of the Texas budget was dedicated to Medicaid. The fact of the  matter is that when the States have to spend so much of the money they  tax and collect on Medicaid, then, it is unavailable for other  important purposes--law enforcement, education, and the like. There is  a crowding-out effect. By responsibly reforming Medicaid, the States  and the Federal Government will benefit, all while helping Medicaid  work for the most vulnerable in our country and putting us on a path to  fiscal sustainability.   In addition to entitlement reform, this bill will also get rid of the  ObamaCare taxes that have led to hikes in premium costs, fewer options  for patients, and more redtape for job creators. I know, being in  Tyler, TX, for example, back after ObamaCare passed, and meeting with a  woman who said she was forced, actually, to work two jobs because her  employer laid her off of her full-time job, so as to come under the cap  necessary for the ObamaCare employer mandate. So, literally, this  single mother had lost her full-time job because of ObamaCare and was  forced to work two part-time jobs just to make up the difference in  income.    We will also, in this American Health Care Act, eliminate the  individual mandate. President Obama said when he ran for office back in  2008 that he was opposed to penalizing the American people if they did  not buy government-approved insurance, but of course he changed his  tune once he was sworn into office.   We will eliminate the individual mandate so people who don't want to  purchase a government-approved plan are not forced to buy a plan they  don't want and that they can't afford or else suffer a penalty. This  bill will also help families spend money on healthcare decisions that  make the most sense to them by giving them tools so they can manage  their healthcare expenses like health savings accounts.   The American Health Care Act is an answer to a promise we made and we  have made repetitively in the last three elections since ObamaCare  became the law of the land. I believe it is imperative we keep our  promise.   Some have said: Well, this is a difficult process. I agree. There are  a lot of different ideas that people have. I agree. That is a good  thing, but in the end, we have a binary choice. We can either keep the  status quo, which is in meltdown--which is ObamaCare--or we can pass  legislation which offers more choices at affordable prices to the  American people.   I believe the choice is very clear. It is a great opportunity to  reform our healthcare system and Medicaid and move healthcare decisions  away from Washington and back to the families, back in the States where  we all live, and back in the hands of patients and their doctors. I  look forward to working with my colleagues and the Trump administration  to make this a reality.   Again, the choice is between the status quo, which is unacceptable,  which is not working, or a better way. I, for one, choose a better way:  more choices at a price consumers can afford.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).    Mr. President, this week, we remember the brave men of  Texas who gave so much to preserve freedom in the Pacific and survived  the greatest horrors of World War II. Soldiers of 2nd Battalion, 131st  Field Artillery Regiment from Camp Bowie, TX, a Texas National Guard  unit, were fighting alongside Australian forces on Java, an island in  Indonesia, against invading Japanese forces. On March 8, 1942 the  Americans and their Australian allies were captured by the Japanese. A  report was never filed by the Japanese to identify the captured unit.  As a result, the Texas soldiers had disappeared and were dubbed ``the  Lost Battalion.''   They were combined with survivors of the USS Houston, CA-30, which  had been sunk in the Battle of Sunda Strait on March 1, 1942, and  dispersed to POW labor camps located in Burma, Thailand, and Japan to  work as slave laborers. They worked on the Burma-Siam Death Railway,  building a railroad through the jungle and into the coal mines, docks,  and shipyards in Japan and other Southeast Asian countries. For 42  months, the men of 2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery and the USS  Houston suffered together through humiliation, degradation, physical  and mental torture, starvation, and horrible tropical diseases, with no  medication.   Five hundred and thirty-two soldiers of the battalion, along with 371  survivors of the USS Houston were taken prisoner. As many as 163  soldiers died in captivity, and of those, 133 are estimated to have  died working on the railroad.   In August of 1945, after 42 months of captivity and forced labor, the  survivors of 2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery Regiment and the  survivors of the USS Houston were returned to the United States. March  8, 2017, marks the 75th year since their capture on the island of Java,  and these soldiers deserve to be remembered for their heroic service  and sacrifices in the Pacific theater of battle.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
