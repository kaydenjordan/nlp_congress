 Mr. Speaker, I am here to speak on the importance of Title  X Family Planning programs and to condemn the Trump administration's  misguided efforts to prevent patients from making fully informed health  decisions.   This week, the House will begin to reverse years of deep funding cuts  to this vital program, a slash-and-burn approach that has had drastic  impacts on the health of women and families.   Consider this: 7 years of Republican cuts left 1.2 million without  access to proper care.   This is shameful.   I am proud to have led, with the support of more than 190 of my  colleagues, the effort to urge the Appropriations Committee to include  $400 million for the Title X Family Planning program in fiscal year  2020.   Nearly 4 million people struggling to make ends meet, including  people of color, LGBTQ people, immigrants, and people in underserved  rural communities, receive care at Title X centers.   We must support the health of millions of Americans by supporting  Title X and preventing States from discriminating against potential  Title X providers.                            ____________________
