 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the late  Jesse Gomez and his lovely wife, and good friend of mine, Rosemarie  Gomez.   Jesse was elected East Chicago city councilman in 1963, making him  the first person of Hispanic descent to be elected to political office  in East Chicago. Jesse's time in office opened political doors for the  Hispanic community throughout the city and northwest Indiana.   Jesse's wife, Rosemarie, was elected to replace him on the council,  making her the first Hispanic female to serve in political office in  East Chicago. Rosemarie dedicated much of her time to the East Chicago  Public Library, volunteering countless hours to help support readers  and future leaders. Rosemarie was also very proud to help decorate an  annual Mexican-themed Christmas tree for the library's ``Christmas  Around the World'' exhibit.   Madam Speaker, our Nation's success is reliant upon the rich heritage  and cultural diversity of its people, including the extraordinary  contributions of citizens such as Jesse and Rosemarie Gomez.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for this time.   Madam Speaker, throughout my career, I have witnessed the direct,  positive impact of programs and shelters such as the St. Jude House in  Crown Point, Indiana, and the Haven House in Hammond, Indiana, which  provide hope and resources for survivors and help prevent and protect  against domestic violence. That is why I rise today in strong support  of H.R. 2119, the Family Violence Prevention Act and Services  Improvement Act.   The increase in domestic partner violence is alarming, particularly  as many individuals have lost valuable resources to aid them due to the  pandemic and are forced to remain in close quarters with their abusers.  As an administrator of emergency assistance for 15 years, I remain  deeply concerned about the mental, physical, and emotional trauma  survivors and their children endure.   As one of the most effective Federal investments in preventing  domestic violence, Congress must pass this measure to reauthorize and  improve family violence and prevention service programs.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the leadership of Chairman Scott,  Representative McBath, and the Education and Labor Committee, and I  encourage my colleagues to support this measure.
