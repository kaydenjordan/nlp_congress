 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on  this issue. It is an honor for me to serve on the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act. This is a historic opportunity to reject the status quo and  provide real tax relief to the families, individuals, and businesses in  my district.   America's Tax Code is broken. It is uncompetitive for American  companies, and it is unfair to American workers. The American people  deserve a Tax Code that works for them, not one that works for special  interests in Washington. They deserve a Tax Code that rewards their  lifetime of hard work, not one that squeezes and depletes their  savings.                                time  1045    They deserve a Tax Code that prioritizes their goals, not penalizes  their success.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act creates a Tax Code that is focused on  growth, fairness, and a booming economy for everyone.   The reforms in this bill level the playing field for small businesses  in my district in north Texas around the DFW Airport, giving them an  opportunity to grow and hire more people and spend more money in our  economy, and allow the hardworking taxpayers whom I represent to keep  more of their paycheck and increase their family's budget.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for allowing me to represent the  views of my constituents throughout the process of the committee work.  I urge my colleagues to take advantage of this very historic  opportunity and vote in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
