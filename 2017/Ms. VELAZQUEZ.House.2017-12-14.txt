 Mr. Speaker, let me take this opportunity to thank  Ranking Member Waters for her extraordinary leadership on these issues.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2396, the Privacy  Notification Technical Clarification Act.   This bill claims to amend the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to exempt  vehicle finance companies from providing customers with annual privacy  statements if the company hasn't released recently changed its policies  and practices and the company makes its policy available online.   But this bill goes far beyond providing a small exemption and  tailored flexibility to captives and vehicle finance companies, as the  proponents of this bill will have you believe, and something I am  really ready to support. This bill will exempt all financial  institutions from providing customers with annual privacy notices.   As currently drafted, under the bill, financial institutions such as  payday lenders, check cash servicers, and large institutions like Wells  Fargo are exempted from providing annual privacy notices and are  unconstrained on who they can share their customers' personal  information with. This goes far beyond the original intent of the bill.   As we have seen in the growing number of data breaches at companies  like Equifax, the protection of consumers' personal information is  something Congress must consider carefully.   While I continue to think that it makes sense for captive auto  finance companies to have some degree of flexibility, to the extent  they only share customers' personal information with the dealership,  this legislation is far too broad.   Mr. Speaker, to that end, I ask my colleagues to oppose this measure.
