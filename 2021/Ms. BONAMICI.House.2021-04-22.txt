 Mr. Speaker, in Northwest Oregon, raging wildfires have  made the air unhealthy to breathe. Ocean acidification, harmful algal  bloom, and hypoxia threaten our fisheries. Droughts and extreme weather  patterns jeopardize the livelihoods of our farmers.   But there is hope. By recognizing the scale and urgency of the  climate crisis, we can take meaningful action to address it.   Today, the Biden-Harris administration is convening a group of world  leaders to commit to ambitious action. We stand ready to work with them  to enact policies that reduce emissions, create jobs, and support  frontline communities.   Last year, I joined my colleagues on the Select Committee on the  Climate Crisis in releasing our bold, comprehensive, science-based  Climate Action Plan to reach net-zero emissions no later than mid- century, and net-negative thereafter. It includes bills like my  bipartisan Blue Carbon for Our Planet Act, which I am reintroducing  today, to help capture the power of the ocean and coastal ecosystems in  mitigating the climate crisis.   The Climate Action Plan is our road map. Now, on this 51st  anniversary of Earth Day, we must all reaffirm our commitment to the  Earth and to taking bold action to solve the climate crisis.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today, joined by my colleagues  from the Oregon congressional delegation and others, to announce the  passing of our esteemed former colleague, Congresswoman Elizabeth  Furse, who represented the First District of Oregon--the district I am  honored to represent--from 1993 to 1999.   Congresswoman Furse was not only a friend, but a mentor. My first  experience volunteering for a political campaign was during her  reelection in 1994. She inspired dedication to worthy causes, including  cofounding the Oregon Peace Institute. She embodied the traits public  servants should strive to uphold, to meet the needs of their community  and drive meaningful change.   Our world, especially northwest Oregon, is a better place because of  Elizabeth's tireless devotion to improving the lives of those around  her.   On behalf of the Oregon delegation and all who served with Elizabeth  and all who are present, I express our sincere condolences to her  family and friends. I ask that the House observe a moment of silence in  her memory.                            ____________________
