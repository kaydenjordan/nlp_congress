 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Mexico  for yielding. I appreciate her leadership on this issue, and, as a  cosponsor, I rise in strong support of this amendment.   Our Customs and Border Patrol officers face a difficult mission in an  extremely challenging environment. Polygraph testing is an important  tool to ensure those charged with patrolling our border are not  corruptible by drug traffickers or other criminal elements.   I am sympathetic to the hiring and staffing challenges facing this  agency, but we cannot cut corners or jeopardize the security of our  border.   This amendment delays the implementation of this legislation until  CBP can complete its ongoing test of an alternative, more efficient  polygraph test.   This amendment also requires DHS determine these changes in the  underlying bill to our polygraph procedures do not endanger our  national security.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to  ensure we do not create unnecessary risks to the security of our  border.   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1  minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong  disapproval of President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States  from the international Paris Agreement on global climate change. The  world is watching us, and history will judge this ill-considered  decision harshly.   Withdrawing from the accord weakens America's global leadership, will  slow our transition to renewable sources of energy, and make it more  likely the clean energy jobs of tomorrow will be created overseas  rather than here at home.   Let me be clear: Climate change is real and a present threat. America  can and should be the global leader in developing innovative solutions,  but this decision leaves us as an international outlier.  [[Page H4690]]    I am proud my hometown, Chicago, joins cities and States across the  country that have pledged to continue honoring the emission reductions  that are part of the Paris Agreement. That is why I am introducing a  resolution to commend these States and localities and to urge the  administration to reverse its position.   I invite my colleagues to join me. Irrespective of President Trump's  shortsighted policies, we must continue to seek solutions to protect  our planet for future generations.                            ____________________
