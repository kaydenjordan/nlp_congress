 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, what my amendment does is it eliminates  funding to the tune of $470 million for ARPA-E, Advanced Research  Projects Agency-Energy; $470 million.   What this Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy is designed to  fund are high-risk, high-reward projects in which the private sector  would never invest in.   Since it is taxpayers' money, what this proposed amendment does is to  cut funding because it doesn't do the job that the dollars that they  expended it to.   The problem is that ARPA-E does not always seem to follow its own  guidelines. The Federal Government has awarded several ARPA-E grants to  companies and projects that are neither high risk nor something that  private industry cannot support. In other words, they don't need the  crutch.   These problems with ARPA-E were identified by the GAO, the Department  of Energy Office of Inspector General, and the House Science, Space,  and Technology Committee.   Of the 44 small- and medium-sized companies that received an ARPA  award, the GAO found that 18 had previously received private-sector  investments for similar technology. It is a duplicate.   The GAO found that 12 of those 18 companies plan to use ARPA-E  funding to either advance or accelerate prior funded projects.   I am in the real estate business. That is like paying me double to  build you a house or a shopping center. How much sense does that make?  It doesn't.   Mr. Chair, in your world, it pays double to do one surgery. How does  that work out? It is taxpayers' money. It should never have been funded  in the first place.                                time  1930    High-risk, high-reward programs are not necessary, especially when  there is a bias to fund technologies that have already received funding  to make the program appear on the surface successful. Congress should  restructure the DOE to conduct the basic research that the private  sector would never undertake and create a system that allows the  private sector, using private funds, to tap into that research and  commercialize it. Federal labs should allow basic research to reach the  market organically.   Until that happens, we should defund ARPA-E, just as the Trump  administration did. The market is the best place to determine the merit  of an investment and whether it is a good or a bad investment. If a  project cannot find private support, it is a good indicator of its  prospects for success. Certainly, a lack of private investors alone  does not justify using taxpayers' money to support a project.   Indeed, technologies that lose private financing as they move closer  to commercialization are likely the worst bets for taxpayers' money,  since professional investors have already determined them to be losers.   What you find out on grants such as this, if you really analyze the  line items, it goes to overhead. What is overhead?   That is paying salaries of people with jobs that you can't have an  outcome for. I have seen these. That is why a lot of the grants that  are written are vague; they can use the money wherever. This isn't like  it is a $50,000 investment, it is $470 million.   At the time when our growing national debt has surpassed $33  trillion, we cannot continue to use taxpayers' dollars to fund this  useless research.   I think the last figure I heard one of my colleagues mention, that we  are paying $20,400 per second in interest on the $33 trillion. That is  just the interest, not counting the principal.   As I mentioned, ARPA-E does not follow its guidelines. It is loosely  interpreted. They can use the money wherever they want. My question is:  Why ARPA-E funding and not private capital?   If it is that good of a project, let the private sector invest in it.  You have sharp investors that know what they are doing, they could  determine whether they want to risk their capital.   In short, this project should be defunded. It is at a time we can't  afford it. I would urge the cut of this $470 million project, for  something that yields no benefit to the taxpayers, and I urge adoption.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
