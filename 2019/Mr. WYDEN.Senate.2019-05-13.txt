 Mr. President, today I have introduced the Retirement  Parity for Student Loans Act. This legislation would permit employers  to make matching contributions to workers under 401(k) and similar  types of retirement plans as if worker student loan payments were  salary reduction contributions to the retirement plan. This legislation  will help workers who cannot afford to both save for retirement and pay  off their student loan debt by providing them with employer  contributions to build their retirement savings. This legislation is a  common sense fix to our nation's laws that govern employer-sponsored  retirement plans and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1428         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
