 Madam Speaker, recovery is challenging and isolating even  during normal days, and this pandemic has only made it more difficult  for those who suffer from addiction and substance use disorder. That is  why National Recovery Month, this month,  [[Page H4537]]  takes on even greater meaning as many are navigating isolation and  distance from family and support networks.   National Recovery Month is personal for me and my family. My son,  Harry, is in long-term recovery from opioid addiction. Now he is  healthy, he is well, and he works now to help others who struggle with  substance abuse disorder.   In his work, he reminds me that, during the pandemic, so many have it  even tougher on the road to recovery. He reminds me that not all are as  fortunate as we have been, and we recognize National Recovery Month for  its importantly shining a light on this issue.   I call on us to dedicate more resources to support those suffering  with addiction and substance use disorder to live happy, rewarding,  healthy lives.   And for those suffering with substance use disorders: You are not  alone. There is hope.                            ____________________
