 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, the word  ``historic'' is probably overused at times. Really, it is a day like  today when the word ``historic'' is warranted.   For decades, politicians of both parties talked about giving Medicare  the ability to negotiate prescription drugs to bring down the costs for  seniors. Today, in this bill, we are doing it.   For decades, politicians talked about capping the amount of money  seniors paid every year on prescription drugs. Some in my district in  Philadelphia pay $5,000 a year, $10,000 a year. This bill caps it at no  more than $2,000 a year.   Again, for decades, politicians talked about the need to address  climate change and to make a large investment, so that we can finally  tackle this existential challenge for America and for the world. Here  in this bill we are doing it: the largest single investment to address  climate change in our Nation's history.   I know that on social media and on TV, it tends to be the  performative politics that get most of the attention, that helps breed  cynicism within our constituents. It is legislation like this that  makes a difference in people's lives. This is why we are here as  lawmakers: to do the people's business.
