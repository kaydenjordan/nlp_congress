 Mr. Speaker, according to recent data from my district,  the number one concern of my constituents is the Biden border crisis.  Let me repeat that: The number one concern of my constituents in North  Carolina is the crisis at our southern border, over 1,600-miles away.   It is beyond clear that the response by the Biden administration has  not simply been weak; it has also been counterproductive. Americans  nationwide are sensing what the international community has known for  the past 6 months: Our leaders are not strong, our border is open, and  America is ripe for the taking.   Fifteen hundred illegal immigrants cross into our country daily  without ever being tracked, according to border data. Two Yemeni men on  a terror watchlist were just apprehended at the border, and this  administration has turned a blind eye to one of our biggest national  security crises in recent history.   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed, because it seems that the political  maneuvering of one select class has co-opted the good of the people.  What can we, as individual Americans, do in the face of such abject  disregard for our well-being? We can speak out.                            ____________________
