 Madam Speaker, it is difficult to find words after what  has unfolded before our eyes and the eyes of the American people these  last few days, and it has gotten worse the last few days.   So today, I rise in defense of children on this House floor to demand  of this House and, more importantly, the Trump administration to end  this cruel exploitation of children by separating them from their  families, by tearing children from their moms, and what appears to be,  no doubt, a very craven political tactic by President Trump to try to  hold hostage children to get other draconian items done on his  immigration bill.   This tactic is fueled by some very ugly things that the American  people have to reject. It is fueled by bigotry. It is fueled by hatred.  It is fueled by fearmongering and is now being fueled by the  endangerment of children.   As a father, as a grandpa, I cannot believe how we are debasing our  Nation's moral traditions, how we are replacing our sacred values with  autocratic comments and rhetoric from the President.   Mr. President, no more lies, no more child hostages. End this now.  You can, and for our Nation's sake and for the children's sake, this  needs to be done.    I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Gomez),  my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois  (Ms. Schakowsky), my good friend.
