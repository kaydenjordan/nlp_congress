 Madam Speaker, today I rise to mark Global  Entrepreneurship Week, where all across the globe cities will be  hosting events that will inspire millions to explore their potential as  an entrepreneur while fostering connections and increasing  collaborations within their communities.   Small businesses and entrepreneurs are the engines of our economy in  Arkansas and across our country. They support millions of jobs in this  Nation. They create and support jobs within their local communities and  employ approximately half the private-sector workers in the United  States.   As a co-chairman and founder of the House Entrepreneurship Caucus, I  am proud to celebrate the visionary men and women who boldly pursue  their passion to build the growth businesses that fuel our economy.   The United States has served as a global beacon of innovation,  delivering remarkable new products and services that improve the lives  of all Americans. Today, over 99 percent of U.S. employers are small  businesses that create 57 million jobs that generate 44 percent of our  economic activity.   The spirit of the startup is built into our American DNA. Our country  is home to the world's greatest inventions, companies, and  technological advances because we believe that anyone with a good idea  and determination can build a business that changes the world.  [[Page H9160]]    The House Entrepreneurship Caucus believes in empowering the pursuit  of America's innovators by removing the barriers that make it harder to  start a business in this country.   Over the past four decades, I have had a long career focused on  different aspects of entrepreneurship and technology. Back in 1980, I  helped start a payment system innovator in the banking industry, a  company that became PULSE, the largest shared ATM/POS system in the  Southwest. PULSE is now owned by Discover.   I didn't know it at the time, as a young person, but I was an  entrepreneur. I took a leave from a public company that I worked for  and helped start an innovative financial technology business that  really changed the face of banking in Texas in those years.   Likewise, later in the late 1980s and early 1990s, I served as Deputy  Assistant Secretary for Corporate Finance at the Treasury. There,  working with my colleagues at the Commerce Department, we focused on  how to make American companies more competitive.   How do we lower barriers to our global competitiveness? That was a  key moment at that time, given the world in the late 1980s, with  amazing increases in foreign competition from Asia and from Europe.   Also, how do we reduce the barriers for investment in technology  companies, something that, now, America, again, 30 years later, is so  well known for? And yet, still investing in technology, whether it is  biotech or Silicon Valley or in the worldwide web investing, that is  still a challenge to come up with the right number of dollars to  support investing in technology, where you don't have traditional  assets.   So throughout my career, I have tried to lead in looking for  solutions to build our entrepreneurship and build our business  ecosystem, and I have had the pleasure to work in a variety of  different industries.   As a chamber chairman and as a community banker, I led the way in my  hometown of Little Rock to improve our ecosystem by supporting the  BioVentures incubator at the University of Arkansas medical campus,  support the creation of a venture center. These are all things that I  have seen help create a spirit of entrepreneurship in not only Little  Rock, but across the country.   Perhaps Steve Case has said it best. By creating an environment where  there is the rise of the rest, where technology, entrepreneurship,  business startups are not limited to the West Coast or the East Coast  of the United States, but are spread across all of our towns and  communities in a better way, things like the innovation hub or the  program called the Conductor are bringing to middle America the kinds  of entrepreneurship talents and abilities that we need.   But the most things that a startup business needs, more than anything  else besides capital, is to take that idea and have a good set of  mentors or advisers. That is something that, again, the Conductor and  the innovation hubs in our small business development centers across  the country help create, that local community entrepreneurship culture.   Now, since joining Congress some 4\1/2\, almost, now, 5 years ago, I  have continued to focus my work to expand the flow of capital, reduce  barriers to business startups and business growth, and consistently,  Madam Speaker, I have tailored my thoughts in the following key areas  that Federal policy can influence entrepreneurship:   We need to tailor regulatory regimes for businesses. We need to be  very sensitive about the regulatory burden to a startup or to a small  business or to a mom-and-pop.   We need to lower taxes for capital investment and capital gains  taxation to encourage long-term investments, and some of the changes  that we made in the 2017 tax bill reflect that.   Lowering taxes on investment, encouraging investments in opportunity  zones, encouraging long-term capital investment, returning capital to  the United States, all this creates a better entrepreneurship  environment.   We want to mitigate barriers for companies that want to go public,  that want that ultimate recognition of raising capital on the public  markets.   Over the last three decades, we have seen the number of public  companies fall, Madam Speaker, dramatically, and we want to know what  are the barriers that are causing fewer companies to go public in our  country.   We want to reward innovation.   We want to make sure Federal policies streamline efficiencies and  compliance for our business.   And, finally, we want to make sure that credit is available equally  across this great country.   In furtherance of these ideals, I would like to highlight the work of  the Kauffman Foundation and their new report just released, ``America's  New Business Plan.''   The Kauffman Foundation is a leader in this field and recently formed  the ``Start Us Up'' coalition, in collaboration with over 100  entrepreneurship advocacy groups, to address many of the issues that I  have touched on and am discussing today.   America's New Business Plan outlines four key principles that are  necessary to support entrepreneurship and business development:   Number one, opportunity: a level playing field and less red tape.  When it comes to starting a business, entrepreneurs need a level  playing field to compete with larger, more established enterprises.   Number two, funding: equal access to the right kind of capital--not  just bank loans, but also venture capital. The idea of an innovation  grant, called an SBIR, the opportunity to raise angel capital or  venture capital.   Number three, knowledge: the know-how to start a business, including  understanding the requirements and barriers that come with turning an  idea into reality.   Having been engaged in so many emerging companies and startup  companies over my career, that is always that strict assessment that an  entrepreneur, a visionary, a startup company owner really needs,  perspective: perspective on what are the requirements needed to start  your business and any barriers that would make it difficult, and having  a realistic plan to deal with that.   And the fourth key area that Kauffman outlines is support: the  ability for all to take risks, while having the proper support after  becoming an entrepreneur and leaving behind that stability of a  traditional job and that paycheck every 2 weeks and the benefits that  come with it.   That is why I emphasize those four areas are so key.   The University of Arkansas at Fayetteville recently established their  Startup Village to address a few of these issues by providing students  and the community entrepreneurs with the resources and support needed  early in the process to help them launch their own business and pursue  happiness.   I know how important it is to have a wide range of funding options  that I have talked about. In central Arkansas, I am proud to note that  private equity has created over 1,600 jobs and invested more than $2  billion just in the last 5 years, demonstrating that Steve Case is  right, that all communities can share in this prosperity if they have  that right ecosystem.   Specifically, to push some of these ideals, I have supported  different causes and different legislation in this House that I want to  highlight during Global Entrepreneurship Week.   First, we formed the Entrepreneurship Caucus to address these issues  and have our support in the House of job creators across this country.  We did that in conjunction with the United States Senate, which also  has started an Entrepreneurship Caucus. It is led by Senator Klobuchar  and Senator Scott. I was pleased to, here in the House, have my  colleagues join me from House Financial Services, House Ways and Means,  and House Small Business.   To start it, we had my colleagues--Congressmen Foster, Chabot, Murphy  of Florida, Schweikert, and Veasey--all coming together with an idea  that we will be a voice to create, I would say, an ability to watch for  legislation in this House that may have either a positive effect on  capital formation and business formation or a deleterious effect.   Number two, we have introduced the Enhancing Entrepreneurship for the  21st Century Act.   As a part of this caucus work, I have introduced legislation with the  co-chairs that directs the Secretary of  [[Page H9161]]  Commerce to conduct a comprehensive study into the underlying economic  factors driving the decline in rates in entrepreneurship. Senators  Klobuchar and Scott have introduced a Senate companion of this bill, as  well.   I also introduced with my friend, Representative Schweikert from  Arizona, a bill that I saw was a big help to people starting a  business, and I call it the Fair Investment Opportunities for  Professional Experts Act. What this does is it changes the definition  of an accredited investor.   Right now, Madam Speaker, you have to invest in a private business to  participate in a venture capital idea, to go into what the SEC calls a  reg D private placement offering. You have to be an accredited  investor. You have to have a certain net worth. You have to have a  certain income.   For many people, that discriminates against their ability to lead a  company, invest in a company in which they have terrific expertise. So  this bill simply says that professional expertise can also count to  that definition of an accredited investor, and it is not limited to  just high net worth individuals.   Additionally, I have cosponsored legislation called Helping Startups  Continue to Grow Act. This extends that regulatory balance, those  compliance costs. It reduces those for emerging growth companies from 5  years up to 10 years.                                time  1345    This is where companies that are just growing, accessing capital  through the public markets, have a lower regulatory burden now for 10  years rather than 5.   So those are some of the key things that we are doing in these first  few days of the House Entrepreneurship Caucus. I encourage all of my  colleagues to get involved, whether they are entrepreneurs or not, if  they have that entrepreneurial spirit, or if they believe that we  should limit the government's red tape in bogging down innovative  Americans from starting their business.   According to the Kauffman Foundation, 79 percent of new business  owners feel they did not have that kind of support from government when  they started their business.   The House Entrepreneurship Caucus was created to attack that issue  and identify comprehensive efforts on how to answer to these problems  that have limited business formation and make it easier to start a  business.   Working with entrepreneurs, business leaders, and economists to  identify the root causes of what the Kauffman Foundation calls the  current startup slump is a critical step to unleashing a new  generation, a new wave of business growth in this country.   Having effective policies in place to encourage innovation can make  all the difference in the world for the entrepreneur in their first few  years of a new endeavor.   I am working hard to create that environment where all Americans are  empowered to boldly pursue their passions and build a business that can  change the world. Supporting innovators and new business founders is a  mission that is not a partisan one. And with our voices, both Democrat  and Republican in this new caucus, it won't be.   Commending Arkansas Department of Human Services for Addressing Mental                               Health Issues     Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the  Arkansas Department of Human Services for taking action to address the  urgent need for better mental healthcare by establishing a support line  to connect Arkansans to low-cost mental health and substance abuse  services.   Far too many Americans, about one in five, are suffering from some  form of mental illness, a problem that has disrupted too many families,  caused too much violence and pain, and cost far too many lives.   Untreated, mental health disorders and substance abuse have resulted  in countless tragedies in our country, including over 45,000 lives lost  to suicide and 70,000 lives lost to drug overdoses, both in 2017 alone.   We all must work together and continue to move forward in addressing  the issue of mental health and mental health access and do what we can  to save the lives of all American citizens and reverse this deadly  trend of suicides and overdoses.   The Arkansas support line is now live. If you or a loved one need  mental health or substance abuse services, please share this number and  call the DHS mental healthcare support line at 1-844-763-0198.   Recognizing the Arkansas Chapter of the American Foundation for Suicide                                 Prevention     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  good work of the Arkansas chapter of the American Foundation for  Suicide Prevention and to call attention to this topic that is so  important throughout our Nation.   Since I came to Congress, I have met with Arkansas American  Foundation for Suicide Prevention members, their families, and  recently, Tyler West and Christopher Epperson. This week I cosponsored  H.R. 4194, the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, in honor of  them, and for so many like them and their families that have been  affected by suicide and hope that we can reduce suicides nationwide.   This bill would designate 988 as the universal telephone number for  the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, making it just as simple as  dialing 911 for emergency help.   I want to thank my friend and colleague, Representative Chris  Stewart, for introducing this vital legislation. We all must work  together and do what we can to save the lives of our fellow citizens  and reverse this deadly trend.   I look forward to the day we vote on this House floor to make 988  that lifesaving number.           Congratulating Vinh Long on a New Manufacturing Facility     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize and  congratulate Vinh Long on opening their new manufacturing facility in  Morrilton, Arkansas.   Vinh Long Import-Export Manufacturing Company is headquartered in  Vinh Long, Vietnam, and was started from a small weaving group for  local women in 1976.   It has now expanded into a multimillion-dollar international  operation. The company has grown to become one of Vietnam's largest  natural fiber manufacturers.   The new facility in Arkansas will have approximately 75 employees and  use local suppliers in the production of furniture and other household  goods for retailers in North America such as IKEA.   The company has invested more than $10 million in the Morrilton  facility, which is the first Vietnamese-based manufacturer to locate  operations in the United States. It is a pleasure to visit this new  facility, greet the team, and learn about their plans for manufacturing  in central Arkansas. I look forward to their continued success.                      Recognizing Bank On Arkansas Plus     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Arkansas' efforts toward helping residents gain financial independence  through the Bank On Arkansas Plus initiative. A statewide coalition of  financial institutions has partnered to form Bank On Arkansas Plus to  fight the unbanked individual, which are individuals, citizens that  don't have access to affordable, local banking services.   Madam Speaker, around 27 percent of Arkansans are considered  underbanked, and 1 in 10 Arkansas households have no bank account.    I want to thank my friend Darrin Williams, the chief executive  officer of Southern Bancorp and a founding partner in Bank On Arkansas  Plus.   Darrin and other Bank On partners provide checking accounts with no  overdraft fees, no minimum monthly balances, and access to a debit or  ATM card for all participants.   Financial security is a freedom that many people in the low-income  areas of our country may not be able to afford or may not be able to  have access to. And as a former community banker in Little Rock, I  commend Darrin, his team, and all of the participating financial  institutions for partnering to create Bank On.   This is such a worthwhile strategy to help all Arkansans have access  and opportunity to build savings and build wealth for themselves, and  to have financial independence.  [[Page H9162]]                Congratulating Harding University Librarian Jean Waldrop     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ms.  Jean Waldrop, librarian of Harding University, on receiving the Suzanne  Spurrier Academic Librarian Award.   This award is given--in memory of Suzanne Spurrier, the former  library director at Harding University--each year to the librarian who  exemplifies the spirit of outstanding service and is dedicated to the  professionalism that we expect from all librarians.   Miss Waldrop has been working at Harding's Brackett Library since  2006 and oversaw several areas of the library before becoming its  director. She has served as the secretary for ARKLink, a board member  for Amigos, and is currently serving on the White County Regional  Library System board and the Searcy Public Library board.   I would like to extend my congratulations to Jean Waldrop on  receiving this recognition and wish her much continued success.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 1:30 p.m.  tomorrow.
