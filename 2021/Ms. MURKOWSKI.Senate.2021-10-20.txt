 Mr. President, this afternoon I come to the floor to  recognize the life and the contributions  [[Page S7101]]  of a friend, an Alaskan, a gentleman: Chuck Bundrant. He was the  founder and the majority owner of Trident Seafoods and a fisherman who  really forever changed the seafood industry in Alaska.   Employing thousands of people across Alaska and the country and  processing hundreds of millions of pounds of finished seafood products  each year, Trident is the largest vertically integrated seafood  harvesting and processing company in North America today.   The company--and, really, by extension, Chuck Bundrant--has been  critical in giving the rest of the United States and the world a taste  of Alaska's delicious and, of course, sustainably managed wild seafood.   Chuck has a pretty interesting story. He didn't grow up in Alaska. He  didn't even grow up near the ocean. He was born in Tennessee. He was  raised there and in Indiana. He had initially hoped to pursue  veterinary medicine and enrolled in a pre-veterinary program at Middle  Tennessee State University.   But by the winter of 1961--19 years old; he has $80 in his pocket--he  and a few friends drove from Tennessee to Seattle with the thought that  they would make it up to Alaska. At that point in time, he didn't have  any experience, any exposure to the State. Apparently, he had watched  the John Wayne movie called ``North to Alaska,'' and that kind of  spurred him.   But he had heard that there were some pretty lucrative opportunities  within the fishing industry, but he also knew that finding a job wasn't  going to be an easy task. So, apparently, his buddies reconsidered the  merits of the trip, but Chuck doubled down and continued on his way to  the dream of working in The Last Frontier.   So, according to legend, he spent his first summer in the State  working wherever he could in the Bristol Bay fishing industry, even  sleeping under a boat on the docks. He eventually got a job busting  freezers--which, for colleagues, means literally banging metal pans to  knock loose the blocks of frozen shelled crab--and he was out on a  floating processor anchored near Adak out in the Aleutians.   Like so many who have the chance to come and visit Alaska, Chuck  wasn't satisfied with just one quick stint in the State. He turned his  journey north into a 12-year learning experience--and, really, a  lifelong business.   By 1965, he had worked his way up from the freezer hold to buying his  first crab fishing boat. As Chuck gained more experience in and  understanding of the crab fishery, he noticed that there was an  inefficiency in the way that the industry operated. After bringing in  the harvest, most fishermen would then head back to shore to hand it  off to the shoreside processing outfits, where the crab meat would be  removed from the shells and then sent to market. And just a lot of back  and forth here meant that the fisherman loses valuable time at sea. And  this is where Chuck's ingenuity really struck.   In the early 1970s, he and two other crab fishermen, Kaare Ness and  Mike Jacobson, used whatever collective earnings they had at that point  in time and they built the Billikin, which was a 135-foot boat with  both crab cookers and freezing equipment that allowed for immediate  onboard processing. So this was new. This was novel at the time.   Chuck pushed on. He kept fishing and processing on the Billikin.  There were protests from other Bering Sea crab fishermen who were in  the middle of a strike to secure better prices from processors. Around  this same time, he, Kaare, and Mike partnered with another individual,  Edd Perry and his Bellingham-based company San Juan Seafoods. And this  was, really, the beginning of Trident Seafoods in 1973.   Trident's early years coincided with a phaseout of foreign fleets  from the North Pacific harvest due to the enactment in 1976 of the  Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act--we know it as  the MSA--and, also, a burgeoning Japanese market for Alaska frozen  fish, salmon, and herring. So Chuck and his colleagues took advantage  of this opening. They built a fleet of mobile processing vessels that,  really, very quickly made their mark on Alaska fisheries.   Chuck's competitive, resourceful mentality, again, proved useful as  king crab numbers and harvest started to decline in the early 1980s. In  the seventies, he had watched giant Japanese, Korean, and Norwegian  trawling vessels rake in billions of pounds of pollock from the Bering  Sea. And then with the enactment of the MSA in 1976, it extended U.S.  fisheries jurisdiction to 200 miles offshore, giving American fishermen  priority access to stocks of abundant fish, like pollock, that  inhabited Alaska's coastal waters.   There was a significant market opportunity for pollock in Japan, but  in America at the time, pollock was kind of considered a junk fish, a  trash fish. And what is more, American boats and processors did not  have the equipment to harvest pollock, to extract its roe that was very  popular in Japan, and to transform its flesh into commonly consumed  surimi paste and fillets.   But Chuck saw things with a vision. He saw this as an opportunity and  not pollock as a trash or poor investment. He studied Japanese methods  for catching and processing pollock. He strategized about how Trident  could enter this market and, in 1981, he took a pretty bold move. He  built a plant on a very remote Aleutian island, Akutan, for onshore  processing of crab; salmon; and, of course, pollock.   So Chuck really took a risk there. He, after years of trying to  convince food wholesalers and restaurant owners to take a chance on  pollock, was able to secure a pretty pivotal deal between Trident and  Long John Silver's. This was the first major contract to bring the fish  to U.S. market. And this deal didn't take place in some fancy  restaurant in some major city. This deal took place out in Akutan--the  Akutan processing facility that he had taken this chance on back in  1981.   So companies like McDonald's, Burger King soon followed Long John  Silver's in replacing cod and whiting with very tasty, and now cheaper,  pollock. And these companies have grown to become some of Trident's  biggest customers. Odds are that if you have tried their fish and chips  or fish sandwiches, you have probably tried Trident product.   Today, Seattle-based Trident operates a fleet of 40 vessels,  including catcher processors, trawlers, crab boats, tenders and  freighters; 11 processing plants in Alaska--so good jobs in Alaska--5  processing plants in Washington State, Georgia, and Minnesota. It  offers a host of frozen, canned, smoked, and ready-to-eat seafood  products; and its harvest-and-business model means they know exactly  where its products come from. That is important to us.   But as Trident has grown and propelled the industry forward, Chuck  remains steadfast in his commitment that Trident remain a family  business that supports its employees and the independent fishermen that  it partners with. Chuck's son Joe now serves as the company's CEO. He  has continued his dad's efforts to seek out new value-added products  that can be created from Alaska fish.   It is always a good story, I think, to know of these very successful  businesses that keep grounded with the base from which they began; and  with Chuck, it was really important that his family continued to be  part of this success story.   I am told that Chuck had some pretty strict rules, that if any of his  grandkids--and I think he has about 13 of them--if any of them decide  that they want to work for the family business, you first have to earn  a college degree, which Chuck did not have; but they also had to spend  at least 4 years working someplace else other than Trident; and they  had to have cut their teeth and fished at least two summers in Alaska.   So he wanted to make sure that you weren't just going to get the job  just because you were a member of the family. You worked for it; you  knew what this was all about.   It really is difficult to overstate the impact that Chuck has had on  his fellow fishermen. Beyond the industry innovation that he drove, he  always sought to pay it forward, to offer younger fishermen the same  mentorship and support that allowed him to get his start in the 1960s  and the seventies and to make Trident the company that it is today.   And this dovetails, really, with Chuck Bundrant's commitment to  charitable giving. He was generous in so many, many different ways. He  [[Page S7102]]  raised and donated money for the victims of the Tohoku earthquake, the  tsunami in Japan, Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, and contributed  to multiple cancer research foundations.   I have certainly seen his generosity as he has shared in ways that  demonstrate his compassion, his care. His influence on the fishing  community is really clear from the outpouring of love and support that  he has received since he was diagnosed with an atypical form of  Parkinson's.   In September of 2019, four of the captains from the TV show the  ``Deadliest Catch''--all of whom considered Chuck a mentor, a friend,  and, really, an inspiration--co-hosted what they called Captains for a  CURE fundraiser. It was an auction for the northwest chapter of the  American Parkinson's Disease Association. They raised nearly $380,000  at the event, and this money goes towards a Parkinson's disease  research grant in Chuck's honor--again, trying to shine a light on the  specific form of disease that Chuck lived with.   I received a note from Joe Bundrant on Sunday, when Chuck Bundrant  passed from this Earth, and I wanted to share just a couple sentences  from a personal email. He says:         Dying is not easy, but Chuck was up to the task and faced       death on this earth as he faced rogue waves in Alaska: head-      on with dignity, determination and with the faith that he       would be safe in God's hands.    He goes on further to say that ``he lived each day fully, driven by  the values of integrity, loyalty, hard work and most importantly  faith.''   And so as I have reflected on the life of, really, an extraordinary  man, it strikes me that, at the end of the day, this individual, Chuck  Bundrant, was a family man, cared for his family deeply; but he, at the  base of it, was a fisherman. And he lived his life in a way that really  speaks to the values of integrity; loyalty; hard work; and, most  importantly, faith.   To his family, to his wife Diane: Know that our hearts are with you.  We thank you for sharing a truly honorable man with so many of us.   With that, I yield the floor.
