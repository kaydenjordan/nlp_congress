 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, the Speaker of the House is supposed to be the Speaker  of this entire House. And the entire will of this House on the  Democratic side and Republican side is to pass a DACA bill but we are  running out of time.   Instead of following the bipartisan consensus of the majority in this  House, this Speaker is yielding to the will of the majority party's  anti-immigration fringe unilaterally, and that fringe is led by this  President. If we continue to bend to this fringe, this body, this shiny  beacon on a hill, this hopefulness in this country will go dark.   The Senate was able to pass the bipartisan agreement due to the hard  promise of Leader McConnell and the good work of our Democratic  leadership as well to allow--simply allow--the body to vote on a DACA  bill. We, however, have no such commitment on this side.   22,000 dreamers in the State of New Jersey: they are doctors, they  are lawyers, they are connected to their churches, they are parents,  they are teachers, they are business owners. I spent time in a church  where a Christian, tithe-paying immigrant was taken from his family and  put in detention. He was not a threat to anyone.   My constituents did not send me here to deport young people who are  American and know no other country.   I ask you, I beg you, I implore you: Do your job. Save these  DREAMers, and until we do, I urge a ``no'' on this vote.
