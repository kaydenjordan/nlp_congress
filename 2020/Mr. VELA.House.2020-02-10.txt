 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise in support of S. 2107, the Protecting America's Food and  Agriculture Act of 2019. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  crucial bill.   I introduced this important legislation in the U.S. House of  Representatives with support from Members of both sides of the aisle.  This bipartisan bill authorizes the hiring of additional agricultural  specialists, agricultural technicians, and agricultural K-9 teams at  our international ports of entry and has the support of nearly one  dozen Governors and over 150 agriculture and trade stakeholders across  this country.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from Governors and  industry groups addressing their support for this bill.                                                      State of Utah,                                          Office of the Governor,                               Salt Lake City, UT, January 31, 2020.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Rogers,      Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Rogers: I       appreciate your work leading the House Committee on Homeland       Security. I write today in support of H.R. 4482, Protecting       America's Food & Agriculture Act of 2019. The bill would       authorize funding to hire additional Customs and Border       Protection (CBP) personnel to help conduct Agriculture       Quarantine Inspection services at the United States' ports of       entry.        Utah has a robust agricultural sector, including a pork       industry that is an important part of our state's economy. We       are genuinely concerned about the potential impact of       agricultural pests and diseases, including African Swine       Fever. The Fever has not yet impacted the United States, but       is wreaking havoc in other parts of the world and would pose       a significant threat to the U.S. pork industry.        Through regional and national partnerships, we spend       considerable effort as a state to detect and combat diseases       and prevent outbreaks. However we need the federal       government's support to prevent disease transmissions from       foreign sources.        Thank you again for your work, and please let me know if       can be helpful.            Sincerely,                                                   Gary R. Herbert,      Governor.                                   ____                                                   February 5, 2020.      Chairman Bennie G. Thompson,      House of Representatives, House Committee on Homeland           Security, Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Mike Rogers,      House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Rogers: We the       undersigned Governors request that the Committee on Homeland       Security swiftly report out without amendment H.R. 4482,       Protecting America's Food & Agriculture Act of 2019. This       bill authorizes funding to hire additional Customs and Border       Protection (CBP) personnel which are critically needed to       conduct Agriculture Quarantine Inspection services at the       Unites States' ports of entry. The Senate version of this       bill, S. 2107, has been approved by the Senate by unanimous       consent and we are hopeful that it will be placed on the       House suspension calendar.        The U.S. agriculture sector is vital to the American       economy, generating over $1 trillion in annual economic       activity. Threats to the vitality of American agriculture       present a danger to economic security at the local and state       level across our nation. Indeed, the U.S. Department of       Agriculture has calculated that foreign agricultural pests       and diseases already cost the American economy tens of       billions of dollars annually. We must vigilantly protect our       borders against diseases such as African Swine Fever (ASF),       which has killed more than one out of every four pigs on the       planet and would have a devastating impact on U.S. livestock       producers, their communities, and the economy if it were to       reach the USA.        CBP employees perform critically important agricultural       inspections every day at our nation's ports of entry. CBP       Agricultural Specialists play a vital role in both trade and       travel safety and preventing the introduction of harmful       foreign animal diseases such as ASF and exotic plant pests       into the U.S. CBP has been chronically understaffed at the       ports of entry and currently reports a deficit of 721       Agriculture Specialists. Passage of the Protecting America's       Food and Agriculture Act of 2019 will help close this gap by       authorizing the hiring of 240 CBP Agriculture Specialists and       200 CBP Agriculture Technicians each year until the staffing       shortage is closed.        The bill also authorizes the training and assignment each       year of 20 new Agricultural Canine Teams, which are valuable       assets in the detection of illicit fruits, vegetables and       animal products that otherwise may be missed during       inspections. These specially trained dogs have already       demonstrated their ability to sniff out agricultural products       that pose a danger. Finally, the bill authorizes supplemental       appropriations each year to pay for the activities of the       agriculture specialists, technicians and canine teams.        We ask that Congress authorize and fund the needed CBP       Agriculture Specialists, Canine Teams and support staff to       fully staff our international ports of entry. This investment       will significantly enhance mitigation of national security       threats, address public safety risks and grow the economy. We       urge you to quickly discharge S. 2107/H.R. 4482 without       amendments and advocate for its swift passage on the House       suspension calendar.            Sincerely,        Hon. Doug Burgum, Governor of North Dakota; Hon. Mike       DeWine, Governor of Ohio; Hon. Gary Herbert, Governor of       Utah; Hon. Asa Hutchinson, Governor of Arkansas; Hon. Bill       Lee, Governor of Tennessee; Hon. Brad Little, Governor of       Idaho; Hon. Henry McMaster, Governor of South Carolina; Hon.       Kristi Noem, Governor of South Dakota; Hon. Kim Reynolds,       Governor of Iowa; Hon. Pete Ricketts, Governor of Nebraska;       Hon. Kevin Stitt, Governor of Oklahoma.                                   ____                                                   January 22, 2020.      Chairman Bennie G. Thompson,      House of Representatives, House Committee on Homeland           Security, Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Mike Rogers,      House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Rogers: The       undersigned groups request that the Committee on Homeland       Security expeditiously report out, without amendment, H.R.       4482, Protecting Americas Food & Agriculture Act of 2019, a       bill authorizing funding to hire additional Customs and       Border Protection (CBP) personnel needed to conduct       Agriculture Quarantine Inspection at the international ports       of entry. The Senate version of this bill, S. 2107, was       recently approved by the Senate by unanimous consent.        The U.S. agriculture sector is a crucial component of the       American economy, generating over $1 trillion in annual       economic activity. According to the U.S. Department of       Agriculture, foreign pests and diseases cost the American       economy tens of billions of dollars annually. CBP employees       perform critically important agricultural inspections every       day at the nation's ports of entry. CBP Agricultural       Specialists play a vital role in both trade and travel safety       and prevent the introduction of harmful foreign animal       diseases and exotic plant pests into the U.S. Diseases such       as African Swine Fever, which has killed more than one out of       every four pigs on the planet, would have a devastating       impact on U.S. livestock producers, their communities, and       the economy if introduced into the U.S.        For years, CBP has been chronically understaffed at U.S.       ports of entry. The most recent results of CBP's Agriculture       Specialist Resource Allocation Model (AgRAM) shows a need for       an additional 721 Agriculture Specialists. Passage of the       Protecting America's Food and Agriculture Act of 2019 would       authorize CBP to hire 240 Agriculture Specialists and 200       Agriculture Technicians each year until the staffing shortage       determined by AgRAM is remedied. The bill also authorizes the       training and assignment each year of 20 new Agricultural       Canine Teams, which have proven valuable in detecting illicit       fruits, vegetables, and animal products that may have       otherwise been missed in initial inspections. These specially       trained dogs are already being utilized by CBP to sniff out       potentially contaminated products. Finally, the bill       authorizes supplemental appropriations each year to pay for       the activities of agriculture specialists, technicians, and       canine teams.        We ask Congress to authorize and fund the needed CBP       Agriculture Specialists, Canine Teams, and support staff at       the international ports of entry to guard against national       security threats, address public safety risks, and grow the       economy. To achieve this goal, we urge you to quickly       discharge S. 2107 /H.R. 4482 without amendment and push for       its swift passage in the House.

The U.S. agriculture sector is crucial to our economy and  generates more than $1 trillion in annual economic activity.   In 2017, Texas farms sold $24.9 billion in agricultural products, a  significant contribution to the State's economy. However, with  increasing levels of trade, threats to the United States' agricultural  sector are growing. Foreign pests and diseases cost our economy tens of  billions of dollars per year.   Agricultural specialists at our ports of entry intercept thousands of  invasive pests and prevent the introduction of foreign animal diseases,  such as the African swine fever, into the United States, protecting our  natural resources and our economy.   Unfortunately, a shortage of agricultural specialists exists at our  U.S. ports of entry, which is why this legislation is so important.  This bill would ensure that we have enough agricultural specialists,  technicians, and K-9 teams to adequately perform agricultural  quarantine inspections at our international ports of entry.   I ask my colleagues to support swift passage of the Protecting  America's Food and Agriculture Act of 2019. I thank my colleague,  Senator Peters, for his collaboration on this crucial bill and our  Texas colleagues in the Senate, Senators Cornyn and Cruz, and  Representative Crenshaw for their leadership in this effort.
