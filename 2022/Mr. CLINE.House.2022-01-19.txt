 Madam Speaker, high school athletics play an important  role in the lives of so many young people in the communities that they  live in, which is why I have a policy of speaking from the floor to  congratulate my district's State championship teams.   Today, I am here to honor the Riverheads High School football team,  which won the VHSL Class 1 State title last month. Not only did the  Gladiators best their opponent by an impressive 45-14 point margin, but  this victory marked the team's sixth consecutive State championship,  the only football program in VHSL history to accomplish such a feat.   And if that weren't monumental enough, the game was also the team's  50th straight win, which is the longest active winning streak in our  Nation.   For the past 26 years, this team has been led by Coach Robert Casto,  who has sadly announced that he will be retiring at the end of the  school year. Coach Casto's remarkable coaching career comes to an end  with an overall record of 59 losses and 261 wins, including nine State  championships.   Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to recognize this talented football  team and their remarkable coach. Go Gladiators.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Wisconsin for  yielding on this very important subject. I was unfortunate to catch  COVID a couple weeks ago, and I think that the Vitamin D supplements I  was taking in addition to Vitamin C, in addition to zinc definitely  helped to minimize the length and the severity of the illness.   Madam Speaker, today marks 1 year since Joe Biden was sworn in as  President, meaning it has been a year since  [[Page H251]]  Democrats took unified control of the Federal Government.   And at this point there is no denying that Americans are worse off  today than they were 12 months ago.   Consumer prices have risen 7 percent since Democrats won  congressional majorities and the White House, marking a 40-year high  rate of inflation.   Gas prices reached $3.28 a gallon last month, a 49.6 percent increase  from a year ago.   1.7 illegal immigrants were encountered unlawfully crossing the  border in FY21, the highest number ever recorded.   Sixteen major U.S. cities set new homicide records this past year.   And just last week, COVID hospitalizations hit a record high.   Thirteen American servicemembers tragically lost their lives, and the  Taliban captured Afghanistan as a result of this administration's  disastrous withdrawal plan.   Madam Speaker, Democrats are certainly setting records, just not the  records that they want to be breaking. Their party has utterly failed  the American people.
