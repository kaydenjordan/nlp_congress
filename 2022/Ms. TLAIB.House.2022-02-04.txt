 Madam Speaker, I stand here today at the beginning of  Black History Month to honor the mother of the civil rights movement  and beloved resident of 13 District Strong, Mother Rosa Parks, on her  birthday.   Today, with the help of her family, we introduced a bill to name a  United States Post Office near her home in honor of this amazing and  incredible civil rights leader.   The progress made by those incredible leaders who came before us,  like Mother Rosa Parks, Dr. King, Malcolm X, Fred Hampton, and so many  more, is under extreme threat. While some in our body right here choose  to ban books and desperately try to return to the days of Jim Crow, I  am proud to stand here for the radical love and beautiful strength  embodied in leaders  [[Page H965]]  like Mother Rosa Louise McCauley Parks.   We know our struggle against racism is a lifelong pursuit. As Mother  Parks wrote: ``Freedom fighters never retire.''   Her memory continues to guide us.   I will add that freedom fighters never die.   I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this effort, and I am  proud to have the opportunity to serve the incredible people of the 13  District Strong in our fight for equity and justice.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this effort.                            ____________________
