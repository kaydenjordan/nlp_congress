 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment I cosponsored with  Representative Gosar that will expand the Good Neighbor Authority for  counties.   Good Neighbor Authority allows the Forest Service to enter into  cooperative agreements and contracts with States and Puerto Rico to  execute projects that perform watershed restoration and forest  management services on National Forest System lands.   The current text of the farm bill includes language to expand the  Good Neighbor Authority to include Indian Tribes. This simple amendment  seeks to build on that commonsense provision by empowering local  communities and allowing the Forest Service to include counties as  partners to these agreements.                                time  1430     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, my amendment would allow land management agencies like the  U.S. Forest Service and BLM to quickly remove dead trees after  wildfires to pay for reforestation and rehabilitation after devastating  fires.   Last year, over 1 million acres burned in Montana. Livelihoods were  threatened, wildlife habitats were destroyed, and whole landscapes were  scarred.   My commonsense amendment was passed, verbatim, in the Resilient  Federal Forests Act by this body. It would allow the agencies to  quickly respond, as well as to raise funds to further rehabilitate the  forest. An expedited environmental assessment would still be required  and public input would still be included in order to move forward with  the project. Most importantly, this amendment would require that at  least 75 percent of the burned area would be reforested.   These landscape scale projects are badly needed. The Rice Ridge fire  burned over 160,000 acres alone. Quickly responding to the damage  caused will protect our public lands and restore our watersheds for the  future and restore them to the quality we have come to love in Montana.   As I mentioned, similar language was included in the Resilient  Federal Forests Act, which passed the House on a bipartisan basis on  November 11, 2017.   My amendment is supported by the Federal Forest Resource Coalition,  the National Association of Counties, the National Water Resources  Association, and the Idaho Forest Group.   Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Chair, at this time, I urge adoption of my  commonsense amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
