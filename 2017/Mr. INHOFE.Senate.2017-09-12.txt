 Mr. President, I want to discuss an amendment, and I am  not sure when it will be offered--I understand it will be offered--and  I think it is very significant.   First of all, let's keep in mind what this is all about. The NDAA is  the National Defense Authorization Act. It is one that we know is going  to pass. It has passed for 55 consecutive years. If something happened  and it didn't pass, the troops wouldn't get hazard pay or flight pay,  and it would really be a traumatic thing that would happen. But it is  not going to happen. It is going to pass. It is the most important bill  that I believe we pass every year. As I said, we have passed it for 55  consecutive years, and it is important that we pass it right away.  Sometimes it gets stalled until later in the year, but if it isn't done  by the end of December, that is when everything falls apart. So we just  don't need to do that, and I believe we have the momentum to go ahead  and get it done.   Now, we are facing a threat. I have stood at this podium so many  times now to talk about how I look back wistfully at the days of the  Cold War when we had two superpowers. We knew what they had. They knew  what we had. Mutually shared destruction meant something, but now it is  totally different.   We hear that the two biggest threats facing us right now would be  North Korea and Iran. I stand on the side that it is North Korea  because North Korea is run by someone with a questionable mentality,  and they are developing--I have watched them over the years--the  capabilities that they now have. I certainly agree that Iran also is a  serious threat. But the fact is that our Armed Forces are now in a  condition that they have not been in for a long time.   I chair the Subcommittee on Readiness in the Senate, and we had the  vice chairs testify before us not too long ago. They testified that we  are in worse shape now than we were during the hollow force of the  1970s, right after the Carter administration. Many of us remember that,  and I certainly do. Our Armed Forces are smaller than in the days of  the hollow force in the 1970s, and readiness in the form of personnel,  training, and equipment have been degraded, I think, to a breaking  point. All the while, we have witnessed an uptake in the training and  operational accidents across the Armed Forces. While the risks posed by  the readiness crisis are significant, Congress is already taking steps  to correct the shortfalls.   Every amendment considered for the NDAA should focus on increasing  readiness across our services. We owe it to  [[Page S5202]]  our troops and our Nation to help ensure that levels are acceptable.  That is why it is disappointing and dangerous that we are considering  an amendment that would authorize a base realignment and closure round,  better known to all of us as a BRAC round. We have had five BRAC rounds  since 1989, and I am familiar with all of them. I, along with many of  my colleagues in the Senate Armed Services Committee, successfully have  a provision that would include a prohibition against a BRAC right now.  I think it is pretty obvious. Everyone knows what the threat is out  there. At least those on the Armed Services Committee do. But they also  know that any BRAC round that you do is going to have the effect of  costing a lot of money that should be spent on readiness. No matter  what a base realignment and closure, or BRAC, is, the amount of money  that is spent when you first start is going to be very expensive.   Unfortunately, an amendment is pending that would enable a new BRAC  round in 2019, and, at the same time, remove--this is critical--the  nonpartisan commission that allows the input of both local defense  communities and Congress into the BRAC process.   I will tell my colleagues why that is important. I remember because  it was shortly after I was first elected. Prior to 1989, the Defense  Department was the agency that made the decisions as to what was going  to happen to our various installations around America. It was very,  very political. There were rumors or some stories that they would agree  for certain considerations to allow someone to continue to operate when  they really shouldn't be operating.   Well, the Pentagon claims that a BRAC round would save money and  would allow the military to invest that money into critical readiness  shortfalls. It is just not true. Before the most recent BRAC round in  2005, we heard these same arguments from the Pentagon, that the BRAC  would somehow save money and would allow the military to increase  efficiency. With 22 major base closings and 33 realignments--that is  what happened in 2005--the round was depicted to save, over a 20-year  period, $35 billion, with costs of $21 billion. The reality is far  different. The 2005 BRAC round cost taxpayers roughly $35 billion, and  it is only expected to save $9.9 billion over the next 20 years.   Now, the other day I went back and looked up just to see what the GAO  said about that. Keep in mind that it was a 2005 BRAC round, but the  GAO study was actually in 2011, saying: We know what we said at that  time; let's see how they performed.   So let me read right out of their report: The ``one-time  implementation costs''--that is the cost of putting together a BRAC  round--``grew from $21 billion originally estimated by the BRAC  Commission in 2005 to about $35 billion.'' In other words, they said it  was going to cost $21 billion, and it ended up costing $35 billion.  That is an increase of 67 percent. It has been that way with the other  rounds too.   Looking at their analysis of the value, it is very important that we  understand what they are saying here. The GAO said that ``the 20-year  net present value DOD can expect by implementing the 2005 BRAC  recommendations has decreased by 72 percent.''   In other words, they were 72 percent off as to what great savings we  were going to have in the future by making these closures.   They went on to say that ``the 20-year net present value--that is,  the present value of future savings minus the present value of up-front  investment costs--of $35.6 billion estimated by the Commission in 2005  for this BRAC round has decreased by 72 percent.'' It cannot be more  specific than that, and this is the consistent pattern that we have.   So, clearly, those base closure rounds cost the American taxpayers an  exorbitant amount of money up front and take years to recoup their  initial investment, if they ever do. In this case, they haven't, and  they don't expect to. With the history of previous inconsistencies  between expected and actual costs, there is no certainty that any  proposed base closures or realignments would be economically viable now  or at any time in the future.   Now, we are at a point of uncertainty that makes it irresponsible to  expend billions of dollars in downsizing our Armed Forces when we are  currently facing some of the most volatile, unpredictable, and  dangerous military threats that America has ever seen. Readiness can't  wait, and our enemies around the world will not.   We must also consider the possibility that we will soon require the  capacity that is presently considered excess if the current military  threats materialize in a manner that would encourage expansion of our  armed services.   I think that just stands to reason. We know the threats are out  there, and we know the problems are more severe than they have ever  been in the history of this country. So maybe the current size of our  forces would not be adequate. Well, it is a lot cheaper to go ahead and  keep something that is already there than it is to tear down something  and start all over again.   So, anyway, as to the early years, everybody knows that the certainty  is there that it will cost money in the early years. The high cost of a  BRAC round would divert resources away from addressing immediate,  tangible threats.   Just last week, North Korea tested what is believed to be a hydrogen  bomb, its most powerful nuclear weapon tested to date, estimated at  nearly seven times as powerful as the bomb detonated over Hiroshima.  This came on the heels of North Korea's first successfully tested and  more powerful and far-ranging intercontinental ballistic missile, or  ICBM. We are familiar with that test, which began over the summer. Now,  if fired on a trajectory, experts believe the ICBMs that North Korea  tested could have reached the United States of America.   I can remember talking about this with our intelligence department  years ago. At that time, we were saying that they could finally develop  a bomb and a delivery system that could reach the United States of  America. Well, that may be here today. If not, it is imminent.   A BRAC round now would also shortchange a response to the immediate  readiness needs. Over the last 90 days, we have witnessed a spike in  accidents across the military services, especially in the Navy and in  some of the aviation mishaps. While these accidents are still under  investigation--under investigation to determine the cause--it is not  hard to correlate them with the readiness decline.   Our forces are smaller than the days of the hollow force in the  1970s. Our equipment is aging. Our base infrastructure requires  critical maintenance and upgrades. Our Air Force is short 1,500 pilots,  and 1,300 of those are fighter pilots. Only 50 percent of the Air Force  squadrons are trained and ready to conduct their assigned missions. The  Navy is the smallest and the least ready it has been in years. It  currently can only meet about 40 percent of the demand for regional  combat commanders. We are talking about the commanders in the field who  make that assessment. We can only carry out less than 40 percent of  them. More than half of Navy aircraft are grounded because they are  awaiting maintenance or lack necessary parts. The Marine Corps' F/A- 18s, known as the Hornets, 62 percent are broken. We don't have that  capacity. The Army has said about one-third of their brigade combat  teams, one-fourth of their combat aviation brigades, and one-half of  their division headquarters are currently ready.    Speaking in January about the Army readiness, then-Vice Chief of  Staff of the Army General Allyn said:         What it comes down to . . . we will be too late to need. .       . . Our soldiers will arrive too late, our units will require       too much time to close the manning, training, and equipment       gap . . . the end result is excessive casualties to civilians       and to our forces who are already forward-stationed.    We are talking about lives. We are talking about American lives. That  is a sobering assessment, especially when considering the gravity of  the threats we face around the world, including, of course, the Korean  Peninsula.   The NDAA's first priority has to be to rebuild our force and improve  its readiness, which is what we are in the process of doing right now,  and we need to get it done. A BRAC round would divert vast resources  away from this end for savings we would not see for decades to come, if  we ever did--and we  [[Page S5203]]  are growing, not shrinking. Now is not the time for a BRAC round.   I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in rejecting this  amendment. However well-intentioned, now is not the time for a  shortsighted BRAC round.   There are still Members--I have talked to Senators who are saying  they really believe, and they have been told, that somehow we are going  to have more money for readiness if we have a BRAC round. It is exactly  the opposite. Again, straight from the GAO, they made the analysis of  the 2005 BRAC, and said the 20-year net present value DOD can expect by  implementing the 2005 BRAC recommendations has decreased by 72 percent.  It always costs a lot more on the front end and saves much less in the  long run.   With that, I encourage my colleagues to reject this amendment, if  this amendment is indeed offered.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
