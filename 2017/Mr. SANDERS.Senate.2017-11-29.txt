 Madam President, President Trump and the Republican  leadership are on television every day telling the American people how  this tax bill is going to help the middle class, how it was written for  the middle class. Unfortunately, I will not shock too many people by  suggesting what President Trump is saying is not truthful.   This legislation, according to independent studies, will provide 60  percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent. We are living in a moment  in American history where we have massive levels of income and wealth  inequality, where the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as  much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, where three people--three of the  wealthiest people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half  of the American population. Yet my Republican colleagues believe this  is a moment when 60 percent of the benefits of the so-called tax reform  bill should go to the 1 percent. Meanwhile, millions of middle-class  families will end up paying more in taxes. So we have a situation in  which the wealthy, who need tax breaks the least, will benefit the  most, and many millions of struggling working-class and middle-class  families will end up paying more in taxes at the end of 10 years.    The President of the United States and my Republican colleagues tell  the American people that trickle-down economics--giving huge tax breaks  to the wealthy and large corporations--will expand the economy, will  create new jobs, and will pay for the deficit that this legislation  brings about. The simple truth is, trickle-down economics is a  fraudulent theory. It has failed miserably in Kansas, where it has been  most recently put into effect. It failed under the Reagan  administration, and it failed under the administration of George W.  Bush.   What interests me the most is, my Republican colleagues will not tell  the American people how they are going to be paying for the $1.4  trillion increase in deficits that this bill creates. You have a $1.4  trillion increase in deficits. How is that going to be paid for? My  view is that, without doubt, as soon as this legislation is passed, the  Republicans will come back, and they will suddenly rediscover their  religion about deficits. They will go before the American people and  say we need ``entitlement reform'' or we need ``welfare reform.'' Let  me translate for you what ``entitlement reform'' means. It means that  when millions of older workers have nothing in the bank saved up for  retirement, they are going to propose massive cuts to Social Security.   We do not know exactly the form it will take. Maybe they will want to  raise the retirement age, forcing older workers to work more before  they can get their Social Security benefits. Maybe they will cut back  on cost-of-living increases through a so-called chained CPI, which  means lower benefits. They are going to go after Medicare. Maybe their  idea will be to privatize Medicare, convert it into a voucher program,  and say to older Americans: Here is a check for $8,000. You go out and  find the private insurance that you can, and good luck to you with your  $8,000 check if you are dealing with heart disease or cancer. They  will, no doubt, come back to slash Medicaid.   Now, these are not just wild ideas that I have been thinking about.  This is pretty much what was in the budget the Republicans voted for  right on the floor of the Senate. They already voted for a $1 trillion  cut over a 10-year period to Medicaid, and that means massive  reductions in help not only for lower income Americans, not only for  children but for people in nursing homes. They have already voted in  the budget, over a 10-year period, to cut Medicare by $470 billion, and  in the House they are working hard to figure out ways to cut Social  Security. The Republicans will also make massive cuts to education, to  nutrition, and to environmental protection.   The other day, I sent a letter to the Senate majority leader, Mitch  McConnell, and to the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. What I asked of  them was to be honest with the American people.   I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                        U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on the Budget,                                  Washington, DC, November 27, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: It is no       secret that I am vigorously opposed to the disastrous ``tax       reform'' bills that you are pushing in the U.S. House and       U.S. Senate.        At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, both of       these bills would provide huge tax breaks to the very rich       and large corporations. Meanwhile, they would raise taxes for       millions of middle class families.        Further, and the point of this letter, is that both of       these bills would increase the federal deficit by more than       $1.4 trillion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.        I am very concerned that if you succeed in passing tax       legislation that significantly adds to our national debt, you       will then move aggressively to balance the budget on the       backs of working families, the elderly, the children, the       sick, and the poor. In other words, in order to pay for tax       breaks for the rich and large corporations, you will make       massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,       nutrition, environmental protection, and every other program       designed to protect the needs of the middle class and working       families of our country.        Before the Senate votes on tax legislation that adds over       $1.4 trillion to the deficit, you owe the American people a       specific and detailed explanation as to how the Republican       Congress will achieve its commitment of balancing the budget       over the next decade.        Will you schedule a vote to raise the eligibility of       Medicare from 65 to 67 as called for in the House Budget       Resolution? Will you attempt to end Medicare as we know it by       giving seniors vouchers to purchase private health insurance,       something long supported by Speaker Ryan?        How much will you cut Social Security? Will you try to       increase the retirement age  [[Page S7374]]       to 70, cut cost-of-living adjustments for senior citizens and       disabled veterans, and/or privatize Social Security?        Will you support legislation to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion       over the next decade, kicking 15 million Americans off of       health insurance? As you know, this was a provision included       in the Republican Budget Resolution that was passed earlier       this year.        How much do you plan on cutting affordable housing, Pell       Grants, WIC, and Head Start to pay for a permanent tax break       for profitable corporations?        The bottom line is that the American people have a right to       know exactly how you plan to pay for a $1.4 trillion increase       in the deficit before, not after, tax legislation is signed       into law. In your response, please be as specific as you can.            Sincerely,                                                   Bernard Sanders,                                                    Ranking Member.     Mr. President, this is what I asked:         I am very concerned that if you succeed in passing tax       legislation that significantly adds to our national debt, you       will then move aggressively to balance the budget on the       backs of working families, the elderly, the children, the       sick, and the poor.

Before the Senate votes on tax legislation that adds over       $1.4 trillion to the deficit, you owe the American people a       specific and detailed explanation as to how the Republican       Congress will achieve its commitment of balancing the budget       over the next decade.

How much do you plan on cutting affordable housing, Pell       Grants, WIC, and Head Start to pay for a permanent tax break       for profitable corporations?    That is what I wrote to the majority leader.   My challenge right now to my Republican colleagues is--and I ask  you--to come down to the floor of the Senate and tell me I am wrong.  Come down here and tell the American people, if this legislation--this  disastrous tax bill--passes, that you will not be coming back to cut  Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, nutrition, education, and other  programs. Maybe I am wrong. If Republicans come down here and say:  Bernie, you are wrong. We have no intention of cutting Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid, I will come here, and I will apologize.   So here is my challenge right now to my Republican colleagues: Come  down here. Tell me and tell the American people I am wrong. Tell us all  that you are not going to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and  education in order to deal with the $1.4 trillion deficit you will  bring about in this disastrous tax bill. Tell the American people you  are not going to cut programs that the elderly, the children, the sick,  and the poor desperately need in order to give huge tax breaks to the  wealthy and large corporations.   That is my challenge, and I will be listening eagerly to see if there  are any Republicans who are going to come down and tell me what I am  suggesting is wrong.   I yield the floor.
