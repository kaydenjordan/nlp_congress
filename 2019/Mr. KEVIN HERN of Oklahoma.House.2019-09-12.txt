 Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague from  Alaska for yielding.   Mr. Chair, how long must we rely on foreign adversaries for fuel?  Utilizing  [[Page H7673]]  our domestic resources is essential to a strong economy. Energy  dominance on the world stage is our end goal. We will never get there  if we continue to cut off access to our own resources.   The truth is, oil and gas production in ANWR benefits our country as  a whole, but it is also a key industry for the people of Alaska.   The community of Kaktovik sees the energy sector as a significant  source of employment, revenue, and reliable energy. The people,  including the local Tribe of Alaska Natives, are incredibly supportive  of the continuation of oil and gas production in their community. These  people were never consulted by my colleagues at any point in the  development of this bill.   Neither was our colleague   Don Young, who has represented the needs  of the people of Alaska for more than 40 years, who has more experience  than everyone who wrote this bill combined.   Don Young, the dean of  the House, the longest serving Member in Congress, should have been the  first person consulted about this legislation was never sought out.  Instead, they consulted a Tribe 350 miles away that has nothing to do  with oil and gas in ANWR.   To put this in perspective, I live in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Omaha,  Nebraska, is about 380 miles away. Can anybody tell me what my opinion  would matter in Omaha, Nebraska? I don't spend time there. I don't know  what the people there want.   The only assumption we can make as to why a Tribe over 350 miles away  was consulted instead of the local community is that my colleagues knew  they wouldn't find support in Kaktovik.   This should be an easy decision. There is no reason to vote ``yes''  on this bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to think about the future of our  country and vote ``no'' today on H.R. 1146.
