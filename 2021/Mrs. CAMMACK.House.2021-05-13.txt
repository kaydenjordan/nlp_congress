 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  submit extraneous materials.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor the  police officers across our country.   As we commemorate National Police Week, I can't help but think about  the barrage of attacks that our LEOs have come under in recent months  and years.   Police officers have constantly been vilified by the media and those  in leftwing politics for just simply doing their jobs. It is a job that  comes with significant challenges and dangers and is often thankless,  at best.  [[Page H2301]]    At this time, I would like to thank my colleagues here today for  joining me for this Special Order to honor our heroes in blue.   I would like to take the opportunity to thank our police officers all  across this Nation for their work and sense of duty. They walk the beat  and meet people at their worst moments, all while maintaining  professionalism and a steadfastness to the rule of law.   This is a job that affects not only the individual officer but their  entire family. Husbands, wives, sons, and daughters worry if their  loved ones will return home from a shift. This fear is very real and  very raw.   As the wife of a first responder, I, too, have felt this fear and  dread as my husband, Matt, drives to a SWAT call-out.   Too often, these brave men and women in uniform don't make it back  after that shift. They pay the ultimate price for their bravery, and  their families are left to pick up the pieces.   Just this year alone, we have lost too many brave officers in the  line of duty. I will honor them here today by saying each of their  names. Their memories and bravery will be recorded in the Congressional  Record and etched into the archives of American history.   Their names are as follows:   Sergeant Gordon Best, Sergeant Daniel Mobley, Lieutenant Jeff Bain,  Deputy Sheriff Nicholas Howell, Sergeant Randall Sims, Deputy Sheriff  Jonathan Price, Officer Jay Hughes, Officer Brian Sicknick, Sergeant  David Crumpler, First Sergeant Timothy Howell, Lieutenant William  Gardner, Conservation Officer Steven Reighard, Officer Arturo Villegas,  Officer Tyler Britt, Master Corporal Brian LaVigne, Agent Luis Marrero- Diaz, Agent Luis Salaman-Conde, Agent Eliezer Hernandez-Cartagena,  Officer Melton Gore, Sergeant Frederick Cameron, Detective Sergeant  Stephen Desfosses, Officer Hector Moya, Chief of Police Tony Jordan,  Corporal Christine Peters, Constable Sherry Kay Langford, Lieutenant  Treva Preston, Officer Alfred Jiminez, Officer Jerry Hemphill, Sergeant  Edward Marcurella, Lieutenant John Reynolds, Officer Joseph Martini,  Deputy Sheriff Adam Gibson, Officer Brandon Stalker, Warrants Officer  Toby Keiser, Deputy Sheriff Jacinto Navarro, Officer Byron Shields,  Lieutenant Robert Van Zeyl, Lieutenant Frank Arnold, Special Agent  Wayne Snyder, Captain Michael Garigan, Lieutenant Juan Rafael Rivera- Padua, Deputy Sheriff Frank Gonzalez Holguin, Auxiliary Sergeant Louis  Livatino, Director of Field Operations Beverly Good, Sergeant Tommy  Cudd, Sergeant Jeffrey Smith, Special Agent Robert Mayer, Sergeant  William Brautigam, Correctional Officer Juan Llanes, Sergeant Grace  Bellamy, Lieutenant Michael Boutte, Special Agent Laura Ann  Schwartzenberger, Special Agent Daniel Alfin, Detention Officer Robert  Perez, Deputy Sheriff Jack Gwynes, Agent Juan Rosado-Lopez, Patrolman  Darian Jarrott, Detective Pedro Mejia, Officer Cesar Sibonga, Deputy  Sheriff Ross Dixon, Officer Vicky James, Investigator Eddie Hutchinson,  Chief of Police Timothy Sheehan, Deputy Sheriff Donald Gilreath, Police  Officer Mitchell Penton, Officer Genaro Guerrero, Corrections Officer  Tawiwo Obele, Major Esteban Ramirez, Deputy Constable Manuel Phillipe  De La Rosa, Sergeant Richard Brown, Deputy Sheriff Michael Magli,  Police Officer Horacio Dominguez, Lieutenant Eugene Lasco, Officer  Jasaon Lagore, Parole Officer Troy Morin, Officer Carlos Mendoza,  Deputy Sheriff Thomas Albanese, Reserve Deputy Constable Martinus  Mitchum, Police Officer Dominic Winum, Captain Justin Bedwell, Police  Officer Jose Anzora, Corrections Officer Tracey Adams, Officer Crispin  San Jose, Officer Jesse Madsen, Sergeant Barry Henderson, Deputy  Sheriff Stanley Burdic, Police Officer Gary Hibbs, Border Patrol Agent  Alejandro Flores-Banuelos, Police Officer Kevin Valencia, Sergeant  LaShonda Owens, Police Officer Matt North, Police Officer Eric Talley,  Chief of Police Fred Posavetz, Corrections Officer Robert McFarland,  Senior Master Trooper Todd Hanneken, Corporal Kyle Davis, Trooper  Joseph Gallagher, Sergeant Shane Owens, Reserve Deputy Sheriff James  Driver, Trooper Chad Walker, Officer Luis Hernandez, Officer William  Evans, Lieutenant James Kouski, Officer Brent Hall, Deputy Sheriff  Joseph Gore, Deputy Sheriff Christopher Knight, Sergeant James Smith,  Deputy Sheriff Thomas Barnes, Deputy Sheriff Carlos Hernandez, Border  Patrol Agent Christopher Simpkins, Detention Deputy Mark Anderson,  Officer Jimmy Garcia, Officer David Parde, Deputy Sheriff Terry Dyer,  Deputy Sheriff Alexander Gwosdz, Officer Anastasio Tsakos, Corporal  Keith Heacook, Sergeant Chris Ward, Deputy Sheriff Logan Fox, Officer  Christopher Farrar, Detective Luca Benedetti, Deputy Sheriff Samuel  Leonard, Deputy Sheriff Stephen Jones, and Officer Jimmy Inn.   I would also be remiss if I didn't mention our K9 officers that also  gave their lives in the line of duty: K9 Figo, K9 Riley, K9 Luna, K9  Joker, K9 Kozmo, and K9 Jango.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in a moment of silence to remember these  heroes.   As you can see, that is a pretty lengthy list. I hope that, even  though I may have mispronounced some of their names, their families  seek comfort in knowing that their names will forever be remembered.   Again, these are just some of the heroes that we have lost this year.  It is May, and this list takes up four pages of paper. May we always  remember their names and recognize their service in keeping law and  order for our communities.   To the brave men and women who we just named: Rest easy. We've got  the watch.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford),  a good friend and sheriff of the great city of Jacksonville.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, former sheriff  from Jacksonville, Mr. Rutherford.   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida ( Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana  (Mr. Higgins), my good friend, who is also a law enforcement officer  and great patriot.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Nehls), another great friend of law enforcement; the former sheriff of  Fort Bend County, Texas, who knows truly what it is to be a man of the  law.    Thank you to our sheriff from the great State of Texas.  I  [[Page H2303]]  appreciate your remarks and thank you for your service, not just to  Fort Ben, but to the great State of Texas and our country. Thank you.   At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Miller- Meeks), my good friend who may be the smallest in stature in our  conference but has the biggest heart.    Mr. Speaker, during this National Police Week, we have  highlighted many officers who have met the call of duty with courage  and unmatched service. Two such officers I would like to highlight  today are from my district in the great little tiny town of High  Springs, Sergeant Gary Moore and Officer Mayuly Nodarse.    On April 28, these two officers of the High Springs Police Department  responded to a call about suspicious activity. Upon arriving on scene,  they observed a suspect standing in the bathroom of a house with a  knife and a victim yelling for help.   After these two officers gave multiple commands, they forced entry  into the bathroom and found the armed suspect who was uncooperative.  Based on their training and experience, they were able to disarm the  suspect. Everyone on scene lived to see another day, thanks to the work  and quick thinking of these officers.   For their bravery and professionalism, they have been awarded the  Medal of Valor. I thank these two officers for their quick thinking and  decisive action. They show us what proper training and a well-funded  police force can do to keep our communities safe.   As I stand here today, I know my husband is watching, on shift, from  the station. So, a quick hello to my husband Matt, and thank you. I  also would like to thank my colleagues for joining me here today and a  big thank you to every officer who gets up every day, puts on their  vest, puts on their badge, walks out that door not knowing if they will  make it home at the end of their shift. To the families, thank you for  your service alongside our men and women in uniform.   As we have listed the names here today of those that we have lost  this year, rest easy, know that we have to watch.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
