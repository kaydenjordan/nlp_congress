 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the people of Puerto Rico and the  Virgin Islands have been hit especially hard by powerful hurricanes. As  I said earlier this week, the Senate will continue to work with FEMA,  the Department of Defense, and the rest of the administration to help  in the recovery, just as we have in Texas, Florida, and across the  Southeast. We are eager to hear more soon about what additional  resources will be necessary.   The American people are stepping up, too, just as they always do, and  so are the brave men and women of our military.  [[Page S6201]]    This week, 70 soldiers and 8 aircraft from Kentucky's own 101st  Airborne Combat Aviation Brigade deployed from Fort Campbell to Puerto  Rico to support hurricane relief operations. These soldiers will join  the larger joint force effort, which includes elements of the 26th  Marine Expeditionary Unit, medical support teams, medevac aircraft, and  elements from the Army Corps of Engineers.   Kentucky is similarly proud of the men and women of its Air and Army  National Guard who have worked to provide relief in the Virgin Islands,  Puerto Rico, as well as in Texas where, according to recent reports,  their efforts helped save more than 300 lives in the wake of Hurricane  Harvey.   We are all proud of their efforts, but we should not forget that  disasters of these proportions typically require a response from nearly  every arm of the Federal Government. The FAA plays a critical role as  well.   As we all know, the FAA's authority to collect and spend money from  the aviation trust fund is set to expire on September 30, this week.  These are the resources that fund repairs and replacement parts for our  air traffic control system. Even absent a crisis, it would be  irresponsible to let this lapse.   We have read in recent days that air traffic in and out of Puerto  Rico has already been limited because of damage done to radar,  navigational aids, and other equipment. The Governor of Puerto Rico  reports that air traffic control capacity is only at about 20 percent  of normal.   This critical air safety equipment needs repair. The FAA reports that  failure to act on the reauthorization would leave them without  sufficient funding in the accounts necessary for replacement parts,  equipment, and supplies. They would have only enough funding to cover  salary costs for these workers for about 1 week.   These American territories are suffering. What they need right now is  aid and assistance from the air, not a manufactured crisis from  Washington on top of everything else. The House of Representatives will  soon pass legislation that reauthorizes the FAA. It will help open up  the air space to that aid so that it can get to where it is needed  most.   The House bill goes further by authorizing tax relief for individuals  and businesses affected by the recent hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the  Virgin Islands, and Texas and Florida, as well, because these disaster  victims should not suffer a tax bill on top of their losses. We need to  pass that legislation here in the Senate without further delay.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of H.R. 3823.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Cassidy amendment at the desk be agreed to and the bill, as amended, be  considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.
