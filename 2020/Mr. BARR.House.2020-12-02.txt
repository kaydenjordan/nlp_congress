 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 945. The United  States has the most robust and advanced capital markets in the world.  They provide access to capital for some of the most innovative  businesses, and create an avenue for investors of all levels to save  for retirement and plan for their futures.   It follows that companies from around the globe flock to the U.S.  capital markets to fund their businesses; and the U.S. is happy to be  the destination for these firms. However, to play in our markets,  companies need to play by our rules; and Chinese firms listed on  American exchanges are the worst and most frequent offenders. Gone are  the days when we can sit idly by and let Chinese firms, many with  strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party, participate in our markets  at the expense of protection for everyday investors.   Most publicly traded firms are audited by public accounting firms,  which, in turn, are overseen by the PCAOB. This gives investors  confidence that the books are accurate. China, however, refuses to let  the PCAOB review its auditors.   The result? At best, investors lack confidence in the validity and  reliability of a company's financial data. Even worse, thousands of  investors are downright defrauded. The worst case scenario--American  savers are unwittingly funding efforts by Chinese SOEs to usurp  America's global supremacy and compromise U.S. national security.   I was proud to serve on the House China Task Force, where we closely  examined, among other things, China's participation in U.S. capital  markets. Earlier this year, we published a report with over 130  recommendations--most of which are bipartisan. Passage of the House  companion to S. 945, sponsored by Mr. Sherman, was among the  recommendations.   Also among the recommendations was passage of my bill, the  Transparency in Chinese Government Investment Act, which would direct  the SEC to investigate whether disclosure of a business's ties to the  CCP or other malign Chinese initiatives is material for investors; and,  if so, require companies to report.   We can no longer allow China to take advantage of our rules, defraud  our investors, and challenge the spirit of free enterprise. I urge  support of S. 945.                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 945, the  Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.   The United States has the most robust, liquid, and advanced capital  markets in the world. Companies from around the globe flock to the U.S.  capital markets to fund their businesses.   However, to participate in our markets, companies need to play by our  rules, and Chinese firms listed on American exchanges are the worst and  most frequent violators of the rules.   Gone are the days when we can sit idly by and let Chinese firms, many  with strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party, participate in our  markets at the expense of protection for everyday investors.   Most publicly traded firms are audited by public accounting firms  which, in turn, are overseen by the PCAOB. This gives investors  confidence that the books are accurate. China, however, refuses to let  the PCAOB review its auditors.   The results are that investors lack confidence in the validity and  reliability of a company's financial data. Worse, thousands of  investors are defrauded. And the worst case scenario, American savers  are funding Chinese state-owned enterprises which are fueling China's  civil-military fusion and, in some cases, directly financing China's  military space and cyberspace buildup, threatening U.S. national  security.   As a member of the China Task Force, I strongly support this  legislation. I urge this body to pass it. And we can no longer allow  China to take advantage of our rules and defraud our investors.                            ____________________
