 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  progress in America's pledge to provide liberty and justice for all  Americans.   Today, President Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law.  The legislation ensures equal rights and protection for married couples  regardless of the color of their skin, where they live, or whom they  love.   This act is long overdue and necessary as threats remain to undo the  hard-fought ruling giving same-sex couples the fundamental right to  marriage equality.   I am honored to have cosponsored this bill, and I am proud this day  has finally come.                            ____________________
