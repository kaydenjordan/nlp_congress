 Madam Chair, I am going to read a letter  from a family back in Pennsylvania, the Stewarts, Sara, Michael, and  their three daughters: Maddie, Gilly, and Daphne. It start off this  way:         Dear Congressman Kelly, my name is Sara Stewart, and I am       from Saint Petersburg, Pennsylvania. It is my understanding       that the House Ways and Means Committee is having a public       hearing on H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019.        Now, it appears this legislation does not have bipartisan       support. It needs to take a more balanced approach. The       balance is needed for patients like my 10-year-old daughter,       Maddie.        Maddie suffers from a rare mitochondrial deletion condition       called Pearson syndrome, which is a disorder that occurs as a       result of mutated genes in the body. These genes impact       mitochondria of her cells that prevent them from producing       enough energy for the body to function properly.        Pearson syndrome is difficult to diagnose because it       affects each individual differently. Maddie's symptoms       through the years have included being blood transfusion-      dependent for several years, the inability to heal after heat       and Sun exposure, becoming type 1 diabetic, progressively       losing her hearing and her vision, kidney failure, and       several other daily complications, including developmental       delays from having a body that runs on limited energy. It has       been truly heartbreaking to see her endure this disease, but       she continues to defy the odds.        My message is simple to you, Mr. Kelly, and to the rest of       the committee: There is no cure or treatment for Pearson       syndrome. There isn't any right now. Each day is a struggle       to keep Maddie balanced so her body is able to better cope       with the symptoms of this terrible disorder.        All we have--as well as many other families across the       world--is hope. Please don't let partisan bickering impact       the ability of researchers to discover and innovate new       therapies that could save Maddie's life one day. The clock is       ticking, and Maddie is waiting.    Madam Chair, I went to visit the Stewarts. I saw this adorable child,  and her mom told me: She has so much energy today, and we are really  excited that she is feeling this way when you came to see her.   When I looked at the Stewart family, when I looked at Maddie, when I  looked at her sister Gilly, and when I looked at her sister Daphne, I  thought: This isn't fair. She has never had a chance to live her life.  She has already doubled the chances of what the life expectancy is. The  mom is saying please don't let political bickering stand in the way of  developing and innovating a new source that could save Maddie's life.   Last year, there were 80-some children who had the same condition as  Maddie. This Christmas, hopefully, the 40 who are left will have the  chance to celebrate it.   Now, I don't know how the Stewarts are registered. I don't know if  the Stewarts vote, and I don't care. But I do know how the Stewarts  pray, and they pray every night not just for Maddie, but for all the  rest of the children who have this horrible disease.   The other thing they pray for is that, in the people's House and on  the floor of the people's House, we don't look at each other as  Republicans and Democrats, that we look at each other the way we really  are: We are moms and dads. We are grandmas and grandpas and aunts and  uncles.   If we cannot come here and agree that the hallmark of America has  always been her ability to develop, to innovate, and to be the savior  of the rest of the world, then what are we doing?   Do we really want to make this a political battle, or do we want to  start developing policy that is about people and not political power?    Madam Chair, do we really want to look in  the eyes of a 9-year-old or a 10-year-old and say to that child: It is  not just in the cards right now because we can't get together as adults  and do the right thing for the right reasons and let good things  happen.   No. We have allowed ourselves to be so damned political and so damned  divided that we turn our backs on the people who sent us here.   Maddie Stewart can't develop the drug herself. Mr. and Mrs. Stewart  can't develop the drug themselves. The people of Saint Petersburg,  Pennsylvania, can't help Maddie develop a drug. But we can. We can by  passing legislation and looking not at H.R. 3, because you know it  stops innovation.    Forget all the rest of the talk. It is all about innovation. It is  about something new, something better, and something great that is  going to save somebody's life.   Let's look at H.R. 19. Let's talk about the substitute, the Lower  Costs, More Cures Act.   I wish we all had unlimited time to speak on this issue, but we  don't. The clock is ticking. It is ticking for Maddie Stewart in Saint  Petersburg, Pennsylvania.   Please do the right thing for the right reasons, and good things are  going to happen.
