 Mr. Chairman, I am a proud sponsor of the Violence  Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019.   Violence against women is one of our country's greatest shames. For  over 20 years, VAWA has provided critical protections for survivors of  violence, while also helping them rebuild their lives.   VAWA grants help survivors to access vital resources such as legal  assistance, safe housing, and counseling. VAWA also facilitates  important partnerships between advocates, law enforcement, and the  courts, which further helps survivors in times of crisis and reduces  future violence.   In 2018 alone, because of VAWA grants, the Rhode Island Coalition  Against Domestic Violence served over 8,500 individual victims of  domestic violence, assisted over 2,900 victims in obtaining a  restraining order, and answered over 13,000 crisis line calls.   H.R. 1585 improves upon VAWA by prohibiting persons convicted of  dating violence or misdemeanor stalking from possessing firearms. And  let's be honest. This is the principal objection of my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle, because the powerful gun lobby is scoring  this bill because of that provision.   This bill protects employees from being fired because they are  survivors of sexual assault or domestic violence and ensures survivors'  eligibility to receive unemployment insurance.                                time  1445    Survivors of violence and their families cannot wait any longer as  VAWA continues to stay lapsed.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill in a bipartisan  way so that the American people can see action by Congress, Republicans  and Democrats who are standing up, loudly condemning violence against  women, and reauthorizing VAWA in a new and improved way so that we can  really take on the issue of domestic violence and all the pernicious  consequences of violence against women in this country.   Stand up to the gun lobby. Do what is right for women in America.
