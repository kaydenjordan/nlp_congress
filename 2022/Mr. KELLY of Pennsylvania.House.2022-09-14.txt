 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative DelBene for being with me today.   We are really proud of this bill because it has taken a lot of time  to get there, and it has taken so many people on both sides of the  aisle looking at it and saying this is something that just makes sense.   The purpose of the Improving Seniors' Timely Access to Care Act is  very simple: it is to protect our seniors. They deserve fast, high- quality care when they see their doctor, not bureaucratic paperwork and  delays. Unfortunately, our current prior authorization system often  produces just that.   My office has heard countless stories of Pennsylvanians being  affected by having their care delayed due to prior authorizations. One  ophthalmology practice reported that they had problems getting both of  a patients' eyes authorized for a basic operation because the system  rejected the second eye as a duplicate.   At the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Neurosurgery, doctors  can perform an advanced surgery with a Gamma Knife to control brain  tumors. In many cases, these operations give patients life and more  time. The problem is that it takes prior authorization, and care is  delayed for way, way too long costing patients' valuable time.   As a result, patients lose confidence in the medical system, and they  also begin to lose hope. That is why we are here today, to move the  prior authorization process into the 21st century and give doctors and  health insurance plans the tools they need to make these decisions more  quickly.   The current system allows insurance plans to take weeks to review  prior authorization requests, leaving patients waiting. The process is  often manual, requiring fax machines, phone calls, and paper  submissions, meaning doctors cannot easily appeal these decisions.   The Improving Seniors' Timely Access to Care Act requires prior  authorization decisions to be done faster, helping seniors get care  more quickly. Most routinely approved prior authorization items and  services will receive a real-time electronic response.   For nonroutinely approved items, doctors and patients will have clear  expectations of how long they are going to need to wait for a response,  allowing them to better coordinate their care.   Additionally, health insurance plans must begin to disclose data on  how many prior authorizations they approve or deny, along with an  analysis of how they made that decision.  [[Page H7802]]    Truthfully, I have seen many similar situations in the business I  have been in my whole life. I am an automobile dealer, and when we are  working on an owner's car under warranty, too often it is a negotiation  with a manufacturer on what repairs we are able to do.   The manufacturer does their own time studies on how long they think  it should take and what they think should be repaired. But oftentimes  those time studies are on a brand new car or truck just off the  assembly line. As we all know, living in western Pennsylvania, we have  a lot of steep hills, and we go through really rough winters where  there are a lot of things put on the road--salt and whatever else--that  can corrode different parts once they are in operation.   It is the same story with insurance companies when we are doing  covered auto body work. We have to give the insurance company the  estimates before we ever touch a car or truck, and then continuously  negotiate with them as we get into the tear-down of the vehicle and  find other damage. We have to go back and get authorization to do that,  and that holds up the process.   As much as people say, now, wait, wait, wait, don't compare cars and  trucks and that warranty work to patients. You know what? It is the  same thing. It is the same thing. You are denied access to care that  you need today, not tomorrow, not some time in the future. There is no  reason why you should have to wait for it, not in today's world, and  not with the way we are able to improve all of this.   I know when I talked to Dr. Bera or Dr. Bucshon and especially with  Ms. DelBene, we think: Why in the world are we working on old ways of  getting answers as opposed to being able to get them today and get them  more quickly?   I just think what we are doing makes sense. I would rely more on a  technician who has expert experience than somebody who does time  studies on something that isn't actually the duplicate of what we are  looking to do.    This whole thing is about protecting our seniors, the people who have  done the most for this generation and previous generations, who have  really put their shoulders to the wheel and have never ever complained  and always done what they think is best.   Why in the world would we make it harder for them to get the  healthcare they deserve? Why? That makes absolutely no sense to any of  us. This is not a red concern or a blue concern. It is all about red,  white, and blue. It is about Americans. It is not Republicans or  Democrats or Libertarians or anything else. It is about this body's  obligation to come together on issues that are really critical.   There never should be this type of work that we have had to go  through to get this done. And then all of a sudden last night, by the  way, the CBO decided after 11 months to weigh in on how we would score  this legislation. They waited until the 11th hour, and right after the  11th hour they pulled back what they had said they thought the cost was  going to be.   I don't know how anybody runs a business like that.   I know if I give somebody an estimate or tell somebody something is  going to be done at a certain time--and I know we make commitments to  all of the people we represent, give them the right answer in the right  time. Why make them wait for something that is so basic?   I know we always have this concern about fraud, waste, and abuse. My  complaint really comes down to service. We can complain about a lot of  things, but we cannot complain about what we owe our seniors.   We wrote and rewrote this bill over the course of the last several  years to ensure it was as strong as possible, using everything that is  available to us today to implement, to get answers quicker, not longer,  not put people off, not tell them to wait in the waiting room, not tell  them to stay on hold, but to get them an answer and get them the care  that they need today.                                time  1230    Feedback is important. Honesty is more important. I know Ms. DelBene  and Dr. Bera and Dr. Bucshon and so many of our colleagues agree the  same way, and all the staff members that you mentioned.   This is not something that just happened very quickly and on the back  of an envelope. This is something that a great deal of concern went  into, a great deal of care went into, and a great deal of looking into  went into.   So I am going to thank my colleagues, and I am going to ask everybody  today, when this comes up for a vote, please vote for seniors. Please  vote for all of those who have done so much for all of us. And take  this opportunity to thank them in a way that really makes sense and,  that is, by saying, you have played the game well; you have played the  game long. You have done so much for all of us. Why don't we do  something for all of you?   So I thank my colleague--it has been great--and all our colleagues  for getting on board on this. It has been a really good example of how,  when we actually work together on good policy and don't worry about the  politics of it, amazing, amazing what can get done for the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment also  to thank the Regulatory Relief Coalition because they have been working  hand in hand with us trying to contact as many members as they can. And  today is an example of when we work together, what we can get done.   Mr. Speaker, I present one of the doctors in our Doctors Caucus from  North Carolina, Dr. Murphy, to give his actually on-the-job, on-the- field experience of what it is like to try to work through this massive  group of--I don't know what you call these people. They are hard to  work with and they don't represent us. They do represent something  else. I think we need to represent just our folks back home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   I know Dr. Bera is leaving the floor right now.   So often, when I am home and I am here, we always pick winners and  losers and, somehow, that becomes the main objective of who won, who  lost. So we are worried today about the score. It doesn't matter on the  score because everybody wins on this. There is no loser on this.   And if we can't look to the people who have supported us our whole  lives and have created opportunities that exist in this country on  their backs, what in the world are we doing here?   Well, I can't tell you how much I appreciate the opportunity to be  with Ms. DelBene. This is incredible to get this done today.   I am urging every single Member to vote for this. Please throw out  your scorecard and look at the picture in your wallet of who it is that  parented you or grandparented you and say you know what, wouldn't it be  nice to give them something back after they gave us their whole life?  And let them have some peace of mind.   I don't think there is anything greater in your later years than  peace of mind and being able to know that I am getting healthcare when  I need it. I am not going to have to wait for somebody someplace else  to determine whether I should get it.   So it has been a pleasure working with you. It has been a pleasure  working with all of our colleagues. And for Dr. Marshall, who used to  sit here with us but now is over in the senior area of this magnificent  model--although, I think he is too young to be there. Now, I am sure my  older Senators will say, hey, Kelly, please don't call us old. I won't.  Let's just say the more seasoned Members.   But I am glad we can wrap this up on a really good note. I can't tell  you how good I feel about this, that we can go  [[Page H7804]]  home and tell those people that we represent--I don't care how they  vote. All I want them to know is we care about what they have done for  us, and we are going to be able to supply them some peace of mind.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1245
