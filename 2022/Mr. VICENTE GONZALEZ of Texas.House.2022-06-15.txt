 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at  the desk made in order by the rule.  [[Page H5584]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   My amendment to H.R. 2543, the Federal Reserve Racial and Economic  Equity Act, ensures no changes made by this bill will prohibit  community banks from expanding into underserved areas as defined by the  bill.   Access to credit is a building block for aspiring entrepreneurs and  small business owners and helps create jobs and boost local economic  power and growth.   My amendment helps increase banking opportunities in rural and  underserved areas, and I urge my colleagues to support it and the base  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further  remarks. I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again I urge my  colleagues to support this amendment and the chairwoman's underlying  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
