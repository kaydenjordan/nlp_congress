 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I  demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground  that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum  is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Tottenville Pirates football team on an incredible season that took  them all the way to the New York PSAL championship game at Yankee  Stadium last week.   Now, although they came up just short of their ultimate goal, the  Pirates should be incredibly proud of what they accomplished this  season. After a loss in their season opener, the Pirates bounced back  with a remarkable 11-game winning streak, including a dramatic last- second victory in their first matchup with the eventual champions,  Erasmus Hall.   In the championship game, their star running back, Roland Dempster,  battled through a hamstring injury until he literally couldn't run  anymore and had to be helped off the field by his teammates.   I think I speak for all of Staten Island when I say how incredibly  proud I am of Coach Brian Neville and the entire Pirates team for  putting up a hell of a fight.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating  them, particularly the graduating seniors, and wishing them well in  whatever comes next, both on and off the field.                            ____________________
