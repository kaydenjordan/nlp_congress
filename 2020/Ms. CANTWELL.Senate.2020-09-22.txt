 Madam President, I come to the floor tonight to join my  colleagues to honor the life of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Before I  do, though, I would like to first of all thank my colleague from  Massachusetts for reviewing the many legal decisions that Justice  Ginsburg had been involved in and their significance.   I am so glad to be out here tonight as you took time in your  perspective on the importance of those cases. We definitely need to  remember that these decisions, these words, set the stage for so many  things to come before the American people and for working families.  Thank you for that.                            ____________________     Madam President, before I do, I wanted to say just a  word about Savanna's Act, which, I can tell you, Justice Ginsburg would  probably be happy that the House has now passed and, previously, the  Senate had passed Savanna's Act, legislation that would help protect  the rights and help move forward on changes to law enforcement that  would better protect missing and murdered indigenous women.   This legislation--originally sponsored by my colleagues Heidi  Heitkamp and Lisa Murkowski, and most recently cosponsored by Senator  Murkowski, Senator Cortez Masto, and myself--I believe is on its way to  the President's desk, and I am hoping that the President will sign this  important legislation as soon as possible.   Indigenous women deserve to have the same rights and same protections  under the law, but they need to have people who are tracking these  heinous crimes that are happening because they are the victims of these  crimes at a much higher rate than the general population.   You ask yourself: Well, how can that be? When you think about these  women being abducted and murdered and missing, you have to have law  enforcement who are going to follow these cases, track individuals,  track the court process, and this is what better protocols, better  statistics, and a better system is going to do with the passage of  Savanna's Act. It will give us those tools that we need for indigenous  women.   So I thank all of my colleagues for helping with the passage of that  important legislation. It is on its way to the President's desk, and,  again, I hope he will sign it as soon as possible.                            ____________________     Madam President, I join my colleagues tonight to come  here and honor the life of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. As many people  have said tonight already, what an unbelievable hero she was--a  trailblazer, a deep thinker. And there are the things she did on the  Court to do so many important things for the rights of Americans.   When I first met her in 2001, I had just come to Washington, DC, in  my first year here in the U.S. Senate, and I just happened to go to a  play at the Shakespeare Theatre, here near the Capitol, and had seats  right next to her in the theater. I had probably already heard about  her and knew of her, of course. That was of great significance even in  2001. But during the play, I noticed, just as I do in a dark situation,  oftentimes falling asleep a little bit, and I thought, wow, I don't  know, this woman is so petite and so tiny. And I had heard that she had  been sick. I literally sat there in the dark concerned for her future.   What a lesson about Ruth Bader Ginsburg, because that was 2001. And  in 2020, she was going strong. This is not a woman to ever, ever, ever  underestimate. She took her tools and applied them for the betterment  of American women and American society overall. People across the  United States of America are reeling from her passing because they want  to know who is going to stand up for their rights now that she is gone.   There is something about that diminutive figure with so much might  and wisdom that succeeded on that groove of a Court with all those men  and had the courage and the tenacity to read her dissent in the Lilly  Ledbetter legislation from the bench--the unusual move of saying: I  might not have the decision I want today, but, by God, you are going to  listen to what is wrong with gender inequality in America, and we are  going to get on a path to fix it.   When I think about that unbelievable moment that in her quiet, soft  voice set the stage that we heard our colleague Senator Warren talk  about tonight, it is pretty amazing. That is why we need to have women  in these places. We need to have them so you have the voice of  diversity there to tell you what it is like. And I guarantee you--when  she said that statement, ``I don't ask anything from my brother other  than to get your foot off my neck,'' I guarantee you, she knew what  that was like, and that is why she says it with such conviction.   That is what she represented. That is what she represented as an icon  to so many people, and now they are mourning. I have had 2,000 calls in  just a few days to our office about her passing.   One constituent, Lynn from Shelton, WA, said: I am old enough to have  grown up experiencing the subtle and not so subtle discrimination aimed  at girls and women that have limited our self-expression, our  participation in sports, in politics, college accessibility and  workplace, and even in my family life and reproduction. She continues:  It has been slow progress for each of us to achieve increased equality.  And so we have so much to thank Ruth Bader Ginsburg for. I am deeply  saddened and frightened--frightened by her passing. As you know, our  democracies, freedom, integrity and the rule of law are threatened and  are even at greater risk.   Eileen, from Issaquah, wrote: Justice Ginsburg fought so valiantly  for our rights as women. As women, we provide so much for the  Washington economy.   I agree with her. Women provide a lot for our economy in the State of  Washington.   She continues: I am a business owner myself, and I am terrified that  gender protections are in grave danger. Ensuring civil liberties is not  just the moral  [[Page S5776]]  thing to do, but it makes sound economic policy as well. Allowing more  people more opportunities does not take away from those with power, but  it grows our economy as a State and as a country and allows all of us  to be more prosperous together. That includes reproductive rights,  which is the keystone to allowing women full economic opportunity as  men.   I have to say that letter basically sums it all up. That is what the  fight with Lilly Ledbetter was. I thank Lilly Ledbetter. I thank Lilly  Ledbetter for having the courage to file that case and stand up to that  discrimination and basically fight a long process that people still  don't understand. We do not have pay equity in America yet. We still  are not making the same amount as men.   Ruth Ginsburg made a decision that set the course for the Lilly  Ledbetter law, which basically says that instead of saying our time to  file a case for discrimination runs out after a year when we don't even  know we have been discriminated against, we should have a longer period  of time to file that case. All we are going to get is our day in court.   I thank both Lilly Ledbetter and Justice Ginsburg for that because  they were women standing up in an incredible environment, with men  surrounding them, and speaking truth to power about what needed to  happen, as my constituent says here, for full economic opportunities  for all people.   I can't tell you how many men I have heard say: I want equal pay for  women. I want equal pay for women because I want my wife to make a  decent salary. I want her to bring home as much as she can bring home.  I don't want her discriminated against.   Yet when Justice Ginsburg set us up for the Lilly Ledbetter  legislation and we came here to the Senate floor, I heard the most  unbelievable speeches here on the Senate floor. Colleagues of ours  basically said things like: Well, if you would just be as qualified as  a man, we will pay you as much as a man.   The disconnect still exists. The pay inequity still exists. But the  course of action has been set by Justice Ginsburg, and we just have to  pick up the torch and carry this to the finish line because it is good  for our economy. It is good for our society. It is good for women to  have the type of participation that--when you are paid equally to a  man, you can continue to contribute in society.   Already, 2,000 people have written to me. It is unbelievable what she  has done to touch the hearts of Americans.   A father from Bellingham wrote: Mostly, I mourn for the future of my  4-year-old daughter. The prospects of women losing their right to  choose and an erosion of gender equality is frightening.   Another constituent, Katie, wrote: Even though the air this morning  looks relatively clear again in Seattle--a little reference to all our  fire and smoke--our future is foggier than ever. While I mourn the  death of Justice Ginsburg, I cannot help but feel tremendous anxiety  about the future of existing laws in effect that protect all people's  rights, from legal abortions to access to healthcare, to laws that  protect our votes and our freedom of speech and laws that Justice  Ginsburg protected.   That is really what is going on here in America. This movement about  RBG is saying: You stood up to protect us, and now you are gone, and  what is going to happen?   I definitely pause in this for a little comment about our Senate  schedule. I don't get it. We can sit here and argue back and forth  about what people said when and how and all of that. What I don't  understand is this: It takes time to review the record of someone for a  lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court in which these important  issues to working families and whether they have as much power and as  much clout and as much standing as a corporation in America--people  want to know where they stand.   Somehow, people are already talking about schedules. I don't  understand. How can you decide what the schedule is when you haven't  even heard the name of a person? How do you move forward with a  schedule when you don't even know--maybe this person is going to end up  being Harriet Miers. Maybe you are going to look at their record and  say: It is Harriet Miers, and I don't want to move forward because I  looked at her record, and I decided maybe this is not the jurist I want  at this point in time.   All I am saying is, I don't understand how somebody can set a course  of action in a schedule when you don't even know who the person is,  what the process is going to be, or the length of time. You are setting  a horrible precedent. You are saying to people that it doesn't even  matter what the name is; you already have a schedule. It doesn't matter  how long it is going to take to review.   It is very hard here to not have frustration when my citizens have  fought so hard for these rights, and Justice Ginsburg's passing has  upset them so much that they need to hear from us about how a fair and  deliberative process--the last wishes of Justice Ginsburg--is going to  be honored.   I would like to add in the Record the full dissent that was read from  the bench from Justice Ginsburg in the Lilly Ledbetter case   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   Supreme Court of the United States, Lilly M. Ledbetter, Petitioner v.                  The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Inc.     on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the                       eleventh circuit--May 29, 2007         Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice       Souter, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.        Lilly Ledbetter was a supervisor at Goodyear Tire and       Rubber's plant in Gadsden, Alabama, from 1979 until her       retirement in 1998. For most of those years, she worked as an       area manager, a position largely occupied by men. Initially,       Ledbetter's salary was in line with the salaries of men       performing substantially similar work. Over time, however,       her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area       managers with equal or less seniority. By the end of 1997,       Ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and       the pay discrepancy between Ledbetter and her 15 male       counterparts was stark: Ledbetter was paid $3,727 per month;       the lowest paid male area manager received $4,286 per month,       the highest paid, $5,236. See 421 F. 3d 1169, 1174 (CAl 1       2005); Brief for Petitioner 4.        Ledbetter launched charges of discrimination before the       Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in March 1998.       Her formal administrative complaint specified that, in       violation of Title VII, Goodyear paid her a discriminatorily       low salary because of her sex. See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-      2(a)(1) (rendering it unlawful for an employer ``to       discriminate against any individual with respect to [her]       compensation . . . because of such individual's . . . sex'').       That charge was eventually tried to a jury, which found it       ``more likely than not that [Goodyear] paid [Ledbetter] a[n]       unequal salary because of her sex.'' App. 102. In accord with       the jury's liability determination, the District Court       entered judgment for Ledbetter for backpay and damages, plus       counsel fees and costs.        The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed.       Relying on Goodyear's system of annual merit-based raises,       the court held that Ledbetter's claim, in relevant part, was       time barred. 421 F. 3d, at 1171, 1182-1183. Title VII       provides that a charge of discrimination ``shall be filed       within [180] days after the alleged unlawful employment       practice occurred.'' 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(e)(1). Ledbetter       charged, and proved at trial, that within the 180-day period,       her pay was substantially less than the pay of men doing the       same work. Further, she introduced evidence sufficient to       establish that discrimination against female managers at the       Gadsden plant, not performance inadequacies on her part,       accounted for the pay differential. See, e.g., App. 36-47,       51-68, 82-87, 90-98, 112-113. That evidence was unavailing,       the Eleventh Circuit held, and the Court today agrees,       because it was incumbent on Ledbetter to file charges year-      by-year, each time Goodyear failed to increase her salary       commensurate with the salaries of male peers. Any annual pay       decision not contested immediately (within 180 days), the       Court affirms, becomes grandfathered, a fait accompli beyond       the province of Title VII ever to repair.        The Court's insistence on immediate contest overlooks       common characteristics of pay discrimination. Pay disparities       often occur, as they did in Ledbetter's case, in small       increments; cause to suspect that discrimination is at work       develops only over time. Comparative pay information,       moreover, is often hidden from the employee's view. Employers       may keep under wraps the pay differentials maintained among       supervisors, no less the reasons for those differentials.       Small initial discrepancies may not be seen as meet for a       federal case, particularly when the employee, trying to       succeed in a nontraditional environment, is averse to making       waves.        Pay disparities are thus significantly different from       adverse actions ``such as termination, failure to promote, .       . . or refusal to hire,'' all involving fully communicated       discrete acts, ``easy to identify'' as discriminatory. See       National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, 536 U.S.       101, 114 (2002). It  [[Page S5777]]       is only when the disparity becomes apparent and sizable,       e.g., through future raises calculated as a percentage of       current salaries, that an employee in Ledbetter's situation       is likely to comprehend her plight and, therefore, to       complain. Her initial readiness to give her employer the       benefit of the doubt should not preclude her from later       challenging the then current and continuing payment of a wage       depressed on account of her sex.        On questions of time under Title VII, we have identified as       the critical inquiries: ``What constitutes an `unlawful       employment practice' and when has that practice `occurred'?''       Id., at 110. Our precedent suggests, and lower courts have       overwhelmingly held, that the unlawful practice is the       current payment of salaries infected by gender-based (or       race-based) discrimination--a practice that occurs whenever a       paycheck delivers less to a woman than to a similarly       situated man. See Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 395       (1986) (Brennan, J., joined by all other Members of the       Court, concurring in part).      I.        Title VII proscribes as an ``unlawful employment practice''       discrimination ``against any individual with respect to his       compensation . . . because of such individual's race, color,       religion, sex, or national origin.'' 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-      2(a)(1). An individual seeking to challenge an employment       practice under this proscription must file a charge with the       EEOC within 180 days ``after the alleged unlawful employment       practice occurred.'' Sec. 2000e-5(e)(1). See ante, at 4;       supra, at 2, n. 1.        Ledbetter's petition presents a question important to the       sound application of Title VII: What activity qualifies as an       unlawful employment practice in cases of discrimination with       respect to compensation. One answer identifies the pay-      setting decision, and that decision alone, as the unlawful       practice. Under this view, each particular salary-setting       decision is discrete from prior and subsequent decisions, and       must be challenged within 180 days on pain of forfeiture.       Another response counts both the pay-setting decision and the       actual payment of a discriminatory wage as unlawful       practices. Under this approach, each payment of a wage or       salary infected by sex-based discrimination constitutes an       unlawful employment practice; prior decisions, outside the       180-day charge-filing period, are not themselves actionable,       but they are relevant in determining the lawfulness of       conduct within the period. The Court adopts the first view,       see ante, at 1, 4, 9, but the second is more faithful to       precedent, more in tune with the realities of the workplace,       and more respectful of Title VII' s remedial purpose.      A        In Bazemore, we unanimously held that an employer, the       North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service, committed an       unlawful employment practice each time it paid black       employees less than similarly situated white employees. 478       U.S., at 395 (opinion of Brennan, J.). Before 1965, the       Extension Service was divided into two branches: a white       branch and a ``Negro branch.'' Id., at 390. Employees in the       ``Negro branch'' were paid less than their white       counterparts. In response to the Civil Rights Act of 1964,       which included Title VII, the State merged the two branches       into a single organization, made adjustments to reduce the       salary disparity, and began giving annual raises based on       nondiscriminatory factors. Id., at 390-391, 394-395.       Nonetheless, ``some preexisting salary disparities continued       to linger on.'' Id., at 394 (internal quotation marks       omitted). We rejected the Court of Appeals' conclusion that       the plaintiffs could not prevail because the lingering       disparities were simply a continuing effect of a decision       lawfully made prior to the effective date of Title VII. See       Id., at 395-396. Rather, we reasoned, ``[e]ach week's       paycheck that delivers less to a black than to a similarly       situated white is a wrong actionable under Title VII.'' Id.,       at 395. Paychecks perpetuating past discrimination, we thus       recognized, are actionable not simply because they are       ``related'' to a decision made outside the charge-filing       period, cf. ante, at 17, but because they discriminate anew       each time they issue, see Bazemore, 478 U.S., at 395-396, and       n. 6; Morgan, 536 U.S., at 111-112.        Subsequently, in Morgan, we set apart, for purposes of       Title VII's timely filing requirement, unlawful employment       actions of two kinds: ``discrete acts'' that are ``easy to       identify'' as discriminatory, and acts that recur and are       cumulative in impact. See Id., at 110, 113-115. ``[A]       [d]iscrete ac[t] such as termination, failure to promote,       denial of transfer, or refusal to hire,'' Id., at 114, we       explained, `` `occur[s]' on the day that it `happen[s].' A       party, therefore, must file a charge within . . . 180 . . .       days of the date of the act or lose the ability to recover       for it.'' Id., at 110; see Id., at 113 (``[D]iscrete       discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even       when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed       charges. Each discrete discriminatory act starts a new clock       for filing charges alleging that act.'').        ``[D]ifferent in kind from discrete acts,'' we made clear,       are ``claims . . . based on the cumulative effect of       individual acts.'' Id., at 115. The Morgan decision placed       hostile work environment claims in that category. ``Their       very nature involves repeated conduct.'' Ibid. ``The unlawful       employment practice'' in hostile work environment claims,       ``cannot be said to occur on any particular day. It occurs       over a series of days or perhaps years and, in direct       contrast to discrete acts, a single act of harassment may not       be actionable on its own.'' Ibid. (internal quotation marks       omitted). The persistence of the discriminatory conduct both       indicates that management should have known of its existence       and produces a cognizable harm. Ibid. Because the very nature       of the hostile work environment claim involves repeated       conduct,        ``[i]t does not matter, for purposes of the statute, that       some of the component acts of the hostile work environment       fall outside the statutory time period. Provided that an act       contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period,       the entire time period of the hostile environment may be       considered by a court for the purposes of determining       liability.'' Id., at 117.        Consequently, although the unlawful conduct began in the       past, ``a charge may be filed at a later date and still       encompass the whole.'' Ibid.        Pay disparities, of the kind Ledbetter experienced, have a       closer kinship to hostile work environment claims than to       charges of a single episode of discrimination. Ledbetter's       claim, resembling Morgan's, rested not on one particular       paycheck, but on ``the cumulative effect of individual       acts.'' See id., at 115. See also Brief for Petitioner 13,       15-17, and n. 9 (analogizing Ledbetter's claim to the       recurring and cumulative harm at issue in Morgan); Reply       Brief for Petitioner 13 (distinguishing pay discrimination       from ``easy to identify'' discrete acts (internal quotation       marks omitted)). She charged insidious discrimination       building up slowly but steadily. See Brief for Petitioner 5-      8. Initially in line with the salaries of men performing       substantially the same work, Ledbetter's salary fell 15 to 40       percent behind her male counterparts only after successive       evaluations and percentage-based pay adjustments. See supra,       at 1-2. Over time, she alleged and proved, the repetition of       pay decisions undervaluing her work gave rise to the current       discrimination of which she complained. Though component acts       fell outside the charge-filing period, with each new       paycheck, Goodyear contributed incrementally to the       accumulating harm. See Morgan, 536 U.S., at 117; Bazemore,       478 U.S., at 395-396; cf. Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe       Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, n. 15 (1968).      B        The realities of the workplace reveal why the       discrimination with respect to compensation that Ledbetter       suffered does not fit within the category of singular       discrete acts ``easy to identify.'' A worker knows       immediately if she is denied a promotion or transfer, if she       is fired or refused employment. And promotions, transfers,       hirings, and firings are generally public events, known to       co-workers. When an employer makes a decision of such open       and definitive character, an employee can immediately seek       out an explanation and evaluate it for pretext. Compensation       disparities, in contrast, are often hidden from sight. It is       not unusual, decisions in point illustrate, for management to       decline to publish employee pay levels, or for employees to       keep private their own salaries. See, e.g., Goodwin v.       General Motors Corp., 275 F. 3d 1005, 1008-1009 (CA10 2002)       (plaintiff did not know what her colleagues earned until a       printout listing of salaries appeared on her desk, seven       years after her starting salary was set lower than her co-      workers' salaries); McMillan v. Massachusetts Soc. for the       Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 140 F. 3d 288, 296 (CA1       1998) (plaintiff worked for employer for years before       learning of salary disparity published in a newspaper).       Tellingly, as the record in this case bears out, Goodyear       kept salaries confidential; employees had only limited access       to information regarding their colleagues' earnings. App. 56-      57, 89.        The problem of concealed pay discrimination is particularly       acute where the disparity arises not because the female       employee is flatly denied a raise but because male       counterparts are given larger raises. Having received a pay       increase, the female employee is unlikely to discern at once       that she has experienced an adverse employment decision. She       may have little reason even to suspect discrimination until a       pattern develops incrementally and she ultimately becomes       aware of the disparity. Even if an employee suspects that the       reason for a comparatively low raise is not performance but       sex (or another protected ground), the amount involved may       seem too small, or the employer's intent too ambiguous, to       make the issue immediately actionable--or winnable.        Further separating pay claims from the discrete employment       actions identified in Morgan, an employer gains from sex-      based pay disparities in a way it does not from a       discriminatory denial of promotion, hiring, or transfer. When       a male employee is selected over a female for a higher level       position, someone still gets the promotion and is paid a       higher salary; the employer is not enriched. But when a woman       is paid less than a similarly situated man, the employer       reduces its costs each time the pay differential is       implemented. Furthermore, decisions on promotions, like       decisions installing seniority systems, often implicate the       interests of third-party employees in a way that pay       differentials do not. Cf. Teamsters v. United States, 431       U.S. 324, 352-353 (1977) (recognizing that seniority systems       involve ``vested . . . rights of employees'' and concluding       that Title VII was not intended to ``destroy or water down''       those rights). Disparate pay, by contrast, can be remedied at       any time solely at the expense of the employer who acts in a       discriminatory fashion.  [[Page S5778]]       C        In light of the significant differences between pay       disparities and discrete employment decisions of the type       identified in Morgan, the cases on which the Court relies       hold no sway. See ante, at 5-10 (discussing United Air Lines.       Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553 (1977), Delaware State College v.       Ricks, 449 U.S. 250 (1980), and Lorance v. AT&T Technologies,       Inc., 490 U.S. 900 (1989)). Evans and Ricks both involved a       single, immediately identifiable act of discrimination: in       Evans, a constructive discharge, 431 U.S., at 554; in Ricks,       a denial of tenure, 449 U.S., at 252. In each case, the       employee filed charges well after the discrete discriminatory       act occurred: When United Airlines forced Evans to resign       because of its policy barring married female flight       attendants, she filed no charge; only four years later, when       Evans was rehired, did she allege that the airline's former       no-marriage rule was unlawful and therefore should not       operate to deny her seniority credit for her prior service.       See Evans, 431 U.S., at 554-557. Similarly, when Delaware       State College denied Ricks tenure, he did not object until       his terminal contract came to an end, one year later. Ricks,       449 U.S., at 253-254, 257-258. No repetitive, cumulative       discriminatory employment practice was at issue in either       case. See Evans, 431 U.S., at 557-558; Ricks, 449 U.S., at       258.        Lorance is also inapposite, for, in this Court's view, it       too involved a one-time discrete act: the adoption of a new       seniority system that ``had its genesis in sex       discrimination.'' See 490 U.S., at 902, 905 (internal       quotation marks omitted). The Court's extensive reliance on       Lorance, ante, at 7-9, 14, 17-18, moreover, is perplexing for       that decision is no longer effective: In the 1991 Civil       Rights Act, Congress superseded Lorance's holding. 112, 105       Stat. 1079 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-      5(e)(2)). Repudiating our judgment that a facially neutral       seniority system adopted with discriminatory intent must be       challenged immediately, Congress provided:        ``For purposes of this section, an unlawful employment       practice occurs . . . when the seniority system is adopted,       when an individual becomes subject to the seniority system,       or when a person aggrieved is injured by the application of       the seniority system or provision of the system.'' Ibid.        Congress thus agreed with the dissenters in Lorance that       ``the harsh reality of [that] decision,'' was ``glaringly at       odds with the purposes of Title VII.'' 490 U.S., at 914       (opinion of Marshall, J.). See also Sec. 3, 105 Stat. 1071       (1991 Civil Rights Act was designed ``to respond to recent       decisions of the Supreme Court by expanding the scope of       relevant civil rights statutes in order to provide adequate       protection to victims of discrimination'').        True, Sec. 112 of the 1991 Civil Rights Act directly       addressed only seniority systems. See ante, at 8, and n. 2.       But Congress made clear (1) its view that this Court had       unduly contracted the scope of protection afforded by Title       VII and other civil rights statutes, and (2) its aim to       generalize the ruling in Bazemore. As the Senate Report       accompanying the proposed Civil Rights Act of 1990, the       precursor to the 1991 Act, explained:        ``Where, as was alleged in Lorance, an employer adopts a       rule or decision with an unlawful discriminatory motive, each       application of that rule or decision is a new violation of       the law. In Bazemore . . . , for example, . . . the Supreme       Court properly held that each application of th[e] racially       motivated salary structure, i.e., each new paycheck,       constituted a distinct violation of Title VII. Section       7(a)(2) generalizes the result correctly reached in       Bazemore.'' Civil Rights Act of 1990, S. Rep. No. 101-315, p.       54 (1990).        See also 137 Cong. Rec. 29046, 29047 (1991) (Sponsors'       Interpretative Memorandum) (``This legislation should be       interpreted as disapproving the extension of [Lorance] to       contexts outside of seniority systems.''), But cf. ante, at       18 (relying on Lorance to conclude that ``when an employer       issues paychecks pursuant to a system that is facially       nondiscriminatory and neutrally applied'' a new Title VII       violation does not occur (internal quotation marks omitted)).        Until today, in the more than 15 years since Congress       amended Title VII, the Court had not once relied upon       Lorance. It is mistaken to do so now. Just as Congress'       ``goals in enacting Title VII . . . never included conferring       absolute immunity on discriminatorily adopted seniority       systems that survive their first [180] days,'' 490 U.S., at       914 (Marshall, J., dissenting), Congress never intended to       immunize forever discriminatory pay differentials       unchallenged within 180 days of their adoption. This       assessment gains weight when one comprehends that even a       relatively minor pay disparity will expand exponentially over       an employee's working life if raises are set as a percentage       of prior pay.        A clue to congressional intent can be found in Title VII's       backpay provision. The statute expressly provides that       backpay may be awarded for a period of up to two years before       the discrimination charge is filed. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-      5(g)(l) (``Back pay liability shall not accrue from a date       more than two years prior to the filing of a charge with the       Commission.''). This prescription indicates that Congress       contemplated challenges to pay discrimination commencing       before, but continuing into, the 180-day filing period. See       Morgan, 536 U.S., at 119 (``If Congress intended to limit       liability to conduct occurring in the period within which the       party must file the charge, it seems unlikely that Congress       would have allowed recovery for two years of backpay.''). As       we recognized in Morgan, ``the fact that Congress expressly       limited the amount of recoverable damages elsewhere to a       particular time period [i.e., two years] indicates that the       [180-day] timely filing provision was not meant to serve as a       specific limitation . . . [on] the conduct that may be       considered.'' Ibid.      D        In tune with the realities of wage discrimination, the       Courts of Appeals have overwhelmingly judged as a present       violation the payment of wages infected by discrimination:       Each paycheck less than the amount payable had the employer       adhered to a nondiscriminatory compensation regime, courts       have held, constitutes a cognizable harm. See, e.g., Forsyth       v. Federation Employment and Guidance Serv., 409 F. 3d 565,       573 (CA2 2005) (``Any paycheck given within the [charge-      filing] period . . . would be actionable, even if based on a       discriminatory pay scale set up outside of the statutory       period.''); Shea v. Rice, 409 F. 3d 448, 452--453 (CADC 2005)       (``[An] employer commit[s] a separate unlawful employment       practice each time he pa[ys] one employee less than another       for a discriminatory reason'' (citing Bazemore, 478 U.S., at       396)); Goodwin v. General Motors Corp., 275 F. 3d 1005, 1009-      1010 (CA10 2002) (``[Bazemore] has taught a crucial       distinction with respect to discriminatory disparities in       pay, establishing that a discriminatory salary is not merely       a lingering effect of past discrimination instead it is       itself a continually recurring violation . . . . [E]ach race-      based discriminatory salary payment constitutes a fresh       violation of Title VII.'' (footnote omitted)); Anderson v.       Zubieta, 180 F. 3d 329, 335 (CADC 1999) (``The Courts of       Appeals have repeatedly reached the . . . conclusion'' that       pay discrimination is ``actionable upon receipt of each       paycheck.''); accord Hildebrandt v. Illinois Dept. of Natural       Resources, 347 F. 3d 1014, 1025-1029 (CA7 2003); Cardenas v.       Massey, 269 F. 3d 251, 257 (CA3 2001); Ashley v. Boyle's       Famous Corned Beef Co., 66 F. 3d 164, 167-168 (CA8 1995) (en       banc); Brinkley-Obu v. Hughes Training, Inc., 36 F. 3d 336,       347-349 (CA4 1994); Gibbs v. Pierce County Law Enforcement       Support Agency, 785 F. 2d 1396, 1399-1400 (CA9 1986).        Similarly in line with the real-world characteristics of       pay discrimination, the EEOC--the federal agency responsible       for enforcing Title VII, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C.       Sec. Sec. 2000e-5(f)--has interpreted the Act to permit       employees to challenge disparate pay each time it is       received. The EEOC's Compliance Manual provides that       ``repeated occurrences of the same discriminatory employment       action, such as discriminatory paychecks, can be challenged       as long as one discriminatory act occurred within the charge       filing period.'' 2 EEOC Compliance Manual Sec. 2-IV-C(1)(a),       p. 605:0024, and n. 183 (2006); cf. id., Sec. 10-III, p.       633:0002 (Title VII requires an employer to eliminate pay       disparities attributable to a discriminatory system, even if       that system has been discontinued).        The EEOC has given effect to its interpretation in a series       of administrative decisions. See Albritton v. Potter, No.       01A44063, 2004 WL 2983682, *2 (EEOC Office of Fed.       Operations, Dec. 17, 2004) (although disparity arose and       employee became aware of the disparity outside the charge-      filing period, claim was not time barred because ``[e]ach       paycheck that complainant receives which is less than that of       similarly situated employees outside of her protected classes       could support a claim under Title VII if discrimination is       found to be the reason for the pay discrepancy.'' (citing       Bazemore, 478 U.S., at 396)). See also Bynum-Doles v. Winter,       No. 01A53973, 2006 WL 2096290 (EEOC Office of Fed.       Operations, July 18, 2006); Ward v. Potter, No. 01A60047,       2006 WL 721992 (EEOC Office of Fed. Operations, Mar. 10,       2006). And in this very case, the EEOC urged the Eleventh       Circuit to recognize that Ledbetter's failure to challenge       any particular pay-setting decision when that decision was       made ``does not deprive her of the right to seek relief for       discriminatory paychecks she received in 1997 and 1998.''       Brief of EEOC in Support of Petition for Rehearing and       Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc, in No. 03-15264-GG (CA11),       p. 14 (hereinafter EEOC Brief) (citing Morgan, 536 U.S., at       113).      II        The Court asserts that treating pay discrimination as a       discrete act, limited to each particular paysetting decision,       is necessary to ``protec[t] employers from the burden of       defending claims arising from employment decisions that are       long past.'' Ante, at 11 (quoting Ricks, 449 U.S., at 256-      257). But the discrimination of which Ledbetter complained is       not long past. As she alleged, and as the jury found,       Goodyear continued to treat Ledbetter differently because of       sex each pay period, with mounting harm. Allowing employees       to challenge discrimination ``that extend[s] over long       periods of time,'' into the charge-filing period, we have       previously explained, ``does not leave employers       defenseless'' against unreasonable or prejudicial delay.       Morgan, 536 U.S., at 121. Employers disadvantaged by such       delay may raise various defenses. Id., at 122. Doctrines such       as ``waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling'' ``allow us to       honor Title VII's remedial purpose without negating the       particular purpose of the filing requirement, to give prompt       notice to the employer.'' Id., at 121 (quoting Zipes v. Trans       World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 398 (1982)); see 536       U.S., at 121 (defense of laches may be invoked to block an       employee's suit ``if he unreasonably delays in filing       [charges] and as a result harms the defendant''); EEOC Brief       15 (``[I]f  [[Page S5779]]       Ledbetter unreasonably delayed challenging an earlier       decision, and that delay significantly impaired Goodyear's       ability to defend itself . . . Goodyear can raise a defense       of laches . . . .'').        In a last-ditch argument, the Court asserts that this       dissent would allow a plaintiff to sue on a single decision       made 20 years ago ``even if the employee had full knowledge       of all the circumstances relating to the . . . decision at       the time it was made.'' Ante, at 20. It suffices to point out       that the defenses just noted would make such a suit       foolhardy. No sensible judge would tolerate such inexcusable       neglect. See Morgan, 536 U.S., at 121 (``In such cases, the       federal courts have the discretionary power . . . to locate a       just result in light of the circumstances peculiar to the       case.'' (internal quotation marks omitted)).        Ledbetter, the Court observes, ante, at 21, n. 9, dropped       an alternative remedy she could have pursued: Had she       persisted in pressing her claim under the Equal Pay Act of       1963 (EPA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 206(d), she would not have       encountered a time bar. See ante, at 21 (``If Ledbetter had       pursued her EPA claim, she would not face the Title VII       obstacles that she now confronts.''); cf. Corning Glass Works       v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 208-210 (1974). Notably, the EPA       provides no relief when the pay discrimination charged is       based on race, religion, national origin, age, or disability.       Thus, in truncating the Title VII rule this Court announced       in Bazemore, the Court does not disarm female workers from       achieving redress for unequal pay, but it does impede racial       and other minorities from gaining similar relief.        Furthermore, the difference between the EPA's prohibition       against paying unequal wages and Title VII's ban on       discrimination with regard to compensation is not as large as       the Court's opinion might suggest. See ante, at 21. The key       distinction is that Title VII requires a showing of intent.       In practical effect, ``if the trier of fact is in equipoise       about whether the wage differential is motivated by gender       discrimination,'' Title VII compels a verdict for the       employer, while the EPA compels a verdict for the plaintiff.       2 C. Sullivan, M. Zimmer, & R. White, Employment       Discrimination: Law and Practice Sec. 7.08[F][3], p. 532 (3d       ed. 2002). In this case, Ledbetter carried the burden of       persuading the jury that the pay disparity she suffered was       attributable to intentional sex discrimination. See supra, at       1-2; infra, this page and 18.       III         To show how far the Court has strayed from interpretation       of Title VII with fidelity to the Act's core purpose, I       return to the evidence Ledbetter presented at trial.       Ledbetter proved to the jury the following: She was a member       of a protected class; she performed work substantially equal       to work of the dominant class (men); she was compensated less       for that work; and the disparity was attributable to gender-      based discrimination. See supra, at 1-2.        Specifically, Ledbetter's evidence demonstrated that her       current pay was discriminatorily low due to a long series of       decisions reflecting Goodyear's pervasive discrimination       against women managers in general and Ledbetter in       particular. Ledbetter's former supervisor, for example,       admitted to the jury that Ledbetter's pay, during a       particular one-year period, fell below Goodyear's minimum       threshold for her position. App. 93-97. Although Goodyear       claimed the pay disparity was due to poor performance, the       supervisor acknowledged that Ledbetter received a ``Top       Performance Award'' in 1996. Id., at 90-93. The jury also       heard testimony that another supervisor--who evaluated       Ledbetter in 1997 and whose evaluation led to her most recent       raise denial--was openly biased against women. Id., at 46,       77-82. And two women who had previously worked as managers at       the plant told the jury they had been subject to pervasive       discrimination and were paid less than their male       counterparts. One was paid less than the men she supervised.       Id., at 51-68. Ledbetter herself testified about the       discriminatory animus conveyed to her by plant officials.       Toward the end of her career, for instance, the plant manager       told Ledbetter that the ``plant did not need women, that       [women] didn't help it, [and] caused problems.'' Id., at 36.       After weighing all the evidence, the jury found for       Ledbetter, concluding that the pay disparity was due to       intentional discrimination.        Yet, under the Court's decision, the discrimination       Ledbetter proved is not redressable under Title VII. Each and       every pay decision she did not immediately challenge wiped       the slate clean. Consideration may not be given to the       cumulative effect of a series of decisions that, together,       set her pay well below that of every male area manager.       Knowingly carrying past pay discrimination forward must be       treated as lawful conduct. Ledbetter may not be compensated       for the lower pay she was in fact receiving when she       complained to the EEOC. Nor, were she still employed by       Goodyear, could she gain, on the proof she presented at       trial, injunctive relief requiring, prospectively, her       receipt of the same compensation men receive for       substantially similar work. The Court's approbation of these       consequences is totally at odds with the robust protection       against workplace discrimination Congress intended Title VII       to secure. See, e.g., Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S.,       at 348 (``The primary purpose of Title VII was to assure       equality of employment opportunities and to eliminate . . .       discriminatory practices and devices. . . .'' (internal       quotation marks omitted)); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422       U.S. 405, 418 (1975) (``It is . . . the purpose of Title VII       to make persons whole for injuries suffered on account of       unlawful employment discrimination.'').        This is not the first time the Court has ordered a cramped       interpretation of Title VII, incompatible with the statute's       broad remedial purpose. See supra, at 10-12. See also Wards       Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642 (1989) (superseded       in part by the Civil Rights Act of 1991); Price Waterhouse v.       Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989) (plurality opinion) (same); 1 B.       Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 2 (3d       ed. 1996) (``A spate of Court decisions in the late 1980s       drew congressional fire and resulted in demands for       legislative change[,]'' culminating in the 1991 Civil Rights       Act (footnote omitted)). Once again, the ball is in Congress'       court. As in 1991, the Legislature may act to correct this       Court's parsimonious reading of Title VII.        * * *        For the reasons stated, I would hold that Ledbetter's claim       is not time barred and would reverse the Eleventh Circuit's       judgment.    In that dissent, Justice Ginsburg said:         The problem of concealed pay discrimination is particularly       acute where the disparity arises not because the female       employee is flatly denied a raise but because male       counterparts are given larger raises. Having received a pay       increase, the female employee is unlikely to discern at once       that she has experienced an adverse employment decision. She       may have little reason to suspect discrimination until a       pattern develops incrementally and she ultimately becomes       aware of the disparity.    Again, I think of what bravery Justice Ginsburg showed in saying to  our colleagues that this dissent was so important, to read it from the  bench.   Not everything in the legislative or legal process is easy. It takes  bringing awareness to our colleagues, and clearly there is a lot of  awareness that needs to continue to happen here. This is about working  families and their desire to have healthcare coverage for preexisting  conditions, protection of reproductive rights, hundreds of thousands of  Dreamers wanting to know what the future looks like, and obviously  LGBTQ rights and whether they are going to be set back.   I think of the other time that I had a great interaction with Justice  Ginsburg. When I also first got here, we had this dinner every year.  The Senator from Hawaii will find this interesting. We in the Senate  would be invited--Democrats and Republicans--to have dinner with the  Supreme Court. It was a great night. We would go over to the Court, and  we would have dinner.   Actually, the Justices would open up their offices, and we could tour  around. I thought it was really interesting. If you know anything about  people, you can almost see how their mind works by the desk they keep.  Some people keep a messy desk, but they know where every piece of paper  is on the desk. Other people have a very neat desk.   The whole thing--letting us into their Chambers, talking about the  decorum of the Supreme Court, how they shook hands every day, how they  all worked with each other to try to keep comity among the decisions  when you are going to disagree every day--was very interesting.   We usually had some entertainment. But it was kind of a moment where  we all said: We are in this together, and we are going to keep moving  forward.   Several years later--I am not sure whose decision it was--I think  maybe around--I am not sure what year they disbanded that. They  decided: We are not doing that anymore.   I asked: Why aren't we doing this?   This is one of the greatest things we have done around here because  Democrats and Republicans would get together with the members of the  Court and other people relevant to our associations, and we would share  a meal and talk and say that this was about civility and working  together--obviously a very divided branch as it relates to the Senate  and the judiciary.   But nonetheless I so appreciated the fact that even though that was  disbanded, Justice Ginsburg invited the women for dinner. She invited  the women Senators to come over for dinner. I think we might have  invited a few of our ex-colleagues. I think Olympia Snowe, the former  Congresswoman from Maine, might have been there. So we invited some of  our old colleagues. It might have been a dinner for a newly added  Justice to the Court. Nonetheless, guess what we got with dinner. Great  opera. Great opera. In fact, she had I think two singers there that  evening and entertained us.  [[Page S5780]]    It is that kind of spirit of people working together and showing  that. I think that was probably what her relationship was with Antonin  Scalia. It was probably, yes, we are not always going to agree, but we  are going to work together, and we are going to figure out how to make  the best of this situation and move forward.   I remember that. Even though this thing had been disbanded, she still  took the time--at least with the women--to say: Do you know what? We  can all still work together.   Whoever said the statement ``Good things come in small packages'' had  it down when it came to Justice Ginsburg because in that very small  package came a lot of wisdom that got applied to the rights  particularly of women in the United States of America with a calm but  forceful voice that has moved this ball down the road. It is up to all  of us to continue her legacy and get equal pay for equal work and  continue to protect these rights that are well established in the  United States of America.   My thoughts and prayers are with the Ginsburg family.   I yield the floor.
