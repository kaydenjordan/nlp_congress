 Mr. President, due to my concerns related to violations of  the Fourth Amendment, I will object to any unanimous consent request,  motion, or waiver of any rule in relation to Treaty Doc. 111-8.   I cannot support action that provides for the bulk collection of the  financial records of U.S. citizens. The benefits of the treaty  agreement should not come at the grave expense of endangering regular  foreign investment and violating the constitutionally protected right  of every American to be free from unreasonable suspicionless searches.  [[Page S4675]]    Previous tax treaties were more focused on information specific to  suspicions of fraud and required serious allegations of tax wrongdoing  to be supported by evidence. The new bulk collection provisions,  however, demand Americans' records under a vague standard that allows  the government to access personal financial information that may be  ``relevant'' through information exchanges between the U.S. and foreign  governments. This new, lower, and ambiguous threshold would allow  government access to bank records for hardly any reason at all. I do  not condone tax cheats, but I cannot support an effort that punishes  every American in pursuit of those that have actually broken the law.   Accordingly, I will object to any unanimous consent request, motion,  or waiver or any rule in relation to Treaty Doc. 111-8.                            ____________________     Mr. President, due to my concerns related to violations of  the Fourth Amendment, I will object to any unanimous consent request,  motion, or waiver of any rule in relation to Treaty Doc. 112-1.
