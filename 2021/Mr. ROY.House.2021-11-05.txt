 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding.   I am interested to hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  [[Page H6220]]  who designate themselves as moderates running around saying that they  need a CBO score. Yet, we know this isn't paid for. We all know it is a  lie.   But you know what you don't need a CBO score for? You don't need a  CBO score to tell you that there is a 900 percent increase in OSHA  fines because you are going to cause small businesses to go out of  business because of mandates.   You don't need a CBO score to know that there is an amnesty provision  in here right when our border is completely on fire to provide amnesty  for 7 million.   You don't need a CBO score for the $500 billion of a unicorn energy  strategy that is already crippling the country, causing gas prices and  electric bills to go up while President Biden is across the Atlantic  begging for oil and taking cold baths in Glasgow.   You don't need a CBO score for that, and you don't need to know what  is in this garbage bill that is going to hurt the American people.  Reject it resoundingly this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I object.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
