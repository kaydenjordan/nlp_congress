 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Fischbach for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, the Supreme Court handed down a decision  that will live in infamy. Because of that opinion, over 63 million  unborn children have lost their lives due to abortion.   In time, future generations will look back at this moment in American  history and wonder how the greatest country in the world could have  permitted modern-day slaughter of the innocent. Our Nation has  dehumanized those who are seen as a burden. Comfort and convenience are  now the new cardinal virtues of our modern society.   It is this mentality and this historic decay of the value of life  that has allowed our Nation to treat the unborn as a disposable  commodity.   Over the last five decades, we have treated the unborn as problems to  be solved rather than children to be loved. Due to the incredible work  of millions of patriotic Americans, abortion has been consigned to the  ash heap of history. On this day, we thank those Americans who for over  50 years willingly and joyfully stood outside in the January cold for  the March for Life.   On June 24, 2022, the United States of America declared to the world  that, once again, our Nation will embrace the intrinsic worth and value  of every human life.   This is a reminder, however, that our work is not yet done. We will  continue to work and convince hearts and minds that the culture of life  is worth preserving.   May all those who work to promote the cause of life forever know that  their cause is true, their cause is beautiful, and their cause is good.
