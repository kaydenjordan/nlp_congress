 Mr. President, I rise today in support of my amendment,  Heller-Brown amendment No. 3405. This bipartisan amendment increases  funding for the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program, better known  as VITA, by $5 million for the next fiscal year.   Building upon the success of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it is  important that we take additional steps to ensure that Nevada families  are fully able to realize the benefits of the new tax laws and maximize  their returns. The VITA Program is one way to do that.   The VITA Program offers free tax help to lower income and middle- income taxpayers--those who often need it the most--by helping them to  prepare and file their income tax returns.   Every year, VITA programs help tens of thousands of Nevadans and  millions of taxpayers nationwide keep more of their hard-earned money.  As a statistic, in 2015, VITA sites helped nearly 23,000 Nevadans file  their returns and processed refunds that exceeded $25 million.   That is why I urge all of my colleagues to join me and Senator Brown  in supporting hard-working American taxpayers and voting yes on this  bipartisan amendment, Heller-Brown amendment No. 3405.  [[Page S5241]]    I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Ohio.
