 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 105th  birthday of a proud Hoosier, Neva Fricke Bell, born on January 26,  1916. Neva lived through the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, two World Wars,  the Great Depression, and many other tragedies, as well as great  celebrations, including her marriage to Simeon Bell for 60 plus years,  the birth of her loving children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren,  and great-great-grandchildren. A Boilermaker through and through,  Neva's tenacity and great style are a testament to all Hoosiers and all  Americans that our great State and Nation endures and celebrates  victories great and small. Happy Birthday, Neva Fricke Bell.                            ____________________
