 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, it has been,  now, well over a year since the devastation of Hurricane Maria hit  Puerto Rico. It ripped apart the homes and lives of millions of Puerto  Ricans, leaving tens of thousands struggling without jobs and housing.   Thousands of Puerto Ricans are feeling the sting of insufficient  Federal funds to help the island recover from Hurricane Maria. The  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that helps Puerto Ricans buy  food, get medical treatment, and recover from the hurricane, when the  money trust ran out, Puerto Rico's government had to start cutting  benefits just last month.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support and see this House just pass,  finally, the Disaster Relief Act, which provides approximately $1.4  billion for our fellow American citizens in Puerto Rico. It provides  $600 million for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, $5  million for a study of the disaster nutrition assistance provided to  the Commonwealth in 2017, and approximately $500 million to the Coast  Guard.   Madam Speaker, we must do more for Puerto Rico.                            ____________________
