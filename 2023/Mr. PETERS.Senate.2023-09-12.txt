 Mr. President, I rise today to honor an  accomplished and highly regarded leader in Michigan's labor movement,  David Hecker, president of the American Federation of Teachers--AFT-- Michigan. David has made an immeasurable impact on the State of  Michigan and its many educators and healthcare providers over the past  40 years, and it is a privilege to recognize him here today and  celebrate his upcoming retirement.   David's engagement with the labor movement first began in 1977, when  he became a member of AFT Local 3220, a union of graduate assistants at  the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he earned his Ph.D. in  industrial relations. Following his graduation, David's commitment to  strengthening the labor movement continued to grow, serving as the  executive assistant to the president of the Metropolitan Detroit AFL- CIO from 1986 to 1996, where he worked to protect the welfare of  Michigan's labor force and support the activities of local unions.   David's history with the Michigan chapter of the AFT began with his  service as secretary-treasurer for the organization in the late 1990s.  In 2001, David was named the president of AFT Michigan, a role which he  has occupied with distinction since. Under his leadership, AFT Michigan  has organized many new locals that represent thousands of Michiganders  working in public education and healthcare, in addition to expanding  partnerships in the State and overall strengthening Michigan's labor  movement.   In 2004, David expanded his involvement with the labor movement to a  national level, and began his service as a vice president of the  national AFT, which included serving on the AFT executive committee and  cochairing the AFT organizing committee. For many years, he has been a  member of the Michigan State AFL-CIO and Metro Detroit AFL-CIO's  executive mommittees and has also been a member of AFT delegations to  the Education International World Congress, worked with the National  Union of Teachers in England, the Cambodian Independent Teachers Union,  and higher education unions in Israel and the occupied territories.   David's legacy of leadership and service expands beyond the labor  movement. His work includes serving as the chair of Community in  Schools Michigan and the Green and Health Schools Coalition; as cochair  of the Metropolitan Affairs Corporation; on the boards of Promote the  Vote, the Michigan League for Public Policy, the Education Alliance of  Michigan and New Detroit; and finally, as an officer-at-large of the  Michigan Democratic Party.   I cannot understate the impact that David Hecker has had on  Michigan's workforce and labor movement. A lifelong trade unionist, he  has over these many years steadfastly promoted positive change in our  communities and created a model for public service that is unmatched.  Though his leadership at the American Federation of Teachers Michigan  will be sorely missed, his legacy will most certainly endure and  continue to inspire.                            ____________________
