 Mr. Speaker, we all remember that day, September 30,  2023, at 11:59 a.m. That was when the Democrats actually called for a  motion to adjourn. It was a tactic to stop the vote from taking place  when we were just 12 hours away from a government shutdown. It was also  the day that the leader on the other side tried to give a speech to  delay the vote even further.   Perhaps the most egregious thing we saw was when one of the Members-- remember, we are Members of Congress--and a Member on the other side of  the aisle pulled a fire alarm to disrupt proceedings. It was certainly  an attempt to interfere with an official proceeding.   Now, the speaker who spoke on his behalf said, no, no, no, he was  rushing for a vote. In fact, that is what the statement from Mr. Bowman  was, that he was rushing for a vote. Then why, after pulling that  alarm, did he show up to vote an hour later? If he was in such a rush  to come to the Capitol to vote, why did it take him an hour to actually  cast his vote?   That is the question that he should be answering, because nothing  else truly makes sense. The bottom line here is that he was charged  with a crime after an investigation by the police. He did break the  law, he did plead guilty, and we need to hold that Member accountable.  That is why we have brought this resolution today.   It is not pathetic. What is pathetic is somebody who is a grown adult  pulling a fire alarm like they are in high school. As a high school  principal, Mr. Bowman knows very well the old fire alarm trick, and  there would be accountability for his students if they pulled the fire  alarm.   That is why we are here today making sure there is accountability.  That is all that this is about. It is not just accountability if  Republicans do something. There is accountability if anyone in this  Chamber does something, commits a crime, pleads guilty. That is what we  are doing today.
