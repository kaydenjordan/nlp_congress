 Mr. President, today former majority leader and Kansas  Senator Bob Dole was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.   On December 11, 2021, Senator Dole's hometown of Russell, KS, said  their final goodbyes to their favorite son and celebrated his life.  [[Page S491]]    I ask unanimous consent that the remarks I gave that day be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         All of my political life, I've had to follow Bob Dole and       Pat Roberts. It's a challenge and they have a sense of humor       and wit that I have never been able to replicate, and they       have big shoes to fill that are impossible to accomplish.        Never in my time in public life, and therefore in any       portion of my life, have I felt more nervous, less capable,       of delivering a message. But it is an important one, and I'm       honored so much, so privileged to be able to speak in this       setting. I am delighted that our minority leader, the       Republican leader of the Senate, and his wife Elaine are with       us.        From day one, Mitch has said ``I will be in Kansas.'' I ask       him, ``so did you have a relationship with Bob Dole, did you       like him?'' To which he said, ``Jerry, I voted for him five       times. When I arrived in the United States Senate, there was       a leadership election going on and it took five ballots to       elect Bob Dole, the majority leader, and I did it one, two,       three, four, five times.''        Then he went on to say what I think is the important point       of that story. He said, ``I was a new staffer for a new       Senator when Bob Dole was in the Senate, and I was leaning       against the back wall of the U.S. Senate and the only one of       those five candidates who ever visited with me was Bob Dole.       And I repaid the favor for him paying attention to somebody       he had no necessity of talking to by voting for him. And he       became the majority leader, as I understand it, by one       vote.''        It tells us a story about Mitch's loyalty, but it tells us       a story about Bob Dole. You may remember, I don't know if       it's done these days, but there used to be polls of people       who worked in the Capitol. The question was, ``who's your       favorite Senator; who the politest person is; who's       respectful . . . Bob Dole every time.'' To the elevator       operator, the person who drives the train, to the staff up       and down the halls, Bob Dole was their favorite.        And Senator Kassebaum, I am delighted you're here. There       are many people who appreciate and long for the days in which       Bob Dole and Nancy Kassebaum were their Senators. Those were       days of glory for Kansas because we were represented so well.        There's lots of Dole alumni in this room, people whose       lives were affected by the fact they worked for Bob Dole,       therefore they worked for Kansas; they worked for Americans.       They have done so many good things in their life, and they       come to pay respect to their mentor, the person that gave       them a chance, who brought them from Kansas to the nation's       capital and changed their lives.        Chaplain Black, I certainly appreciated what you said       yesterday at the National Cathedral, but what you said today       in St. Mary's in Russell, Kansas, is meaningful. This is a       place in which you can preach the gospel, the gospel of       salvation, and people are receptive. And Elizabeth Dole, we       have so many things we could compliment you on in your public       service, your service to the United States Senate, your       service to the cabinet. But I have no doubt that the ability       for Chaplain Black to say, ``a brother in Christ'' has a lot       to do with your relationship with Senator Dole. And there is       no better thing that could be said today. All the accolades       about Bob Dole's life are irrelevant until you get to the       point that the Chaplain made: ``my brother in Christ.''        ``. . .We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering       produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and       character produces hope. . .'' (Romans 5:3-4).        I travel Kansas a lot and there are so many stories about       Bob Dole. Each of us, we'd love to tell them. . .I've       suggested that we ought to get a group together, get a cup of       coffee, have a sandwich and just tell Dole's stories.        Bob Dole is the first United States Senator I ever met. My       home town of Plainville neighboring county knew of him, but       then the first Senator I ever had the chance to shake a hand       with. And I have been in awe of Bob Dole for 52 years since       then. I know him personally, but I know him from the way       Kansans talk about him. The way they express their views       about what he did for them, what he meant to them, how       important he was to them. If there is a role model in public       service, isn't it about getting to the point in which people       say `you meant something to me'? I hope those days are not       passed in which the connection between elected officials and       the people they represent are about what we've done to make       their lives better.        My story with Bob Dole begins when he was serving our       nation in uniform in the spring of 1945. Not me, but in the       spring of 1945, a worried mother, Bina Dole called my       grandma. My grandparents lived south of here on the Russell-      Barton county line. The way it was described to me, the       conversation took place on a party line and Mrs. Dole was       asking my grandmother, ``could you please ask your son to see       what happened to Bob in the battlefields of Italy?''        My dad was also serving in Italy. He was serving in the       Army and she hoped she expressed this hope to my grandmother,       my dad's mom that maybe my dad could learn something about       what happened to Bob Dole and how he was doing and what his       chances were. My dad took leave and made the effort to find       Bob Dole only to discover that he had been transported,       evacuated out the day before. He missed seeing him by a day.        I walked out of church last Sunday, a week ago tomorrow,       only to learn the news of Senator Dole's passing. And I want       folks to know that every time that I think about Bob Dole, I       think of Russell. I think of places like Russell. Towns like       Russell, some a little bit bigger, some a little bit smaller       dot our state.        In each of these towns, there are differences of opinions.       There are Republicans and there are Democrats. There's people       who go to this church or that church. But you know, when it       comes to communities in Kansas--communities like Russell--we       set aside our differences and try to solve problems. Maybe in       a place like Russell, you could actually have a kid who grew       up in the Kennedy Methodist Church have his funeral service       in St. Mary's Catholic Church. Maybe you could actually have       the Methodists and the Lutherans singing in the choir       together.        I've tried to explain this to my colleagues in Washington,       D.C. more than once, but there is something about small towns       where we still get along, and get along well enough to solve       our problems. Less so, unfortunately, in the nation's       capital. We respect our neighbors. We see them in the grocery       store, and we see them at the football game on Friday night,       and if we fought among ourselves all the time like sometimes       national politics exhibits today, our towns would be a thing       of the past. It's only that community working together that       keeps the place alive. And we put our hands over our heart       when the flag goes by, and we love our country.        Following the attack of December 7th, 80 years ago this       week, the values Bob Dole learned growing up in Russell led       him to sign up and swear an oath to protect and defend our       nation. In the fall of 1944, Lieutenant Dole shipped out, and       on April 14th of the next year, 1945, on a battlefield in the       hills of Italy, his life almost ended. He began here in       Russell and almost ended in a place he probably never       envisioned ever seeing--some set of hills and some country       called Italy. And sadly, his injuries occurred three weeks       before the war came to an end. Those injuries he suffered       were horrific, and they were permanent, but he survived. He       endured a long road to recovery. Three years of healing,       therapy, rehabilitation still left him with a severely       paralyzed right arm.        As we've heard Senator Dole wanted to be a doctor. He was a       great track star in Russell and at the University of Kansas.       But after that event in 1945, his life, even the basic tasks       of living, they were not the story of a track star or a young       man who saw stability in being a doctor in a small town. His       dreams were crippled.        All of us grow up with dreams; his were shattered on one       day. He endured these disabilities throughout his life. You       could never see and talk about Bob Dole without knowing the       experience of his disability which he never let be one. It       took us a number of times to figure out in my life,       particularly as a teenager, ``how do I get to shake Bob       Dole's hand, how does this work?'' He lived with these       disabilities and rather than asking for help; he decided to       commit his life to offering help. His disabilities developed       his character. It developed an empathy for other people, and       he turned his adversities into public service. His       circumstances altered the course of his life, leading him to       Congress where he championed bills to provide hope, hope to       people like him. There may be no more important thing that       any of us can give anyone else, maybe with the exception of       what the Chaplain offers, but the hope. And maybe what the       Chaplain offers is hope.        In addition to his World War II service, Senator Dole's       character developed due to his upbringing here in Kansas,       here in Russell, Kansas. His family and this community       endured the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. In Russell,       you could feel and see the challenges, the obstacles, the       barriers that were put in people's lives--nothing was easy.       He wanted to be a doctor because it looked to him like the       doctor was the only one who had a stable income . . . Roger.        Even after Bob Dole became a household name across the       country, he always returned to Russell. Following his       injuries, he returned to Russell. After receiving the Vice       Presidential nomination, he and the President came to       Russell. The three presidential campaigns, he came to       Russell; I went to Iowa, three times on a bus, as lots of       Kansans did. After the death of Kenny, his brother, he came       to Russell. In 1996, members of his hometown gathered here to       celebrate his birthday just after he had been defeated by       Bill Clinton.        Though a national leader, he would always be a son of the       Kansas plains. This is what Bob Dole said: ``The first thing       you learn on the prairie is the relative size of a man       compared to the lay of the land.'' The Chaplain talked about       our distances, the sky, the horizons. ``The first thing you       learn on the prairie is the relative size of a man compared       to the lay of the land and under the immense sky where I was       born and raised, a man is very small, and if he thinks       otherwise, he is wrong.'' This place where many of us call       home is a place that puts us in perspective.        Russ Townsley, who Senator Roberts mentioned, the former       Publisher of the Russell Daily News, wrote regarding Senator       Dole's decision to make his announcement to run for President       from a stage in Russell. The national media was making fun of       this kind of thing, ``why would you announce your Presidency       in Russell? You're going to carry Russell County.'' And here       is what Russ Townsley had to say: ``Skeptics ask what  [[Page S492]]       Bob Dole can hope to gain from this public show of       professionally staged rally. And this is where skeptics find       themselves traveling blind. There is no need to look for       ulterior motives for there are none. Dole and his town gained       from each other while one draws on unseen reserves that have       nurtured him from childhood, the other grows strong from the       aura reflected from his image of leadership and stature by       the other.''        To the people of Russell, to the people of Kansas, thank       you for the manner in which you have shaped, treated,       respected a man now so worthy of our admiration. This town       should be so proud because none of us come from places and       become anything but from what we came from. We never escape;       we don't become somebody different than where our roots lie.        We mourn our man, Bob. It can feel like the sun is setting       on both a man and the Greatest Generation that he embodied.       Bob Dole, perhaps the greatest man of the Greatest       Generation.        On Thursday, I stood in the Rotunda of the United States       Capitol as Senator Dole lied in State. He was on a platform,       incidentally that President Lincoln laid on upon his death.       Only 33 people have lied in State in that Rotunda. Your       hometown boy, Bob Dole, is one of them. The statue of his       hero, his commanding general, Dwight D. Eisenhower, looks       over that room and looked over all of us as we gathered to       pay tribute to Bob Dole. I have debated whether to express       concern, always be optimistic, but I am worried. I'm       concerned if America, ever again, will experience the       civility, the bravery, the empathy, the character of people       like President Eisenhower and Senator Dole. What happens when       the greatest generation is absent?        But, I am relieved--I wrote in my notes `think,' but I       think the word is `know.' I'm relieved to know that Bob Dole       would disagree. Bob Dole would disagree with my worry.        Bob Dole was a man of hope--hope for recovery, hope for       those disabilities to have full access to the world around       them, hope that no child would go to bed hungry, hope that       every veteran would receive the care and benefits they       deserve, hope that the aged would live their remaining years       with dignity. In the 1996 comments from the senator on the       Senate floor as he left the United States Senate for the last       time, as a senator he said, ``I agree with the prairie       poet,'' he was speaking of Carl Sandburg, ``who said,       `yesterday, is a wind gone down, a sun dropped in the west, I       tell you that there is nothing in the world only an ocean of       tomorrows; only a sky of tomorrows. And like everybody here       I'm an optimist, and I believe our best tomorrows are yet to       be lived.' ''        My hope is that the life of Senator Bob Dole will be       remembered--carried on in towns across America, the hearts       and minds of here and around the world. Brave enough to find       freedom worth defending and in the halls of our government       where there is a new generation. Where that new generation,       like Senator Dole, will help make tomorrow better for their       fellow citizen.        I started my remarks by sharing how much Bob Dole meant to       Kansans. This week, we're also reminded how much Bob Dole       meant to Americans. One of the places Senator Robert's       mentioned, the World War II Memorial. We saw this week       thousands of people gathered to pay their respects to Bob       Dole at the World War II Memorial. You see it every day,       hundreds of Americans, veterans, their families, citizens who       respected and admired their service they're there at the       World War II memorial to say, ``thanks.''        I did mention earlier as I described my first connection to       Senator Dole, but the first time I heard the story of my dad       searching for Bob Dole in Italy was when my dad told the       story to Bob Dole because my dad was on an honor flight at       the World War II Memorial. My dad in his early 90s, Senator       Dole in his 80s, just two old veterans talking about the       past. That memorial that Senator Dole gave us creates a point       in which we all come together and it helps change lives now,       today, and in the future. Senator Dole had this memorial       built in honor of veterans like my dad, and because of that       we will be reminded of the service and sacrifice for       generations to come across the nation.        When I get frustrated with things in the nation's capital,       I'll walk down to the Lincoln Memorial and on that trip, I'll       go by the World War II memorial, I'll go by the Vietnam Wall,       and see the Lincoln Memorial and come back by the Korean War       Memorial. I was there one day, this was right before the       World War II Memorial opened and I found the Kansas pillar       and I stepped away from the memorial and used my cellphone to       call my dad. This is something that this memorial does,       because I would never tell my dad this in person. I wouldn't       voluntary say what I said to my dad that day and fortunately       for me I got the answering machine so it was not a problem to       leave a message. But I said, ``Dad, I'm at the World War II       Memorial. This memorial was built in your honor, and dad I       want you to know: I thank you for your service; I respect       you, and dad, I love you. That memorial caused that       conversation to occur, which probably was not ever going to.       Incidentally, I was walking back to my office and my       cellphone rings and I answer it. It's my dad's voice and he       says, ``Gerald?'' I said, ``yes?'' and he said, ``you left me       a message, but I couldn't understand it. Would you repeat       it?''        Across the nation, people will remember Bob Dole for       campaigns and presidential races and service to the Senate       and legislation passed. I will always remember Bob Dole as       the serviceman. The person who sacrificed so much, for the       rest of us, in the military. And we'll always remember his       roots.        David Rogers, who covered Congress for The Wall Street       Journal, traveled to Russell in 1988 and he said, ``Like the       outcroppings of bleached stone in the prairie grass, there is       a hardness to this land, and it shows in Russell's native       son, Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole.'' Pat mentioned he       spoke to the high school class graduation in 1986 and Senator       Dole said--of his own powerful ambition to chase flat       horizons and grasp the dreams that lie beyond--he said, ``The       horizon is out there somewhere, and you just keep chasing it,       looking for it, working for it . . . to make your mark not       only on Kansas but America.''        Bob Dole suffered; he endured, and he developed character       that gave him and us hope.        I'm honored to serve in the Dole seat in the United States       Senate and use the Dole desk where I see his name etched into       the bottom of the desk drawer every day. It reminds me of the       man who went before me, and that each of us, each of us can       chase the horizon and make our mark on Kansas and the       country.        Bob Dole has reached his final horizon. He promised us he'd       be sitting up above us; he's watching. And he said he'd be       full of optimism and hope. CJ Mahoney, who was my first       intern in the House of Representatives--a Russell native--      sent me a comic, a cartoon that appeared in some nation's       paper today, and it teared me up this morning. The cartoon is       Bob Dole standing in front of the pearly gates and he's       talking to St. Peter. And the caption is ``For the first       time, Bob Dole can again salute his country with his right       arm.'' Isn't that something that is to celebrate?        Robert J. Dole gives us hope for a brighter and better       tomorrow. We say, ``thank you.'' I can't say it to my dad,       Bob Dole, and I can't say it to you, except in this symbolic       way. But we can say it to all those who served our country.       We say this today, ``Senator Dole, I respect you, I thank you       for your service, and we love you.'' Thank you.    (At the request of Mr. Cramer, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
