 Mr. Speaker, this summer the Supreme Court issued the  Dobbs decision, a direct assault on the right to safe and legal  abortion.   In a disturbing concurrence to an already dangerous decision, Justice  Clarence Thomas attacked Obergefell v. Hodges, which underpins the  right to marriage equality.   With the right to marry potentially at risk, House Democrats put  people over politics and took action to protect marriage equality for  all Americans.   The Respect for Marriage Act prevents right-wing extremists from  overturning legal precedent and ensures statutory protections for same- sex and interracial marriages across the country.   While extremist Republicans continue their path to destroy American  freedom and challenge the legitimacy of LGBTQ families, Democrats are  protecting American people's right to marry who they love.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this crucial bill to  safeguard same-sex and interracial marriages, and I look forward to  seeing President Biden sign this bill into law to protect and respect  the right to marriage equality across our country.                            ____________________
