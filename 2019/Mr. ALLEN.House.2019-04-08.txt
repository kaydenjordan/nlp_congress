 Mr. Speaker, this week in Augusta, Georgia, we celebrate a  tradition unlike any other: bringing together the most elite golfers in  the world to take on the prestigious Augusta National Golf Club for the  first major of the year, the 2019 Masters Tournament.   The first full week of April in my hometown of Augusta is always  filled with excitement and great competition, creating one of the most  electrifying atmospheres in all of sports.   This year, I am thrilled that a new tradition has unfolded. This past  Saturday, the inaugural Augusta National Women's Amateur took place at  the famed Augusta National for the first time.   I congratulate the entire field for their stellar performance and  especially our women's amateur champion, Jennifer Kupcho.   I also thank Chairman Ridley, the membership of Augusta National, and  all the volunteers for their continued success in conducting the finest  competition in sports and in growing the game of golf worldwide.   This special week allows the world to get a glimpse into Georgia's  12th District and the wonderful people who live and work there. I am  looking forward to the final round on Sunday and the 2019 champion  putting on that coveted green jacket. The tradition that encompasses  the Masters is truly special.                            ____________________
