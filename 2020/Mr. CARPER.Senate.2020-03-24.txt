 Mr. President, I would say to my colleague, my West  Virginia colleague and friend: Don't lose that sense of optimism. It is  going to carry us through this and, hopefully, well beyond.   I live in Delaware. My wife and I live in Delaware. We live in the  same house we have lived in for--gosh--33 years, and we raised our sons  there and sent them off into the world.   Every morning that I get up and I come here, I go to the train  station. It used to take maybe 15 minutes from my house to get to the  train station. Today there were just a few cars on the road--no buses.  I got to the train station, and most of the doors were closed. Up on  the platform, I think two people were on the platform to catch the  train that ultimately brought me down here.   A lot of people whom I passed by on the way to the train station,  some people had slept out overnight--destitute, asking for money. Then,  off the train station here, an hour and a half later, in Union Station,  walking through the train station, it was almost empty. The train I had  been on was almost empty.   A number of the people whom I did run into walking through the  station and out of the station, came out Delaware Avenue to the  Capitol, where people were, again, destitute and begging for money.   There are a lot of people who showed up last week and the week before  in this country to ask for and sign up for unemployment benefits. They  never imagined in their life that they would be in this situation.   A lot of people who signed up in the last 2 weeks for food, what used  to be food stamps--SNAP--food benefits for their family, they never  imagined they would face this situation.   My colleagues call me a recovering Governor. I was privileged to be  Governor of Delaware for 8 years. I chaired the National Governors  Association. The Governors who met on the 50-State conference call  several days ago, I was fortunate enough to talk to some of them  afterward and ask them what their priorities were.   They said, among other things: We want to make sure, when people file  for unemployment insurance, if they are eligible for it, that it will  actually be there; and these State funds that were created, contributed  to by employers in 50 States across America, when they are depleted,  there needs to be a backup. They were pleading with us to make sure  that that backup is there.   I am encouraged that the package that is before us today will provide  that liquidity, if you will, for unemployment insurance so people will  actually be able to get not necessarily their full payroll or full  salary--full paycheck--back but at least maybe enough to get by.   The Governors asked that we--they use the term ``plus-up'' the SNAP  program. We used to have food stamps. We now have something called SNAP  cards, and they can be plussed-up or down remotely, electronically, and  the Governors were asking that we do something about that to make sure  that not only people have at least some kind of payment coming in,  through unemployment insurance, to their homes but also something--some  additional benefits for the SNAP program.   I don't think we are going to get that. We made some progress on SNAP  in the last package that came through a week or so ago. And we  probably, especially, need to focus on food benefits for families who  have kids in schools. Schools are closed. Those kids used to get their  lunch--maybe their breakfast--at their school. They are not getting it  now. Those families, especially, are going to need some help.   The third area I want to mention is health benefits--health benefits.  A lot of people who have very good health insurance benefits through  their employer are going to lose them or face the possibility of losing  them. There are going to be people--millions of people across the  country--who are going to sign up for Medicaid who never thought they  would be in a position to have to do that.   The Governors are asking that we do a little bit more to help make  sure that Medicaid, which is partly funded by the Federal Government  and partly by the States--that there are sufficient dollars to meet the  demand for healthcare through Medicaid that certainly would not have  been imagined a month or so ago.   I want to just mention a couple of things. I see a colleague from  Iowa is here, and I don't want to take too much more time, but I am  asking indulgence for just a couple of minutes.   One of our colleagues mentioned today looking ahead to the elections  and thinking about the elections. We have great concerns about election  security these days, with the Russians trying to interfere with our  elections again.   We have a Postal Service that is in dire straits. The Postal Service,  as we know it, has faced great challenges in recent years because of  the lack of first-class mail. People have moved off first-class mail  into email to do business and personal communications. The Postal  Service is in dire straits. One of the ways we could help them is to  expand vote by mail. Every State with counties and cities that have  primaries and general elections would be a source of revenue for the  Postal Service going forward. It actually helps address the concerns we  have about the Russians interfering in our business.    In the last week or so--I know my colleagues did as well--I called  really smart people I know who have been leaders in this country-- people like Leon Panetta, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, John Kasich, and any  number of other people--Democrats and Republicans--just to pick their  brains as to what they thought we should do. Some of the best advice  from people like Leon Panetta, Mark Sandy, and several others used the  three Ts.   I said: Well, what are the three Ts?   He said: When you are putting together this package, always remember  the three Ts.   What are they?   He said: They are timely--whatever we do should be timely; targeted-- it should be targeted; and it should be temporary.   I believe that is what we are trying to do with this huge package-- enormous package. I never imagined we would be dealing with one bill of  this size and magnitude.   Timely, temporary, targeted--we have added one to that. Democrats  suggested this, and I think the Republicans embraced this idea. It also  should be transparent--transparent.   I have a bunch of quotes I carry around with me on my cell phone.  Sometimes I need some inspiration, and I pull out my cell phone and  look at a couple of quotes. In anticipation of saying something today,  I looked at a few of my favorites. One is John Kennedy. I think it is  especially timely right now. One said: ``Let us not seek the Republican  answer or the Democratic answer but the right answer''--the right  answer.   Another quote I carry around on my phone is one by Churchill.  Churchill used to say: The worst form of government devised by man is  democracy. Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all  the rest. What he was saying there is this is a hard way  [[Page S1987]]  to govern. It sure is, especially in the midst of a pandemic, the likes  of which we have never seen in our lifetime.   The third one that comes to mind is actually an African proverb. It  goes something like this:         If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go       together.    Think about that.         If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go       together.    I think what we have coming together here is our Democrats and  Republicans--and maybe an Independent or two--who have decided over the  last several days that despite our differences, there is not a  Republican answer and there is not a Democratic answer; they are the  right answers. Hopefully, we get more right answers in this package-- which I expect we will be considering later today--than wrong answers.  The American people are counting on us to pull together, and I think we  are beginning to do that.   I would close by saying that this is not the first package-- legislative package--that we prepared to adopt in the last 2 weeks or  so. This is No. 3. People smarter than me say there will probably be a  No. 4 and maybe No. 5 as we learn more going forward.   The first one is pretty small, $3 billion. The second, which focused  on a lot on testing, was over $100 billion. This one is many, many,  many times that amount.   I hope folks across the country will be encouraged that we were able  to get it mostly right in the first legislative package and get it  mostly right in the second legislative package. This one is huge. It  took another week or so to pound it out, but I think it is probably  better because we have gone slowly.   I say to the American people, take heart. We have been through a lot  worse than this in our lifetime--a civil war that killed about 800,000  men: families against families, brothers against brothers. Hundreds of  thousands of other women, children, and old people were killed. After  the Civil War was over, President Lincoln was assassinated. A short  while later, his successor, Andrew Johnson from Tennessee, was  impeached.   We somehow made it out of that century to get into the 20th century  just in time to fight not one world war but two world wars--fought  them, led them, won them. The Cold War--led it, won it. And when the  sun came up on January 1, 2001, here is where we were as a nation: We  had the strongest economy on Earth. We had the most productive  workforce on Earth. We had four balanced budgets in a row. We hadn't  balanced our budget since 1968, but we ended up in the last 4 years of  the Clinton administration with four balanced budgets in a row, with a  Republican-led Congress.   We are the mightiest force for justice and the most admired Nation on  Earth. If we can get through everything from the Civil War through the  first day of 2001, we can get through this as well. People are looking  to us to lead. I hope and pray that later today that is exactly what we  will do.   I want to thank everybody who is working very hard on our side, our  leadership, our caucus and the Republican side, their leadership. I was  sitting in Chuck Schumer's vestibule earlier today, and Secretary  Mnuchin was going back and forth, and Mark Meadows, who is the new  Chief of Staff, was going back and forth. Chuck Schumer and others-- there was lot of activity and, I think, a little more optimism than I  have seen in the last several days.   America, take heart. We will get through this.   I yield the floor
