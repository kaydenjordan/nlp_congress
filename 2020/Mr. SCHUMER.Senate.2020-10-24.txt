 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I just heard the Republican leader say  there is no inconsistency between what the Republicans are doing now  with Amy Coney Barrett's nomination and what they did with Merrick  Garland in 2016. Who would believe that? The contradiction is glaring.  The contradiction will be a stain on the leader's forehead and on the  entire Republican caucus if it continues.   We just heard another warped, distorted, and convoluted history  lesson from Leader McConnell. We know how defensive he is about the  blatant, 180-degree, hypocritical turn he has made on Supreme Court  nominations, but a distorted, warped history lesson will not remove the  stain.   Only one thing will, Leader McConnell: Withdraw the nomination of Amy  Coney Barrett until after the election, plain and simple.   Now we meet here in a rare Saturday session because there is  nothing--nothing--remotely normal about the Republicans' drive to  confirm Judge Barrett to the Supreme Court only days before a  Presidential election.   Four years ago, the entire Republican Senate said it was a  principle--that was their word, ``principle''--that Supreme Court  Justices should not be confirmed in Presidential election years. Leader  McConnell said: ``The American people [deserve a choice] in the  selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.'' That is the principle  they insisted the Senate must follow, and they declared that this  principle bound the Senate not to consider the nomination of Judge  Garland even though it was 8 months before the Presidential election of  2016.   Well, here we are today, just a few days from another Presidential  election. More than 50 million Americans have already voted, and that  number will only increase between today and Monday--the date of Judge  Barrett's confirmation vote. Americans are waiting in line now,  patiently, at early voting locations around the country, to cast their  ballots in Arizona and North Carolina, in Maine and Colorado, in Iowa  and Kansas, in Georgia, Alaska, and Kentucky, in 26 States where early  voting centers are open and in another 15 States where early votes can  be dropped off at election offices.   In my home State of New York, where today marks the first day of  early voting, it may look a little different this year. The lines are  longer, not just because of enthusiasm but also because they are more  socially distant. Everyone should be wearing a mask. But as we speak,  millions of Americans are using their voices to say who they want to  have select Supreme Court Justices.   At the same time, when the Republican majority in the Senate is  ramming through the lifetime appointment of a Justice who will make  hugely impactful decisions about their lives and freedom, Leader  McConnell has the temerity to say there is no contradiction between  Merrick Garland and how they treated him and Amy Coney Barrett and how  they are treating her. Give me a break. Our colleagues are saying to  the American people: You get no say. You get no choice.   Four years ago, when a Democratic President nominated a Justice, the  Republicans professed to care about giving the American people a  voice--not so now, not when a Republican-nominated Justice is on the  line, not when their own political power is at stake.  [[Page S6421]]  What became of that high-minded principle the Republican Senators  embraced so fervently in somber tones? Just 4 years ago, Leader  McConnell and they told the Nation that the Senate must heed the voices  of the American people when they vote. Where on Earth did that  principle go? What principles govern their current mad rush to confirm  another Trump Justice 8 days before this Presidential election?   If this process has revealed anything, it is that the supposed  Republican principle was a farce--no principle at all and never was. It  was a naked, opportunistic, transparent, cynical, last-ditch grab for  power. Of course, it is the continuation of their shameful, lockstep  subservience to President Trump--the most unprincipled President in  American history. This will go down as the most partisan, most  hypocritical, and least legitimate Supreme Court nomination in our  Nation's history.   Once again, Leader McConnell, when you talk about history--a  distorted, one-sided view, that is all you give--it doesn't erase what  you have done. It stares the American people in the face. They know it.  We know it. We all know it, and history will know it.   It is a very dark moment for the Senate, and I am ashamed that the  Republicans are going along with this. This, again, will be the most  partisan, most hypocritical, and least legitimate Supreme Court  confirmation in our Nation's history                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 925    Mr. President, now let's look at the status of our country. It is  even less justified in light of that.   We had a record number of COVID infections yesterday. Let me repeat-- a record number. Are Senate Republicans doing anything about that? No.  This is not a regional crisis like before. These spikes are now  widespread, across the whole country, putting all of our Nation at  risk. In fact, in per capita terms, I believe North and South Dakota  have the highest in the Nation. I read this morning that beds are  running out, and we are not doing a thing.   In the past month, there has been a 35-percent increase in the number  of Americans hospitalized with COVID. COVID is now the third leading  cause of death in the United States. In countries like Germany and  Japan and Australia, COVID isn't close to being in the top 10. Experts  like Dr. Fauci are predicting, unfortunately, or projecting that we  could hit 400,000 American deaths this year and that the darkest and  worst days of this pandemic, unfortunately, are ahead of us, not behind  us.   The next huge wave of this pandemic is not looming; it is here. We  cannot afford to wait, but are the Republicans doing anything about it?  No. There are tens of millions of Americans out of work, and businesses  are failing every day. Are Senate Republicans doing anything about  that? No. There are foreign powers, particularly Russia, trying to  undermine our elections. Are the Republicans doing anything about that?  No. They are too focused on implementing their deeply unpopular agenda  through the courts because they know they could never get it through  the Senate. Most of them wouldn't even vote for it.   Today, we are going to give the Republican majority in the Senate the  opportunity to consider critical legislation that has, so far,  languished in Leader McConnell's legislative graveyard. Many bills that  are just sitting here, awaiting action, that were passed in the House-- many with bipartisan support--are waiting for Senate action. We should  be doing that, not rushing through this nomination while people are  voting and wanting their choices to be listened to, not the Republican  Senate's choice.   So we are going to start with comprehensive legislation that  addresses the most serious problems facing America right now, the  Heroes Act, which would deliver urgent and necessary relief to the  Nation and to the people who are suffering. The Heroes Act would have a  comprehensive regime for testing and tracing of $75 billion--the money  that is needed but that this administration never gave. In fact, there  is $9 billion sitting there from what we approved months ago in the  CARES Act that they have not even given out yet, so incompetent are  they.   I saw Donald Trump in the debate. He said: Oh, it will go away. He  has been saying that since January. That is why people know he is an  incompetent President during the most difficult of times. Yet he still  says it.   We need that money. We need money to open up our schools safely and  soundly. That takes extra money. The school districts can't afford it.  We need ventilation, more buses, PPE, oftentimes more teachers,  hotspots so that people can get Wi-Fi when they don't have it in their  own homes, and so much more.   We need money to prevent people from being evicted from their houses.  They have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, and they are  getting kicked out either as a renter or as a mortgagor. The Heroes Act  deals with that.   We need money to help our small businesses--and not just a few. The  restaurants, stages and venues, broadcasters and newspapers, nonprofits  and rural hospitals--all left out of the Republicans' proposal--are in  the Heroes bill.   There is money for unemployment. The $600 pandemic unemployment kept  10 million people out of poverty. It has pumped money into the economy  as well as given people who are not wealthy at all an ability to get  by. That is in the Heroes bill, and there is so much more.   There is money to make sure our elections are guarded and safe. There  are provisions that allow for the census to be counted in a fair way.   All of that is in the Heroes bill. The American people so much want  us to pass it, but Leader McConnell will not even put it on the floor  for a debate.   If Leader McConnell and his Republican majority had an ounce of  concern for average American families, they would halt this sham  Supreme Court process and join us in taking up the critical pieces of  legislation which my colleagues and I will be putting on the floor all  afternoon. In each case, we are not asking the Senate to pass it; we  are simply asking to debate it. We are asking them to overrule Leader  McConnell and put these bills on the floor and let there be a debate  and let there be amendments. That is all we ask during the most  desperate--desperate--of times.   All we ask is for the ability to debate something that really matters  to the American people instead of rushing through a judge, a Supreme  Court nominee, when the American people want the decision to be made by  them, not by Republican Senators, not when her views on key issues only  represent an extreme minority of the American people.   Mr. President, in order to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 925,  Heroes 2, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  legislative session.    Mr. President, just a few quick points.   No. 1, no one is--we are not talking about, and the American people  are not about qualifications. We are talking about views on issues.   Do the American people want their healthcare taken away from them?  Amy Coney Barrett has said that she disagrees with the decision to keep  it.   Do the American people--do American women want the right to choose  taken away from them? Amy Coney Barrett, in the past, has said she  would do that.   Do the American people want to make it even harder to form a union so  they might get some good pay? Amy Coney Barrett. How about gun safety?  She is to the right of Scalia.   The issue on Amy Coney Barrett is twofold, and nothing they say  changes it. No. 1, her views on the issues are so far and so extreme  that she does not represent even the views of the people in this body  on the Republican side; and, No. 2, if they feel that the American  people want her, let them vote and decide--the very same thing my  friend from South Dakota and everyone else said with Merrick Garland.  We know hypocrisy when we see it. We know contradictions when we see  them.   And on the bill--yes, let's debate it. But their bill is inadequate  on testing, inadequate on small business, inadequate on schools. We  went to school administrators. No money for State and local  governments, and I dare say to my friend from South Dakota, a police  officer, a firefighter, someone who picks up the garbage or drives the  buses needs help in South Dakota, if it is a red State, or New York, if  it is a blue State. It is despicable, when the bill goes for all  States, to say: ``It is just for blue States.'' That is the kind of  divisiveness that Donald Trump has created in this country. It is why  so many people don't like him, and what our Republican colleagues,  unfortunately, since he has become President, have followed through on.   Our bill is far more comprehensive. It deals with the needs. Very  little money for testing, very little money for State and local  governments, no money to help restaurants or stages or nonprofits or  rural hospitals, no money for hospitals, in general.   So the bottom line is very simple. Ours is a broad, comprehensive  bill. Theirs is a narrow, skinny bill done to appease 20 Republican  Senators who wanted no money--no money. And they won't even debate that  either.   So I say to my good friend from South Dakota, and he is my friend, we  have one view. The American people are for a $2 trillion bill, a recent  poll showed--60, 70 percent. They have a much narrower view, based on a  hard-right philosophy.   Bring this bill to the floor, and let's debate it. It passed the  House. It is the only thing that has a chance of getting done, and if  you want to make amendments to cut back on the money and help we need,  we welcome that debate, but don't just block something that has a real  chance of becoming law as opposed to the farcical exercise they engaged  in on Tuesday on a totally partisan bill that got not a single  Democratic vote. Let's have a debate.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, well, for more than year and a half,  Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans have refused to take action on  the House-passed For the People Act at a time when our democracy is  under siege in so many ways. The For the People Act is a bold proposal  that will restore people's trust in our democratic system, a trust that  is fading. It is for the people. In order to make a more perfect Union,  it would shore up our elections from threats from abroad. That is  something we have just recently read more and more about. Why aren't we  doing more on that?   In fact, when Senator Van Hollen, a few days ago, put on the floor a  UC of an act that would say Russia should have sanctions imposed on it  if they interfere with our elections, the other side blocked it. I hope  they are not following Donald Trump's obeisance to Russia and his view  that Putin is just OK.   It would also dismantle systematic hurdles that discourage voter  participation. One of the worst things the Supreme Court has done--and  there are quite a few under this conservative majority--is the Shelby  decision, where Justice Roberts, leading the charge, said: We can  dismantle the toughest protections under the Voting Rights Act. He  said: States aren't going to discriminate anymore.   And within a year, 20 States passed laws making it harder to vote.  That is despicable. That is an awful case.   It would help beat back decades of loose finance rules that empowered  special interests at the expense of the American people. We all know  about the dark money that is cascading into our system. In fact,  Sheldon Whitehouse yesterday asked to make that public, to disclose  those kinds of contributions when it came to the Supreme Court, where  rightwing money pours in to make sure that rightwing nominees get on  the Court and move to pull the American agenda so much further to the  right than the American people ever would.   Well, in general, there is too much dark money, too much special  interest money. This would undo it. As election interference remains an  urgent threat, as efforts to disenfranchise voters--especially voters  of color, young voters, and low-income voters--persist, and as powerful  special interests continue to exercise outside influence in our  elections, the need for this legislation couldn't be more clear.   Unfortunately, the Republican leader has other priorities. Rather  than strengthen our democracy, rather than protecting our right to  vote, rather than fighting big money or tackling corruption, rather  than addressing any of the myriad of problems in our democracy that  this country faces, Leader McConnell is undoing democracy by rushing  through a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court mere days before an  election.   You couldn't find a more different set of priorities from that of  everyday Americans if you tried. I urge Leader McConnell to stop this  unprecedented and nakedly partisan process and instead put this  important legislation on the Senate floor for a vote now. Let's discuss  it. Let's debate it. Let's not just reject it at a time when we need to  do so much of this.   In order to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1, For the People  Act, I  [[Page S6431]]  ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I have another request.   As Americans face job loss, health crises, isolation, and enormous  daily stress during the pandemic, the risk of suicide has tragically  gone up. The CDC found that since the pandemic began, twice as many  Americans report serious consideration of suicide. The rate of suicide  risk is especially high among young Americans, minorities, essential  workers, and caregivers.   Unfortunately, this is hitting our Armed Forces, as well. The Army's  Chief of Staff, General McConville, stated that he sees a correlation  between COVID and a rise in military suicides. My office recently  received a note, a tragically sad note, from a veterans group in  Rochester, NY, about a veteran in their region, 50 years of age,  unemployed, and struggling during the pandemic. When he stopped  receiving the $600 unemployment assistance, he was unable to make his  mortgage payments and, unfortunately and sadly, very recently committed  suicide.   I have no doubt that there are more American veterans out there who  are going through the same struggle. Each one is a separate and  heartbreaking tragedy. These men and women who risked their lives for  us are taking their own lives. It is incumbent upon us to do something  about it.   Congress can implement suicide prevention initiatives. We may be able  to make a difference. The House has passed a number of bills to get  suicide prevention funding and new resources out to communities.   I am going to ask that we go into legislative session to consider  four of those House-passed bills. This pandemic has taken so many  lives, and we sometimes forget that it is not just those who contracted  COVID, but those who are pushed to unimaginable stress and devastation  because of what COVID has done to our economy, our friends, and our way  of life. The Senate should be passing these bills and helping out those  who may be hiding in the shadows but crying out for help.   There are four bills. I think I will ask for consideration on the  four of them en bloc; is that permitted?    In order to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 5619,  Suicide Prevention Act; H.R. 5572, Family Support Services for  Addiction Act of 2020; H.R. 4861, Effective Suicide Screening and  Assessment in the Emergency Department Act of 2020; and H.R. 4585, the  Campaign to Prevent Suicide Act, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session.    The emaciated bill filled with poison pills that the  Senator from Wisconsin talks about was never intended to pass. In fact,  the Republican majority leader waited 5 months before doing anything  while people were suffering. The bill does not contain close to what is  needed.   Basically, his analogy is incorrect. The analogy would be saying: You  have a series of serious illnesses; let's treat one because we don't  want to pay for the others--even though we were willing to increase the  deficit by close to $2 trillion by giving a tax break to the wealthy.   So this cry about deficit, when it comes to helping middle-class  people, hurting people, unemployed people, people who can't feed their  kids, no, it is the deficit. When it comes to giving a big tax break to  wealthy corporations and wealthy people, that is fine.   As much as I respect my colleague from Wisconsin, I don't really take  his words very seriously. Our Republican friends put this emaciated  bill on the floor at the last minute because they got such pressure for  doing nothing. They know it can't pass the House. They know it is  totally inadequate.   This is the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, the  greatest healthcare crisis for 100 years since the Spanish pandemic  flu, and our colleagues do next to nothing in terms of the crisis. This  is loaded with poison pills so they know it can't pass. They know it  can't pass the House, and they waited 5 months.   The American people know it. When they are asked: Who wants to solve  this problem, they know that it is the Democrats in the Senate and  House who want to and the Republicans have resisted. There is no  question about it.   The bills I just asked for are small bills, not very expensive, that  deal with suicide. Of course, the answer is no again. It is sad and  unfortunate. Fortunately, the American people will be able to have a  real say, not on the Supreme Court Justice they are rushing through but  on who will be the next administration and who will do more. We will  see what their answer is.    I would be happy to yield.    I would add one final thing. The bill that the Senator  from Wisconsin talks about was totally partisan, which they know can't  pass. Then, when Leader McConnell put it on the floor, he filled the  tree so it couldn't even be amended.   I yield the floor.
