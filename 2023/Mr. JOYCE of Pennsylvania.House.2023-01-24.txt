 Mr. Speaker, there is a reason that we  hold our law enforcement, our firefighters, and our paramedics in such  high esteem. It is because these men and women are called to protect  human life.   As a doctor, I swore an oath to first do no harm, and to protect the  sanctity of human life, working to care for those who are vulnerable.   Here in Congress, we also swore an oath to protect our country and to  protect our citizens, and that means that we must all stand for life.   I am proud to stand for those who protect human life at all costs. I  am proud to have cast my vote in favor of the Born Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act, and the Senate must urgently take up this  important piece of legislation to protect human life.   Mr. Speaker, we are all called to love children who are created in  the image of God. This Nation must bind together and work to protect  all of those, both born and unborn, and this Congress must always stand  for human life.                         National School Choice Week     Mr. Speaker, this week, we celebrate  National School Choice Week, and recognize that parents have the right  to choose the school that is best for their children.   For the past 3 years, we have seen lockdowns and curriculum that  failed to provide American students with the education that they so  desperately need and want. American 9 year-olds have now lost two  decades of progress in math and reading after prolonged school  shutdowns and closings.   It is clear that parents need to, once again, have a greater say in  their children's education. To make sure that that happens, Congress  must act to protect these parents by passing the Parents Bill of  Rights.   Parents have the right to know what their children are being taught  in school. Parents have the right to see their child's school budget  and the spending. Parents have the right to protect their children's  privacy and to ensure that their children are safe in school.   Congress must commit to passing legislation that puts students and  parents first. Let's work to recover the education that was lost during  the school shutdowns, and let's work to create a future that is built  on freedom. Freedom for students, freedom for parents, and freedom for  families.                            ____________________
