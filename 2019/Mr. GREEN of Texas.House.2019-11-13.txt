 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise. And still I rise  because I love my country.   And today I rise to defend those who are recipients of the DACA  program. I rise to defend these young people because, unfortunately,  bigotry is being weaponized against them.   I rise because the Chief Executive Officer has indicated that there  are hardened criminals among them, but he does it in such a way as to  demean and defame all of them. He does it on the day that the Supreme  Court of the United States of America is considering a case with  reference to DACA recipients.   I rise to defend them. These are young people who came to this  country at a very early age. They did not come of their own volition.  These are young people who have been screened and vetted. These are  young people who have gone on to get good educations. These are young  people who are contributing to our society.   So I rise to defend the DACA recipients. I rise because I understand  what is going on. This Chief Executive Officer is not going to stop.  This is just another phase of his attempts to weaponize bigotry,  hatred, racism.   He did it with the Muslim ban, weaponizing religion. He did it with  the s-hole countries, weaponizing race. He did it with some ``fine  people'' among those in Charlottesville where a woman lost her life,  weaponizing anti-Semitism.   And he has done it repeatedly and will not stop. He went on to do it  with the ban on transgender persons in the military, weaponizing  homophobia.   This is not going to stop. We must move to impeach this President.   I am proud to say that history, now, is going to record that, on this  day, witnesses appeared to give testimony with reference to why the  President should be impeached. That is how the testimony is going to be  presented.   I am not proud that this is happening. I love my country. I don't  want this to happen in my country.   I didn't come to Congress to be a part of an impeachment effort  against the President, but when a President attempts to weaponize race,  bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, homophobia, that President ought to  be impeached--and he will be.    Madam Speaker, and still I rise. And I rise  tonight with love of country and heart inspired by ``Harriet.''  ``Harriet,'' the movie.   I saw the movie, ``Harriet,'' and I was inspired to speak tonight  because of some of the horrors associated with the movie. There were  some high points in the movie, but the movie is about a person born  into slavery, a person who had been given the promise of freedom,  freedom that was denied.   Inspired by this movie, I rise. I also would rise because I am  inspired by the poem Maya Angelou left us, the poem that allows us to  express some of the reasons why I am here in this Congress, if you  will.   In this poem in the last stanza, she leaves us these words:       Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,      I am the dream and the hope of the slave.    The dreams and hopes of the Harriets, the dreams and hopes of those  who were able to survive the journey across the ocean; those who were  able to survive and not be lynched; those who were able to survive Jim  Crow laws, and Bull Connor's dogs.       I am the dream and the hope of the slave.      I rise.      I rise.      I rise.    I am proud that Maya Angelou gave us this poem, because it gives us  something to believe in. We are the hope of the slave. There are many  of us.   I am not the only one, but I rise tonight. I rise because I am the  beneficiary of people who lived and died so that I might have this  moment.   I am not supposed to be in Congress. People lived and died, people  who survived German Shepherds, and high-pressure water hoses.                                time  1845    I am the beneficiary of people who fought in a war, a war for  freedom. And in that war for freedom, some 600,000 Americans lost their  lives.   Most people believe that World War II claimed the most American  lives--not so. Nor did World War I, nor the Vietnam war--not so. It was  the Civil War that claimed the most lives of Americans, a war fought so  that I might have the privilege of standing here today.   I don't say to you that that is what was in the minds of the people,  but the liberation of a people has metamorphosed into this opportunity.   So I rise understanding that, in that war, there were some African  Americans. Then, they were known as colored troops. Some 30,000 colored  troops died, and still I rise knowing that others made a sacrifice.   And I am here tonight to talk about the bigotry that still exists in  this country. Bigotry is on the rise in this country, and we, the  Members of this House, have acknowledged it, and we are responding to  it. We have responded to it with hearings:   Tuesday, April 9, 2019, hearing styled, ``Hate Crimes and the Rise of  White Nationalism'';   Wednesday, May 8, 2019, hearing styled, ``Confronting the Rise of  Domestic Terrorism in the Homeland'';   Wednesday, May 15, 2019, hearing styled, ``Confronting White  Supremacy (Part I): The Consequences of Inaction'';   Tuesday, June 4, 2019, hearing styled, ``Confronting White Supremacy  (Part II): Adequacy of the Federal Response'';   Wednesday, September 18, 2019, hearing styled, ``Meeting the  Challenge of White Nationalist Terrorism at Home and Abroad'';   September 20, 2019, hearing styled, ``Confronting Violent White  Supremacy (Part III): Addressing the Transnational Terrorist Threat.''   These are some of the hearings that we have had in our response to  the rise of bigotry, to the rise of hate, white supremacy, anti- Semitism, all of the various invidious discrimination that we find  ourselves having to deal with--Islamophobia, xenophobia, homophobia,  all of the invidious phobias that we have to contend with.   We are responding, and we are responding because this hate has to be  dealt with. Those who ignore invidious discrimination, those who ignore  hate, those who ignore racism--all of the various phobias that I have  called to your attention--perpetuate these various forms of invidious  discrimination.   We perpetuate when we ignore. When we tolerate, we ignore. I rise  tonight because we cannot ignore the hate. We have to stare it down. We  have to take it on. I must do so because I am the hope of the slave,  the many who suffered.   I have been given this opportunity, and it would be a waste, a wasted  opportunity, if I but only came to this Congress and took on the issues  of our day, the issues du jour, and ignore this issue.   Other issues are important. I don't put them aside. But this issue  cannot be ignored. To ignore it would be a betrayal of those who  suffered so that I might be here. It would be a slap in the face to  those who died so that I might have this opportunity.   So I take advantage of the opportunity that has been afforded me, not  necessarily because I want to, but because I have to. I don't have a  choice. And as long as I am in this Congress, I am going to be the  reminder. I am going to be the conscience for those who have suffered.  I will not back down.   And tonight, I want to ask the question: Why do more than 51 percent  of American voters think that the President is a racist?   This is printed. This is information available.   Yes, in this country, the greatest country in the world--the country  that stands for liberty and justice for all; the country with  government of the people, by the people, for the people; the country  wherein no one is above the law--in this country, 51 percent of  American voters believe that the President is a racist.   Why would 51 percent believe that the President is a racist?   This makes people uncomfortable to hear me stand in the well of the  House of Representatives and talk about the racism emanating from the  Presidency. It makes people uncomfortable.   People want to get back to bigotry as usual, when bigotry is  something that  [[Page H8823]]  we confront on an as-needed basis, but not anything that we seek to  end, bigotry being something that we read about, that we hear about,  but we don't have to do anything about.   No, we have to do something about it.   So the question: Why would 51 percent--more than 50 percent--of the  American voters believe that the President is a racist?   Could it be because at the time he was promoting an immigration  policy he called countries in Africa, countries where people of color  are predominant, could it be because he called them s-hole countries?   I don't use scatology. I never use profanity--I should correct  myself. I never speak profanity. There are times when I do think it.  And I am told that, as a person thinks, so is the person, but I never  say it. I respect those around me to the extent that I don't use  scatology.   But the question is: Why do people think that the President is a  racist?   One answer is: Could it be because he has infused bigotry into  policy?   When he was negotiating this policy, immigration policy, he made this  comment and thereafter promulgated a policy--or attempted to--that  would limit persons coming from countries of color, would limit them  access, and open access to persons coming from countries predominated  by Anglos.   Could it be because he launched a travel ban against Muslims? Is this  why more than 50 percent of the American public believe that the  President is a racist, a travel ban based upon religion?   In this country, we appreciate and celebrate freedom of religion. If  you can ban one, where is the line? Where must you stop?    The ban was initially shot down. After some tweaking, this policy was  implemented.   This President is thought by more than 50 percent of the American  public--that is my refrain--to be a racist.   Could it be because he attacked a Muslim Gold Star family, the  parents of a Muslim who served in our military, who gave his life for  our country? Could it be because he would attack this family, a Muslim  family?   Could it be because he claimed that a judge was biased against him  and said that he is a Mexican? Could it be because he believes that he  cannot get justice from a person of color?   More than 50 percent of the American voters believe that the  President is a racist. And if I said ``people'' before, I correct the  Record here and now. It is voters.   Could it be because the Justice Department sued his company twice for  not renting to Black people? The President of the United States, having  been sued for not renting to people of color, maybe this is a reason  that more than 50 percent of the American public believe that the  President of the United States of America is a racist.   Uncomfortable to hear, not pleasant, but it is the truth. And it is  written that, if you know the truth, the truth will set you free. I  hope to free some souls tonight.   Could it be because he refused to condemn the white supremacist who  advocated for him? He didn't say: ``White supremacist, I don't want  your support,'' didn't condemn white supremacy and white supremacists.   Could it be because he questioned whether the only African American  to become President of the United States was born in the United States?  Could it be because he carried that message near and far?   He was almost proud to take on the challenge of questioning the  nationality of the Black President of the United States. And since he  has become President, it seems that he has tried to undo the legacy of  the African American President.   Could it be because he took out a full-page ad advocating the death  penalty for those who were charged in what is known as the Central Park  Five, a horrible case? Someone did ungodly things to a young woman in  Central Park. Five persons of color were taken into custody. He took  out a full-page ad and was an advocate for the death penalty.   Could it have been done because of principle? Let's give him the  benefit of the doubt for the moment. But later on, it was proven that  the five did not commit the crime--not based on a technicality; based  upon DNA evidence.   The President never apologized--stood his ground. As a matter of  fact, he hasn't apologized for any of the things that I have called to  our attention tonight. He does not apologize. He does not repent. He  does not say ``I am wrong; I made a mistake''--something that I do more  often than I would like to, but I make mistakes. He doesn't apologize.   Five people incarcerated, but five people liberated based upon  evidence--no apology, no retraction from the President.   Could it be because he has condoned the beating of a Black Lives  Matter protester?   Could it be because he has stereotyped Jews and shared an anti- Semitic image created by white supremacists?   Could it be because he has been sanctioned by the U.S. House of  Representatives for his racist comments directed at Members of  Congress?   There are many reasons to be discussed, but we have to acknowledge  that, with all of this evidence and with our moving forward on  impeachment, with all of this evidence, should we not consider the  impeachment of this President as the Radical Republicans--as they were  called, but they were Republicans--did in 1868 with Andrew Johnson?                                time  1900    Republicans impeached Andrew Johnson in article X--for those who care  to read the articles, article X of the XI Articles of Impeachment  against him.   Republicans impeached Andrew Johnson for reasons rooted in his  bigotry. He was the President Trump of his time.   Andrew Johnson did not want the freedmen and -women to have the same  rights and privileges as other Americans. He fought against this. He  fought the Freedmen's Bureau. He did not want them to be accorded  freedom--the Harriet Tubmans of the world to have their freedom.   Andrew Johnson was the bigot of his time, but the Republicans took a  stand. The Republicans took the moral high ground.   When you are standing on the moral high ground, you have a moral  imperative to go forward. And they did. And the Republicans impeached  Andrew Johnson. I admire the Republicans of 1868. I believe that what  they did was right. And, more importantly, it was the righteous thing  to do. I am a person who stands with what they did.   There are those who would say, ``Well, that was 1868.''   Well, the Constitution hasn't changed. It was based upon the same  Constitution that we read, the same Article II, Section 4 that we have  used for our impeachment going forward currently--same articles.  Nothing has changed.   You can't conclude that what they did in 1868, when they were closer  to those who framed the Constitution than we are today, had a greater  sense, perhaps, of what--if you measure your sense of what was  available by your nexus to those who made it available--they were  following the Constitution.   We should follow the Constitution. We have a duty and a  responsibility to the Harriets of the world to not allow this level of  bigotry to continue to emanate from the Presidency.   Impeachment is moving forward. I had said months ago that the  President would be impeached. I repeat only what I have said then when  I close with: He will be impeached. The hands of history will record  that President Donald John Trump was impeached by this House of  Representatives.   And for those who say that I have already made up my mind, you are  correct. I have, because the evidence is apparent, and there is no  requirement that I must wait until we have had subsequent hearings.   He will be impeached. And I believe that we ought to add articles  that include his invidious discrimination harmful to this society.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.  [[Page H8824]]    The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 4 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, November 14, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
