 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division B (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to deliver a printed copy of the Federal Register to       the office of a Member of the House of Representatives       (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the       Congress), unless a printed copy is requested by the Member       (or Delegate or Resident Commissioner).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment, which restructures the way the Federal  Register is distributed to Members' offices, will save approximately $1  million annually.  [[Page H6418]]    The Federal Register contains a large amount of information,  including proposed rules and public notices, regulations, executive  orders, and Presidential documents. This information is compiled by the  great folks at the National Archives, and published daily by the  Government Printing Office, or the GPO.   Since 1994, the GPO began publishing the Federal Register online. To  improve the user experience, the digital version has been enhanced over  time and is now fully searchable and downloadable, and is the preferred  method that staff and Members use the Register, making for quick access  to any document.   Sadly, despite these advances in technology, Members of Congress  still receive printed copies of the Federal Register every day. This  results in thousands of copies going directly into the trash, costing  taxpayers $1 million annually. Put another way, Mr. Chairman, this  means that approximately 96 Americans have to work all year long and  pay their taxes so that we can put these Federal Registers in the  trash.   This amendment simply prevents the distribution of printed copies to  Members' offices, unless the Member opts in to receiving a copy.  Digital copies are already daily distributed.   This amendment is in line with H.R. 195, a bill I introduced, which  passed this House unanimously without any opposition, and was  cosponsored by Mr. Connolly of Virginia.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that  we can now make it law.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague from Kansas for  his kind remarks. I also appreciate the colleagues from the other side  of the aisle who have shown continued support for this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell).   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10  printed in House Report 115-259.                   Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Bergman    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11  printed in House Report 115-259.
