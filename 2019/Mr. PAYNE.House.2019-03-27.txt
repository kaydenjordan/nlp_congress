 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that it may be in  order at any time on Wednesday, April 3, 2019, for the Speaker to  declare a recess, subject to the call of the Chair, for the purpose of  receiving in joint meeting His Excellency Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary  General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a community leader  from Essex County, New Jersey, Ms. Florence M. Johnson. Ms. Johnson has  been an exceptional leader across Essex County for the past four  decades.   In the 1970s, she cofounded a housing development in East Orange, New  Jersey, that was designed, built, and managed by African Americans--one  of the first of its kind.   In the 1980s and 1990s, she was a trailblazing member of East Orange  City Council.   In 2000, she joined the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra as an outreach  and community engagement leader. At the New Jersey Symphony, Ms.  Johnson led outreach to schools, churches, senior centers, and other  organizations in order to make sure that the arts benefit everyone in  the community.   This evening, she is being honored as a Hidden Figure in East Orange,  New Jersey.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms.  Florence M. Johnson for her leadership.                            ____________________
