 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the heroic actions  by members of the Newberry Fire Department.   On March 1, 2019, the alpha shift, comprised of Captain Andrew  Morris, Lieutenant Brian Beck, Senior Engineer Benjamin Dukes,  firefighter Richard Doran, and volunteer firefighter Barry Brown, were  working a wreck on Third Street when they received an urgent call of a  hit-and-run incident on Louis Rich Road.   The firefighters responded to the call and found the victim of the  hit and run  [[Page H9261]]  completely unresponsive. The firefighters immediately performed CPR on  the victim and as a result of these actions, the person gained a pulse  and began breathing. The brave actions of these dedicated public  servants resulted in a life being saved, and in the words of the late  Prime Minister of Great Britain Winston Churchill, who said the  following: There are times when doing one's best is not good enough.  One must do what is required.   The brave firefighters of Newberry Fire Department's alpha shift did  what was required, and as a result, a life was saved.                            ____________________
