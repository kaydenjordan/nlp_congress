 Madam Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Chair, this bill is absolutely critical to our Nation, critical  for hardworking Americans, not to mention critical for national  security.   We produce energy cleaner, more efficiently, and cheaper than any  other country. We need to start acting like it.   The best way to reverse the damage of Biden's energy crisis and drive  down energy prices is by flipping the switch and unleashing American  energy at home.   We have real solutions in H.R. 1 to do just that very thing.   Bills like Representative Crenshaw's Keeping America's Refineries Act  will help ensure that our Nation's refineries can continue to operate  and keep the lights on in our country.   My energy-heavy district, as the chairman referred to, houses about  50 percent of Texas' daily refining output. Our district is home to  America's largest petroleum refineries, which process 2.6 million  barrels of oil a day. This bill will ensure our refineries stay online.   This bill fights back on overburdensome regulations imposed by the  Biden administration that target the use of hydrofluoric acid that goes  into everything from aluminum cans to vehicle fuel cells.   Our country simply cannot run without energy, and let me tell you: We  can't afford to live in the greenies' dystopia that the folks on the  other side of the aisle dream about, either.   Madam Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this  vital piece of legislation that will unleash American energy, lower  energy costs for hardworking Americans, increase production, reform the  drawn-out permitting processes, streamline energy infrastructure, and  boost the production and processing of critical minerals. Our country  depends on it.                                time  1330
