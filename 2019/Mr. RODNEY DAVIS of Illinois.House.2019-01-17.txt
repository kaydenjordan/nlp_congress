 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the young people from my home diocese in Springfield,  Illinois, who traveled to Washington, D.C., for the 46th annual March  for Life tomorrow.   Each year, nearly 200 students from throughout the Diocese of  Springfield and the 13th District come to our Nation's Capital to show  their support for choosing life. It is truly inspiring to see so many-- especially young people--marching for life, and I am proud to stand  with them in their defense for life.   Last year, I attended mass with these students to pray for all unborn  children and for an end to abortion. Before mass, I learned that, when  the students arrived in Washington, one of their classmates, Ayden  O'Malley, from Nokomis, Illinois, suffered a serious medical episode.  Ayden passed away 5 days later here in Washington. Although I never met  her, I admire her convictions and willingness to be a voice for those  who cannot speak for themselves.   This year, we remember Ayden as well as all unborn children whose  lives were cut short.                            ____________________
