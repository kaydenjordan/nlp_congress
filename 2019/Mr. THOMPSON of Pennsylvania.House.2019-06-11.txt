 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life and service of Allen ``Al'' Pingee of Lewis Run. Al passed away on  Tuesday, April 23, at his home, surrounded by his family.   Al was a McKean County commissioner at the time of his death, and I  flew a flag over the United States Capitol to be presented to Al's  family and his colleagues.   Prior to becoming a commissioner, Al was a member of the city of  Bradford professional firefighters and retired as a captain in 1988. He  then served as Bradford Township supervisor for 14 years, 11 of those  years as chairman.   Al was a proud Vietnam veteran. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps  and was honorably discharged as a corporal in September 1970.   Mr. Speaker, Al Pingee has served his Nation and his community.   Above all else, he was a family man, a loving husband of 36 years to  his wife, Deborah, and father to his four children, Andy, Scott, Jeff,  and Jodie. He was a grandfather, a brother, and a friend to many.   We remember Al Pingee for his exceptional service to others.   May he rest in peace.                       Recognizing National Dairy Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  June as National Dairy Month.   Dairy products like milk contain nine essential nutrients that may  help reduce the risk for high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and certain  cancers. Whether it is a protein to help build and repair the muscle  tissue of active bodies or Vitamin A to help maintain healthy skin,  dairy products are a natural nutrient powerhouse.   National Dairy Month started out as National Milk Month in 1937 to  stabilize the dairy demand when the production was at a surplus. Now,  it has developed into an annual tradition that celebrates the  contributions the dairy industry has made to the world.   Proudly, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is one of the largest milk- producing States in the Nation. I have a bill called the Whole Milk for  Healthy Kids Act, which would allow for whole milk, both flavored and  nonflavored, to be offered in school cafeterias.   Just last week, I introduced the School Milk Nutrition Act with  Congressman   Joe Courtney to expand milk options for students and  reverse the decline of milk consumption in our schools. Our bill  reaffirms recent regulation from the U.S. Department of Agriculture by  providing schools with the option to serve low-fat milk with flavor and  requires that the milk offered is consistent with the most recent  Dietary Guidelines for Americans.   In November 2017, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced  regulatory changes for the National School Lunch and School Breakfast  Programs, including a provision that provides schools with the option  to serve low-fat 1 percent flavored milk.   The School Milk Nutrition Act for 2019 will codify this milk  provision and will maintain the option for schools to offer low-fat 1  percent flavored milk if it is consistent with the most recent Dietary  Guidelines for Americans.   I urge my colleagues to sign on to these bills during National Dairy  Month and allow our students the option of consuming the type of milk  that they love and to receive the nutrition that they need.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to being, a week from today, in our State  capital of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, at 11 a.m. for a rally with all  the advocates for nutrition for children and certainly for dairy  farming, as we rally for whole milk for healthy kids.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, June is National  Homeownership Month, and it is the time when we celebrate and recognize  the many benefits of owning a home.   For generations of Americans, owning a home has been an essential  element in achieving the American Dream. But since the Great Recession,  we have seen homeownership rates dip to historic lows.   Young families often find themselves unable to save for a down  payment or gain access to adequate credit, and that is especially true  for those living in rural areas.   The U.S. Department of Agriculture places emphasis on helping rural  Americans buy homes. USDA provides mortgage loan guarantees through  partnerships with private-sector lenders to help low- to moderate- income rural home buyers. USDA has helped more than 4.4 million rural  residents buy homes since the National Housing Act was passed 70 years  ago.   Mr. Speaker, homeownership has widespread benefits: It fortifies  communities, creates jobs, and strengthens the local businesses that  support our towns.   I thank USDA for its commitment to providing affordable housing for  rural Americans. By helping hardworking Americans achieve this dream,  it provides a strong foundation for more prosperous rural communities.                            ____________________
