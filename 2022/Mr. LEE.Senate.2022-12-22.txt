 Mr. President, this amendment is a ruse. It is a ruse  designed to provide political cover to a small handful of people who  recognize the crisis on the border and want to appear to be doing  something about it, but it doesn't.   Look, it proposes tens of billions of dollars to simply manage the  border crisis, not stop it. It doesn't do anything to stop fentanyl or  actually secure our border.   The sponsors will tell you that their amendment prohibits the  funding--prohibits the repeal of title 42, but that is a lie. It only  prohibits DHS funding to repeal title 42 when the surgeon general, who  is housed in HHS, is the one who has the authority to do so.   How would it manage this crisis? Well, it would do so by funding the  processing of people coming into this country faster than they are  currently being processed. And more costly lawsuits await against our  enforcement policies.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment, which is  a ruse. It doesn't do what it purports to do. It distracts from the  crisis unfolding on our southern border.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6621    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the  amendment.    Mr. President, during our recent border crisis, title 42 has  become  [[Page S10069]]  the only sustained control we have over illegal immigration.   In 2022, just this year alone, we have had over 2.7 million  undocumented immigrants at our southern border. It doesn't even include  those who came across sneaking through undetected.   The Biden administration is only expelling people from the border  exclusively under title 42. That is it. That is all we have got. In the  last 3 years, title 42 has been used to help us expel 2.5 million  illegal immigrants.   Just over the last 7 days alone, Mr. President, the Border Patrol in  Arizona showed us that it is not just people coming across illegally;  it is also drugs--dangerous drugs. In the last 7 days alone, Border  Patrol agents in Arizona have confiscated 1.5 million fentanyl tablets.  More than 14,000 pounds in total was intercepted at the border in 2022,  and that is enough to kill America's entire population nine times over.   We have no business passing this bill unless this is in here. Vote  for this amendment, I implore you.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.    Point of inquiry, Mr. President.   Mr. President, point of parliamentary inquiry.   Are we not under a unanimous consent agreement that presupposes a 10- minute vote that will be called at the end of 10 minutes? And is there  an exception to that when the Democrats don't like the disposition of  the vote that has been cast?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The vote is still continuing. Debate is  not in order.    That wasn't a debate. That was a point of parliamentary  inquiry. There is a difference. I would like an answer.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Parliamentary inquiries are not in order.   On this vote, the yeas are 47, the nays are 50. The amendment is not  agreed to.   The amendment (No. 6563) was rejected.                              Amendment No. 6576    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is now 2  minutes of debate prior to the vote on the Lee amendment numbered 6576.    Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on this, I would  like to know how long the vote was held open on the last vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It was 16 minutes total--18 minutes.    Eighteen minutes is, of course, longer than 10.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may proceed.                              Amendment No. 6576     Mr. President, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Ridge Alkonis is one of  the best and the brightest naval officers this country has. In late May  of 2021, he was involved in a serious car accident in which he  encountered an unforeseeable, unforeseen medical emergency that caused  him to lose consciousness. He was involved in a car accident as a  result of that emergency in which two Japanese nationals tragically  lost their lives.   It was, indeed, an accident, not preventable or foreseeable by  Lieutenant Alkonis. Nonetheless, under the Japanese legal system, he  now stands convicted of a crime for which he is serving a 3-year prison  sentence. This is an accident that was not avoidable by Lieutenant  Ridge Alkonis.   I believe that, under these circumstances, we must stand behind him  and his family. Lieutenant Alkonis has a wife Brittany and three young  children. They are set to lose their pay and benefits from their sole  breadwinner in their home 1 week from today. We must stop that.   The Department of Defense supports this. They wish they could grant  it on their own. They don't believe they have the authority. I disagree  with them. But this will fix that, and I am happy to help them with  that.   I urge my colleagues to support this and would gladly accept a voice  vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the  amendment.   The amendment (No. 6576) is agreed to.                              Amendment No. 6577    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is now 2  minutes of debate prior to the vote in relation to the Lankford  amendment.   The Senator from Oklahoma.    Mr. President, this bipartisan bill is something that I  stand behind. Yes, this amendment simply restores the previous version  that Senator Klobuchar and I introduced and passed by unanimous  consent. I urge our colleagues to support it.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.
