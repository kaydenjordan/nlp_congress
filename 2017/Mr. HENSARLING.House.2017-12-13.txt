 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1638, the Iranian  Leadership Asset Transparency Act, introduced by my colleague and dear  friend from Maine (Mr. Poliquin).   This legislation requires the Treasury Secretary to report to  Congress on the assets held by the Islamic Republic of Iran's most  senior political and military leaders, and on the probable sources and  uses of those assets.   A classified version, if necessary, would be available, as  appropriate, to Congress, and a public version of the report would be  posted on the Treasury Department's website in English and in the major  languages used within Iran that could easily be downloaded.   The genius of this latter point is that it will allow the average  Iranian to understand and circulate information of how their leaders  are, in a phrase, robbing them blind, as well as aiding and abetting  terrorists.   Iran's top political, military, and business leaders, if there is  much of a distinction between those roles in Iran, fund terrorist- related activity, we know this, and through intricate financial  arrangements that give them great flexibility in moving their money.   According to the nongovernmental organization Transparency  International, Iran's economy is characterized by high levels of  official and institutional corruption, and there is substantial  involvement by Iran's security forces, particularly involving the  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.   Unsurprisingly, then, members of Iran's senior political and military  leadership have acquired significant personal and institutional wealth  by using their positions to secure control of major portions of the  Iranian national economy.   Some estimates put their iron grip at a third or more of the  country's economy, and some individual holdings in the billions of  dollars; all at a time when the average Iranian citizen earns the  equivalent of about $15,000 a year.   The unwise sanctions relief provided through the Obama  administration's nuclear deal with Iran resulted in the unwarranted  removal of many Iranian entities that are tied to government corruption  from the list of entities sanctioned by the United States.                                time  1500    Thankfully, however, the Trump administration has, in recent months,  levied a number of needed new sanctions on Iranian individuals and  entities. Still, the Transparency International index of perceived  public corruption in Iran is higher than ever.   As well, the Treasury Department has identified Iran as a country of  ``primary concern for money laundering.'' Separately, the State  Department has continually identified Iran as the world's foremost  state sponsor of terrorism. Iran is, the State Department tells us, a  country that has ``repeatedly provided support for acts of  international terrorism,'' and ``continues to sponsor terrorist groups  around the world, principally through its Islamic Revolutionary Guard  Corps.''   The bill before us today, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency  Act, requires the Treasury Department again to list the known assets of  senior Iranian officials in a form that is easily understandable and  accessible to individual Iranians, as well as to those in the financial  or business sector who might be concerned--hopefully concerned--about  inadvertently doing business with a corrupt Iranian entity.   The bill also requires the Treasury to evaluate the effectiveness of  existing sanctions against Iran and make any appropriate  recommendations for improving the effectiveness of sanctions.   The bill passed the Financial Services Committee last month with a  bipartisan support vote of 43-16. The House approved a nearly identical  bill just 18 months ago by a very strong vote of 282-143.   As passed by the committee, this year's version has an important  addition, a sense of the Congress section, that urges the Treasury  Secretary, in addition to other sources, to seek information for the  report from private sector sources that search, analyze, and, if  necessary, translate publicly available, high veracity, official  records overseas, and provide methods of searching and analyzing such  data in ways useful to law enforcement.   These source of services provide information that could augment  information that is gathered, often by classified means, and provide a  final public report that helps give the world a better picture of the  true nature of Iran's economy.   Mr. Chairman, I urge immediate passage of Mr. Poliquin's thoughtful  and bipartisan bill. I appreciate his leadership to bring us here  today, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, December 6, 2017.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Foreign Affairs on H.R. 1638, the Iranian       Leadership Asset Transparency Act.        I agree that the Foreign Affairs Committee may be       discharged from further action on this bill so that it may       proceed expeditiously to the Floor, subject to the       understanding that this waiver does not in any way diminish       or alter the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee,       or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or       similar legislation in the future. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek an appropriate number of conferees       to any House-Senate conference involving this bill, and would       appreciate your support for any such request.        I ask that you place our exchange of letters into the       Congressional Record during  [[Page H9869]]       floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your       cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to       continuing to work with you as this measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                   Washington, DC, December 7, 2017.      Hon. Ed Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: Thank you for your December 6th letter       regarding H.R. 1638, the ``Iranian Leadership Asset       Transparency Act'', as amended.        I am most appreciative of your decision to forego action on       H.R. 1638 so that it may move expeditiously to the House       floor. I acknowledge that although you are waiving action on       the bill, the Committee on Foreign Affairs is in no way       waiving its jurisdictional interest in this or similar       legislation. In addition, if a conference is necessary on       this legislation, I will support any request that your       committee be represented therein.        Finally, I shall be pleased to include your letter and this       letter in our committee's report on H.R. 1638 and in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the same.            Sincerely,                                                    Jeb Hensarling,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds simply to  remind the ranking member that in the State Department's latest Country  Reports on Terrorism, Iran is labeled the ``world's foremost state  sponsor of terrorism.''   Why we would want less information as opposed to more information on  that rogue state is beyond me.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maine (Mr.  Poliquin), the sponsor of the legislation and a distinguished member of  the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maine.                                time  1515     Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce), who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee and a senior member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), who is a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson), who is never an apologist for the leading state  sponsor of terrorism in the world. He is a proud member of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds just to say  in the time the ranking member was speaking, I went back, yet again, to  read the nine-page bill. Nowhere is the JCPOA mentioned in the bill.   Iran was the leading state sponsor of terrorism before the JCPOA.  They remain the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism after the  JCPOA. We ought to know something about the leadership of this  terrorist nation, and I think the next speaker will tell us even more.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Budd), another outstanding member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Lance), a member of the House Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining on my side?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes again to the  gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers, and I believe  I have the right to close.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I find it fascinating how often the ranking member  criticized our own President and didn't have one critical comment for  the President of Iran, the nation which our State Department, including  the Obama State Department, has labeled as the world's foremost state  sponsor of terrorism. But yet, in the last almost hour we have not  heard one single critical word.   We hear much about the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, perhaps one of  the worst arrangements, international agreements that has ever been  entered into by our country, but look as I may, in the legislation--and  it is 9 pages long, not 900--you will not see the JCPOA in it.   Mr. Poliquin's bill, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act,  is just that. It is seeking to have greater international transparency  for the leaders of this rogue nation, regardless of the JCPOA.   Let's remember what the gentleman from Ohio reminded us, that it was  because of information, including radio-free Europe, that went across  the Iron Curtain that ultimately brought that curtain down and freed  millions. We want to make sure the Iranian people know about their own  leadership.   Our own State Department has said the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary  Guard Corps' Quds Force along with Iranian partners, allies, and  proxies continue to play a destabilizing role in military conflicts in  Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, but the ranking member says: Oh, let's not say  anything about their leadership because we might hurt their feelings.   The State Department goes on to say: Iran continued to recruit  fighters from across the region to join Iranian-affiliated Shia militia  forces engaged in conflicts in Syria and Iraq and has even offered a  path to citizenship for those who heed this call. And yet the ranking  member says let's not report on the leadership of this rogue regime  because they are very sensitive people.   The State Department goes on to say: Hezbollah continued to work  closely with Iran in these conflict zones, playing a major role in  supporting the Syrian Government's efforts to maintain control in the  territory and providing training and a range of other support for  Iranian-aligned groups in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. Yet we continue to  hear from the ranking member that we shouldn't learn anything about  their leadership. Again, we might step on their toes after the JCPOA,  and we wouldn't want to do that. We wouldn't want to be insensitive to  international terrorists.   In 2016, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, boasted: ``We are open  about the fact that Hezbollah's budget, its income, its expenses,  everything it eats and drinks, its weapons and rockets are from the  Islamic Republican of Iran.''   I mean, how much more do we need to know? Why do we continue to have  Members of the United States Congress come to the floor of this  institution and somehow want to seemingly protect the leaders of this  rogue regime?   We want to know more information. We want to disseminate this  information. We want the whole world to know about the leadership of  the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism. It is exactly what the  gentleman from Maine is trying to. I salute him for his leadership.   I encourage all Members to vote ``aye'' for his bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  New York for her amendment. I note that she was a supporter of H.R.  5461, a nearly identical bill that passed the House in the last  Congress. I think that her amendment is a valuable addition to H.R.  1638. Indeed, we should always know the effectiveness of the programs  that we promote. In this case, we do need to understand how effective  economic sanctions may be. So I appreciate her leadership.   Mr. Chairman, I would urge all Members to vote ``aye'' on the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 658, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4324) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to  make certifications with respect to United States and foreign financial  institutions' aircraft-related transactions involving Iran, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 4324, which is a  commonsense piece of legislation sponsored by my good friend and fellow  Texan, Mr. Williams. His work as a member of the Financial Services  Committee and as vice chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade  Subcommittee has been invaluable.   Mr. Speaker, as our colleagues know, under the Iran nuclear bill,  also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the  Obama administration committed the U.S. to license the sale of aircraft  to Iran.   In addition to authorizing the sales, these licenses have authorized  banks to engage in financing, even though Iran remains classified by  the Treasury Department as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering  concern. On top of that, the State Department continues to label Iran  as the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism.   The recipient of these aircraft would be Iran Air, the state-owned  airline that was sanctioned as recently as 2011 for supporting the  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which itself has been designated by  the Trump administration as a terrorist organization. So, Mr. Speaker,  so far, so bad.   And yet, while I and many of my colleagues from both sides of the  aisle find these aircraft sales and their financing deeply disturbing,  Mr. Williams' bill is about something far, far simpler. All  [[Page H9882]]  his bill would do is bring about the implications of the aircraft  finance for Iran out into the sunlight. In other words, Mr. Speaker, it  is a reporting requirement--nothing more, nothing less.   It would simply require Treasury to help Congress understand who is  involved in these transactions. If it is an airline, has that airline  stopped supporting terrorists or other sanctioned persons. If it is a  bank, does that bank have the due diligence in place to guard against  the immense illicit finance risk endemic to Iran.   All this legislation does is have Treasury certify this information  for Congress. And, if Treasury can't make those certifications, it  simply has to notify us what plans it has in response, even if it has  no plans in response.   So, when we hear today from the other side of the aisle how this bill  may impose new conditions on Iran or somehow stand in the way of  commitments under the JCPOA, I suggest, again, everyone read the bill.  It is simple. It is common sense. In fact, we should be considering  this under the expedited process of the suspension calendar.   This legislation provides, again, for a simple reporting requirement,  Mr. Speaker; that is it, a reporting requirement.   If my friends who oppose this bill don't care enough to even request  the information from the executive branch, especially information that  may reveal the use of their constituents' bank deposits for the benefit  of enablers of terrorism, well, Mr. Speaker, that is a sad, sad day for  congressional oversight and a sad day for the United States Congress.   But there are people who have read the bill, if everybody in this  institution hasn't, people, for example, associated with the Foundation  for Defense of Democracies, who wrote recently in a November 22 policy  brief for the Foundation's Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance:  ``The proposed bill supports Treasury's robust licensing approval  process by codifying steps that are likely already central to the  Department's evaluation process.''   They go on to write, Mr. Speaker: ``While not imposing any new  standards for the approval of sales to Iran, codifying the existing  standards in law through this bill makes the licensing process more  transparent and gives the American people--through their elected  representatives--a clear picture of a significant component of the  sanctions relief provided to Iran under the nuclear agreement.''   Mr. Speaker, I include this report in the Record.      [From the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Nov. 22, 2017]     Congress Supports Financial Transparency for Iranian Transactions                     (By Annie Fixler, Tyler Stapleton)         The House Financial Services Committee approved last week       the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act,       which codifies in law a set of conditions that the U.S.       Treasury must use to evaluate licenses for the sale of       commercial aircraft to Iran.        The bill requires the secretary of the Treasury to report       within 30 days whether transactions related to the export and       re-export of aircraft to Iran pose a ``significant money       laundering or terrorism financing risk to the United States       financial system.'' The secretary must also determine whether       the transactions benefit any Iranian person that has       knowingly transported or otherwise supported the       proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or provided       material support to persons included on Treasury's sanctions       lists. If the secretary cannot certify that the transaction       meets these conditions, he must explain whether the licenses       authorizing the transaction will be revoked, modified, or       remain valid despite the potential for illicit transactions       or benefits going to sanctioned persons.        Under the July 2015 nuclear agreement known as the Joint       Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the United States       committed to allowing the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran       provided the planes are used ``exclusively for commercial       passenger aviation.'' The JCPOA specifically states that if       aircraft are either used for a prohibited purpose or       transferred or re-sold to individuals or entities on       Washington's sanctions lists, the U.S. would view this as       grounds to cease its approval of aircraft sales--but, by       implication, not abrogate the nuclear deal in full.        Upon the implementation of the JCPOA in January 2016,       Treasury issued a Statement of Licensing Policy (SLP) and       additional guidance reiterating and expanding on the relevant       language from the nuclear deal. The SLP and related guidance       indicate that Treasury would view license applications       favorably but would review applications on a case-by-case       basis and ``include appropriate conditions to ensure'' that       no sanctioned persons were involved in the transaction.        The SLP and related guidance are clearly consistent with       the JCPOA, which does not require the United States to issue       licenses for aircraft sales without conditions. Accordingly,       the SLP does not guarantee that all applications will be       approved. If Washington determines that certain criteria are       necessary in order to ensure that commercial aircraft are       used appropriately, it is permitted to reject an application       that does not meet those criteria.        The proposed bill supports Treasury's robust licensing       approval process by codifying steps that are likely already       central to the department's evaluation process. First, for       more than two decades, Treasury has been at the forefront of       efforts to implement global anti-money laundering and       counter-terrorism financing standards. The bill emphasizes       that these standards should be a critical component in the       evaluation of licenses vis-a-vis Iranian aircraft       transactions. Second, the bill's requirement that no persons       knowingly supporting proliferation benefit from the deal       mirrors Treasury's statement that no persons on sanctions       lists be involved in the transactions.        While not imposing any new standards for the approval of       sales to Iran, codifying the existing standards in law       through this bill makes the licensing process more       transparent and gives the American people--through their       elected representatives--a clearer picture of a significant       component of the sanctions relief provided to Iran under the       nuclear agreement.        The most novel component of the bill is that it requires       the secretary of the Treasury to issue a report listing all       U.S. or foreign financial institutions that have conducted       authorized transactions in connection with the export or re-      export of commercial aircraft to Iran. While not classified,       this information is not currently part of the public record.       Objections to the publication of a list of companies and       banks involved in aircraft sales revolve around exposing       businesses to reputational risks for transacting with Iran.       Yet it is unavoidable for there to be reputational risk for       doing business--even legal business--with the world's leading       state sponsor of terrorism.     In closing, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman, my fellow  Texan, has given all Members an opportunity, no matter what their views  on the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal, to simply support transparency and  Congress' right to basic information. I hope that my colleagues will  seize that opportunity.   And, again, I thank Mr. Williams from Texas for his leadership and  his excellent work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Williams), my friend, the sponsor of this legislation, and a  great member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Zeldin), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), an outstanding member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd), a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chairman emeritus of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee and chairman of its Subcommittee on the  Middle East and North Africa.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman), a member of the Small  Business Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, from time to time in my Congressional career I come to  the House floor, and I have a surreal moment. Iran is the world's  foremost state sponsor of terror, and we have Members on the other side  of the aisle saying: Well, we shouldn't learn anything about them. We  shouldn't learn about who is financing their aircraft. We shouldn't  learn whether or not aircraft will be converted for military purposes.   Iran is a regime where every day the leadership wakes up shouting:  ``Death to Israel, Death to America.'' Yet I have friends on the other  side of the aisle who say: Well, we shouldn't have any reporting on  Iran because it might hurt their feelings.   This is a surreal moment, Mr. Speaker, an absolute surreal moment. We  have been told over and over that somehow this stops the JCPOA, the  nuclear deal with Iran. I wish it did, but it doesn't. I would suggest  to my friends on the other side of the aisle, if they actually read the  bill, it is 10 pages long, 6 pages of findings. You can put the  findings aside and read the 4 pages. It is a reporting bill.   It has certifications. And guess what the implications are if the  administration can't give the proper certifications? Nothing. The deal  continues to go on. It is perhaps the single worst foreign policy  agreement in the history of America that legitimizes Iran's nuclear  program and, on its best day, slows up their nuclear weapons by maybe a  few years, at best, on its best day.    When the JCPOA was sold to us by the previous administration, we were  told: This would be for civilian aircraft use only. Don't worry about  it. This is not going to exacerbate terrorism in any way. But we know  Boeing itself says their aircraft, which are being sold to Iran, can be  used for combat purposes, and, in fact, have been. Iran Air was cited  in 2011. It was sanctioned for supporting the Islamic Revolutionary  Guard Corps, which has been designated as a terrorist organization.  [[Page H9889]]    This isn't just theory, Mr. Speaker. It is a fact. Then we had my  colleague, the gentleman from Washington, say: Well, it is important  that we sell aircraft to Iran so companies can make profits. Well,  using his logic, maybe we ought to sell weapons to North Korea if some  company can make a profit. I think not, Mr. Speaker.   There are some things that are more important. Our security is even  more important than the profit of any one particular company. So,  again, this is a simple reporting requirement.   I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) for his  leadership here. It is incredibly important that we understand from  those who sold us this terrible Iranian deal, they need to make good on  their promises.   We need to make sure that civilian aircraft are being used for  civilian purposes. We need to make sure that the banks who are  financing these deals are not financing terrorism. Yet those on the  other side of the aisle say: No, let's put our heads in the sand. Let's  just trust--let's trust the world's foremost state sponsor of  terrorism. They will do the right thing. Let's just ignore this  terrorism thing.   No. No, Mr. Speaker. That is why it is so important that we enact  H.R. 4324, and I urge all my colleagues to vote for it. It is important  to America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the  aisle seem to be schizophrenic. They can't seem to figure out whether  they want to coddle Iran or to ``stand up to'' Iran. We were also told  that H.R. 4324 was designed to ``blame and shame'' financial  institutions, and now they offer a motion to recommit to blame and  shame financial institutions.   So here is what is going on, Mr. Speaker: What we have is a regime  that wakes up every morning shouting ``Death to America; death to  Israel,'' and yet we have a motion to recommit trying to relitigate the  2016 Presidential election.   We have a regime which has been certified as the world's foremost  state sponsor of terrorism whom we are trying to hold accountable and  from whom we are trying to get information, and our friends on the  other side of the aisle are trying to relitigate the 2016 Presidential  election.   We know that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps supports the Assad  regime in Syria. According to the U.N., the Assad government, with the  help of Iran, has now carried out 27 chemical weapon attacks since the  start of the Syrian conflict, including an April 2017 sarin gas attack  that killed more than 80 people, including scores of women and  children, and my friends on the other side of the aisle want to  relitigate the 2016 Presidential election.    Mr. Speaker, Iran continues to imprison foreign nationals, including  Americans--including Americans--including 81-year-old Baquer Namazi,  who has lost his teeth in prison due to malnutrition. We have had  another American prisoner, a student at Princeton, who has suffered  health problems, and yet my friends on the other side of the aisle,  with their motion to recommit, want to relitigate the 2016 Presidential  election.   This is a serious moment, Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4324 by the gentleman  from Texas is an important piece of legislation to ensure that civilian  aircraft sales to Iran remain civilian aircraft and that our financial  institutions are not unwittingly helping to finance this rogue  terrorist regime, and it is no time to relitigate an election that my  friends on the other side of the aisle lost.  [[Page H9891]]    We need to reject the motion to recommit, and we need to enact H.R.  4324.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
