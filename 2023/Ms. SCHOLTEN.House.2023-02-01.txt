 Mr. Speaker, I am on the House floor today to talk  about an element that sustains us all--water.   My home State of Michigan is surrounded by four out of the five Great  Lakes--our Nation's largest freshwater reserve. The Great Lakes region  is home to 51 million jobs and has a GDP of $6 trillion. It is an  economic powerhouse.   Yet, despite the abundance of freshwater surrounding us, many of our  constituents do not have access to reliable and safe drinking water.  PFAS and lead contamination continue to be an issue for many West  Michiganders. The Great Lakes are home to one of our Nation's most  incredible landmarks but are under dire threat from climate change.   We must protect our freshwater supply nationally and internationally.  The Great Lakes contain 90 percent of the United States' freshwater  supply and 20 percent of the global supply. We have to work with  urgency to protect this precious resource.   The importance of water nationwide cannot be understated. It is an  environmental matter, an economic matter, and a matter of national  security.   This week, I am launching my work on the Transportation and  Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water and the Environment where I will  work to protect this vital resource, and I invite my colleagues to join  me.                            ____________________
