 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 144) to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services,  acting through the Director of the Indian Health Service, to acquire  private land to facilitate access to the Desert Sage Youth Wellness  Center in Hemet, California, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 144         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Desert Sage Youth Wellness       Center Access Improvement Act''.  [[Page H6687]]            SEC. 2. ACCESS ROAD FOR DESERT SAGE YOUTH WELLNESS CENTER.         (a) Acquisition of Land.--        (1) Authorization.--The Secretary of Health and Human       Services, acting through the Director of the Indian Health       Service, is authorized to acquire, from willing sellers, the       land in Hemet, California, upon which is located a dirt road       known as ``Best Road'', beginning at the driveway of the       Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center at Faure Road and extending       to the junction of Best Road and Sage Road.        (2) Compensation.--The Secretary shall pay fair market       value for the land authorized to be acquired under paragraph       (1). Fair market value shall be determined--        (A) using Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land       Acquisitions; and        (B) by an appraiser acceptable to the Secretary and the       owners of the land to be acquired.        (3) Additional rights.--In addition to the land referred to       in paragraph (1), the Secretary is authorized to acquire,       from willing sellers, land or interests in land as reasonably       necessary to construct and maintain the road as required by       subsection (b).        (b) Construction and Maintenance of Road.--        (1) Construction.--After the Secretary acquires the land       pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary shall construct on       that land a paved road that is generally located over Best       Road to facilitate access to the Desert Sage Youth Wellness       Center in Hemet, California.        (2) Maintenance.--The Secretary shall--        (A) maintain and manage the road constructed pursuant to       paragraph (1); or        (B) enter into an agreement with Riverside County,       California, to own, maintain and manage the road constructed       pursuant to paragraph (1).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 144 authorizes the Indian Health Service, or IHS, to  purchase land in Hemet, California, for the purpose of constructing a  paved road that facilitates access to the Desert Sage Youth Wellness  Center. IHS will then maintain the road or enter into an agreement with  Riverside County, California, to maintain the road.   This critical legislation will expand healthcare access to American  Indian and Alaska Native youth in California by ensuring that the  Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center can be reached by safe roadways.   Prior to 2016, indigenous youth in California experiencing substance  use disorders were forced to travel to out-of-State facilities in order  to receive care. Recognizing this added barrier to quality care, IHS  built the Desert Sage Wellness Center in Hemet, California. The center  is notable for providing culturally sensitive treatment to indigenous  youth battling substance use disorders and can hold up to 32 patients  at a time.   Unfortunately, during the center's construction, IHS was unable to  reach an agreement with adjacent property holders on the pavement and  maintenance of an access road to the facility. As a result, the center  is currently accessible only by a dirt road that is often washed out  from heavy rainfall or in a general state of disrepair.   The center remains the sole IHS youth regional treatment facility in  the State, and it is a much-needed resource to California's American  Indian and Alaska Native communities. However, the center's physical  inaccessibility poses yet another obstacle to indigenous youth seeking  care.   This bill will solve the issue by granting IHS the authority to  acquire the necessary nearby land in order to build an operational  access road to the center.   I thank Senator Feinstein for moving this important bill through the  Senate, as well as our colleague, Representative Raul Ruiz, for  championing the House version of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge swift adoption of S. 144, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1286) to establish in the States of North Carolina and South  Carolina the Southern Campaign of the Revolution National Heritage  Corridor, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1286, the Southern  Campaign of the Revolution National Heritage Corridor Act, introduced  by our esteemed colleague, Majority Whip Clyburn.   H.R. 1286 would establish in the States of North Carolina and South  Carolina the Southern Campaign of the Revolution national heritage  corridor.   The Revolution national heritage corridor is an 8-mile-wide area  filled with an abundance of the Carolinas' Revolutionary War sites and  historic resources, including battlefields, historic communities,  farmsteads, and landscapes. These Revolutionary War sites are critical  to the preservation of the Carolinas' history, as they reflect the  cultural and natural environments of North Carolina and South Carolina  in the late 18th century.   The protection, conservation, and restoration of these sites ensure  that the story of these sites is preserved so that residents of and  visitors to the corridor can have the opportunity to learn from and  understand its rich history.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Clyburn, for  introducing this important legislation and championing this bill on  behalf of my constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1286, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  this important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2024) to establish the Southern Maryland National Heritage  Area, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 2024         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Southern Maryland National       Heritage Area Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

(6) State.--The term ``State'' means the State of  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2024, the Southern Maryland  National Heritage Area Act, introduced by our esteemed colleague,  Majority Leader Hoyer.   This bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish the  Southern Maryland National Heritage Area to preserve, protect, and  restore the area along with the local coordinating entity.   The heritage area would include portions of St. Mary's, Calvert,  Charles, and Prince George's counties in Maryland, with the specific  boundaries to be established by the Department of the Interior.   A management plan would be proposed from the Tri-City Council, which  is also serving as the local coordinating entity. This management plan  would come no later than 3 years after which the funds are made  available to carry out this act. An inventory will also be taken  because of the significance of the property.   Establishing this Southern Maryland National Heritage Area ensures  that the land is maintained, preserved, and protected so all Americans  will be able to use this space, as well as to learn and understand its  rich history.   I, again, congratulate Majority Leader Hoyer for championing this  bill on behalf of his constituents, and I urge everyone to support the  bill today.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time and I  am prepared to close, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote on this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.

(c) Prohibition on the Acquisition of Real Property.--The       local coordinating entity shall not use Federal funds to       acquire real property or any interest in real property.       SEC. 5.

SEC. 9. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.         The authority of the Secretary to provide assistance under       this Act terminates on the date that is 15 years after the       date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3222, the Alabama Black  Belt National Heritage Area Act.   This bill would establish the Alabama Black Belt National Heritage  Area, consisting of land in 19 counties in the State of Alabama,  including Montgomery County, as a national heritage area.   The region's identity is rooted in its cultural geography and  historical development. During the mid-1900s, Alabama's Black Belt area  gave rise to the civil rights movement emerging in the South.   Montgomery County witnessed the bus boycotts in the 1950s. Dallas,  Lowndes, and Montgomery Counties also gave way for the famous march for  equal rights from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, led by the Reverend  Martin Luther King, Jr.   National heritage areas leverage private funding for long-term  projects that have substantial economic and environmental benefits. The  protection, conservation, and restoration of Alabama's Black Belt area,  in partnership with the National Park Service, will ensure that the  powerful history of this area is preserved for posterity. These are  stories that need to be told.   I thank my colleague, Representative Sewell, for introducing this  important legislation and championing this bill on behalf of her  constituents.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3222, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I too, urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''  on this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4404) to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate  segments of the Kissimmee River in the State of Florida as a component  of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4404         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Kissimmee River Wild and       Scenic River Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION FOR STUDY OF WILD AND SCENIC RIVER                     SEGMENTS, KISSIMMEE RIVER, FLORIDA.         Section 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C.       1276(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(__) Kissimmee river, florida.--The restored segment of       the Kissimmee River, beginning approximately 16 miles       downstream of Lake Kissimmee and ending approximately 15       miles upstream of Lake Okeechobee.''.       SEC. 3. STUDIES AND REPORTS.         Section 5(b) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C.       1276(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(__) Kissimmee river, florida.--Not later than 3 years       after the date on which funds are made available to carry out       this paragraph, the Secretary of the Interior shall--        ``(A) complete the study of the Kissimmee River, Florida       named in paragraph (_) of subsection (a); and        ``(B) submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and       Natural Resources of the Senate a report that describes the       results of the study.''.       SEC. 4. EFFECT ON MANAGEMENT.         This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not       interfere with the current management of the area of the       Kissimmee River described in section 5(a)(_) of the Wild and       Scenic Rivers Act, nor shall the fact that such area is       listed for study under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16       U.S.C. 1271 et seq.) be used as justification for more       restrictive management until Congress acts on the study       recommendations.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4404, the Kissimmee  River Wild and Scenic River Act to direct the Secretary of the Interior  to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and designate segments of the  Kissimmee River as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers  System.   After efforts in the 1940s to control the Kissimmee River's flow led  to issues that destroyed habitats, Congress directed the Army Corps of  Engineers to restore the river back to its original path in the 1990s.   The completion of this project has already contributed to the return  of many wildlife species and a healthier ecosystem.   This bill will ensure that the restored segments of the river are  preserved for future generations to enjoy, by adding them to the  National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.   Congress created the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System in 1968  to preserve certain rivers with outstanding natural, cultural, and  recreational values in a free-flowing condition for the enjoyment of  present and future generations.   I thank my colleague, Representative Soto, for introducing this  important legislation and championing it on behalf of his constituents.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I too, urge a ``yes'' vote on this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6337) to require the Secretary of the Interior and the  Secretary of Agriculture to develop long-distance bike trails on  Federal land, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6337         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Biking on Long-Distance       Trails Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Federal recreational lands.--The term ``Federal       recreational lands'' has the meaning given the term ``Federal       recreational lands and waters'' in section 802(5) of the       Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (16 U.S.C. 6801(5)).        (2) Long-distance bike trail.--The term ``long-distance       bike trail'' means a continuous route, consisting of 1 or       more trails or rights-of-way, that--        (A) is not less than 80 miles in length;        (B) primarily makes use of dirt or natural surface trails;        (C) may require connections along paved or other improved       roads;        (D) does not include Federal recreational lands where       mountain biking or related activities are not consistent with       management requirements for those Federal recreational lands;       and        (E) to the maximum extent practicable, makes use of trails       and roads that were on Federal recreational lands on or       before the date of the enactment of this Act.        (3) Secretaries.--The term ``Secretaries'' means the       Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture,       acting jointly.        (4) Secretary concerned.--The term ``Secretary concerned''       means the following:        (A) The Secretary of the Interior, with respect to Federal       recreational lands under the jurisdiction of that Secretary.        (B) The Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to Federal       recreational lands under the jurisdiction of that Secretary.       SEC. 3. LONG-DISTANCE BIKE TRAILS ON FEDERAL RECREATIONAL                     LANDS.         (a) Identification of Long-distance Trails.--Not later than       18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Secretaries shall identify--        (1) not fewer than 10 long-distance bike trails that make       use of trails and roads in existence on the date of the       enactment of this Act; and        (2) not fewer than 10 areas in which there is an       opportunity to develop or complete a trail that would qualify       as a long-distance bike trail.        (b) Public Comment.--The Secretaries shall--        (1) develop a process to allow members of the public to       comment regarding the identification of trails and areas       under subsection (a); and        (2) consider the identification, development, and       completion of long-distance bike trails in a geographically       equitable manner.        (c) Maps, Signage, and Promotional Materials.--For any       long-distance bike trail identified under subsection (a), the       Secretary concerned may--        (1) publish and distribute maps, install signage, and issue       promotional materials; and        (2) coordinate with stakeholders to leverage any non-      Federal resources necessary for the stewardship, development,       or completion of trails.        (d) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretaries, in partnership with       interested organizations, shall prepare and publish a report       that lists the trails identified under subsection (a),       including a summary of public comments received in accordance       with the process developed under subsection (b).        (e) Conflict Avoidance With Other Uses.--The Secretary       concerned shall ensure that each long-distance bike trail or       area identified under subsection (a)--        (1) does not conflict with--        (A) the uses, before the date of the enactment of this Act,       of any trail or road that is part of that long-distance bike       trail;        (B) multiple-use areas where biking, hiking, horseback       riding, or use by pack and saddle stock are existing uses on       the date of the enactment of this Act;        (C) the purposes for which any trail was or is established       under the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. 1241 et       seq.); and        (D) any area managed under the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C.       1131 et seq.); and        (2) complies with land use and management plans of the       Federal recreational lands that are part of that long-      distance bike trail.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 6337, the Biking on Long-Distance  Trails Act.   This bill would expand outdoor recreational opportunities by  developing and completing long-distance bike trails and expanding  mapping resources  [[Page H6695]]  for long-distance biking on Federal land.   The legislation would expand outdoor recreation opportunities  throughout the country and boost local economies that rely on tourism  and the outdoor industry.   Additionally, ensuring Americans have access to public lands is  critical to the development of multiple-use management, which includes  outdoor recreation, resource development, and grazing. This bill  identifies long-distance bike trails on Federal lands, making them  easier for the public to explore and use for personal enjoyment.   I thank my colleague, Representative Neguse, for introducing this  important legislation and championing it on behalf of his constituents.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2022.      Hon. David Scott,      Chair, Committee on Agriculture,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Scott: I write to you concerning H.R. 6337 the       ``Biking on Long-Distance Trails Act.''        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Agriculture. I acknowledge that your Committee will not       formally consider H.R. 6337 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in the       bill that fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.        Additionally, the Committee on Natural Resources confirms       our mutual understanding that the Committee on Agriculture       will be appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or       similar legislation moves forward so that you may address any       remaining issues within your jurisdiction. I am pleased to       support the appointment of members of the Committee on       Agriculture to any conference committee to consider such       provisions.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Raul M. Grijalva,      Chair, House Natural Resources Committee.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2022.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva: This letter confirms our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 6337, the Biking on Long-      Distance Trails Act. Thank you for collaborating with the       Committee on Agriculture.        Our Committee will forgo consideration of this bill so that       it can proceed expeditiously to the House floor. However, the       Committee on Agriculture reserves the right to seek the       appointment of conferees to any House-Senate conference and       requests consultation on any remaining matters within our       jurisdiction.        We would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 6337, and request       that a copy of our letters on this matter be published in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration.            Sincerely,                                                       David Scott,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation and yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7002) to authorize the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri,  to be illuminated by blue and yellow lights in support of Ukraine, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7002         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Gateway Solidarity Act''.       SEC. 2. ILLUMINATION OF THE GATEWAY ARCH IN SUPPORT OF                     UKRAINE.         To show support and solidarity with the Ukrainian people,       the Secretary of the Interior shall illuminate the Gateway       Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, by blue and yellow lights--        (A) in 2022, within 15 days following enactment of this       act, for no fewer than 5 consecutive days; and        (B) annually on August 24, in recognition of Ukrainian       Independence Day, until the President reports to Congress       that the government of the Russian Federation has ceased its       destabilizing activities with respect to the sovereignty and       territorial integrity of Ukraine.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7002, the Gateway Solidarity  Act, to illuminate the St. Louis Gateway Arch in the colors of the  Ukrainian flag.   As we know, Russian president Vladimir Putin launched an unprovoked  invasion of Ukraine, and since then, the country and its people have  experienced the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II--a  conflict consisting of Russian attacks that have leveled Ukrainian  cities, caused civilian casualties, and sparked an enormous refugee  crisis.   Introduced by my colleague across the aisle, Representative Ann  Wagner, this bill would require the Secretary of the Interior to  illuminate the Gateway Arch in the colors of the Ukrainian flag to show  that we, in the United States, are behind Ukraine, sending a message to  our friends and allies in Europe and across the globe that the American  people are supportive of a sovereign Ukrainian nation.   I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 7002 and reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote and yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7025) to prohibit the Director of the United States Fish and  Wildlife Service from funding entities that commit, fund, or support  gross violations of internationally recognized human rights, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The Director may consider, in       determining an appropriate  [[Page H6698]]       remedy of a violation of a grant requirement under such       provision, whether the covered recipient was in compliance       with subsection (a)(1)(D) at the time of such violation.

(k) Safeguard for Sensitive Information.--In carrying out       this section, the Director may take such measures and       withhold such information as the Director determines       necessary to protect the safety of individuals--        (1) who are victims, or at risk of being victims, of a       gross violation of internationally recognized human rights;       and        (2) who provide information regarding a potential gross       violation of internationally recognized human rights.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7025 is a bipartisan bill led by the chair and the  ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee. It will  significantly improve the management and oversight of international  conservation programs at the Department of the Interior.   Over the past couple of years, our committee conducted a bipartisan  investigation into the role of the Worldwide Wildlife Fund, or WWF, and  the Department of the Interior, DOI, regarding allegations of human  rights abuses at conservation parks around the world.   The reports are deeply upsetting, describing decades of abuse toward  indigenous and local people in the name of conservation.   The committee's oversight hearing in October revealed numerous  shortcomings in how WWF carries out its work and how DOI oversees grant  funding in challenging locations.   These allegations aren't unique. Leading voices at the U.N. and  elsewhere have, for years, warned of grave abuses in the name of  conservation, in large part due to the colonial-based ``fortress  conservation model'' that kicked indigenous and local people off their  lands to set up protected areas.   International conservation efforts are critical to the success of our  national security, international development, climate, and biodiversity  goals.   However, when investing in these goals, we must ensure commonsense  safeguards are in place that protect human rights. This bill does that.   First, it expands human rights vetting to international Fish and  Wildlife Service-funded conservation projects. It prohibits Fish and  Wildlife Service funds from going to armed groups that commit gross  violations of human rights.   Second, the bill establishes a thorough, fair, and transparent  process for investigating credible allegations of human rights abuses.   Third, this legislation weaves the highest human rights standards  into grant contracts.   This bill is common sense, it is good government, and it will make  international conservation more successful, benefiting local and  indigenous community members and the planet.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation and reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Mexico for  mentioning Professor Knox. He was an outstanding witness in our  hearings on this subject.   The truth is, the product of 3 years of work that is before us today  was a really good exercise in bipartisan leadership, so I appreciate  that.   I have no further requests for time and am prepared to close, so I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation  and yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7693) to amend title 54, United States Code, to reauthorize  the National Park Foundation.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7693         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Park Foundation       Reauthorization Act of 2022''.  [[Page H6699]]            SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE NATIONAL PARK                     FOUNDATION.         Section 101122(a) of title 54, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) by striking ``$5,000,000'' and inserting       ``$15,000,000''; and        (2) by striking ``2023'' and inserting ``2030''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7693, the National Park  Foundation Reauthorization Act of 2022.   This bill will ensure that the congressionally charted philanthropic  partner of the National Park Service can continue supporting our parks  for years to come.   Specifically, this bill will reauthorize Federal funding for the  National Park Foundation through 2030 and increase the overall annual  authorization level from $5 million to $15 million.   This is a smart and commonsense investment in the future of our  national parks. Every Federal dollar requires a minimum 1-to-1 match  with private dollars, creating a multiplying effect that reaches units  throughout the entire system.   After more than 100 incredible years, our national parks are more  popular than ever. This means they need our support to ensure that the  National Park Service can address challenges that include aging  infrastructure, overcrowding, and inconsistent funding from Congress.   The National Park Foundation is a key partner and ally. Innovative  partnerships that leverage Federal investments and private donations  help our parks thrive. I am proud to support this bill today so that  the foundation can keep serving this important role.   Later this week, we will consider the Interior Appropriations  legislation, which includes vital funding for the National Park  Service.   I thank my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for developing  a bill that includes a robust investment in our national parks, and I  hope that Congress can keep making sound investments that ensure the  National Park Service continues to thrive throughout its second century  and beyond.   I thank our colleague, Ranking Member Westerman, for introducing this  important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes,'' and reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
