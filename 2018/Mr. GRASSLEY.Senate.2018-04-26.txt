 Madam President, today, April 26, 2018, we celebrate  World Intellectual Property Day and recognize the important role  intellectual property plays in the fabric of society. We take time to  recognize the innovators and creators who are making our lives  healthier, safer, and more productive through their ingenuity and the  robust system of intellectual property protections enshrined in our  laws.   This year's World Intellectual Property Day campaign in particular  celebrates the women who are driving change and making our common  future better though innovation in so many fields including science,  healthcare, art, engineering, and design, just to name a few.   Inspiring contributions from countless women are powering innovation  in our world. For example, Helen Murray Free was inducted into the  National Inventor's Hall of Fame in 2000 and awarded the national medal  of technology and innovation in 2010 for her pioneering work in self- testing systems for diabetes. She received seven patents for her work.  Iowa's own Mary Florence Potts also used the American patent system to  protect three of her inventions. Her work improved the safety of common  household appliances, and her novel iron design was even displayed at  the 1876 World's Fair in Philadelphia. Elise Harmon holds numerous  patents for technology, ranging from microprocessor production to high- altitude carbon brush performance. Our intellectual property system  must continue to protect and reward the work of women like Helen Murray  Free, Mary Florence Potts, and Elise Harmon.   We need to continue creating an environment where innovative,  creative women are empowered, connected, and celebrated. This involves  ensuring a robust, inclusive intellectual property system that fosters  and rewards innovation and the widespread ingenuity that has made  America a leading force in the global economy.   The Founding Fathers recognized that robust intellectual property  infrastructure fosters creative talent and enhances innovative spark.  Article I, section 8 of the Constitution says ``Congress shall have  power . . . to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by  securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right  to their respective writings and discoveries.'' Placing this authority  within Congress's enumerated powers underscores the weight that our  Founding Fathers placed on intellectual property's value to the budding  Nation. Although the American system of intellectual property rights  has evolved since the ratification of the Constitution, its core  mission of promoting innovation has remained constant. As a result,  America has long been on the forefront of intellectual property and a  leader in so many IP-intensive fields. Our IP system is one that  rightly rewards creativity and passion, characteristics common to so  many Americans.   Intellectual property is also critical to our national economy  because it fuels innovation that improves lives and creates jobs. The  United States is one of the most dynamic and innovative countries in  the world. Our Nation's success in areas such as agriculture,  manufacturing, computer technology, and medicine can be traced in large  measure to our respect for and protection of intellectual property. In  our modern, innovation economy, patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade  secrets, and other forms of IP are more critical than ever. IP  protections and incentives drive enormous economic activity and  development, helping assure America's place as an economic and  intellectual beacon to the world. According to the U.S. Commerce  Department, IP-intensive industries account for more than 45 million  direct and indirect U.S. jobs--that is nearly a third of the  workforce--and almost 40 percent of U.S. GDP. In addition, these jobs  pay well. Average weekly wages in IP-intensive industries are 46  percent higher than in non-IP intensive fields. As a society, we depend  on innovators not just to fuel our economy, but to make our lives  better and to solve the challenges we face. These innovators, in turn,  depend on different forms of intellectual property.   The Judiciary Committee plays an important role in protecting  intellectual property. The committee exercises jurisdiction over our  Nation's intellectual property laws, including those governing patents,  trademarks, and copyrights. We consider legislation that helps to  ensure that intellectual property rights continue to promote jobs and  innovation. The committee also exercises important oversight of the  Patent and Trademark Office, the Office of the Intellectual Property  Enforcement Coordinator, and various law enforcement entities charged  with protecting IP. Just last week, we held an oversight hearing with  Director  [[Page S2479]]  Iancu from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We heard about what is  going well and about some of the difficulties facing the Office, as  well as other intellectual property stakeholders. As chairman of the  Senate Judiciary Committee, I will continue to embrace my role as a  promoter of intellectual property rights, innovation, and ultimately  American jobs.   This World Intellectual Property Day, it is important to once again  recognize the significance of our Nation's robust system of  intellectual property protection and enforcement. As we recognize the  positive impacts IP has on innovation, let's continue to find ways to  work together to ensure its protection against infringement. We want  the United States to maintain its position as the most innovative and  creative country in the world.                            ____________________
