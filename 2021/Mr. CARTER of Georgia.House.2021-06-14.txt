 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Sheriff Craig Nobles of Long County, Georgia, for his heroic actions  saving 22 dogs on May 24, 2021.   Sheriff Nobles was responding to a brush fire and discovered 22 dogs  tied to trees in the wood line. After containing the scene, first  responders successfully saved all 22 dogs that are now safe and  healthy.   The First Congressional District is fortunate to have Sheriff Nobles  serving and protecting not only the people in the community, but man's  best friend as well.   After seeing the faces of the 22 dogs, I am thankful for the first  responders who rescued these dogs that are now able to find a loving  home.   I am proud to rise today to congratulate Sheriff Nobles, the Long  County Sheriff's Office, and the Long County Fire Department for their  great work in saving these precious animals.                            ____________________
