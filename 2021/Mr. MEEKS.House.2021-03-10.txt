 Mr. Speaker, as chair of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, I speak in support of the international provisions of the  American Rescue Plan.   Pandemics do not respect international borders. COVID-19 won't end in  America until it is brought under control around the world. The $10  billion included in this package for international support are a small,  yet critical, investment in fighting COVID and its effects around the  world.   This portion of the bill prioritizes global health, providing more  that $4.6 billion to relieve overburdened healthcare systems and  medical workers, and helping governments and multilateral partners  develop and distribute vaccines.   To address the humanitarian crises exacerbated by this pandemic, the  American Rescue Plan provides funding for lifesaving assistance,  including shelter, food, clean water, and basic medical care. It also  provides COVID-related relief to refugees, who are already among the  most vulnerable; and to our multilateral partners, such as the World  Food Program and UNICEF, who can leverage their other partners and  their global reach to maximize these dollars.    These provisions would also provide nearly $1 billion in flexible  funding for economic support to help ensure that even more need isn't  created as a result of the economic impacts of COVID, which are already  severe.   It will support our diplomats and development professionals, enabling  them to scale up and adapt to the pandemic, and continue to serve  Americans and our country's interests around the world.   The Foreign Affairs provisions represent approximately \1/2\ of 1  percent of the overall package. These funds support America's foreign  commitments to the poorest nations least able to tackle the pandemic.
