 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to  me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the underlying  bill, and I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that  the House can vote on my bipartisan legislation, the Presidential Tax  Transparency Act.   Mr. Speaker, in the last week, the President fired the FBI Director  who was investigating him. We then learned that the President also  pressured the Director to end his investigation of Michael Flynn's  Russia entanglements. These revelations, added to so many others, make  it abundantly clear that we must have disclosure of the President's tax  returns in order to fully understand his connections to Russia. The  Presidential Tax Transparency Act would require this disclosure for the  current President, all future Presidents, and Presidential nominees.                                time  1245    This practice has never been required by law. But if there were ever  a time for Congress to codify this bipartisan disclosure tradition, now  is the time.   The President's behavior has raised questions since before the  election about what connections or exposure he may have to Russian  officials. After the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA concluded that Russia  did, in fact, interfere in our national elections; after several of the  President's associates and staff lied about meetings with Russian  officials during the campaign and transition; and after the FBI opened  an investigation into these Russia contacts, the President still  welcomed top Russian diplomats into the Oval Office for a closed-door  meeting last week.   Holding the meeting itself raised many questions. But in the meeting,  the President revealed highly classified, code-word information to the  Russians. I believe that this is unprecedented. No President in the  history of our country has ever done such a thing.   And on May 16, The New York Times reported that the President pressed  the former FBI Director Jim Comey to end his investigation of Michael  Flynn's ties to Russia before he fired him. This all begs the question:  Why is the President so eager to please the Russians?   The appointment of former FBI Director Mueller, a highly  distinguished public servant, as special counsel is most welcome. But I  believe that Congress can act today to provide public disclosure of the  President's tax returns, which would provide an immediate and important  window into the President's potential Russian entanglements, and answer  the critical questions of: To whom does he owe money? And who is the  President doing business with? What are those entities?   We know there are 564 of them. The American people deserve to know.  Only with full disclosure will we know the true sources of the  President's income, the holders of his debt, and the extent of any  business ties to Russia and other foreign countries.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a highly serious, bipartisan--I want to  stress that--bipartisan effort to exercise Congress' constitutional  duty to serve as a check and balance on the executive branch as a  coequal branch of government.   As the former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said on  May 14:         Our institutions are under attack, both externally . . .       and internally.    I want to thank all of the cosponsors of this bill and, most  especially, the Republicans who have had the courage to do so. It takes  courage to have courage. Now is the time to stand up and demonstrate  courage so that the American people will have confidence--confidence in  what takes place here and to answer the questions that are left  unanswered.   So by defeating the previous question today and voting to approve the  Presidential Tax Transparency Act, Congress can create a pathway to the  facts, and then the truth, that the American people have a right to  know.
