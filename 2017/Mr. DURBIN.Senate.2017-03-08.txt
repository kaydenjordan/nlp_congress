 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in recent weeks, we have seen an  astonishing series of revelations about Russia's efforts to influence  the 2016 election in support of the Donald Trump campaign. Last week,  the Washington Post reported that Attorney General Jeff Sessions met  with the Russian Ambassador in July and September during the campaign.  Yet, during his confirmation hearing, the Attorney General said under  oath: ``I did not have communications with the Russians.''   Last Thursday, the Attorney General announced he would partially  recuse himself from any investigation into the Presidential campaign. I  note that this was a partial recusal when it comes to investigations  into Russia's influence on President Trump and his circle of advisers  and associates. The scope of the recusal is still unclear. For example,  Attorney General Sessions does not even appear to believe that his own  meeting with the Russian Ambassador on September 8, 2016, was related  to the campaign. The scope of his recusal will need to be clarified.   We also continue to learn of previously undisclosed communications  between the Russians and President Trump's inner circle. For example,  we learned last week that Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law  and senior adviser, had met in December with the Russian Ambassador in  Trump Tower, along with the President's National Security Advisor,  Michael Flynn, who resigned on February 13. People across America are  wondering when the next shoe will drop.   It is becoming clear that the President is desperate to change the  headlines from these Russian revelations--so desperate, in fact, that  in a series of tweets on Saturday morning, President Trump claimed that  President Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower in an act President Trump  described as ``McCarthyism'' and ``Nixon/Watergate.'' Well, President  Trump's tweets again made news but not in the way he had hoped. It  quickly became clear that President Trump has no evidence to back up  his claims. In fact, it appeared he got his information not from  America's law enforcement or intelligence agencies but from rightwing  talk radio.   On Sunday, the former Director of National Intelligence, James  Clapper, denied the President's claims, and the Director of the FBI,  James Comey, took an extraordinary step of calling on the Justice  Department to publicly deny the President's claims. Even Republicans  like House Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz and Trey Gowdy,  chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, said they had not seen  any evidence that would support what President Trump tweeted.  Nonetheless, the President's spokespeople doubled down, saying that the  President does not accept the contention of the FBI Director and he  stands by his tweets.   Let's be clear. President Trump is playing games with the credibility  of his Presidency. Donald Trump is destroying the credibility of the  Office of the President 140 characters at a time. If President Trump  had consulted with his adviser--any credible adviser--prior to his  tweets, he would have learned something that is crucial, and it is as  follows: The President of the United States does not have the authority  to order a wiretap. Instead, such a wiretap can be granted upon a  finding by a court that there is probable cause to believe the target  has committed a crime or is an agent of a foreign power.   Clearly, there are more revelations to come. The only question: How  long is it going to take? How much damage will be done to the  credibility of the Office of the President and America in the process?   These recent events confirm yet again the need for an independent,  transparent, bipartisan commission led by Americans of unimpeachable  integrity to get to the bottom of this Russian attack on the United  States. Russia attacked our democracy. We need to fully understand what  happened. We certainly need to prevent it from happening in the next  election or ever again.   This week, a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that Americans,  by a margin of 58 percent to 35 percent, believe an outside independent  investigation is needed into Russian involvement in our election. It is  worthy of note that just a few weeks ago, only 30-something percent of  the American people were aware of this controversy with Russia. Now  over 55 percent of people want an independent investigation. America is  listening.   We also need the Justice Department and the FBI to proceed with a  credible, impartial investigation to determine if there may have been  any criminal conduct involved.   Yesterday, the President's nominee for Deputy Attorney General, Rod  Rosenstein, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee. If  confirmed, Mr. Rosenstein would oversee any Justice Department  investigation into the Trump administration's Russian connections  after Attorney General Sessions has partially recused himself. So I  pressed Mr. Rosenstein to clarify the scope of Attorney General  Sessions' recusal commitment. I also asked, as did Senator Feinstein,  whether Mr. Rosenstein had read the January 6 Intelligence Community  assessment into Russian election interference. I cannot explain it, but  in 2 months Mr. Rosenstein had not read this 15-page, unclassified  report that is available on the internet. It focuses on the major issue  he will face initially as Deputy Attorney General, and he told us he  had not read it.    Let me add that I respect Rod Rosenstein. He served as U.S. attorney  in Maryland, appointed first under a Republican President and held over  under a Democratic President, and that says a lot about his  professionalism as a prosecutor, his reputation, and his integrity. It  is hard for me to believe that he could come before a hearing, which he  knew would focus on the need for a special prosecutor to look into this  Russian interference, and not have been briefed to read the 15-page  public report that summarizes the conclusions of all of America's  intelligence agencies when it comes to this Russian interference.   I am sure he is an excellent lawyer who wouldn't enter a courtroom or  stand before a judge or jury without complete preparation to the best  of his ability, but yesterday, time and again, he told us he didn't  take the time to read this report. I urge him to do so as quickly as  possible, and when he reads it, he will see that our intelligence  agencies are unequivocal in their statement that Vladimir Putin was  setting out to elect Donald Trump and to defeat Hillary Clinton. This  is not a report from the Democratic National Committee; it is a report  from our intelligence agencies. And whomever Putin was trying to help,  that is secondary to the fact that he was hacking into the internet,  disclosing materials, and trying to become a material player in our  Presidential election.   Mr. President, 3 weeks ago, I went to visit Poland, Lithuania, and  Ukraine. They are watching this carefully because they have been the  victims of Vladimir Putin and Russia's attempts to interfere in their  elections, and now they hear the United States has been victimized by  Putin, as well.   One of the scholars in Poland asked me what I thought was a very  clear question, and I can't answer. He said: If  [[Page S1652]]  the United States will not take the interference of Putin in your  election seriously, how can the people of Poland believe you will take  your NATO commitment to protect us from Putin seriously? Important  question. Valid question.   There are exceptions on the Republican side of the aisle, and I would  like to point out one of them. My friend, my colleague, and the  chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of Appropriations,  Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, made an extraordinarily forthright  statement yesterday about the need for an investigation into this  Russian interference. Thank goodness he is stepping away from party  loyalty and stepping up when it comes to defending this Nation. I  salute my Republican colleague for his leadership on this issue.   It is important to step back from the daily dysfunction we have when  it comes to the Russian investigation and the White House and lack of  governing and remember what is really at stake.   Five months ago, our intelligence services disclosed evidence that a  foreign adversary--one ruled by a dictatorial former Communist KGB  agent--was trying to help its preferred candidate in the U.S.  Presidential election. Think about that for a moment. An adversary of  the United States--a country which has imprisoned millions of Europeans  in the Communist system for almost half a century and which today rigs  elections and silences or murders members of the media and opposition-- committed what I believe is akin to a cyber act of war against America  in trying to elect someone they saw as more sympathetic to their  interests.   Since those early reports, we have been provided with damning  evidence by our intelligence agencies on the depth and sophistication  of this operation--so favorable to its nefarious goal that it had  Russian intelligence operatives boastfully celebrating after the  outcome of the election.   We also know that members of President Trump's campaign met with  those thought to be Russian intelligence; had suspiciously timed  communications with the Russian Government just after the Obama  administration placed sanctions on Russia; and in the case of top Trump  advisers Michael Flynn and Jeff Sessions, refused to disclose those  meetings, both in public and in one case to the Vice President and in  another case to the Senate Judiciary Committee.   No candidate would or at least should want help from a foreign  dictator to help win political office in the United States. So in a  situation like this, the response is obvious: Help in any way possible  to clear suspicions and concerns. Go forward and serve the American  people with an investigation. It seems so obvious.   Leon Panetta was on one of the Sunday morning talk shows. Leon  Panetta is a friend. I served with him in the House of Representatives.  He was the Chief of Staff to the President of the United States,  President Clinton. He served as Secretary of Defense. He headed up the  Central Intelligence Agency. He is an extraordinarily gifted and well- thought-of person who has a record of public service that is enviable.  He was asked about what the Trump White House should do about this  allegation of Russian interference in the election and the suggestion  that they might have been complicit.   He said: Get out in front.   The President of the United States should say: I have nothing to  hide, and we will fully cooperate with an independent commission to get  to the bottom of what happened in that election. But instead, what do  we have? Fanciful--in fact, patently false--tweets by the President,  alleging a wiretap by the former President. President Trump, if he has  nothing to hide, should help us clear this up once and for all.   To my Republican colleagues, so many patriots and champions of  American national security, it is time for more to join Senator Graham  and others to step up and speak out even on the floor of the Senate  about this situation.   Each one of us in the Senate swore to support and defend the  Constitution of the United States against enemies foreign and domestic.  Clearly, the Russian attack is a call for all of us--of both political  parties--to step up. This issue is not going to go away. We are going  to continue to pursue the truth.         Nomination of Seema Verma and the Republican Healthcare Bill    Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the recently  released Republican healthcare repeal bill and to speak on the  nomination of Seema Verma to serve as Administrator of the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services.   CMS is an agency touching the lives of 125 million people, and 34  percent of Americans receive their health insurance under one of the  three Federal programs run by that agency--Medicare, Medicaid, and the  Children's Health Insurance Program. These programs are vital to the  health and well-being of seniors, children, persons with disabilities,  and low-income families. Yet, with those vows to repeal the Affordable  Care Act, President Trump, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom  Price, and congressional Republicans are sadly attempting to gut the  Medicaid program and to jeopardize the future of Medicare.   The head of CMS should be someone who believes in these core programs  and is willing to fight to preserve them. Instead, Ms. Seema Verma's  record--as well as comments she made during her confirmation hearing-- indicates she is more than willing to take dramatic steps to force  people to lose their health insurance or dramatically increase out-of- pocket costs.   From her refusal to disavow efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act  to her willingness to cut the Medicaid Program, I do not believe Ms.  Verma is the right person for this job.   When it comes to the Affordable Care Act, our constituents-- Republicans, Democrats, Independents--are angry and frightened about  what the Trump administration and congressional Republicans might do to  healthcare. Based on what has finally been released, they have good  reason.   In over 2 months, Republican leaders in Washington have taken  numerous steps to change and even sabotage our healthcare system,  jeopardizing patient access to care and throwing the system into chaos.   Before President Trump took office, congressional Republicans rammed  through a budget bill, laying the groundwork for a quick, silent repeal  of the Affordable Care Act, despite the fact that they had no  replacement. Then, on his first day in office, the President signed an  Executive order to weaken the Affordable Care Act, instructing Federal  agencies to stop doing their job under the law. The President then  acted hastily to stop Federal outreach efforts--TV ads, radio spots,  and emails intended to encourage more Americans to sign up for health  insurance.   I watched yesterday as the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, said that  the Affordable Care Act is collapsing. Well, I can tell you, it needs  help and it should be bipartisan. Instead, the Republicans are doing  everything they can to jeopardize it.   Last week, the President met with big insurance companies to discuss  what they want for healthcare. But where were the patients, the  hospitals, the doctors, the nurses, the community health centers in  these conversations?   It is clear that congressional Republicans want to move full steam  ahead on repealing our healthcare law. The problem has always been and  still is that they can't agree on how to move forward. They don't have  a plan to protect people. Some Republicans just want to repeal. Others  want to repair. Others want to rebuild. They can throw out all the  ``R'' words they can find in the dictionary, but at the end of the day,  they don't know what they want to do. These disagreements are becoming  even more obvious in the last week.   For the past few months, House Republican leaders have been meeting  secretly to craft a repeal bill. Well, they finally unveiled it. No  wonder they wanted to keep it secret.   Incidentally, this bill, which has been authored by the Republicans-- a party that claims a commitment to fiscal soundness--has not been  scored by the Congressional Budget Office. We don't know, even as it is  being considered by committees in the House of Representatives, whether  it is going to add to the deficit or not. You would think that the  party of fiscal integrity--the Republican Party--would ask that  question early on. As yet, they have no answer, and they are proceeding  full steam ahead.  [[Page S1653]]    The bill, first, would end Medicaid as we know it, cutting $370  billion from the program and limiting care. Who are the beneficiaries  of Medicaid? The largest group of beneficiaries are kids and mothers.  The second most expensive group are seniors, many of them in nursing  homes who, without Medicaid and Medicare, could not even continue in a  good nursing home environment.   Keep in mind that one in five Americans currently depend on Medicaid  for their health insurance--65 million people nationwide. That includes  35 million children, 7 million seniors, 11 million people with  disabilities.   We used to say: Well, Medicaid is for poor people. Well, it certainly  is for lower income Americans, but many of them are working low-income  Americans who still qualify for Medicaid.   My friend, who has worked in the motel-hospitality industry all of  her life, in her sixties, sadly, is a part-time employee, despite her  hard work. She can't afford health insurance, but she qualifies for  Medicaid. She is part of the working poor, and she is one who needs  this benefit. If the Republicans have their way and reduce Medicaid  coverage, she could certainly lose it.   In my home State of Illinois, 650,000 people have gained healthcare  coverage under Medicaid, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. For her and  others I have met, it is the first time in their life that these men  and women--often in their sixties--for the first time in their life  have health insurance.   Of Illinois' 18 congressional districts, not a single one has less  than 71,000 Medicaid enrollees. Nearly half of all the kids in  Illinois, 1.5 million children, get their healthcare through Medicaid,  and the Republican repeal bill is going to endanger that.   That is so obvious that yesterday the Republican Governor of  Illinois, who was careful in his words and seldom reacts, came out  publicly and said that the Republican repeal bill would significantly  hurt our State of Illinois. That is from a Republican Governor.   Medicaid is the largest payer of long-term care for seniors in the  Nation and in Illinois. It is one of our best tools, incidentally, for  addressing the opioid epidemic, ensuring that those facing addiction  have access to treatment. And the Republicans want to cut that.   Medicaid has been a lifesaver to Illinois hospitals, especially in my  part of the State, downstate Illinois.   Repeal of the Medicaid expansion, as the House bill proposes, could  result in the loss of up to 90,000 jobs in Illinois.   The Republican repeal bill on healthcare is a jobs killer in Illinois  and across this Nation. We will see hospitals cutting back on personnel  in an attempt to adjust to the cutbacks in coverage and the increases  in cost brought on by the Republican repeal bill.    But the bill goes even further. It dramatically restructures the  entire Medicaid Program. When talking about the plan for Medicaid,  congressional Republicans throw around innocuous terms: per capita  caps, block grants, more flexibility, modernizing. Don't be lulled in a  false sense of security by these words. This Republican healthcare  repeal bill would significantly cut back on Federal spending on  Medicaid, shifting the cost to States, families, and individuals who  are currently struggling to get by today.   With less funding, States would be forced to throw people off of  Medicaid, limit the types of healthcare services offered, create  waiting lists, and much more. In the name of State flexibility and  modernizing, it would mean that more and more people would be showing  up in emergency rooms in Illinois and across the Nation with no health  insurance coverage under the Republican approach.   Oh, they will get care, and it will cost. They can't pay for it, and  that cost will be shifted to others with health insurance.   Unfortunately, Ms. Verma has significant experience in this exact  type of healthcare rationing. In her role as a private healthcare  consultant, she championed radical Medicaid overhauls. She supports  making low-income Medicaid beneficiaries pay more money. She believes  that Medicaid beneficiaries need ``more skin in the game.'' I wonder  how many Medicaid recipients Ms. Verma has actually sat down and met  with.   The Illinois folks whom I know are the mom working two jobs,  struggling to take time off from work to take her kid to the doctor, or  the senior who has literally spent down all of her life savings on  nursing home care and has no place else to turn.   Devising plans that restrict access to care for the most vulnerable  among us are not the qualifications I am looking for in the person who  wants to run the agency responsible for Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP.   Finally, on the House Republican repeal bill, in addition to gutting  Medicaid, the bill eliminates the Prevention and Public Health Fund,  which currently provides the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  $900 million, or 12 percent of their annual budget. The bill defunds  Planned Parenthood. The bill allows insurers to charge older people  significantly more in premiums than allowed under current law. The  bill, incidentally, dramatically cuts taxes for the wealthiest people  in America and increases costs for middle-income families. What is most  telling, as I mentioned earlier, is that the House Republicans won't  even send this bill or wait for a report from the Congressional Budget  Office before proceeding.   How many people will lose their health insurance under the Republican  repeal plan? How will out-of-pocket expenses go up for families under  the Republican repeal plan? How much responsibility and burden will be  shifted to the States under the Republican repeal plan?   For now, Republicans can claim ignorance because they have decided to  move forward before there was a report from the Congressional Budget  Office.   Thank goodness some Republicans are speaking out against this  terrible plan--maybe not for the same reasons I oppose it. But  conservatives say it doesn't rip health insurance away from more people  more quickly, and moderates worry about Medicaid--demonstrating, again,  the lack of a consensus on the Republican side when it comes to the  future of healthcare.   We have big challenges ahead--challenges that will determine whether  we have as many people in America with health insurance tomorrow as we  have today and how much it will cost.   I don't believe the Republican repeal bill is the right path forward,  and I don't believe Seema Verma is the right person to stand up and  fight for our Nation's seniors, children, and low-income families. For  that reason, I will be voting against her nomination to serve as  Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for  his excellent statement summarizing the challenge we face. I thank my  colleagues from Maryland and from Delaware as well.   Yesterday, we had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee. There is an  individual seeking the Deputy Attorney General spot. Of course, he is  seeking this position--a key position--at a critical moment in American  history.   The Attorney General of the United States of America, Jeff Sessions  of Alabama, announced publicly last week, on Thursday, that he was  going to recuse himself from any prosecution involving the Russians and  the last Presidential campaign. That is historic, and it was the right  thing to do. Many of us on the Democratic side have called on him for  weeks to do just that.   Senator Sessions had been an active participant in the Trump  campaign, and when he became Attorney General, we felt that, in the  best interests of preserving the integrity of the Department of  Justice, he had to step aside when it came to the investigation of  Russian involvement in that campaign.   Of course, in the meantime, during the course of this national  debate, the National Security Advisor to the President of the United  States, General Flynn, resigned after he misrepresented to the American  people and to the Vice President of the United States conversations he  had with the Russian Ambassador. It came to light last week that then- Senator Sessions, during the course of his confirmation hearing, gave  misleading comments and answers to a question by Senator Franken,  saying that he had had no contact with the Russians, either. In fact,  he had.   He sent a clarification letter, but yesterday's hearing was about his  successor, the Deputy Attorney General, who would have the power to  oversee this investigation. The gentleman who was nominated is well  known to the Senator from Maryland because he served as U.S. Attorney  there for a number of years--since 2005. He served under President  Obama. He was initially appointed under President Bush, a rare  bipartisan selection, who, by every indication, is a professional  prosecutor.   The disappointing moment at the hearing is when we asked Mr.  Rosenstein if he had read the intelligence report that was publicly  announced in January about the Russian involvement in our election  campaign. It is an unclassified report. It is on the internet. It is  about 15 pages long. It is as precise and conclusive as you can expect.  It said quite clearly that the Russians did attempt to change the  outcome of the election, that they were, in fact, working to benefit  Donald Trump and against Hillary Clinton.   I quickly added that this was not published by the Democratic  National Committee. This was by the intelligence agencies of the U.S.  Government. I was disappointed when Mr.  [[Page S1678]]  Rosenstein said no, he had not read it. He was asked over and over  again why he would not read a piece of information, a document so  critical to his service as Deputy Attorney General.   I will set that aside for a moment and just observe the obvious. If  you believe our intelligence agencies, there is no question that Russia  was trying to change the outcome of the Presidential election. They  were engaged, we believe, with up to a thousand trolls in some office  buildings in Moscow, invading the internet, invading emails in the  United States in an attempt to glean information that they could feed  back to the public through Wikileaks and other sources.   Although there is no evidence to date that they had any impact on the  actual casting or counting of ballots, their intent is clear. They  wanted to pick Donald Trump as President. They believed he was a better  choice for Russian interests than Hillary Clinton.   Is that worthy of an investigation? I certainly hope so. To our  knowledge, it is the first time in the history of the United States  that a foreign power--and one that has been an adversary time and again  to our interests around the world--tried to invade our election. It  was, in fact, a day that will live in cyber infamy in terms of this  Russian effort.   If we ignore it, we can expect several things. Get ready for the next  election. Do you think they learned anything during the course of the  last one? Do you think the Russians will be involved again? It would be  naive to believe otherwise.   Secondly, there is a critical element here that we cannot ignore.  Three weeks ago I visited Warsaw, Poland; Vilnius, Lithuania; and Kiev,  Ukraine. I talked to those leaders--in a couple of instances, the  Presidents of those countries, as well as opinion leaders,  parliamentarians--and they continued to raise the same question to me.  It came down to this: If the United States does not take seriously the  invasion of Russia in your own Presidential campaign, will you take it  seriously when Putin invades our country? You have told us under the  NATO alliance, article 5, that you will stand by our side and protect  us. If you don't take Putin seriously when he invades your own  Presidential election, there is a lot of doubt.   Questions are being asked. Several Republican Senators have stepped  up. I want to salute them. I will start with Lindsey Graham, who  yesterday, again before the Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittee on  Appropriations, made it clear that he believes we have to thoroughly  investigate this Russian involvement in our Presidential election.   A few others have said the same. Unfortunately, the reaction by many  Republican Senators has been lukewarm to cold. They don't want to spend  the time to look into this. They would rather start talking about  investigating leaks in the Trump administration or even the President's  far-fetched tweets suggesting that somehow President Obama was engaged  in a wiretap. It is something that has been denied not only by the  former President but also by the former Director of National  Intelligence and the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   To date, there is not one shred of evidence for the claim made by  President Trump in his tweets in the early morning hours of Saturday.  At the same time, the need for this investigation continues. You have  heard cataloged in detail--and I will not repeat it--Russian aggression  over the last several years.   I have seen it. I have seen it throughout history, at least during my  lifetime, and I have seen it more recently in Ukraine, in Georgia, and  threats that go on every single day in countries in the Baltics and  Poland. It is clear to them that they are fighting a hybrid war, not  just the military threat, which is very real, but also cyber threats  that at one point closed down the Estonian economy--a Russian cyber  invasion closed it down--and propaganda threats, which are nonstop  through cable television known as RT, Russia Today. They continue to  broadcast false information into countries like the Baltics and try to  do it with impunity. That is the reality of what we are facing.   The question we face, though, as the U.S. Senate sworn to uphold this  Constitution, is whether we are prepared to defend it against foreign  powers that will undermine it, in this case the Russian Federation.   There has been a suggestion that the intelligence committees can have  an investigation of this matter. I would say that in and of itself is  not objectionable, but it is certainly not complete and satisfactory.  The Intelligence Committee is going meet behind closed doors. We will  not see the witnesses. We will not hear their testimony. The American  people may not ever hear who testified and what they had to say.   Some parts of this must continue to be classified, and I understand  that. But by and large, the American people have a right to know what  the Russians did and how they did it so that we can make sure we defend  ourselves against this in the future. The Intelligence Committees have  a role, but not in its entirety.   I think there should be a special prosecutor from the Department of  Justice to see if any crimes have been committed. I don't know where  the evidence will lead, but we should have someone we trust, a person  of integrity, who will step up and assume that role and make that  investigation for the Department of Justice.   One other thing: I think this is of sufficient gravity that we should  have an independent, transparent, bipartisan commission. My colleague,  Senator Cardin of Maryland, is the sponsor of that legislation, which I  am happy to cosponsor. That is the ultimate answer.   Let's get to the bottom of this once and for all to make certain we  know what the Russians tried to do to us and to make doubly certain  that it never happens again. That is the reality of this challenge.   I hope we can get bipartisan support for it. When it comes to  sanctions against Russia, we have had good bipartisan support, and that  is encouraging--equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans saying they  should pay a price for what they did. Let's get the investigation to  its conclusion.   Leon Panetta is a friend of mine and served in our government at many  different levels. In the Sunday talk shows, he talked about what he  would recommend to the Trump administration. He said to them very  simply: Get in front of this. Don't keep reacting to this. Say that if  you have done nothing wrong you are going to cooperate fully with any  investigation to get to the bottom of it. That is the way to deal with  it.   I hope we will have an end to the tweets and a beginning of the  cooperation that is necessary so that we can get to the bottom of this  situation and know the facts, wherever they may lead us.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.
