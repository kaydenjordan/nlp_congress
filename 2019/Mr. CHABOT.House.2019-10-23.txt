 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 777, the  Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2019.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank our colleagues, Carolyn Maloney and  Debbie Lesko and others, for their leadership on this important  legislation to reauthorize the DNA Backlog Elimination grant program  for another 5 years.   Madam Speaker, there are over 400,000 victims of sexual assault in  this country each and every year. That equates to approximately one  sexual assault per minute.   Debbie Smith was one of those victims; and although she underwent  forensic examination, her kit went unanalyzed for over 5 years. The  purpose of this legislation is to ensure that no other victim ever has  to wait that long for justice again.   DNA analysis is an invaluable tool in identifying and convicting  criminal suspects. The increased use of DNA evidence in criminal  prosecutions has led to an increase in the collection and processing of  DNA kits, which has led to a substantial backlog in the processing of  DNA evidence, really, all across the country.                                time  1345    Fortunately, last year, after a 7-year effort, my home State of Ohio  was able to clear its backlog of nearly 14,000 of these kits, but many  other States haven't been so successful. In March, the GAO estimated  that the number of backlog requests for crime scene evidence nearly  doubled to nearly 170,000. Unfortunately, at the end of September, the  funding authorization for this program expired.   While the legislation offered by Congresswoman Maloney is an  important  [[Page H8408]]  step in the right direction, this body really should have already  considered the Senate-passed reauthorization so as to get it to the  President's desk.   Continued funding will ensure that law enforcement nationwide will  have the resources they need to process DNA evidence, prosecute, and  punish those who commit these heinous acts of violence.   Again, I thank Congresswoman Maloney and Congresswoman Lesko for  their leadership on this, and I urge its passage.
