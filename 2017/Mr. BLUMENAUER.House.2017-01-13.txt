 Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern). I was in the middle of hundreds of hours  of discussion and debate in committee, on the floor. It is amazing to  think of all the time and energy that went into it.   Was it a perfect bill? Absolutely not. It would have been much better  if the legislative process hadn't collapsed in the Senate and forced  reconciliation as the vehicle.   The offer to somehow become bipartisan and work together to solve the  problems ring hollow. I have been on the Ways and Means Committee for  the last 6 years when Republicans were in charge with constant efforts  to repeal ObamaCare, but they refused to work with us to fine-tune the  legislation when we could move forward and build on this foundation and  not be in a situation where we are going to unsettle healthcare  markets, leave people doubting about where they are, and having no clue  about what comes forward.   There is a reason, after 6 years, the Republicans do not have an  alternative to offer now. It is because their wildly contradictory  promises cannot be met.   I urge rejection of the rule and rejection of this effort to gut the  most important healthcare reform in the last 50 years.    Mr. Speaker, today, I will vote against S. 84, the  bill to exempt retired Marine Gen. James N. Mattis from the prohibition  on individuals who have spent less than seven years out of uniform for  appointment as Secretary of Defense. Even though he is qualified and  probably the best appointee we could expect from the Trump  administration, there is a reason for the law that requires a waiver.  This issue should have been addressed more directly.   Civilian control of the Armed Forces is a critical cornerstone of our  democracy. Regardless of the individual under consideration for such a  waiver, a major departure from longstanding law merits a full  conversation and discussion in Congress. I am concerned by reports that  the Trump presidential transition team prevented Gen. Mattis from  testifying before the House Armed Services Committee, though he was  willing.   It's unfortunate that both chambers did not have the opportunity to  hear from Gen. Mattis. I suspect that if the process were allowed to  work, he may well have received stronger bipartisan support for the  waiver.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 48, the previous question is ordered.   The question is on the third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be read a third time, and was read the third  time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote
