 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule.   I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for the inclusion of  language in the E&W report that would launch a new initiative at the  Department of Energy to aggressively drive down costs and improve the  performance of grid-scale energy storage technologies.   This report language is similar to the BEST Act, which I sponsored  and of which the ranking member is a cosponsor. The BEST Act is a  bipartisan authorization bill that directs the Secretary of Energy to  establish a moonshot goal of three demonstrations of grid-scale battery  storage that will meet aggressive commercialization targets for cost,  performance, and durability.   This concept is modeled after the success of the DOE's SunShot  Initiative, which brought down the cost of solar energy by 75 percent  in less than 5 years.   One of the biggest challenges to greater incorporation of new energy  sources into the power grid is the lack of cost-competitive grid-scale  solutions. Intermittent energy sources cannot reach their potential  without commercially viable storage facilities. We all know this.   Much of the energy we produce is lost, diminishing utility  productivity. While the DOE has issued grants to pursue better battery  storage, funding has been too dispersed to produce the breakthroughs  needed to transform our electricity grid. This initiative will leverage  work currently being done in the Office of Science to set a moonshot  goal for energy storage technology.   In a further sign of the merit of these demonstrations, the Senate  E&W bill also includes very similar report language.
