 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 600 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 600         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 849) to       repeal the provisions of the Patient Protection and       Affordable Care Act providing for the Independent Payment       Advisory Board. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. The amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means now       printed in the bill shall be considered as adopted. The bill,       as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided among and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce and the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Ways and Means; and (2) one motion to recommit       with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 600 provides for the  consideration of a bipartisan bill reported by the House Ways and Means  Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chairs and ranking members of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce and the Committee on Ways and Means.   The rule adopts the amendment in the nature of a substitute  recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means.   Further, the rule waives all points of order and makes in order no  further amendments to the legislation. However, the minority is  afforded the customary motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of millions of seniors in my home State of  Texas and all across the United States, I am grateful that the House is  considering H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of  2017.   This bill has been championed by my good friend from Tennessee, Dr.  Phil Roe, in this Congress and in previous  [[Page H8396]]  Congresses. It accomplishes a very simple task: To repeal the unpopular  Independent Payment Advisory Board created under the Affordable Care  Act.   This repeal has strong bipartisan support in both the Energy and  Commerce Committee, on which I serve, and in this entire body.   As of today, there are 270 Republican and Democratic cosponsors to  the bill who all agree that the creation of this board was a very bad  idea.   More than 800 organizations representing every State support this  bill. If I may add, this includes seniors, patient advocacy groups,  physician groups, and other healthcare provider organizations.   This board is charged with broad, sweeping powers to reduce Medicare  spending when Medicare spending exceeds an arbitrary target.   The board is a panel composed of 15 members appointed by the  President, confirmed by the Senate for up to two consecutive 6-year  terms. Fewer than half of the Independent Payment Advisory Board  members can be healthcare providers, and no one--and this is an  important point--on the board may receive outside income. So that means  by its very definition that this board is comprised of people who  cannot be practicing physicians.   The other members will come from the ranks of think tanks, unions,  and academia.   For a panel with so much authority over Medicare spending, there  could be little to no clinical expertise amongst the board members.   Is this what Americans really want?   Now, here is some good news. The board has yet to be formed. Hooray  for that. According to the 2017 Annual Report on the Boards of Medicare  Trustees from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Office of  the Actuary, the Independent Payment Advisory Board may not be formed  until at least 2021, based on the current Medicare spending rate  projections.   Well, that is good news to seniors and their doctors and their  families, but these projections are just numbers and they can change.  In fact, last year the projection was very different, that the  Independent Payment Advisory Board would be triggered this year rather  than the delay.   The concern of many of us here in the House and hundreds of  stakeholders I have heard from is that under the law, the Independent  Payment Advisory Board's proposals are required to be implemented by  the Secretary of Health and Human Services unless Congress acts by  creating its own proposal to achieve the exact same savings or by  preventing the automatic implementation process as defined by law.   So what is that process?         The law mandates immediate introduction of legislation       encompassing the Independent Payment Advisory Board proposed       bills in Congress--    Stop and think about that for a minute. That is not a bill introduced  by a Member of Congress. That is a bill introduced by an outside board.  That is a bill introduced by the administration. Let me recapitulate.         The law mandates immediate introduction of legislation       encompassing the Independent Payment Advisory Board proposed       bills in Congress and establishes strict deadlines for       committee and Senate floor consideration, and places limits       on the appropriations process.        While Congress is permitted to modify the type of cuts to       Medicare, it must achieve identical savings amounts to       Medicare spending as contained in the board's plan. The law       bars Congress from changing the Independent Payment Advisory       Board fiscal targets in any other legislation it considers,       and it creates procedures whereby a super majority vote is       required in the Senate to waive this requirement.        If the Independent Payment Advisory Board fails to report       recommendations or never becomes operational, the Secretary       of the Department of Health and Human Services is given the       power to implement the cuts unilaterally.    Well, you might think that, then, of course this would be under  judicial or administrative review, but the Independent Payment Advisory  Board is exempt from administrative or judicial review.   No matter what your views are on the Affordable Care Act, we should  all agree that giving this much power to a panel of unelected and  unaccountable officials or a Cabinet Secretary, whoever he or she may  be in any administration, giving away this much power is simply bad  policy. The House shouldn't be for that.                                time  1230    This process is extremely complicated, and maybe that was the intent  of the people who wrote the provision creating this board under the  Affordable Care Act.   I also fundamentally believe that the Independent Payment Advisory  Board infringes on the separation of powers by shifting authority from  the legislative to the executive branch. Not only does the creation of  this board significantly limit Congress' authority, it eliminates  needed transparency from hearings and debate. It eliminates any  meaningful opportunity for stakeholder input.   I believe leaving Medicare payment decisions in the hands of those  who are unelected and unaccountable, with little congressional  oversight, will actually harm seniors' access to quality healthcare.   Congress has played an integral role in shaping policies that best  reflect the needs of our districts and our States, and our constituents  demand that. That is the reason they sent us here.   Lastly, as a physician, I treasure the doctor-patient relationship. I  believe we must do more to honor this relationship and prevent the  Federal Government from further eroding this precious commodity.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), the chief sponsor of the bill.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn), who is also a physician.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I did want to delineate the membership of this board, as  is outlined in the Affordable Care Act. The board will be appointed by  the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, with the  advice and consent of the Secretary or the Administrator of the Centers  for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Administrator of the Health  Resources and Services Administration. All of those individuals will  serve as ex officio nonvoting members. But here are the qualifications  for the actual board:   ``The appointed membership of the board shall include individuals  with national recognition for their expertise in health finance and  economics, in actuarial science, health facility management, health  plans, and integrated delivery systems, and reimbursement of healthcare  facilities. . . .''   Missing from that picture, of course, are the people who actually  provide the care to people who are involved in that doctor-patient  relationship. Almost as an afterthought, here at the end of that  paragraph, ``allopathic and osteopathic physicians.''   The other aspect is that no member of the board can receive outside  income. That may be a good idea, but that guarantees there will not be  a practicing physician on that board. I think that is a significant  oversight.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I recall things a little differently. I recall the lie of the year  being, if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, but I guess  that is a debate for another day.   Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for consideration of an important  piece of legislation to protect seniors' access to healthcare from the  ill-advised Medicare Independent Payment Advisory Board created by the  Obama administration within the Affordable Care Act.   I thank the authors, Chairman Brady and Dr. Roe, and the 270 House  cosponsors of H.R. 849 for their thoughtful and bipartisan legislation,  and I urge my colleagues to support the rule providing for  consideration of this underlying bill, and then support the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 601 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 601         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3922) to       extend funding for certain public health programs, and for       other purposes. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. In lieu of the amendment in the nature       of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and       Commerce now printed in the bill, the amendment printed in       part A of the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution, modified by the amendment printed in part B       of that report, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 601 provides for the  consideration of a critical bill to provide health insurance and  healthcare to millions of underprivileged children. This package, which  includes two separate bills: H.R. 3922, the Community Health And  Medical Professional Improves Our Nation, CHAMPION, Act of 2017; and  H.R. 3921, the Healthy Kids Act. This was reported out of the Committee  on Energy and Commerce after lengthy deliberation and negotiation and a  lengthy markup.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and  controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce.   The rule adopts an amendment from the chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee, modified by a second amendment by the same author,  combining the two bills into the package on the floor today.   Further, the rule waives all points of order and makes in order no  further amendments to the legislation. However, the minority is  afforded the customary motion to recommit.   The congressionally appropriated stream of funding for the Children's  Health Insurance Program expired at the end of September. Funding for  other important public health programs, such as community health  centers, the National Health Service Corps, and Teaching Health Center  Graduate Medical Education, also expired at the end of September.   While every State that receives Federal funding through these  programs continues to have adequate dollars to maintain health  insurance for every enrolled child, several States are beginning to  exhaust their unspent 2017 funds and redistributed funds from the  Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. With November now upon us,  waiting any longer will only put more  [[Page H8403]]  pressure on those States to begin sending notifications to children and  families that they are losing their coverage for those programs; so it  is important that we reauthorize funding for the Children's Health  Insurance Program and other programs now.   H.R. 3922, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act, will achieve that  important task. It is essential to our efforts to ensuring that these  programs continue to meet the healthcare needs of children and families  who have come to rely upon them.   Today, more than 8 million low-income children across our country  depend on the Children's Health Insurance Program for many of their  healthcare services. These include routine doctor visits,  immunizations, prescription medicines, and dental care. Through  flexible, capped allotments to the States, the program has been able to  successfully support these children, while providing States with  opportunities to tailor their respective programs as best meet the  needs of their respective populations.   The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act would extend CHIP for another 5  years, which is the longest extension since its inception in 1996. An  extension through fiscal year 2022 will provide financial stability for  every State's CHIP program and certainty for those children and their  families who are covered. Additionally, ensuring coverage for CHIP- eligible children will make them less likely to have to enroll in  Medicaid or ObamaCare.   This bill also contains and maintains a provision under the  Affordable Care Act that provided 23 percent increased matching for 2  years; then that draws down to an increase of 11.5 percent matching in  the third year; and then, finally, provides funding at pre-ACA levels  for the final 2 years.   These funding levels will provide the States enough time to plan  their budgets before returning to the regular CHIP matching rates,  thereby restoring the fiscally responsible Federal-State Medicaid  partnership.   While reauthorizing CHIP funding is the primary focal point of this  legislation, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act also includes other  important provisions relating to our Nation's healthcare. The bill  provides a 2-year extension of funding for Federally Qualified Health  Centers, community health centers.   One in thirteen individuals nationwide relies upon a community health  center to receive healthcare services. The Community Health Center Fund  plays an important role in supplementing the services that Federally  Qualified Health Centers are able to deliver to underserved communities  by providing care to all Americans, regardless of income or ability to  pay.   Funding for the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education  program is also extended for another 2 years.   The legislation includes a 2-year extension of other important health  programs, including funding for the National Health Service Corps,  Family-to-Family Health Information Centers, the Youth Empowerment  Program, the Personal Responsibility Education Program, the Special  Diabetes Program for Type 1 Diabetes, and the Special Diabetes Program  for American Indians.   In addition to the important funding streams addressed in this bill,  the Committee on Energy and Commerce incorporated a way to help our  Nation's territories in a time of need following recent natural  disasters. The bill includes more than $1 billion for the Medicaid  programs in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This funding  should assist our territories in providing care for their populations  who have faced substantial devastation from Hurricanes Irma and Maria.   The Medicare funding issue is unique to Puerto Rico and the United  States citizens living in the territories. This was a problem that  predated the hurricanes, but it was exacerbated by the devastation that  the storm brought to the islands. Without a legislative fix from  Congress, this will be an ongoing and festering problem until it is  properly addressed, and the bill before us today begins to do just  that.                                time  1300    Additionally, the bill delays the $5 billion in cuts to many of the  hospitals across the country from the Affordable Care Act-mandated  Medicaid disproportionate share hospital reductions for fiscal years  2018 and 2019. I am sure that many of my colleagues have heard from  hospitals in their districts whose ability to remain operational and to  continue to provide care could be jeopardized by these payment cuts.   These cuts are offset in future years, adding an additional $6  billion in reductions in fiscal year 2021, 2022, and 2023. This delays  but does not fix a problem that ObamaCare created for safety net  hospitals. It is one which we will have to revisit, but it delays the  cuts that have already been affected by current law and protects these  safety net hospitals which provide care to the neediest citizens in our  country.   Not only does the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act reauthorize funding  for essential health programs, the bill is fully offset. It will not  add to the national debt. The Committee for a Responsible Federal  Budget called this a ``responsible health package,'' noting that the  $18 billion cost of the bill is fully offset with savings beyond the  10-year budget window.   One of the ways that costs are offset was to alter the qualified  health plan grace period so that it would align with State law grace  period requirements. This involved changing, in the Affordable Care  Act, the grace period for subsidized individuals from 90 days to 30  days unless a State specifically allows otherwise.   It also redirected $6.4 million from the Prevention and Public Health  Fund to help pay for the legislation. This fund is required by law to  receive $2.5 billion in annual appropriations which must be used for  prevention, wellness, and public health initiatives administered by the  Department of Health and Human Services. If Congress--let me say it  again--if Congress does not direct these funds toward specific efforts,  the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to spend  the funds however he or she deems fit.   While we are redirecting these taxpayer dollars, the overarching  purpose of the funding is still to improve the health and wellness of  Americans through existing mechanisms, and community health centers  will do just that.   We allow for certain wealthy Medicare beneficiaries with individual  incomes of over $500,000 to pay increased premiums in order to offset  some of the cost of authorizing these programs. These beneficiaries  will be subject to higher premiums, thereby increasing their overall  cost, but still their cost will be lower than if they purchased  insurance on the exchange.   The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act is a fiscally responsible way to  fund some of our Nation's most important public health programs. The  bill would ensure continued access to care for children and individuals  who rely on the programs for vital healthcare services.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. Mr. Speaker, these offsets are  reasonable. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support  today's rule and support the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds in response  before yielding to the chairman of the Rules Committee.   It pains me to hear people talk about the 33-day delay in getting  SCHIP funding resubmitted. I just want to assure the House of  Representatives that Republicans on the Subcommittee of Health in the  Energy and Commerce Committee have been ready to go with this  legislation. We did our legislative hearings early in the summer, as  the gentleman will recall because he was there, and we were ready for  our markup in the month of September.   Why was it delayed? Let me reference an article from CQ News, October  23, 2017: ``Democrats do not want a children's health insurance bill to  come to the floor this week for a vote, said Frank Pallone, Jr.,  ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee at a district  event. . . .''   `` `The idea is to not have the bill come to the floor this week,'  said Pallone. . . .''   I include in the Record a copy of the CQ News article.                       [From CQ News, Oct. 23, 2017]            House Democrats Push To Delay Children's Health Vote                             (By Sandhya Raman)         Democrats do not want a children's health insurance program       bill to come to the floor this week for a vote, said Frank       Pallone Jr., ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce       Committee at a district event broadcast on Facebook Live on       Monday.        ``The idea is to not have the bill come to the floor this       week,'' said Pallone, emphasizing that Democrats still want       to find a bipartisan compromise and will not accept the       changes to Medicare or Medicaid that Republicans want to use       to fund the coverage. He later added, ``This is supposed to       come up Thursday. Hopefully, it won't.''        Pallone suggested that the process could be lengthy if the       House passes a partisan bill and the Senate does not act       quickly to pass their bipartisan measure. The two likely       would have to be reconciled through conference negotiations.        ``We're going to just delay this for months, and the end       result could be we don't deal with this until the end of the       year,'' said Pallone, speaking at a community health center.        Democrats disagree with the offsets in House bills to       reauthorize CHIP (HR 3921) and community health centers and       other safety net programs (HR 3922). The CHIP bill's offsets       include increasing premiums for Medicare recipients with       income over $500,000 a year and limiting Medicaid benefits       for lottery winners. In addition, Democrats take issue with       an offset that would bill other insurance before Medicaid for       recipients who use more than one form of coverage.        The offsets for the community health centers include       changes to undermine the 2010 health care law (PL 111-148, PL       111-152) including cutting almost $6.4 billion from the       Prevention and Public Health Fund over 10 years. Republicans       also would allow states to create their own grace periods for       individuals on the exchanges to pay their premiums or use a       default one-month grace period. The current grace period is       three months.        ``If you miss it and you don't pay it, you can't get your       insurance. You've got to re-enroll for the next year,''       Pallone said about the grace period.        ``The problem is that they haven't been willing to give       much on taking this money from the Affordable Care Act or       Medicare, but why do they even have to come out of health       care at all? Why can't we use another vehicle to pay for       it?'' said Pallone, adding, ``Part of that could be cut back       significantly.''        Democrats also object to the way Puerto Rico's Medicaid       funding in the CHIP bill would be addressed.        ``They're still requiring a state match from Puerto Rico,''       said Pallone. ``The bill funds a little bit, but it's totally       worthless if Puerto Rico has to come up with the match.''        The island does not have money to contribute, Democrats       say.        Earlier this month, Committee Chairman Greg Walden of       Oregon asked his Democratic colleagues to suggest offsets       that may be more amenable than those currently in the bill       that the committee passed. Last week, Walden said in a       statement that he had not received any Democratic offers.        Democrats contend they have put suggestions on the table.        One idea would require drug companies to help seniors       better afford their prescriptions by closing a funding gap,       known as the ``doughnut hole,'' in Medicare coverage.       Currently, seniors have to pick up more costs after a certain       spending threshold until they hit another limit when Medicare       resumes paying for coverage.        ``We've been making offers back. One of the things we said       is make the drug companies pay for the doughnut hole. We       still have a doughnut hole for Medicare Part D. So if they       pay for the cost of that, that could be used as a payfor,''       said Pallone.        ``This bill that may go to the floor next week is going       nowhere,'' said Pallone, stating that it would ``be a totally       partisan vote.''        Federal funding for CHIP expired Sept. 30. The Centers for       Medicare and Medicaid Services has redistributed unused CHIP       funds to nine states and territories including Arizona,       California, Minnesota, Washington, American Samoa, Guam,       Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands and Oregon. The       funds come from unused CHIP allotments from previous years       and are used to help states that are running low on their       current year funds.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Sessions).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds for the purpose  of a response before I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, if we are going to tell stories, then ``once upon a  time'' should be part of our opening.   This bill merely takes some of the discretion for the Prevention and  Public Health Fund away from the administration and returns it to  Congress where it is supposed to be in the first place, so we take  discretion over some of the Prevention and Public Health Fund dollars  away from the executive branch and redirect these dollars to proven  public health programs that enjoy broad, bipartisan support in Congress  like the community health centers. Every Democrat voted for the Cures  for the 21st Century, and it did exactly the same thing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne), who is a fellow member of the House  Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   First off, the gentleman may not remember that we had a legislative  hearing in June on this very bill. It was delayed from June 14. The  gentleman may recall there was an unfortunate circumstance of a  shooting at a congressional baseball practice. In fact, a member of our  committee, Majority Whip Steve Scalise, was in surgery, and most felt  we couldn't go through with the hearing that day, but we had it 2 weeks  later as soon as we could get the hearing time. So it was done well in  advance of the expiration of the funding.    Furthermore, as far as the substitute goes, the minority is afforded  the customary motion to recommit. I look forward to the gentleman  introducing a substitute at that time.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Tennessee  (Mrs. Blackburn).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Tennessee.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I want to address the issue of the Prevention and  Public Health Fund.   The bill before us does redirect $8.9 billion for the Prevention and  Public Health Fund to support critically important public health  programs that expand access to care and improve health outcomes.   The Prevention Fund was established in the Affordable Care Act as  mandatory funding for prevention and public health programs to improve  health and help restrain the rate of growth in private and public  sector healthcare costs.   According to statute, billions of dollars in advanced appropriations  are to be used for the broad purpose of supporting programs authorized  by the Public Health Service Act for prevention, wellness, and public  health activities. However, prevention, wellness, and public health  activities are allowable, but no Prevention Fund-specific or generally  applicable definitions of these terms are to be found in the Public  Health Service Act, the Affordable Care Act, or anywhere else in  Federal law.   The Affordable Care Act was not accompanied by committee reports in  either Chamber. The Department of Health and Human Services has not  published regulations, guidance, or other information to clarify the  Department's views about the types of activities that are within the  scope of the Prevention Fund.                                time  1345    Annual mandatory appropriations, the Prevention Fund, continue in  perpetuity. If Congress does not explicitly allocate the funding, then  the Secretary of HHS has the authority to spend these dollars without  congressional oversight.   This bill takes discretion over some of the--some, not all--some of  the Prevention Fund dollars. It takes it away from the executive branch  and redirects these dollars to proven public health programs that enjoy  broad bipartisan support in Congress like community health centers, a  program that employs 190,000 people and served over 24 million patients  in 2015.   This has been supported in the past in other legislation, most  recently in the Cures initiative, where Democrats and Republicans  supported the redirecting of funding for the Prevention Fund for the  specific purpose of preserving public health.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I do want to address one of the things that has come up in the  discussion, and that is the issue of the language in the underlying  bill that supports the citizens, the American citizens in Puerto Rico.   There was a problem in Puerto Rico with their Medicare system, the  way people were not automatically enrolled as they were in every other  State and territory. There was a problem under the Affordable Care Act  where they faced a Medicaid funding cliff.    These problems existed prior to the two hurricanes that hit the  island, and a request was made to Chairman Walden and me, on behalf of  the people of Puerto Rico, to fix these problems prior to the storms  coming ashore, and that is what we fixed in the language of this bill.   I might remind this body that, when Hurricane Katrina came ashore  around Labor Day of 2005, a similar problem was encountered.  Ultimately, the State's share of that FMAP payment was made. It was  made with funds from the Deficit Reduction Act, which were allocated on  September 30, 2006, over a year later.   The fact is that there are going to be funds available to Puerto Rico  to help offset their part, their match of their State's share of the  Federal match, but it will likely come through the money that is  appropriated for disaster relief. But we are fixing their underlying  problem that existed before the hurricanes. If we don't fix it, it  continues to be a problem year in and year out, and the American  citizens of Puerto Rico are poorly served by that.   So this body is taking that up today, and I am proud of the fact that  our subcommittee and our full committee recognize that and provided  that relief.   Madam Speaker, I want to enter into the Record a letter from Texas  Health Resources, Mr. Barclay Berdan. I want to quote from this letter:  ``We . . . appreciate your leadership on delaying cuts to Medicaid DSH,  which took effect on October 1, 2017.''   ``Thankfully, H.R. 3922 would eliminate the scheduled Medicaid DSH  reductions in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, thus allowing a critical  source of funding to continue for safety net hospitals.''                                         Texas Health Resources,                                                   November 1, 2017.      Hon. Michael Burgess,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Burgess: As one of the nation's largest       faith-based, nonprofit health care systems, Texas Health       Resources (Texas Health) provides more than 350 points of       access throughout North Texas, including 29 hospitals (acute-      care, short-stay, behavioral health, rehabilitation and       transitional care) and more than 100 outpatient facilities,       satellite emergency rooms, surgery centers, behavioral health       facilities, fitness centers and imaging centers. The system       also includes a large physician group, home health,       preventive and well-being services as well as more than 250       clinics and physician offices to provide the full continuum       of care for all stages of life. I am writing to thank you for       your leadership on the Championing Healthy Kids Act of 2017       (H.R. 3922) to extend funding for the Children's Health       Insurance Program (CHIP). We strongly support a five-year       extension of CHIP funding, along with the elimination of       reductions in fiscal years (FY) 2018 and 2019 to the Medicaid       disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments.        Texas Health has supported CHIP since its inception, and       the program currently covers 8.9 million children with family       incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits who lack access to       affordable private coverage. The nation's uninsured rate for       children is a record low of 5 percent due in part to Medicaid       and CHIP coverage. While CHIP is authorized by Congress to       operate until October 1, 2019, legislative action is needed       to continue funding beyond FY 2017. Failure to extend CHIP       funding could result in coverage losses for millions of       children and increased financial pressure for states that may       lead to reductions in eligibility and benefits This       legislation safeguards the program by providing for a five-      year extension of funding.        We also certainly appreciate your leadership on delaying       cuts to Medicaid DSH, which took effect on October 1, 2017.       As you know, Medicaid DSH payments support Texas Health's       hospitals in serving north Texas' most vulnerable       individuals--the poor, the elderly, and the disabled.       Congress reduced Medicaid DSH payments in the Affordable Care       Act, reasoning that hospitals would care for fewer uninsured       patients as health coverage expanded. However, the projected       increase in coverage has not been fully realized, and       Congress subsequently delayed the start of the cuts that were       scheduled to begin in FY 2014. As a result, Texas hospitals       will sustain a $148 million cut in vital payments in federal       fiscal year 2018. The cumulative loss for Texas hospitals for       2018 through 2024 is $3.2 billion. Thankfully, H.R. 3922       would eliminate the scheduled Medicaid DSH reductions in       Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019, thus allowing a critical source       of funding to continue for safety net hospitals.        Thank you for your steadfast leadership on addressing these       important programs by supporting H.R. 3922. As Congress moves       forward on these important issues, we appreciate your       continued willingness to work with us to extend funding for       CHIP, eliminate reductions to Medicaid DSH payments, and       safeguard programs critical to hospitals. If we can provide       you or your staff with additional information, please do not       hesitate to contact.            Sincerely,                                                 Barclay Berdan,                                     FACHE, Chief Executive Officer,                                            Texas Health Resources.     Madam Speaker, I also have a letter from the Children's  Hospital Association, which renews the call for bipartisan CHIP  extension: ``Children's hospitals thank Congress for its long-term  bipartisan commitment to CHIP and for the children it serves. We look  forward to working with lawmakers to maintain a strong CHIP program and  strengthen healthcare for children in the future.''       Children's Hospitals Renew Call for Bipartisan CHIP Extension         Children's hospitals urge Congress to protect children and       families by passing a bipartisan five-year extension of the       Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as soon as       possible.        We are pleased that members of the House Energy and       Commerce Committee have developed bipartisan CHIP policies       that reflect the needs of children, including a five-year       extension of the program that provides for robust CHIP       funding, and continue important beneficiary protections such       as the Maintenance of Effort provision, funding for  [[Page H8410]]       the Pediatric Quality Measures Program, express lane       eligibility, and outreach and enrollment grants. These       policies are also included in the bipartisan Senate proposal       on CHIP, and we thank the committees of jurisdiction in both       chambers for including these crucial policies.        If CHIP funding is not extended soon, CHIP-enrolled       children may become underinsured or uninsured altogether.       CHIP is an important bipartisan health coverage program for       over 6 million low-income children. CHIP builds off of a       strong Medicaid program by providing age-appropriate and       affordable coverage for children who fall above Medicaid       eligibility levels, but lack access to other health coverage       options.        Concerning reports indicate that states are taking steps to       limit programs in order to address the looming funding       shortfall, despite receiving federal redistribution funds. We       urge Congress to act now and avoid potentially disastrous       consequences caused by further delay by enacting a strong,       bipartisan five-year extension of CHIP.        Children's hospitals thank Congress for its long-term       bipartisan commitment to CHIP and the children it serves. We       look forward to working with lawmakers to maintain a strong       CHIP program and strengthen health care for children into the       future.     Finally, Madam Speaker, I will tell you I am perplexed.  I, frankly, do not understand why there is reticence to providing an  offset for funding of children's health insurance by income relating to  part B premiums for people who earn over $500,000 a year, seniors who  earn over $500,000 a year, or a couple who earns over $875,000 a year.  This was language that was included in President Obama's budget, so  don't tell me it is not bipartisan, because it was bipartisan.   Now, Madam Speaker, today's rule provides for the consideration of an  important piece of legislation to maintain the important funding  streams for millions of underprivileged children depending on the  program.   I want to thank Chairman Walden for his efforts to continually work  with the minority on the Energy and Commerce Committee, repeatedly  providing the requested extensions by the ranking member in order to  continue discussions on the legislation.   The package reflects hours of work to create legislation that will  benefit millions of America's children so that they can lead healthier  lives. I urge my colleagues to support today's rule and the underlying  legislation, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 601 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        Sec. 2. It shall not be in order to consider a       comprehensive tax reform measure or matter reported pursuant       to Sections 2001 or 2002 of House Concurrent Resolution 71 in       the House or in the Committee of the Whole House on the state       of the Union unless easily searchable electronic estimates       and comparisons prepared by the Director of the Congressional       Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation have been made       available on a publicly available website of the House 48       hours in advance.        (b) It shall not be in order to consider a comprehensive       tax reform measure or matter reported pursuant to Sections       2001 or 2002 of House Concurrent Resolution 7l in the House       or in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the       Union, that is called up pursuant to a rule or order that       makes an amendment in order or considers such an amendment to       be adopted, unless easily searchable updated electronic       estimates and comparisons prepared by the Director of the       Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation       reflecting such amendment have been made available on a       publicly available website of the House 48 hours in advance.        (c) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order       that waives the application of paragraph (a) or paragraph       (b). As disposition of any point of order under paragraphs       (a) and (b), the Chair shall put the question of       consideration with respect to the measure, matter, or rule as       applicable. The question of consideration shall be debatable       for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point of order       and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but shall otherwise be       decided without intervening motion except one that the House       adjourn.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
