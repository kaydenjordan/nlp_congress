 Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to  the remarkable life of Retired BG Charles E. Fleming, a 35-year veteran  of the Illinois Army National Guard who passed away on September 8,  2021.   General Fleming was a graduate of the University of Illinois, Western  Illinois University, and the U.S. Army War College.

He assumed duties as assistant adjutant  general in September of 2001 and was responsible for the preparation  and deployment of Illinois Army National Guard units in support of  Operations Santa Fe and Enduring Freedom immediately following the  September 11, 2001, terrorists' attacks, and the beginning stages of  the National Guard's transition from a strategic reserve to an  operational force.   General Fleming served as principal assistant to the adjutant general  in all matters pertaining to supervision and management of the Illinois  Department of Military Affairs and the Illinois Army National Guard.  Throughout his military career, he achieved many awards and decorations  including; the Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal,  National Defense Service Medal, the Humanitarian Service Medal, and the  Army Service Ribbon.
