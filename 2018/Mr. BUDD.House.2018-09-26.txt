 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for  yielding. I also want to thank Chairman Hensarling for his dedicated  leadership of his committee. I appreciate all he did to bring my  legislation, H.R. 5036, to the floor. I also want to thank the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), my co-lead on the bill, for  his efforts, his experience, and his knowledge. It only made the bill  better, so I appreciated working with him.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bipartisan  legislation, the Financial Technology Protection Act.   We all know that illicit financing networks are the lynchpin of any  terrorist group's, criminal organization's, or rogue state's  operations. As we move into an increasingly digital world, criminals  and terrorists will start to use these new technologies that are  available to them. That presents a problem.   That problem is that we know that criminals use digital currencies  through dark net markets to criminalize and to monetize cyber attacks.  There is documented evidence that terrorists are increasingly using  these currencies.                                time  1800    The RAND Corporation has some good supporting evidence on this. The  bottom line is that the Federal Government has to be one step ahead of  the illicit actors in this new space without threatening technological  innovation, and that is what H.R. 5036 will do.   Specifically, my legislation will do the following things to help  make sure the United States stays ahead of this problem: First, it  establishes the Independent Financial Technology Task Force to Combat  Terrorism and Illicit Financing, whose goal is to improve coordination  between private and public sectors on digital currency terror strategy  and to combat illicit use. From my perspective, industry and the  Federal Government should be coming together to find best practices and  solutions to stop this new terrorist funding threat.   Secondly, H.R. 5036 includes language from H.R. 5227, the Preventing  Rogue and Foreign Actors From Evading Sanctions Act, which was  introduced by my friend Mark Meadows of North Carolina. This language  directs the Treasury Department to develop a strategy that identifies  and describes the potential uses of virtual currencies and other  emerging technologies by states, nonstate actors, and terrorist  organizations to evade sanctions, finance terrorism, or launder  monetary instruments and threaten the United States' national security.   Again, the development of a national strategy to combat illicit use  strikes me as common sense; therefore, we are  [[Page H9062]]  excited to have it included in the bill and to have Mr. Meadows'  support as well.   Also, the Budd-Lynch legislation establishes a targeted rewards  program for information leading to the capture of terrorists or illicit  actors involved with terror digital currency networks. The government  should be encouraging individuals with knowledge of illicit use of  virtual currencies to come forward through the offerings of rewards for  successful convictions.   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, H.R. 5036 establishes the  Fintech Leadership in Innovation and Financial Intelligence Program,  which will be used for grants and rewards in the Fintech space for  ideas and programs to combat terrorist use of digital currencies.   These technologies would be open access and open source. Experts in  the private sector can track illicit use of these currencies and  perhaps do a better job of leveraging their talent to create tools and  programs through the Fintech Leadership and Financial Intelligence  Program. We need to give them the ability to try, and that is what this  bill does.   Here is the bottom line, Mr. Speaker. H.R. 5036 is legislation that  sparks private-sector innovation to deal with terror and illicit  financing when it comes to virtual currencies. I think that Congress  should be promoting programs and technologies that give industry the  tools they need to save their technology and industry from illicit use  and, hopefully, save them from further regulation down the road.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill.
