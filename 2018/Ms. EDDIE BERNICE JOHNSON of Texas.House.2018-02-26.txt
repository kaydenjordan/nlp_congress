 Mr. Speaker, there are no words  in the English language to fully capture the pain and suffering that a  parent will endure in the face of losing a child. Imagine then the  immense pain that the families of the 17 Americans who were murdered  during a mass shooting at the Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland,  Florida must be experiencing at this moment. Even worse, imagine how  they must feel as our nation remains crippled by inaction in the wake  of the senseless gun violence that continues to tear apart countless  families and communities throughout our country. That is our reality  today as Congress fails to act, once again, on commonsense legislation  to reduce gun violence.   We cannot allow the violence that we have witnessed at the Stoneman  Douglas High School to become our new norm. More importantly, we cannot  allow our inaction in the face of such tragic violence to also define  what we can and cannot accept as a society. We are all too familiar  with gun violence in the United States. There have already been over  8,200 incidents of gun violence in 2018 alone. This violence has  claimed the lives of 2,200 individuals, upending the lives of countless  friends and families who are impacted by these deaths. I am here to  join my colleagues and countless Americans across our nation by  declaring in one voice, ``Enough is enough.''   Our children deserve the right to an education without a cloud of  fear in their hearts  [[Page H1257]]  and the sound of gunshots ringing in their ears. The people of the  United States deserve representation that works in the face of  senseless violence to deliver real solutions that work for millions of  Americans. We need solutions that include stronger background checks,  while also providing the resources for states to contribute complete  and timely records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check  System (NICS). We need solutions that reduce the proliferation of  assault weapons on our streets, including high-capacity magazines,  flash suppressors, and other accessories that enhance the lethality of  firearms. More importantly, we need everyone to come to the table in a  meaningful way that is not driven by fear or emotion so that we can  deliver on the promises that we made when we took the oath of office.   Mr. Speaker, I am calling for action. I am calling for action that is  already long overdue, and I call for others to find the compassion in  their hearts to also get this done. I call for the courage to make the  difficult choices that we finally need to make. Our failure to act now  is a failure of our leaders to do what is right, notwithstanding  political affiliation or preference. I am calling for action and I am  calling for action now. Enough is enough.                            ____________________
