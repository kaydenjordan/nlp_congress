 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for yielding.   Madam Speaker, diabetes does not care if you are a Republican or a  Democrat. This disease is an absolute torrential disease inside working  families across our country. This bill has been mischaracterized by the  other side. This would lead to a $35 cost for Americans, for  Minnesotans, for part D Medicare beneficiaries and commercial plan  beneficiaries.   For the vast majority of working families, the price of insulin is  simply unsustainable. Many Americans are forced to risk their own lives  by rationing doses or skipping treatments entirely. Today, we have an  opportunity to save American families thousands of their hard-earned  dollars.   Madam Speaker, my bill, the Affordable Insulin Now Act, would cap it  at $35 a month. Certainly, our work to lower drug costs and expand  access to healthcare across this Nation is not done. But this is a  major step forward in the right direction and a chance to make good on  our promises to the American people.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
