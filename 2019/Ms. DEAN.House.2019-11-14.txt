 Mr. Speaker, this week the Supreme Court heard oral  arguments surrounding DACA. Now 800,000 lives hang in the balance.   Mr. Speaker, 800,000 is a big number, and in the face of abstract  figures it is easy to lose touch with the human reality.   So let's think of, maybe, just one person, one young woman who has  lived virtually her entire life in this country; whose friends, family,  and community are here; who attends school and plays on the soccer team  and volunteers at a food bank; who speaks English and no other  language.   Which one of us would take that child to the border and send her  across alone?   Which one of us would banish her to a place she has never been?   Which one of us would force her to build a life and a language she  does not even know?   Which one of us could abandon that child with a clear conscience?   I suspect the answer is very few of us. And, if that is right, if in  our hearts we would not permit us to behave with such coldness and  cruelty, then we cannot allow our government to do so either.   As our dear colleague Mr. Cummings said, we are better than this.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman Waters and Representative  Heck for this important legislation.   I am excited to stand here in support of the Export-Import Bank. It  is critically important to my home State of Pennsylvania and, in  particular, my home district of Montgomery County and Berks County.   With over 200 total exporters in Pennsylvania, which have contributed  over $4 billion in total export value from 2014 to 2019, the Export- Import Bank has helped businesses across the Commonwealth gain access  to new markets, create jobs, and compete globally.   That is why I am pleased to be among the original cosponsors and  supporters of H.R. 4863, the United States Export Finance Agency Act,  which reauthorizes the Bank for 10 years and makes critical reforms to  help businesses across our Nation.   In particular, this reauthorization bill increases the Bank's lending  authority to $175 billion, includes a quorum fix, and enhances the  Bank's environmental practices. Importantly, it also establishes an  Office of Minority and Women Inclusion and an Office of Territorial  Exporting, two important provisions that will help diversify the Bank's  activities and our global activities.   Finally, the bill has key endorsements, as the chairwoman has so  eloquently listed, from various industry stakeholders, including labor  and the business community.   Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman Waters and Representative Heck for  introducing this reauthorization bill, and I urge adoption of the bill.
