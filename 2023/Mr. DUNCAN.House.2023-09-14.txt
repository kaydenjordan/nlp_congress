 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of  the Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act.   Electric vehicles will be part of our energy matrix for a long time,  our transportation matrix. No Republicans deny that, but government is  trying to pick what you drive, America.   Our electric grid does not support electric vehicles now. Power  generation isn't there, and the infrastructure is far from ready across  most of America.   Stripping away Americans' freedom to choose, government picking the  type of car that you have to drive, that is like saying: I am from the  government, and I am here to help. I know better than you do, America.   That is wrong. Americans ought to have the freedom to choose. If  electric vehicles are going to be part of our mix in rural South  Carolina, we have a long way to go to build out that infrastructure. I  can tell you that Wyoming, Nebraska, Montana, and Washington State are  a long way from ready.   Most of the pollution California talks about is not generated in  California. It is coming from Asia. China is building all the  infrastructure, all the solar panels, a lot of components for electric  vehicles. They are using coal-fired power plants to produce those  renewable components, creating pollution that ends up on the West  Coast.   This is wrong for America. Government should not tell people in South  Carolina or Washington State or anywhere else what kind of vehicle to  drive.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  do so.
