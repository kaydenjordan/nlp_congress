 Madam Speaker, while climate catastrophists claim that  our climate is less livable than ever because of fossil fuels, it is  actually more livable than ever, thanks to our fossil fuel powered  climate protection systems.   When you hear the scary claims about a climate crisis, keep in mind  that climate catastrophists, or alarmists as they are now known, have  been claiming climate crisis for about 40 years.   If America tries to rapidly eliminate fossil fuel use through a Green  New Deal or Biden climate plan, we will not prevent a crisis. We will  cause a crisis by making energy completely unreliable and unaffordable  for American industry and American consumers, especially the middle- income and lower income folks.   Now, what isn't pointed out very often in all this talk about carbon  dioxide being a pollutant is that carbon dioxide is 0.04 percent of our  atmosphere. Most people think it is some big number like 20, 30, 40, 50  percent of our atmosphere. Nitrogen, number one, is 78 percent; oxygen,  number two, 21 percent. CO2 is not even in third place.  Argon is, 0.93 of 1 percent.   Some of these pie charts you would look at on the internet would have  carbon dioxide mixed in with other trace gases--other, okay?   So, we are at 0.04 percent. It is an extremely small amount of our  atmosphere. Now, you would think, again, with the alarmism going on,  that it is a high percentage that is poisoning all of us. Carbon is a  building block of most of what we have on this planet, carbon life  forms, right?   We are chasing down this path, I think, because of an agenda that is  a lot different than the climate itself, especially when you see the  folks that are pushing it the hardest still flying to all their Paris  rallies and this and that in private jets, not living their lives any  different, other than what normal people do.   Coming back to the fossil fuel portion of it, it would be worth it,  so the alarmists say, to lower CO2 levels and avoid a  crisis. But the U.S. causes less than one-sixth of all global  emissions, and that number is even going lower.   President Trump pulled us out of the Paris accord, yet the United  States is still leading the way on lowering its CO2  production anyway. It has a lower net number than before, without an  accord. The other countries in the developing world, in the Third  World, in the Eastern Bloc, whatever, are still increasing their  numbers, building new coal-powered plants in China--one a week, some  crazy number like that.    We are supposed to adhere to that in this country and curb our  production and curb our economy, even though we are leading the way in  cleaner technology, cleaner-burning automobiles and trucks, cleaner- burning power plants.   It is so crazy that in my home State of California, for example, when  we look at the type of electricity production that comes from green  power sources, the environmentalists are trying to get rid of them. We  had two nuclear-powered plants in California. They already closed one,  San Onofre, down by San Diego, and then one in San Luis Obispo. Those  two themselves are responsible, at their peak production, for somewhere  around 16, 18, even 20 percent of the whole grid of California. Imagine  knocking out 20 percent of the grid in that short amount of time and  trying to replace it with more politically correct green power.   It is hard to get the permits to do the politically correct green  power, such as making tens of thousands of acres covered with solar  cells or windmills, but nonetheless, we are hellbent on that direction.   At the same time, they want to get rid of the use of natural gas and  propane to power people's stoves, power people's water heaters, things  like that, and have them go electric. They are hellbent on changing  cars into being electric powered by 2035, no more combustion engine  cars, all because of this 0.04 percent.   What are we doing here? It is a political agenda.   Indeed, every committee in this new Congress has to spend a good  portion of their time not talking about whether it is childcare,  agriculture, or finance. They have to run it all through a climate  change filter before we can move on to the work that needs to be done.   Coming back to California, we sometimes have public safety power  shutoffs, they call it, because we have an issue of trees that might  fall onto power lines or branches that the wind might catch and blow  into power lines. Right here is an example of three fires that have  happened in northern California in the last couple of years.                                time  1215    This one here is the current Dixie fire. I am using an older poster,  because I am cheap, but this is now, instead of 100,000 acres, a  million acres. It would come all the way up here past Mount Lassen.   What is the CO2 equation here of unmanaged forests? We  need to manage  [[Page H5181]]  forests, so we don't make all the CO2 and have all the fire  and soot and ash that blows all the way back to the East Coast. This  CO2 this is deceptive, and we need to think differently.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for  yielding.   I would like to use this time to highlight a concern that pops up  when we are debating bills that pay for water storage and conveyance in  the Western United States, especially given the severity of the drought  we face.   Often my colleagues, understandably, wonder why the Federal  Government is still helping fund the California water system. Why  California water? It is rather simple. Our 77,000 farms and ranches top  the production charts in at least 77 different goods, from dairy to  fruits to vegetables.   California is actually the only producer of almonds, artichokes,  celery, figs, garlic, raisins, kiwis, honeydew, nectarines, olives,  cling peaches, pistachios, plums, sweet rice, and walnuts in the United  States. If it isn't made there, you are not going to get it from this  country; it will be imported.   This incredible system was set up as a partnership between the  Federal and State governments. Although $1 billion in this program is a  decent start, when we are talking $100 billion to keep supporting the  high-speed rail boondoggle in California, we see our priorities are  misplaced.   More money needs to be put in for water storage to help all Americans  and less for all these other things that do not help.    ``Ladies and gentlemen, no great country can say it is  secure without being able to control its borders. Period. What I would  do about it is what I proposed to do about it almost 13 years ago. I  would radically ramp up the number of border security guards we have  and increase the use of electronic surveillance material we have to  guard the border.''   Now, which politician said those words back on the campaign trail  back in 2007?   Here is another quote for you: ``We simply cannot allow people to  pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and  circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently,  and lawfully to become immigrants in this country.''   That wasn't President Trump. That wasn't even a Republican. Those  commonsense border policy quotes you heard came from none other than  President Biden and President Obama.   Those words reveal the Democrats do know what is needed to fix our  border crisis, but they are too afraid of what the liberal media and  the progressive left would do in order to act.   So I call on President Biden to listen to his own advice and do what  needs to be done because ``no great country can say it is secure  without being able to control its own borders. Period.''                            ____________________
