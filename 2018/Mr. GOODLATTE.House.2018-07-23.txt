 Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   First of all, the protection of private ownership of property is  vital to individual freedom and national prosperity. It is also one of  the most fundamental constitutional principles, as the Founders  enshrined property rights protections throughout the Constitution,  including in the Fifth Amendment, which provides that private property  shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.   This clause created two conditions to the government taking private  property: first, the subsequent use of the property must be for the use  of the public and, second, that the government must pay the owner just  compensation for the property.  [[Page H6615]]    However, more than a decade ago the Supreme Court, in the 5-4 Kelo v.  City of New London decision, expanded the ability of State and local  governments to exercise eminent domain powers beyond what is allowed by  the text of the Constitution, by allowing government to seize property  under the vague guise of economic development, even when the public use  turns out to be nothing more than the generation of tax revenues by  another private party after the government takes property from private  individuals and gives it to another private entity.   As the dissenting Justices observed, by defining public use so  expansively, the result of the Kelo decision is, effectively, to delete  the words ``for public use'' from the Takings Clause of the Fifth  Amendment. The specter of condemnation hangs over all property. The  government now has license to transfer property from those with few  resources to those with more. The Founders cannot have intended this  perverse result.   In the wake of this decision, State and local governments can use  eminent domain powers to take the property of any individual for nearly  any reason. Cities may now bulldoze citizens' homes, farms, churches,  and small businesses to make way for shopping malls or other  developments.   To help prevent such abuse, using Congress' constitutional  legislative powers, it is important Congress finally passes the Private  Property Rights Protection Act.   I want to thank Mr. Sensenbrenner for reintroducing this legislation.  He and I have worked together on this issue for many years, and I am  pleased that this legislation incorporates many provisions from  legislation I helped to introduce in the 109th Congress, the STOPP Act.   Specifically, the Private Property Rights Protection Act would  prohibit State and local governments from receiving Federal economic  development funds for 2 years when they use economic development as a  justification for taking property from one person and giving it to  another private entity.   In addition, this legislation grants adversely affected landowners  the right to use appropriate legal remedies to enforce the provisions  of the bill and allows State and local governments to cure violations  by giving the property back to the original owner.   The bill also includes a carefully crafted definition of economic  development that protects traditional uses of eminent domain, such as  taking land for public uses like roads and pipelines, while prohibiting  abuses of the eminent domain power.   No one should have to live in fear of the government's taking their  home, farm, or business simply to give it to a wealthier person or  corporation. As the Institute for Justice's witness observed during a  hearing on this bill, using eminent domain so that another richer,  better-connected person may live or work on the land you used to own  tells Americans that their hopes, dreams, and hard work do not matter  as much as money and political influence. The use of eminent domain for  private development has no place in a country built on traditions of  independence, hard work, and protection of property rights.    This legislation has passed the House three times previously, either  by voice vote or with the support of at least 80 percent of House  Members in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, only to be stalled in the  Senate. But the fight for people's homes continues, as will this  committee's efforts to protect Federal taxpayers from any involvement  in eminent domain abuse.   Just a few years ago, every single Republican Member voted for the  very same legislation on the House floor, as did two-thirds of  Democratic Members. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  overwhelmingly bipartisan effort.   I want to respond to some of the issues raised by the gentleman from  New York and the gentleman from Maryland. Pursuant to Congress' powers  under the Constitution's Spending Clause, the Private Property Rights  Protection Act conditions the receipt of Federal economic development  funds on State and local governments agreeing not to use eminent domain  for private economic development takings.   Federal law currently permits expending Federal funds to support the  use of eminent domain for these abusive takings. In our current  economy, and with the Federal Government running deficits every year,  Congress should not be spending American taxpayers' scarce economic  development funds to support State and local governments that  unconstitutionally deprive hardworking Americans of their homes, farms,  and small businesses.   By conditioning the receipt of Federal economic development funds on  State and local governments agreeing not to take property for  commercial development, this provision in the bill ends the Federal  Government's complicit support of eminent domain abuse.   The enforcement provisions in the base bill are comprehensive, and  they include all manner of relief from preliminary injunctions and  temporary restraining orders, to the awarding of attorney's fees, to  the ability of the State or locality to return or replace the property  to avoid the penalties under the bill. Even those comprehensive  enforcement mechanisms, on their own, are not enough. We must end  Federal monetary support for economic development takings.   If State governments retain control over eminent domain decisions,  then, of course, those States should be held responsible for the  State's own actions. But in Virginia, my State, local governments are  not allowed to condemn property for economic development purposes. In  Virginia, the so-called Dillon Rule provides that localities can act  only in areas in which the State general assembly has granted clear  authority.   So, in Virginia, local governments have only the authorities granted  to them by the General Assembly, and the Virginia General Assembly has  empowered local governments in Virginia to condemn property for roads,  schools, and other public uses, but local governments do not have the  right to condemn property for economic development.   In fact, back in 2000, Virginia Beach city government tried to  condemn private property on the oceanfront to help a Hilton hotel build  a parking garage, but Circuit Court Judge H. Thomas Padrick, Jr., ruled  that Virginia Beach could not use eminent domain for that purpose,  finding that the legislature did not intend to allow a city to condemn  property solely for its economic benefit and development.   Indeed, after the Supreme Court handed down its notorious decision in  the Kelo case, a spokeswoman for the Virginia attorney general said the  following:         As per the constitution of Virginia, public use in eminent       domain is defined by the general assembly. There is no       proviso in our constitution to use eminent domain for       economic development.    As a result of the Kelo decision, this bill won't have an impact on  Virginia.   Finally, regarding Representative Raskin's comments about how the  bill relates to the Supreme Court's NFIB v. Sebelius case, the  ObamaCare case, the bill, as currently drafted, would certainly not run  afoul of anything in it for several reasons.   The court made clear in the case that Congress may attach appropriate  conditions to Federal taxing and spending programs to preserve its  control over the use of Federal funds. That is what the bill does: deny  the use of Federal economic development funds to jurisdictions that  have demonstrated their willingness to abuse eminent domain and thereby  demonstrated their willingness to use Federal funds to further future  abuses of eminent domain if allowed to do so.   The court went on to cite the South Dakota v. Dole case, in which a  Federal law threatened to withhold 5 percent of a State's Federal  Highway Fund if the State did not raise its drinking age to 21. The  court found that the condition was directly related to one of the main  purposes for which highway funds are expended: safe interstate travel.   In the same way, the bill's restrictions are directly related to one  of the main purposes for which Congress should intend Federal economic  development funds to be expended: economic development that does not  infringe on the property rights of individual property owners.   The court pointed out that, in the South Dakota v. Dole case, the  Federal funds at stake constituted less than one-half of 1 percent of  South Dakota's budget at the time; whereas, the potential loss of funds  at issue in NFIB v.  [[Page H6616]]  Sebelius were such that Medicaid spending accounts were over 20 percent  of the average State's total budget.   No one is claiming that Federal economic development funds, however  defined, would constitute anything near 20 percent of a State's total  budget.   In NFIB v. Sebelius, the court also cited the Pennhurst v. Halderman  case and characterized its holdings as, though Congress' power to  legislate under the Spending Clause is broad, it does not include  surprising participating States with post-acceptance or retroactive  conditions.   That, of course, is not the case with the bill, which applies its  prohibition upon the receipt of Federal economic development funds only  after a State had been found by a court, in a final judgment on the  merits, to have violated the act.    Finally, not only is it implausible that the bill would ever run  afoul of Supreme Court precedent due to the relatively small size of  Federal economic development funds in the context of a State or a  locality's entire annual budget; the bill contains a further safety  valve in that it gives the attorney general the discretion to  promulgate precisely which Federal funding streams are Federal economic  development funds under the bill. So, if a constitutional issue ever  arose, the attorney general could simply scale back the size of its  promulgated list accordingly.   It seems to me it can't be claimed this bill is unconstitutional  under any reasonable reading of any existing Supreme Court precedent.   Regarding federalism values generally, the key point is that there  actually is a very close nexus between Federal development funding and  eminent domain, even if the funding is not used on eminent domain  projects.   Money is fungible, of course. If the bill were amended to disallow  only the use of Federal economic development funds on eminent domain  projects, it would be very easy for an offending jurisdiction to game  the system by artificially segmenting a project into parts that use  eminent domain and parts that don't. That segmentation would happen  both vertically, by dividing a project into stages, and horizontally,  by dividing a single project into very small geographic segments.   The entirely appropriate federalism message the base bill sends to  States and localities is that, if you are going to do economic  development but abuse eminent domain, that is fine, but you will be on  your own for a while and go without Federal taxpayer complicity in your  abuse of eminent domain.   Mr. Speaker, this is good legislation. The concerns addressed by the  minority are addressed clearly in this legislation. There is strong  bipartisan support for this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  pass this and, once again, send it to the United States Senate, where  we can only hope that they will someday see the wisdom of protecting  the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5954) to amend title 18, United States Code, to clarify the  meaning of the terms ``act of war'' and ``blocked asset'', and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5954         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Anti-Terrorism Clarification       Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF THE TERM ``ACT OF WAR''.

(b) Applicability.--The amendments made by this section       shall apply to any judgment entered before, on, or after the       date of enactment of this Act.       SEC. 4. CONSENT OF CERTAIN PARTIES TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION.         (a) In General.--Section 2334 of title 18, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Consent of Certain Parties to Personal       Jurisdiction.--        ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), for       purposes of any civil action under section 2333 of this       title, a defendant shall be deemed to have consented to       personal jurisdiction in such civil action if, regardless of       the date of the occurrence of the act of international       terrorism upon which such civil action was filed, the       defendant--        ``(A) after the date that is 120 days after the date of       enactment of this subsection, accepts--        ``(i) any form of assistance, however provided, under       chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961       (22 U.S.C. 2346 et seq.);        ``(ii) any form of assistance, however provided, under       section 481 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.       2291) for international narcotics control and law       enforcement; or        ``(iii) any form of assistance, however provided, under       chapter 9 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961       (22 U.S.C. 2349bb et seq.); or        ``(B) in the case of a defendant benefiting from a waiver       or suspension of section 1003 of the Anti-Terrorism Act of       1987 (22 U.S.C. 5202) after the date that is 120 days after       the date of enactment of this subsection--        ``(i) continues to maintain any office, headquarters,       premises, or other facilities or establishments within the       jurisdiction of the United States; or        ``(ii) establishes or procures any office, headquarters,       premises, or other facilities or establishments within the       jurisdiction of the United States.        ``(2) Applicability.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any       defendant who ceases to engage in the conduct described in       paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B) for 5 consecutive calendar       years.''.        (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by this section       shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on H.R. 5954, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, Congress enacted the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992 in order  to help combat international terrorism and to provide some level of  financial  [[Page H6617]]  justice to American victims of terrorism. The 1992 act added a civil  remedy to the ATA's existing criminal regime, removing jurisdictional  hurdles that often confounded terrorism victims' ability to get their  day in court. The act has been largely successful.   However, from time to time, the 1992 act has also needed  modifications to ensure that it is fully serving its purposes. For  instance, just last Congress, in the Justice Against Sponsors of  Terrorism Act, I helped lead the charge in the House to amend the civil  liability provision to make sure that those who aid and abet or  conspire with foreign terrorist organizations are liable under the ATA.   In addition, in 2012, the Judiciary Committee worked to lengthen the  statute of limitations on civil ATA claims to provide victims with the  time they need to file these often complex lawsuits.   The bill we are considering today, the Anti-terrorism Clarification  Act, builds on these previous technical amendments to the ATA. It makes  three needed improvements in order to better ensure that victims of  international terrorism can obtain justice in U.S. courts against  terrorists and their supporters.   First, the bill clarifies the ATA's act of war exception. Defendants  accused of aiding and abetting acts of international terrorism have  been attempting to use this exception as a means of avoiding civil  liability, even in cases in which the plaintiffs' injuries were caused  by the actions of designated terrorist groups.   For example, in Kaplan v. Central Bank of Iran, the defendant  financial institution successfully argued that rocket attacks against  civilians carried out by Hezbollah, a designated foreign terrorist  organization, were acts of war and, thus, outside the scope of the  ATA's civil liability provisions.   The act of war exception should not be a liability shield for those  who aid or abet attacks carried out by designated terrorist  organizations.   This legislation amends the definition of ``act of war'' in the ATA  to clarify that the exception does not apply to U.S. Government- designated foreign terrorist organizations or specially designated  global terrorists.   Second, at the urging of Representative Posey, the author of the  CAPTIVE Act, we included language in the bill to strengthen the ATA's  civil enforcement regime by permitting victims of narcoterrorism to  satisfy their court-awarded judgments with the assets of foreign  narcotics drug kingpins. Assets blocked by the Federal Government under  the Kingpin Designation Act are not currently available to victims,  leaving victims of the FARC and other narcoterrorists without a  meaningful method of getting compensation for their injuries.   Finally, this legislation addresses recent Federal court decisions  that have called into question the continued ability of victims to  bring terrorists and their supporters to justice under the ATA's civil  liability regime.   The ATA was specifically designed to provide extraterritorial  jurisdiction over terrorists who attack U.S. nationals overseas.  However, these recent cases have severely limited the extraterritorial  scope of the ATA.   The Anti-terrorism Clarification Act amends the jurisdiction and  venue section of the ATA to make clear that defendants who take  advantage of certain benefits provided by the U.S. Government shall be  deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction in U.S. courts in ATA  civil actions. No defendant should be able to accept U.S. foreign  assistance while simultaneously dodging responsibility in U.S. courts  for supporting or carrying out terrorist attacks that harm Americans.   I want to thank Ranking Member Nadler, along with Senate Judiciary  Committee Chairman Grassley and Senate Commerce, Science, and  Transportation Committee Ranking Member Nelson for joining me in  introducing this bicameral and bipartisan bill.   I urge my colleagues to support us in passing this legislation to  clarify ambiguities in the ATA that terrorist sponsors have exploited  to evade liability so that we can help ensure that Americans are able  to hold terrorists and their supporters accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey), who has been a real champion in  protecting the rights of the victims of terrorism.    Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I urge my colleagues  to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4100) to amend title 36, United States Code, to revise the  Federal charter for the Foundation of the Federal Bar Association.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4100         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Foundation of the Federal       Bar Association Charter Amendments Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. ORGANIZATION.         Section 70501 of title 36, United States Code, is amended       by striking subsection (b) and redesignating subsection (c)       as subsection (b).       SEC. 3. MEMBERSHIP.         Section 70503 of title 36, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking subsections (a) and (b) and inserting the       following:        ``(a) Eligibility.--Except as provided in this chapter,       eligibility for membership in the corporation and the rights       and privileges of members are as provided in the bylaws.'';        (2) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (b); and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(c) Nondiscrimination.--The terms of membership may not       discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,       disability, age, sexual orientation, or national origin.''.       SEC. 4. GOVERNING BODY.         Section 70504 of title 36, United States Code, is amended       to read as follows:       ``Sec. 70504. Governing body         ``(a) Board of Directors.--The board of directors is the       governing body of the corporation. The board may exercise, or       provide for the exercise of, the powers of the corporation.

[[Page H6619]]            SEC. 5. RESTRICTIONS.         Section 70507 of title 36, United States Code, is amended       to read as follows:       ``Sec. 70507. Restrictions         ``(a) Stock and Dividends.--The corporation may not issue       stock or declare or pay a dividend.        ``(b) Political Activities.--The corporation or a director       or officer in his or her corporate capacity may not       contribute to, support, or participate in any political       activity or in any manner attempt to influence legislation.        ``(c) Distribution of Income or Assets.--The income or       assets of the corporation may not inure to the benefit of, or       be distributed to, a director, officer, or member during the       life of the charter granted by this chapter.

Section 70508 of title 36, United States Code, is amended       by striking ``the District of Columbia,'' and inserting ``a       United States location decided by the board of directors and       specified in the bylaws,''.       SEC. 7. SERVICE OF PROCESS.         Section 70510 of title 36, United States Code, is amended       to read as follows:       ``Sec. 70510.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4100, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the mission of the Federal Bar Association is to  ``strengthen the Federal legal system and administration of justice by  serving the interests and the needs of the Federal practitioner, both  public and private, the Federal judiciary, and the public they serve.''   The Federal Bar Association's membership includes more than 18,000  Federal lawyers, including 1,500 Federal judges, who, as the  Association states, ``work together to promote the sound administration  of justice and integrity, quality, and independence of the judiciary.''   The FBA received a Federal charter in 1954.  Steve Chabot has  introduced H.R. 4100, the Foundation of the Federal Bar Association  Charter Amendments Act. The Foundation wrote to the Judiciary Committee  stating that:         We wholeheartedly endorse H.R. 4100, which would provide       for technical changes to the Federal charter of the       Foundation of the Federal Bar Association. . . . The       technical amendments embodied in H.R. 4100 will provide       reasonable and necessary flexibility to the Foundation to       assist in the governance and management of the Foundation's       affairs. Under the legislation, the mission of the Foundation       of the Federal Bar Association will remain unchanged in the       promotion and support of legal research and education       concerning the Federal administration of justice, the       advancement of the science of jurisprudence, and the       fostering of improvements in the practice of Federal law. . .       . Since 1954, and especially over the past two decades, the       Foundation has devoted significant effort toward the       enlargement of its educational and charitable programs,       including the creation of a fellows program, support of       academic and legal scholarship, creation of donor advised       funds, establishment of assistance funds for the victims of       terrorism and natural disasters, creation of scholarship       programs for law students and the children of Federal       attorneys, and grant assistance for Federal Bar Association       chapters conducting pro bono and other community service       projects. . . . These wide-ranging efforts have been       successful, but also have exposed the limitations of the       Foundation's 1954 charter, particularly with respect to       eligibility for membership and governance of the Foundation.       . . . The technical corrections . . . would address these       concerns and provide greater flexibility to the Foundation in       a fashion similar to the authority and privileges enjoyed by       other . . . organizations federally chartered by Congress. .       . .    The bill, among other things, allows the Foundation to have its  principal office outside of the District of Columbia, gives its board  of directors more leeway in meeting its responsibilities, and adds a  nondiscrimination clause.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4100, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), chairman of the Small Business  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2245) to include New Zealand in the list of foreign states  whose nationals are eligible for admission into the United States as E- 1 and E-2 nonimmigrants if United States nationals are treated  similarly by the Government of New Zealand.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2245         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Knowledgeable Innovators and       Worthy Investors Act'' or the ``KIWI Act''.       SEC. 2. NONIMMIGRANT TRADERS AND INVESTORS.         For purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) of section       101(a)(15)(E) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8       U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(E)), New Zealand shall be considered to be       a foreign state described in such section if the Government       of New Zealand provides similar nonimmigrant status to       nationals of the United States.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 2245, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H6621]]    Mr. Speaker, E-1 visas are nonimmigrant visas available for treaty  traders, and E-2 visas are available for treaty investors.   Pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act, these visas are  available to aliens who are ``entitled to enter the United States under  and in pursuance of the provisions of a treaty of commerce and  navigation between the United States and the foreign state of which he  is a national, and their spouse and children . . . solely to either  carry on substantial trade, including trade in services or trade in  technology, principally between the United States and the foreign state  of which he is a national, or to develop and direct the operations of  an enterprise in which he has invested . . . a substantial amount of  capital. . . . ''   Alien employees of treaty traders and treaty investors may receive  visas if they are coming to the United States ``to engage in duties of  an executive or supervisory character, or, if employed in a lesser  capacity, if they have special qualifications that make the services to  be rendered essential to the efficient operation of the enterprise.''   There are no numerical caps on E-1 or E-2 visas. Aliens may be  admitted initially for a period of 2 years and can apply for extensions  in 2-year increments.   The United States has entered into treaties of commerce since at  least 1815, when we entered into a Convention to Regulate Commerce with  the United Kingdom.                                time  1645    Currently, the nationals of 83 countries are eligible for E-1 or E-2  status. In fiscal year 2017, in total, about 50,000 E-1 and E-2 visas  were issued.   In the past, countries became eligible for the E-1 and E-2 programs  through treaties signed with the United States. However, in 2003, the  Judiciary Committee reached an understanding with the U.S. Trade  Representative that no immigration provisions were to be included in  future trade agreements. Henceforth, legislation would be required to  add countries.   The bill we are considering today, S. 2245, makes New Zealand  nationals eligible for E-1 and E-2 visas. I want to thank Mr. Issa for  all of his work on this issue, and for introducing companion  legislation in the House. I am also appreciative of the Embassy of New  Zealand for seeking E visa status in the right way.   I urge my colleagues to support S. 2245, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Maryland and Ranking Member Nadler and others for their work on this  legislation, as well as Congressman Issa and Senator Hirono. This is  very good legislation and it's overdue. I urge my colleagues to support  it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
