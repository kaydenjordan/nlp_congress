 Madam Speaker, with all due respect to the  President, if you want to make America great again, Mr. President, have  the Senate pass a bill to protect first responders by sending money to  local governments.   If you want to make America great again, put money in the pockets of  the persons who are in food lines miles long so that they can feed  their families.   If you want to make America great again, admit that what you said was  a hoax and let the healthcare workers and advisors give the advice on  healthcare.
