 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a member of my  staff in the great State of New Jersey. We are all fortunate to have  offices full of staff members passionate about working for the  betterment of our country. William Moen, Jr., or Bill Moen, as we  affectionately call him, is a shining example of what patriotism looks  like in government service.   The son of a disabled Vietnam veteran and the grandson of a WWII  veteran, Bill Moen's commitment to public service is a family legacy.   Even prior to his Federal work in my Senate office in Camden, NJ,  Bill has worked at all levels of government in New Jersey. Hes interned  at his local police department and the First Congressional District of  New Jersey. He worked in the New Jersey State Legislature, with the  Gloucester County Board of Chosen Freeholders and even as an elected  Freeholder himself in Camden County.   On December 9, 2013, I welcomed Bill Moen to my staff in Camden, NJ.  Bill was with me on one of my first official events as U.S. Senator. He  helped organize a visit to Cape May County--the southernmost county in  New Jersey--where I spoke with residents who were still struggling to  recover from the devastation of Superstorm Sandy. The past 6 years are  full of memorable events, stories, projects, and cases like this one.  He has managed my South Jersey office with compassion and integrity.   Mr. President, I wish to recognize Bill Moen today because he is  leaving my office to set up his own as assemblyman representing New  Jersey's Fifth Legislative District in the New Jersey State Assembly. I  am sad to see him go but grateful for his work and proud of the new  role he begins in what will surely be a long and brilliant career in  public service.                            ____________________
