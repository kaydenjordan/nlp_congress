 Mr. Speaker, Ukraine, led by President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is winning and will be victorious over Putin.  Biden must send military aid now.   The ruse provided by incompetent Russian generals to claim eastern  Ukraine is a trick. Just as America would not surrender by giving up a  small part of the Eastern United States, such as Delaware, we know  Putin must be defeated by peace through strength.   Victory is the only option to stop autocracy by rule of gun against  democracy by rule of law, a clash of civilizations. The Chinese  Communist Party will be stopped from mass murder in Taiwan. Iranian  mullahs will be stopped from vaporizing the people of Israel. The  world's largest democracy of India can thrive in a stabilized world.   I have faith in the Russian people, a great culture with great  cultural influence adopted in America. There is legislation for  defecting Russian troops, diplomats, and Duma members to be provided  immediate refugee status to America and up to $100,000 for any Russian  military equipment turned over to Ukraine.    God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. Long live Volodymyr Zelenskyy.                            ____________________
