 Mr. Speaker, as the American economy struggles to recover  from COVID, the last thing we need is more wasteful spending on liberal  priorities.   Inflation is higher than it has ever been in over a decade, and  businesses are struggling to get workers back to work because of the  lavish handouts from our Federal Government.   What our country needs is a pure investment in American  infrastructure, one that would put people back to work and increase  mobility for Americans; new roads, bridges, and pipelines built by  Americans for Americans.   Unfortunately, the Democrats have yet again decided to play politics  with America's future. Rather than investing heavily in new roads,  pipelines, and bridges, Democrats are using their infrastructure bill  as a means to push radical left ideas on energy, leaving out oil and  gas workers while funding goes toward achieving the Green New Deal.   House Republicans have introduced our version of real American  infrastructure. It is $460 billion versus the Democrats' $1 trillion  plan. It includes investment in roads, bridges, and transit, water  infrastructure, and broadband. It will help put Americans back to work  and build a brighter future for America.   That is what real American infrastructure is about, not pushing far- left policies to appease the base. If the Democrats ever get serious  about wanting to build out America's infrastructure, Republicans are  ready to work with them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight some of the stated  goals of the INVEST in America Act.   The INVEST in America Act creates and sustains good-paying jobs,  restores global competitiveness, tackles climate change, modernizes  infrastructure, and spurs long-term economic growth.   These are laudable goals that most if not all of us here support.  However, Mr. Speaker, when you focus on the rail title, the INVEST in  America Act misses on all of those marks and, in fact, has the  potential to turn back the clocks on our envy-of-the-world freight rail  system.   Freight railroads provide excellent, high-paying jobs, with a Class 1  freight employee's compensation averaging $132,000 per year.   On competitiveness, the freight rail industry met the demands of our  Nation during the pandemic by never closing and continually moving the  goods we needed to preserve public health. They did all of it, I might  add, without asking for any bailout money.   On the environment, freight railroads are also the most fuel- efficient way to move freight over land. On average, railroads move 1  ton of freight more than 480 miles on 1 gallon of fuel.   On modern infrastructure, unlike the rest of our Nation's  transportation system, our freight rail system receives the highest  grade from the civil engineers for their infrastructure, a B.   On economic opportunity, freight rail's economic impact in 2017 alone  manifested itself in over 1.1 million jobs, $219 billion in economic  output, $71 billion in wages, and nearly $26 billion in total tax  revenues.   The freight railroads can meet all of these goals because the  railroads, not the American taxpayers, spend the $25 billion annually  needed to improve and maintain their infrastructure. Private companies  are simply better custodians of infrastructure networks than the  Federal Government, and we should be utilizing that simple reality, not  bemoaning it.   While President Biden, Secretary Buttigieg, and Chairman DeFazio  regularly profess their love for trains, the truth is that it only  extends to the highly subsidized passenger version.   The INVEST in America Act spends almost $100 billion on Amtrak.  Amtrak ridership was already collapsing outside of the Northeast  Corridor before COVID. Where passenger rail makes sense, private  companies like Virgin Trains are building new passenger lines.   The rail title couldn't include provisions to accelerate the  deployment of new safety technologies on freight rail but ensures that  French toast will be served on every Amtrak train. It does nothing to  expand freight rail service by moving new and in-demand products like  liquefied natural gas but will pay to roll empty Amtrak trains through  new parts of the country.   If Amtrak is so good and deserves an 850 percent funding increase  from the previous rail title, I challenge everyone voting for the  INVEST in America Act to use Amtrak instead of an airline the next time  you need to head from your district to the Capitol.   This rail title is too expensive, too damaging to the economy, and  too partisan to pass. However, it is not too late to work together.   I introduced an amendment to the Rules Committee to strike the entire  rail title. The base text is simply too flawed to fix, and we must do  better.
