 Mr. Speaker, in Florida, we have strong  redistricting standards that were passed by a large majority of Florida  voters and placed in our State constitution.   I also recognize that strong standards and criteria are provided for  in H.R. 1.   Would the chairperson agree to working together with the State- adopted redistricting criteria to ensure H.R. 1 does not dilute the  Florida requirements?
