 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to stand here in this Chamber  and commemorate National Bible Week along with my colleagues here  tonight.   Tonight, I want to talk about what the Bible has meant to me and its  impact on our Nation's history, the divisions we see across our  country, including in this Chamber, and highlight the challenges we are  facing.   I am currently reading the Bible, with a prayer group here in  Congress, in its entirety for the third time. I am constantly reminded  of the answers this book provides to the current issues we are facing  in our Nation.   Unfortunately and regrettably, we are a Bible-illiterate society.  Just above our flag here in this Chamber is ``In God we Trust.'' How do  you put your faith and trust in God if you don't know Him and  understand His Word?   I was baptized in a small, rural church at the age of 9 in Georgia,  and, of course, I began to go my own way in high school and college.  After marrying my wife, we found another church home. For some 30  years, that meant so much to our family, raising our children in that  church, but it became more of a ritual and somewhat meaningless to me.  I had my priorities out of order.   A friend asked me to join him in a Bible study. Some 6 months later,  I realized that God didn't want my rituals; He wanted my heart. I have  had this urge to know God since then and study His Word intently and  try my best to understand His will for me. What I have learned is that  God created the church through Jesus Christ to evangelize, and God  created government to moralize and restrain evil.   Today, both the church and the government are divided on these  issues. We have Moses, his full face looking down on the entire  Chamber, who gave us the first five books of the Bible, the moral law.  It should be pretty plain to us what God expects.   As I said earlier, ``In God We Trust'' is above the flag, and it is  on our money, yet in this body we are without excuse.   Joshua 1:8 says: This book of the law, the Bible, shall not depart  from your lips, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you  may be careful to do what it says and what is written in it; for then  you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success.   God's Word is full of great promises.   So where are we today?   My fellow Americans, Billy Graham offered a prayer on inauguration in  1969, and I would like to read it.                                time  1945    I will read just part of it: Our Father and our God, Thou hast said,  ``Blessed is that nation whose God is the Lord.'' We recognize on this  historic occasion that we are ``one Nation under God.''   As the prayer goes on, Reverend Graham describes the current  situation in 1969. Today, we are struggling with the same issues.  Emotional health has become an epidemic because so many do not have  hope and understanding.   Mr. Speaker, I ask you to seek God's Word, pray, and meet with others  and your colleagues and seek understanding.
