 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Dr. Reiko  Johnson of Newfields and Dr. Nathan Swanson of Durham as October's  Granite Staters of the Month. The duo is working to provide free dental  care for patients in need, including recently hosting a Dental Day of  Caring this past month.   In March 2021, recently vaccinated and with an urge to give back to  her community, Dr. Johnson began looking for medical volunteer  opportunities. In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, she had  provided telehealth services as a primary care provider at Catholic  Medical Center, and she was itching to be face-to-face with patients  again. When she was not able to find a volunteer clinic in the area,  she decided to take matters into her own hands and start her own mobile  clinic, modeled on a free health clinic that she had previously  volunteered at in Hampton.   Dr. Johnson established the Volunteers in Medicine of New Hampshire-- VIM-NH--and held its first free clinic in January of this year,  providing primary and acute care services for uninsured and  underinsured patients and connecting them to long-term primary care  providers. However, over the months that followed, it became clear to  Dr. Johnson that many of the clinic's patients had critical dental  issues that she and her volunteers were not equipped to deal with.   To address this issue, Dr. Johnson partnered with Dr. Nathan Swanson  last month to host VIM-NH's first Dental Day of Caring. Dr. Swanson had  learned about Dr. Johnson's work from Emily Komerska, a UNH pre-med  student and longtime family friend, and he immediately knew he wanted  to get involved. During the event, which took place at Dr. Swanson's  office using his equipment, the 4 volunteer dentists and 6 assistants  provided 19 extractions, 10 fillings, and 1 root canal--donating  $11,531 total in services.   Dr. Johnson and Dr. Swanson's partnership is a shining example of the  Granite State spirit of coming together to help people in need. Many of  the clinic's patients, including people experiencing homelessness and  people without insurance, would not be able to receive this vital care  otherwise. I applaud Dr. Johnson and Dr. Swanson's dedication to making  a difference, and I look forward to seeing how they continue their  Dental Day of Caring initiative.                            ____________________
