 Madam Speaker, I come before the House of Representatives  to discuss the newest and best version of the PACT Act before us today.   Putting the needs of our veterans first is something we can all agree  on. On March 3, the House passed a version of the PACT Act that was  unworkable and unaffordable. At that time, I joined my colleagues in  calling for negotiations and refinements that would best help the  veterans and gain bipartisan support, and I voted ``no'' on that  original bill.   The bill that we have before us today is the result of those long and  difficult negotiations. This version of the bill reinforces why I  opposed it during the initial passage. When we work together and put  the well-being of veterans above partisan politics, we get a workable,  effective bill that will save the lives of those who have given so much  for us.   It is not a perfect bill. There remains language, including the costs  and mandatory spending that are somewhat troubling, but I am confident  that we will be vigilant about carrying out our oversight of the  implementation of those provisions and the spending associated with  them. I also call on the moneys moved to mandatory spending be moved  back to discretionary when we take back the majority.   America's veterans who were exposed to toxins during their voluntary  military service in combat to preserve America's liberty and freedoms  will finally receive the healthcare and benefits they need.                                time  1430    I support this legislation because it requires the VA to contact  every single veteran who filed a claim for benefits that related to  toxic exposure but had  [[Page H6022]]  the claim originally denied, allowing them to refile their claim. I  support this legislation because it expands the screening of possible  toxic exposure to every veteran receiving VA care.   America's obligation to our veterans is best conveyed by the words of  Abraham Lincoln: ``To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and  for his widow, and his orphan.''   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to vote in favor of the amendments  to H.R. 3967.
