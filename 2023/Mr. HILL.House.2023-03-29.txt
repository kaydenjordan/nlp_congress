 Mr. Chair, I thank my good friend from Ohio for yielding. I  rise in strong support for this legislative commitment that House  Republicans have initiated, H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act. I thank  my friend from Ohio for his leadership. I thank my good friend from  Arkansas, Chairman Bruce Westerman of the Natural Resources Committee  for his fine work on this important bill.   Under this administration's green energy only push, we are driving up  costs for central Arkansas families, hurting our economy, and our  national security.   We need in this Nation an all-of-the-above energy approach for the  U.S. and for the globe.   According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's most recent  outlook, by 2050, global energy use will increase nearly 50 percent  compared to today. While the share of primary energy consumption from  renewables is predicted to increase from 15 to 27 percent by 2050, Mr.  Chair, 83 percent of energy consumption in that period will still need  to come from coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear. H.R. 1 takes this key  step in the right direction.   Instead, Biden officials are only focusing on intermittent energy  sources like wind and solar, for which we do not possess large-scale  storage or provide a reliable and consistent source of energy.   We need to be a leader in powering the world, and an all-of-the-above  energy strategy will do that.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
