 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100th  anniversary of the League of Women Voters of the United States. With a  commitment to civic participation, the League has secured its place  nationally as a relied-upon source of voter education and a protector  of voting rights. The centennial celebration is a historical benchmark  for the State of Michigan, as well as the entire Nation.   Just 6 months before the ratification of the 19th Amendment, the  suffragists of the National American Woman Suffrage Association as well  as other suffrage groups embarked on a mission to ensure that voters,  particularly women, would have the necessary nonpartisan information to  make informed decisions on who and what to support in elections. With  this newfound mission, the suffrage movement began a ``mighty political  experiment'' designed to help 20 million women carry out their new  civic duty.   With Michigan women winning the right to vote in 1918, the mission to  educate Michigan women voters started before the League was established  nationally when the Michigan League of Women Voters formed out of the  Michigan Equal Suffrage Association in 1919. The following year, they  became part of the League of Women Voters of the United States. The  early Michigan LWV advocated for changes to State-level voter  registration laws and civil service reform; they also established  citizenship classes through citizenship schools in people's homes. Many  of their actions influenced early programs of the National League, and  the intent of those programs continue today through the League's work.   While the League is nonpartisan, even from their conception, the  League used their voice and their platform for advocacy. One of their  earliest initiatives was for child welfare reform, as well as civil  service and election law reforms across the country. In 1941, the  League advocated successfully for amending Michigan State law to forbid  factory work by those under 16 and to mandate school attendance by all  children between the ages of 7 and 16. Other major legislation the  League advocated for includes the Equal Rights Amendment, National  Voter Registration Act, and the Help America Vote Act.   Today, Leagues from across the country advocate for issues such as  fighting voter suppression, limiting the influence of money in  politics, and redistricting. They are constantly encouraging and  pushing for further investment in our election infrastructure and  election security. With a presence in over 700 communities and across  all 50 States, the League of Women Voters of the United States has  become an activist, grassroots organization which plays a critical role  in our democracy.   It is my great pleasure to congratulate the League of Women Voters of  the United States on the lasting impact it has made throughout our  Nation's history and for the work it continues to do. As the League of  Women Voters of the United States celebrates this centennial milestone,  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating its members and  extending best wishes for continued success in the years ahead.                            ____________________
