 Madam Speaker, America is a Nation of immigrants; some  voluntary, others involuntary. John Lewis would often remind us,  however, that while we may have come over on different ships, we are  all in the same boat now.   We are a gorgeous mosaic of people from throughout the world,  different races, different regions, yes, different religions; that is  what makes America a great country, not xenophobia.   Donald Trump's hateful Muslim ban is unacceptable, unconscionable,  and un-American. It is inconsistent with the principles of religious  freedom and tolerance embedded in the First Amendment of the United  States Constitution. That is why we are going to make it unlawful.   Vote ``yes'' on the NO BAN Act.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  on the topic of tonight's Special Order hour.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we honor the life and  legacy of the Honorable John Robert Lewis. I am thankful for my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Republican Conference Chair  Liz Cheney and Republican Conference Vice Chair Mark Walker, for their  dual participation here on the House floor today, which is a  recognition that, yes, John Lewis was a Democratic hero; he was a  progressive hero; he was a civil rights hero; but above all else, John  Robert Lewis was an American hero.   So we are here today on the House floor, not as Democrats or  Republicans, not as progressives or conservatives, not as the left or  the right, but as Americans because of what John Lewis meant to all of  us: to our communities, to the country, to the Constitution, to the  principle of liberty and justice for all, equal protection under the  law, to the principle of the righteous cause of nonviolence as a  pathway to the beloved community, as he would share with all of us.   John Robert Lewis was the connective tissue between the civil rights  movement and the Black Lives Matter movement.   John Robert Lewis was the connective tissue between the dream of Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Presidency of Barack Obama.   And John Robert Lewis was the connective tissue between the tragedy  on the Edmund Pettus Bridge and the tragedy that occurred in  Minneapolis, Minnesota.   John Robert Lewis' life journey is the American journey, and he has  guided the way as we have traveled and marched toward a more perfect  Union; and through the sheer will of his morality, he has helped to  bend the arc toward justice.   And so we are all thankful for his life and his legacy, honored by  the privilege to have been able to call him ``colleague.''   We learned from John Lewis how to be a good American, a good patriot,  a good neighbor, a good leader, a good human, a good activist, and how  to get into ``good trouble.'' And so we are thankful for this  opportunity just to humbly communicate what John Lewis meant to all of  us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from the great  State of Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Takano), the distinguished chair of the Committee on Veterans'  Affairs.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois  (Mrs. Bustos).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Reed).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Ruppersberger).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Chabot).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Virginia  (Ms. Spanberger).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Mucarsel-Powell).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington  (Mr. Kilmer).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Langevin).    Madam Speaker, how much time do we have remaining?    Madam Speaker, let me simply close this portion of our  special hour in honor of our friend, our colleague, our mentor, our  hero, the legendary John Lewis, by simply recounting his words: Never  give up. Never give in. Keep the faith. Keep your eyes on the prize.  And make some good trouble.  [[Page H3686]]    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
