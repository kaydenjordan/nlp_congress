 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at  the desk.    I am, Mr. Speaker, in its present form.    Mr. Speaker, my motion to recommit amends the  Democratic bill by prohibiting taxpayer dollars from being used to give  raises to Federal employees who have been disciplined for sexual  misconduct. Without this change, Federal employees who have engaged in  sexual misconduct in the workplace would be rewarded for their bad  actions.   The Republican motion to recommit amends the bill and reports it back  forthwith with an amendment. If it passes, the Republican motion to  recommit will allow an immediate vote on final passage of the bill.   The underlying premise of the Democratic bill is that our Federal  civilian workforce should be treated the same as members of our armed  services, who received a 2.6 percent pay raise in last year's NDAA.   The Federal Government is blessed with amazing Federal employees. As  a former United States attorney, I led an office of those amazing  Federal employees. I worked with countless other dedicated Federal  employees.   Our dedicated civil servants work day in and day out to protect and  serve the American public. We are most grateful for their service.   The vast majority of Federal employees are hardworking. They don't  engage in conduct unbefitting their civil  [[Page H1315]]  service. However, those who have been disciplined for sexual misconduct  should not be rewarded with a 2.6 percent pay increase.   The bill before the House today treats every Federal employee the  same. Good, bad, competent, or not, they all get a pay raise on top of  automatic step increases and promotions.   Earlier today, my colleagues have asked: Doesn't everyone deserve a  pay raise? The answer is no. A broken disciplinary process in our  Federal agencies make it nearly impossible to fire anyone. This  Democratic bill is nothing short of a handout to individuals who engage  in sexual misconduct in the workplace, and that is wrong.   How can we reward anyone who harms Federal employees in this manner?  How can we reward people who abuse the public's trust in this way?   Let me give you a few past examples.   A 2018 PBS report included interviews with 34 current and former  female U.S. Forest Service employees who alleged discrimination,  harassment, and sexual assault at the agency. Do these employees who  perpetrated this type of behavior deserve automatic raises? No.   In 2017, an NBC affiliate identified almost 100 cases of Federal  employees viewing pornography on government computers. Should these  employees be rewarded for this behavior with automatic pay raises? No.   In 2015, DOJ's Office of Inspector General found that DEA agents  participated in sex parties in Colombia involving strippers and  prostitutes paid for by drug cartels. Does this type of conduct warrant  automatic pay raises? I don't think so.   A recent study--and this is horrible--shows that sexual harassment is  commonplace in Federal offices. One in five women have experienced  harassment in the workplace, and nearly 9 percent of male employees  report the same. It took 7 years for a former trial lawyer from the  Justice Department to win a ruling from the EEOC confirming she was  harassed by two male supervisors.   In 2018, five ICE officials told The Washington Post the agency  hadn't yet responded to sexual harassment claims they filed more than a  year ago against a manager who they said pressured them to view nude  photos.   Our disciplinary process is confidential and murky. It varies agency  by agency. We don't know how many employees have been disciplined for  sexual misconduct and still remain on the job. We have serious faults  we must address before we give across-the-board pay raises.   During consideration of this bill in Rules, there was bipartisan  sentiment to look at longstanding issues that face our civil servants.  Retention, private-sector wage comparison, and millennial recruitment  were some of those issues. But this was a hastily drafted bill, and  this is not how the process should work.                                time  1345    The American people deserve a Federal workforce with high standards  for appropriate conduct. Federal employees should feel safe and  protected doing the people's business.   Mr. Speaker, we have problems in our Federal workforce that we must  deal with before we give across-the-board pay raises.   The Republican motion to recommit protects due process rights of all  Federal employees by ensuring that only those substantiated claims for  which an employee has been disciplined will result in an employee being  ineligible for a pay raise.   It is inexcusable that the Democrat bill, as drafted, would treat  victims of sexual harassment the same as the perpetrators who may still  be drawing Federal paychecks. Taxpayer dollars should not be used to  give a pay raise to these bad actors.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this motion to recommit; and if it  fails, I urge my colleagues to vote against this flawed bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
