 Madam Speaker, it is with great honor on behalf of the  entire Louisiana delegation that we welcome Troy Carter into the  congressional delegation. Of course, for Troy, this is not his first  time in public service. In fact, he has committed his life to public  service. He served in the State legislature in the House of  Representatives, then served multiple terms on the New Orleans City  Council, and then went back to the State legislature serving as a  senator. In fact, until last week, he served with distinction in the  Louisiana State Senate.   He is replacing, of course, our dear former colleague, Cedric  Richmond, and we are proud to see Cedric make his way down Pennsylvania  Avenue to come over here to the House to be a part of this special  ceremony.   Speaking on behalf of the entire Louisiana delegation, Madam Speaker,  we look forward to continuing that great tradition as Republicans and  Democrats working together for the best interests of our great State of  Louisiana as well as for the Nation.   We welcome Troy Carter to the delegation and to the United States  Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield to Congressman Troy Carter.
