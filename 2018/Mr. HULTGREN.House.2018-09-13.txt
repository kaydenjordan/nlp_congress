 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith. I appreciate all  of his hard work and success. And I also want to thank Ranking Member  Johnson for her bipartisan work on this legislation, as well as her  work on H.R. 589 that we will be getting over the finish line a little  bit later in this series.                                time  1415    Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in the way that we are  able to ask questions and comb through data when doing complex  computational problems. Like many things we do at the Office of  Science, this endeavor requires time, effort, and commitment.   Quantum computing was first theorized in the 1980s with researchers  such as Richard Feynman, the physicist in my district I now know very  well.   While every particle physicist draws Feynman diagrams to explain the  interaction of subatomic particles, his later work in this field may  have just as lasting an impact that he has had on the field.   I am proud to represent Fermilab in my district with the Feynman  Computing Center on campus, and Fermilab is also a partner in the  Chicago Quantum Exchange with Argonne, the University of Chicago, and  other partners to further develop quantum systems outside of just  computing.   I look forward to the advancements this research will provide, but,  more importantly, the people we will be able to help.   We are getting to the point where we can actually use the reams of  data we first got out of our genome project, and our ability to better  use this and other data will help us find more targeted cures and  develop better treatments.   Similar to what we are doing in this legislation, I also want to  thank the chairman and ranking member for their efforts on the  Department of Energy Research and Innovation Act.   This legislation contains a number of sections from legislation I  introduced to improve the ability of our national labs to get ideas out  of the lab and into the private sector.   The increased flexibility this legislation gives to the labs will  allow them to better work with universities and the private sector when  there are capabilities that only exist in our labs.   These labs have been a passion of mine, with the ability to see two  of them up close in Illinois. I have seen the innovation engine they  can be, not just for our Nation, but for local and regional economies.   It is vital that we continue to support our laboratories, which host  more than 32,000 researchers from across the Nation, touching nearly,  if not every, university in the United States.   This legislation gives the Office of Science clear direction on their  mission, and I am pleased that we could work with the Senate to get  this to the President's desk after this vote series.   Again, I thank the chairman for yielding. I urge passage of these  important bills.
