 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a lifelong public  servant and valuable member of the Texas-11 team, Mrs. Jan Lentz.   For 7 years, Jan has devoted her time and talents to our district as  a constituent services aide. She previously served with the VA, West  Texas Counseling and Guidance, and many other organizations and has led  a veterans support group for over 15 years, most of this as a  volunteer.   Jan's impact on our community exceeds everything beyond words, and  her service has extended far beyond our district. She has literally  impacted thousands of lives, veteran lives and family member lives, and  so many in need in our community.   Over the years, Jan has secured countless benefits for veterans and  has impacted thousands of veteran families. Last year alone, she  returned over $100,000 in taxes back to constituents.   Jan is someone who we all wish we could be.   As she moves into the next phase of her life in retirement, we want  Jan to know that we are grateful for her service. We are grateful for  what she has done for our community, veterans, and so many people in  need.   I say thank you to Jan from the bottom of our hearts, from our team,  our district, and the State of Texas. We all wish Jan good luck in  retirement.                            ____________________
