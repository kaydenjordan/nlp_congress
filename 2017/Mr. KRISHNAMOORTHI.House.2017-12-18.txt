 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the Members of the House  will cast a vote on the tax conference committee report, the final  version of the Republican tax plan.   The Republican leadership rushed this bill to the finish line at the  expense of small-business owners and working families. I strongly urge  my colleagues to vote ``no.''   As a former small-business owner, I understand firsthand the  importance of tax simplification. Unfortunately, this bill does the  opposite: it complicates our Tax Code while giving companies fewer than  2 weeks to adjust before it goes into effect. This creates serious  uncertainty for small-business owners who create jobs and invest in our  communities.   I support reforming our Tax Code, but I ask my colleagues to stop  rushing this process and to put working families first. There is simply  too much at stake.   We can simplify our tax system without exploding the national debt  and spiking healthcare premiums. For the sake of our economy and our  future, we need to kill this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman LaHood for  organizing this Special Order. I am so honored to be a part of it.   As the Congressman mentioned, my name is Raja Krishnamoorthi, a  Congressman representing the great Eighth District of Illinois, which  are the west and northwest suburbs of Chicago   I am proud to join my colleagues tonight in celebrating Illinois'  bicentennial--the 200th year--of statehood. There is something special  in celebrating the anniversary of Illinois' entry into the Union, as it  was the State which produced the man who would save it.   I am proud to be from the Land of Lincoln, but for all of its  national and historic importance, my love of our home State is also  very personal. I did not have the honor of being born in Illinois, but  it is my home and always will be because our State welcomed my family  with open arms, as it has for so many others over the last 200 years.   You see, I was born in New Delhi, India, and when I was 3 months old,  my parents brought our family to the United States so my father could  continue his education and our family could embrace all the  opportunities of this great country.   It wasn't easy and there was struggle, but my family came to know  that the American Dream of building a better life was possible because  the people of Illinois made it so.   We had our challenges, but everything changed for the better when my  father was offered a position as an engineering professor in a  mysterious place called Peoria, Illinois. They did not know where  Peoria, Illinois, was at the time. They unfurled the map, found out  where Peoria was, packed the U-Haul in New York State, and started  driving and driving and driving. They made it to Peoria, but that was  when the golden years in our family started. That is where they  educated their two sons in wonderful public schools. That is where they  bought their first home. That is where they entered the middle class.   Every night, my father would say something at the dinner table along  the lines of: Think of the greatness of this country and of Illinois,  and make sure that the governments in both places are there for the  next families who need it.   My father began teaching. My brother and I went to school in Peoria,  and Peoria became our home. More than three decades have passed. My  father is still teaching at Bradley University, and he and my mother  still live in the house I grew up in.   Though I went away for college, I always knew where I would be when  it was time to start my own family. My wife, Priya, and I were married  in Illinois, and all three of our children are being raised there. It  will always be our home, for all the joys of the Cubs' wins and for all  the challenges of its winters.   As I look back on the opportunities my family had, that I have had,  and that my children will have, I will feel an overwhelming sense of  gratitude to Illinois.
