 Madam President, I rise to speak of a friend and colleague  whom we lost this week.   Mike Enzi, a Senator from Wyoming, retired from this body in January  of this year when his successor was seated but served here honorably  for several decades.   I think the simplest description I can give of him is that he was a  kind, good, and decent man. I worked with him on the Budget Committee,  but I got to know him best through the Wednesday morning Prayer  Breakfast, where to say he was a regular participant is an  understatement. Even after he left the Senate, he was at every single  Prayer Breakfast, including last week's, from his home in Wyoming via  Webex.   He was a devoted family man and a devoted man in the service of his  country in this body. He had a rare quality. Unfortunately, I don't  think it was all that rare some years ago, but it seems to be becoming  rarer and rarer. It is a quality my father preached to me years ago.  You can disagree without being disagreeable. That was the way he was.  He and I disagreed on a large number of matters, particularly on the  Budget Committee, but he never was overbearing; he never was  condescending; he never was harsh. It was always in the spirit of  disagreement, in good faith, based upon principle.   I want to talk about Mike Enzi, but I also want to put him in the  context of modern politics because I think there are a couple of  lessons we can learn from him to try to change the course that we seem  to have embarked upon.   One of the problems with modern American politics is, we don't have  opponents; we have enemies. We have converted those we disagree with to  people we demonize and say are bad people; they are evil. They aren't.  They have different views. They have different values. Perhaps they  have different principles. But to convert opponents into enemies is to  poison our democratic system. It is to poison our ability to work  together in the common good. If you make someone into an enemy, they  are going to be an enemy even when it comes to something where you  might agree, and Mike Enzi never did that.   One of the things Mike Enzi taught me was the 80-20 rule. We have all  heard of 80-20 rules in various contexts. His 80-20 rule was, if you  are working on a difficult public issue, work on the 80 percent where  you can agree, and put the 20 percent where you disagree aside. He was  able to do that throughout his career.   He was famous before I got here, but he was famous for working with  Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts when they were both on the HELP  Committee.   I said: Mike, how did you get along with Ted Kennedy?   He said: It was easy--80-20. We put the 20 percent aside where we  knew we were going to differ, and we worked on the 80 percent where we  could, and if everybody applied that principle around here, we would  get a lot more done.    He was also a principled Senator. Indeed, he would have been on the  floor today, making a point of order about the supplemental budget that  we just passed because he believed in the principle of the Budget Act;  he believed in the principle of balancing budgets. He was an  accountant, and he was a principled man.   And he was also decent and kind, as I mentioned, but there is one  story about him that I want to tell that has stuck with me, and I have  told it 100 times, although I never told it while he was with us. Now  that he is lost to us, I think he would be OK with my telling this  story.   I was having dinner with him one night early on when I was here in  the Senate, and he mentioned that he was concerned about the  possibility of having a primary opponent in the Republican primary in  Wyoming, and I was incredulous.   I said: Mike, you are one of most conservative Senators here. How can  somebody possibly get to your right? And here was my precise question:         What will they charge you with?    And his answer was as profound as it was disturbing. He said:         They will charge me with being reasonable.    Think about that for a minute. He was concerned about the possibility  of losing a primary election because he had been reasonable; because he  applied the 80-20 rule and tried to work together to solve problems,  even though there were disagreements on other areas. But he could  lose--he could have lost his election because he was willing to listen  to the other side, to be reasonable, to try to find accommodation, and,  yes, compromise.   And this isn't only a Republican issue; this is a growing issue  across our country in primaries, particularly in gerrymandered  districts where the primary is the election.   And we are getting a new crop of Representatives and Senators who are  coming here who have been told: Don't you dare compromise. Don't you  dare listen to those other people. You better watch whom you are having  lunch with.   I remember spending some time with our immortal Senator Margaret  Chase Smith from Maine, whom I got to know fairly well before we lost  her in the midnineties. And she said, during the McCarthy period, you  literally had to worry about whom you had lunch with in the Senate  dining room. Because of guilt by association, you would be associated  with some liberal Senator.   We don't want that to be the case. It shouldn't be the case. But if  you can lose a primary because you are viewed as someone who is willing  to compromise, whether you are getting that primary from the left or  from the right, imagine what it does to our ability to get things done.   If people come here knowing that one of the ways they can jeopardize  their career is by listening to the other side, trying to get to know  what is going on on the other side and compromising to get something  done, it is paralysis. It is one of the reasons we are in paralysis.   Mike Enzi said:         They are going to charge me with being reasonable.    I think this is one of the hidden problems in American politics  today. It is not what your position is on abortion  [[Page S5162]]  or gun rights or foreign policy or any other--immigration--it is  whether you are willing to talk to the other side, listen, and try to  get to a compromise to solve a problem. That can cost you your seat.  What a pernicious doctrine. What a dangerous situation.   Democracy is built upon compromise. We have 535 people in this  building. We are going to have 535 different viewpoints, interests. We  represent different States, different areas. We have different  principles. We have different values. We have got to compromise,  otherwise it is just perennial gridlock, which, by the way, our  constituents hate.   When I talk to people in Maine, what they most--the biggest question  I get is, Why can't you people work together? Why can't you get  anything done? Why can't you talk to one another and sit down and break  bread together and solve problems?   This idea of not being able to compromise--this body is a product of  compromise. At the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the debate almost  fell apart on the issue of representation.   There was the large State plan and the small State plan, and the  worry was, if it was only one body of the legislature, that the big  States with more population would overrun the smaller States. They  couldn't figure out what to do, and finally one of the delegates from  Connecticut proposed what was called the Great Compromise, which was  the invention of the U.S. Senate.   This body itself is built on compromise. But there is no human  problem that can be solved without compromise. Nobody has it all right.  Nobody has all the answers. No party has all the answers. No group of  people have all the answers. You always are better off listening to  other people, debating, and coming to some consensus solution.   I have a friend in Maine who has a big sign in his office that says:  ``All of us are always smarter than any of us.'' And I think that is a  profound observation. It means that there is wisdom throughout this  room and throughout this body and that we have to tackle these  difficult problems--difficult, challenging problems that we have using  all the wisdom that we could possibly get our hands on, and that means  listening to other people even though we may not agree with them.   I just sat and listened to the Senator from Oklahoma make an  impassioned and, I think, powerful statement about immigration. He  raised questions in my mind that I want answers to. That is the way  this place is supposed to work   But if I can't go back to Maine--if I can't go back and admit I  listened to the Senator today and he raised questions that bothered me,  if I can't say that, if that in itself would endanger my career, then  if people are coming here fearing that kind of being locked out, we  will never get anything done.   So, to me, Mike Enzi was a hero and a model--and a model of the kind  of person that we need in this body. I didn't agree with him on a lot  of issues, but he was always willing to listen.   And I did agree with him. There was some measurable percentage--I  don't know, 10, 20, 30 percent--where we did agree, and he was a very  effective ally because he was so respected here because people knew  that he made his own decisions.   And we need more people like him, and we need to remember the  principle that he shared with us, which is be reasonable.   When we are in a place where being reasonable is an offense that can  cost you your job, we are in real trouble as a country. We are in real  trouble as a democracy.   It is hard enough in a democracy to make decisions and to get things  done. That is inherent in our system. The Framers wanted to design a  system that was difficult and cumbersome to operate, and they succeeded  beyond their wildest dreams.   But it was always based upon a principle of listening, of debating,  of changing minds, and, yes, of compromising.   So I want to pay tribute to Mike Enzi today not only because, as I  said, he was a kind, good, and decent man, but because I think he was  an example of the kind of people that we need here and the way we  should conduct ourselves and the way we should do our work.   And we also have to talk to our constituents and say to them: You  have to let me listen to the other side. You have to give me a little  space to try to do something good. It may not be perfect. It may not be  just what you like. But it may be what we need. It may be the best we  can do in a pluralistic, democratic system, where people have different  outlooks, viewpoints, values, and priorities.   So we lost a great man this week. We lost a great person. We lost a  great Senator. We lost a great friend. We will miss him.   I miss not only Mike and that great smile, but I miss what he stood  for, the way he conducted himself, the way he treated his fellow  Senators and everyone that he encountered.   Mike Enzi was a great man. I hope we can live up to his example.   I yield the floor.
