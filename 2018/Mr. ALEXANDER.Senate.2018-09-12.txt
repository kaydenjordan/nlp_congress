 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each, and I ask consent to speak for as  long as I may require.    Mr. President, Boy Scouts shouldn't get a merit badge  for telling the truth, and Senators shouldn't get an award for passing  an appropriations bill, because that is what we are supposed to do. But  it is worth noting that for the first time in at least 10 years, these  appropriations bills that we just passed are on time and within the  budget Congress has set.   With this vote today, we are moving toward restoring the practice of  regular order in the Senate from start to finish. This is what the  right way means: hearings--we held three. Mark up the bills--all 12  bills are completed before the Fourth of July recess. Consult with  other Senators--in the case of the Energy and Water appropriations  bills, 87 Senators, we believe, had their wishes reflected in our bill.  Floor debate, amendment votes, then a conference committee, and then we  had the vote today.  [[Page S6149]]    I look forward to President Trump signing these appropriations bills  into law. They will help to keep our country first in science,  technology, and supercomputing, and they will build the ports and  waterways that create jobs.   This bill supports funding for several important agencies, including  the Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of Energy, the National  Nuclear Security Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the  Bureau of Reclamation, and regional commissions, including the  Appalachian Regional Commission and the Delta Regional Authority.   The amount of funding in the bill is also consistent with spending  caps agreed to as part of the bipartisan budget agreement. It sets  priorities while reducing unnecessary spending.    Let me start with the Army Corps of Engineers, which affects the  lives of almost every American. Based upon the appropriations request  we received, this is the most popular agency in the budget. The Corps  maintains our inland waterways; it deepens and keeps our ports open; it  looks after our recreational waters and lands; it manages our rivers to  prevent flooding; its dams provide emission-free, renewable  hydroelectric energy. The bill restores $2.3 billion that was cut from  the President's budget request, bringing the Corps' budget up to $6.999  billion--a new record level of funding in a regular appropriations  bill.   For the fifth consecutive year, the bill makes full use of the Inland  Waterways Trust Fund revenues for water infrastructure projects,  including up to $117.7 million to continue construction of Chickamauga  Lock in Chattanooga and $2.125 million for dredging at Memphis Harbor  McKellar Lake.   The bill also provides funding that exceeds the Harbor Maintenance  Trust Fund, a spending target established by the Water Resources and  Development Act of 2014. This is the fifth consecutive year that the  bill has met or exceeded the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund spending  targets, which is necessary to adequately fund our Nation's harbors,  including Mobile Harbor in Alabama, Savannah Harbor in Georgia, Long  Beach Harbor in California, and many others across the country.   For the Department of Energy, for the fourth consecutive year, we  have included record funding levels in a regular appropriations bill  for the following activities: No. 1, for the Department's Office of  Science. This is the Nation's largest support of research in the  physical sciences. It is funded at $6.5 billion, a new record funding  level. The Office of Science provides funding for our 17 national  laboratories--I call them our secret weapons--including the Oak Ridge  National Laboratory. No other country has anything like them.   Let's take supercomputing. The bill provides a total of $1.6 billion  for high performance computing, including $935 million within the  Office of Science and $723 million within the National Nuclear Security  Administration. This includes $6.76 million to deliver at least one  exascale machine in 2021 to reassert U.S. leadership in the critical  area of supercomputing.   This accomplishment is not the result of 1 year of funding, but of 10  years of bipartisan effort through three different administrations,  Democrat and Republican, to try to make sure that the United States is  first in the world in supercomputing. We continue to do that in this  appropriations bill.   Nuclear power is our best source of inexpensive, carbon-free baseload  power. It is important for national security and competitiveness.  Nuclear power provides 20 percent of our Nation's electricity and more  than half of our carbon-free electricity. The Nuclear Regulatory  Commission, which oversees our 99 nuclear power reactors, is also  funded in this bill. We wanted to make sure it is prepared to review  applications for new reactors, particularly small modular reactors and  advanced reactors, and to extend the licenses of existing nuclear  reactors, if it is the safe thing to do.   The bill also provides $47 million for research and development at  the Department of Energy to support existing reactors, $27 million for  the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors, and $30  million for the Transformational Challenge Reactor.   It advances efforts to clean up hazardous materials at Cold War-era  sites. The bill provides $7.2 billion to support cleanup efforts, which  is $578 million above the President's budget request.   A key pillar of our national defense is a strong nuclear deterrent.  That is in this appropriations bill, as well, including $11.1 billion  for weapons activities within the NNSA, including nearly $2 billion for  six life extension programs, which fix or replace components in weapons  systems to make sure they are safe and reliable. Congress must maintain  a safe and effective nuclear weapons stockpile and keep big  construction projects on time and on budget.   I want to compliment Senator Feinstein, of California, my partner on  the Energy and Water Subcommittee. We worked hard together on all  aspects of this bill, but especially on keeping those big construction  projects on time and on budget.   A principal reason the United States produces 24 percent of all the  money in the world for just 5 percent of the people in the world is the  extraordinary concentration of brain power in the United States  supported by Federal dollars through our National Laboratories, the  National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and  other agencies. It is important that the American people know that the  Republican majority in Congress worked together with Democrats to  provide record levels of funding for science, research, and technology.   I would state to all of those who might not have noticed this quiet  new development that Congress is funding science and research at record  levels, and if we continue to do so, we will make America more  competitive and help spur innovation and create good-paying jobs.   A lot of hard work went into these negotiations over the last several  months. Our staff members have worked over weekends and over vacations  to make that happen, including the last few days. On my staff were  Tyler Owens, Adam DeMella, Meyer Seligman, Jen Armstrong, Molly Marsh,  and Rachel Littleton; on Senator Feinstein's staff, Doug Clapp, Chris  Hanson, Samantha Nelson; and on Senator Shelby's staff, Shannon Hines,  Jonathan Graffeo, and David Adkins. I am deeply grateful to them for  their professionalism and their bipartisan work.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now I would like to say a word about  legislation that the majority leader, Senator McConnell, has described  as landmark legislation, which I expect the Senate to move to early  next week, and that is the legislation dealing with the most serious  public health epidemic in America today, the opioid crisis.   We will be voting on the Opioid Crisis Response Act. This landmark  legislation is the work of five different committees in the Senate.  More than 70 Senators--half Republican, half Democrat--have provisions  in this bill.   A big bill is hard to talk about, so let me just mention 10 key  provisions: first, Senator Portman's STOP Act to stop illegal drugs,  including fentanyl, at the border coming through the mail; second, new  nonaddictive painkillers, research and fast-track. I call this the holy  grail of the opioids crisis because 100 million Americans hurt. They  have pain; 25 million have chronic pain. They need help, and we need  new nonaddictive treatments to help them. Blister packs for opioids,  such as a 3 to 5 days' supply--we authorized the FDA to require  manufacturers to do that. More medication-assisted treatment,  preventing doctor shopping by improving State prescription drug  monitoring programs, and more behavioral and mental health providers.  No. 7, support for comprehensive opioid recovery centers; No. 8, help  for babies born in opioid withdrawal; No. 9, help for mothers with  opioid use disorders, addicted to opioids; and No. 10, more early  intervention with vulnerable children who have experienced trauma.  Those are 10 of the 70 provisions that change the authorizing law, but  in addition to that, we have placed unprecedented amounts of Federal  dollars toward the opioid crisis.   In March, in the omnibus bill, Congress and the President directed  $4.7 billion toward the opioid crisis. Tomorrow, the conference  committee considering the Labor, Health, and Human  [[Page S6150]]  Services, and Education Appropriations bill will meet. When that  appropriations bill is approved, as we expect and hope it will be by  the end of the month, that is another $3.7 billion. So that is $8.4  billion in the last few months that will have been directed toward the  opioid crisis.   We have had seven hearings in our committee on opioids. On June 14,  Becky Savage talked to us about two of her sons. She lost both of them  after they accidentally overdosed on a combination of alcohol and  opioids that they took in their own home after a graduation party.   At our hearing, Becky Savage said:         How could two boys who have always seemed to make good       decisions in life make a choice that would ultimately cost       them their lives? [H]ow did someone's prescription end up in       the pocket of a teenager at a graduation party?    Nick and Jack were just two of the 33,000 Americans who died in 2015  from an opioid overdose, according to the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention. By 2016, the number had increased to 42,000 Americans.  We suspect those numbers are even higher now. Last year, 1,776  Tennesseans died of a drug overdose, according to the Tennessee  Department of Health, up from 1,630 the year before. We know that the  opioid crisis is ravaging virtually every American community.   Becky Savage's story was just one of the heartbreaking stories the  Senate HELP Committee heard last year in our seven hearings. Senator  Isakson in Georgia told us of waking up to answer a phone call at 3  a.m. in December of 2016. His son John called to tell Senator Isakson  that his grandson had passed away from an opioid overdose.   We heard Dr. Omar Abubaker, who lost his youngest son, Adam, 21 years  old, after he overdosed on a mixture of heroin and benzodiazepines. At  our hearing he said, ``Since my son's death 3 years ago, more than  165,000 other parents in this country have experienced the same  agony.''   I imagine every Senator has heard heartbreaking stories of how the  opioid crisis has impacted patients and children, doctors and nurses,  entire communities in our States.   But at our hearings, we also heard stories of hope. Jessica Hulsey  Nickel knows ``firsthand the devastating impact that addiction can have  on families,'' having lost both of her parents to addiction. Jessica  has since dedicated her life to helping others battling the same  disease.   Trish Tanner, the chief pharmacy officer at Ballad Health in Johnson  City, TN, lost her nephew Dustin to an opioid overdose. As part of an  executive fellowship program, she worked on a project on ways to reduce  opioid prescribing, saying that ``as Dustin's aunt and as a pharmacist,  I have a duty and a desire to bring about change now.''   To spread awareness and tell the story of losing her two sons, Becky  Savage and her husband have created the 525 Foundation in memory of  Nick and Jack. When she testified before our committee, Becky told us  that ``you could have heard a pin drop in many of the auditoriums I  speak in.'' After hearing her story, you could hear a pin drop in our  committee room as well.   The challenge of solving the opioid crisis has been often been  described as needing a moonshot. I wish we could do that. I wish we  could appoint a single agency in Washington to solve this problem in  every community in America, but what we have found is that will not  work. Solving the opioid crisis might require the energy and resources  of a moonshot, but ultimately it is not something that can be solved by  a single agency here. What the Federal Government can do is create an  environment so that everyone--Governors, mayors, judges, counselors,  law enforcement, doctors, nurses, and families like the Savages--can  succeed in fighting the crisis.   This is a package of more than 70 proposals from nearly three- quarters of the Members of the U.S. Senate--72 Members--that includes  the work of five committees: the HELP Committee that I chair, the  Finance, Judiciary, Commerce, and Banking Committees.   Since last October, the Senate HELP Committee, which I chair and  Senator Patty Murray of Washington is the ranking member of, has held  seven hearings on the opioid crisis. We heard from Governors, from  doctors, from addiction experts, family members, and others on how the  Federal Government can be the best possible partner as we work to solve  the crisis.   We took the input we heard at the first six hearings, and we turned  it into a draft package of proposals, which Senator Murray and I  released on April 5. On April 11, we held our seventh hearing to review  the draft proposal. On April 17, we introduced an updated package of 40  proposals, based on the feedback we heard at the seventh hearing. On  April 24, the Senate Health Committee voted 23 to 0 to pass this  legislation, which included proposals from 38 different Senators.   Because this crisis is so widespread, the Finance, Judiciary,  Commerce, and Banking Committees also have been working on their  contributions to this bill.   On May 22, the Commerce Committee passed two provisions; May 24, the  Judiciary passed six; June 12, the Finance Committee offered 22 more  provisions. We have also included a provision that the Banking  Committee has been working on.   Senator Murray and I have since worked with Senators Hatch, Grassley,  Thune, Wyden, Feinstein, and Nelson to combine all of these proposals,  along with other proposals, such as Senator Portman's STOP Act, into  one package of legislation--the Opioid Crisis Response Act. We thank  all of them.   Over 20 Senators contributed to the Finance Committee provisions, 25  to the Judiciary provisions, and 7 to the Commerce Committee's  provisions. I think it is a testament to just how far-reaching this  crisis is and why we feel a sense of bipartisan urgency in passing this  legislation in the Senate and in the Congress.   In June the House of Representatives passed its own package of  legislation to fight the opioid crisis by a vote of 396 to 14. The  Senate and House staff combined our legislation and what the House has  passed, and we believe it will produce an even stronger bill to fight  the crisis.   My hope is that the five Senate committees will work quickly with our  House colleagues to reach an agreement by September 21, so the House  can pass a final opioids package, the Senate can pass it, and we can  send it to the President's desk as quickly as possible. That is the  bipartisan sense of urgency I feel so that we can help States and  communities fight the opioid crisis.   This act builds on the work already done--the Comprehensive Addiction  and Recovery Act, or CARA, passed in 2016, which gave a substantial  boost to States on the frontlines, providing grants to expand access to  lifesaving opioid overdose reversal medications and to support State  efforts to help individuals.   Later in 2016, Congress enacted the 21st Century Cures Act, which  included $1 billion over 2 years in State grants to fight the crisis.  It sought to accelerate research for major discoveries, like new  nonaddictive pain medicines, which, as I mentioned, I believe is the  Holy Grail of solving the opioid crisis.   Then, the omnibus appropriations bill in March provided $4.7 billion  of funding, and $1 billion of that is for grants. We believe another  $3.7 billion is coming from the Labor, Health and Human Services, and  Education Appropriations bill, which we hope to pass this month.   According to Senator Blunt, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations  subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related  Agencies, Federal funding to help combat the opioid epidemic has  increased nearly 1,300 percent over the past 4 years. The bill we are  voting on next week builds on this funding.   So we will be passing the STOP Act, new nonaddictive painkillers,  blister packs for opioids, more medication-assisted treatment, and  efforts to prevent doctor shopping, to provide more behavioral and  mental health providers, to support comprehensive opioid recovery  centers, and to provide help for babies born in opioid withdrawal, help  for mothers with opioid use disorders, and more early intervention with  vulnerable children who have experienced trauma. These are just a  portion of the more than 70 provisions in the Opioid Crisis Response  Act.   This is, as the majority leader, Senator McConnell, has said,  ``landmark legislation'' that represents the work  [[Page S6151]]  of nearly three-fourths of the Senate, five committees, and countless  staff who have worked to try to help States and communities put an end  to this crisis that is ravaging virtually every community in America.   The House of Representatives has passed its version. We have our  bipartisan urgency to work together. No mother should have to go  through what Becky Savage has gone through. It is time to finish our  work and help States and communities bring an end to the opioid crisis.  This legislation would give us many of the tools we need to do just  that.   I yield the floor.
