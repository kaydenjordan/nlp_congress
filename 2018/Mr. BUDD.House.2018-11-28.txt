 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado,  Doug Lamborn, for yielding. He is one of the buckles of the Bible Belt  in Colorado and in our country, and I thank him for this time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the 77th annual National Bible Week,  as so many of my colleagues are doing this evening.   The late Reverend Billy Graham from my home State of North Carolina  was put to rest just down this hallway earlier this year. We are  grateful for his life and for what he meant to our home State in North  Carolina. He said: ``Being a Christian is more than just an  instantaneous conversion. It is a daily process whereby you grow to be  more and more like Christ.''   Well, what does the daily process that Reverend Graham is referring  to here look like? And how do we obtain a life that looks more and more  like Christ daily?   I believe the answer is found, in part, by daily thought and  meditation on the Word of God, and I wholeheartedly believe 2 Timothy  3:16 and 17, that says: ``All Scripture is breathed out by God and  profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training  in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for  every good work.''   We also know that the Word of God is alive, so my colleagues have  referred to this verse in Hebrews 4:12, which says: ``For the word of  God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it  penetrates even to dividing soul and the spirit, joints and marrow; it  judges the thoughts and the attitudes of the heart.''                                time  1815    I could go on and on. But, again, I want to say how important this  book is to me. For those who are in need of strength and direction, if  they went to the middle, they will find the Psalms. If they go just to  the right, they will find the Proverbs.   Proverbs 3:5-6: ``Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not  lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and  He will make straight your paths.''   Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado for this Special  Order.
