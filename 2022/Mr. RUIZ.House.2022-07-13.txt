 Madam Speaker, once again, we stand at the precipice of  making a monumental change in the lives of our servicemen and  servicewomen and veterans.   Yet, here we are voting on the Honoring our PACT Act for the third  time because of a Senate technical issue. Enough is enough. Our  veterans do not have time for technicalities. Their lives are literally  on the line.   As a cofounder of the bipartisan, bicameral Burn Pits Caucus, I have  spent years fighting to ensure that our veterans exposed to toxins from  burn pits get the care and benefits they need and deserve.    My bill, the Presumptive Benefits for War Fighters Exposed to Burn  Pits and Other Toxins Act is the foundation that the Honoring our PACT  Act is built on. It removes the burden from the veterans to prove that  23 illnesses or conditions--including various cancers--that they are  suffering from are due to their service near burn pits.   Madam Speaker, I implore the House to pass this fix to the Senate's  blue slip error, and I urge the Senate to pass the Honoring our PACT  Act immediately. Our veterans' lives are on the line.
