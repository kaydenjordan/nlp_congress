 Mr. President, earlier this month, Zaila Avant-garde  became the first Black American to win the Scripps National Spelling  Bee. It is kind of discouraging in the year 2021 that barrier still  needed breaking.   Her achievement is an inspiration for so many students around the  country. She drew strength and courage from another trailblazer who had  gotten significant less attention, whose story has not been told and  honored the way that Zaila was.   In 1936, 13-year-old MacNolia Cox from Akron, OH, became one of the  first two Black students to compete in the National Spelling Bee. She  qualified after winning the regional competition that went 60--6-0-- rounds, sponsored by the Akron Beacon Journal. Black communities across  the country cheered her victory. They looked forward to her joining the  national competition. She was celebrated at churches and clubs, talked  about by celebrities, and even politicians. At the RKO Palace in  Cleveland, band leader Fats Waller, tap dancer Bill Robinson, whom we  know, whom history knows as Mr. Bojangles, brought her on stage.   Three thousand Ohioans came to Akron's Union Station to send MacNolia  off on her journey to Washington. She had little idea the treatment she  would endure at the tip of the Jim Crow South. She was forced to ride-- she is, essentially, Ohio's representative at the National Spelling  Bee, a 13-year-old Black--I was going to say Black young woman--Black  girl from Ohio. She was forced to ride in segregated train cars. She  was forced to stay at a private home instead of at the Willard hotel.   Nine years later, my parents--my dad came from overseas, my mom from  Mansfield, GA--met at the Willard hotel at the end of his service in  World War II.   She could not stay at the Willard hotel because she was African  American, while all the other White competitors did. At a dinner for  the finalists, she and her mother were forced to enter through the  kitchen door of the hotel and sit at a separate table segregated from  the other finalists. How shameful that was.   Despite it all, MacNolia Cox made it far in the competition. There  were only five students left when the judges gave her a proper noun to  spell. She hadn't studied it. Proper nouns were supposed to be off  limits. The judges had had enough of a Black girl getting that far.  They wouldn't listen to the Beacon Journal reporter, who covered her to  report on the competition. She pointed out to the judges that the  judges--the judges--weren't following their own rules. She was  eliminated. Of course, she was. Her achievements, her story soon faded  from memory until now.   Zaila Avant-garde talked to the media about scrolling through  pictures of national spelling bee contestants with her father, seeing  face after face that didn't look like hers.   It reminds me, yesterday, I had breakfast with the Secretary of the  Treasury at the Treasury Department. To get to her office--her office,  ``her,'' I reiterate--you walk down a long, long, long hallway. Every  picture in the hallway are people who look like me. They were  Secretaries of the  [[Page S5036]]  Treasury. Every single Secretary of the Treasury, until Janet Yellen,  looked like--well, older, certainly, than the Presiding Officer--but  looked like we do.   She saw MacNolia Cox's face, and she learned her story as she was  looking through these. She told reporters when she was competing, she  thought of MacNolia. She thought about what she had endured 85 years  earlier.   Now, more Americans are learning both of their stories. More kids are  seeing themselves in the faces of champions. That is why Black history  matters. It matters in the classroom. It matters in movies. It matters  on the Senate floor. It matters in books. It matters in TV shows. It  matters in the national news. It is how we shine a light on the  injustices students like MacNolia and Zaila had to overcome and work to  fight them.   It is how we show kids that these are dreams--these aren't dreams  only for certain kids who look a certain way. These dreams, these  aspirations, these achievements in 21st century America should be for  everyone.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Akron's MacNolia Cox, and  even more importantly, telling her story for future generations                            ____________________     Mr. President, over the past week, we have put money  directly--directly--in the pockets of the families of 60 million  American children.   In Ohio, 2.1 million children, their families got hundreds of dollars  each in tax cuts, money to help them keep up with the costs of raising  a family, money they will spend in the local economy--I say to the  Presiding Officer, you know this, the largest tax cut for working  families in American history ever.   Stories have poured into our office from across Ohio--the Presiding  Officer is hearing those in Hawaii--all from parents who work hard to  make ends meet. They now have a little bit extra of their own money  back to spend on groceries and childcare and medical bills and school  supplies.   We care about families. There is a lot of talk in this body about we  care about families. Well, if you care about families, this is all  about empowering families. Families decide how to spend these dollars;  Mitch McConnell doesn't decide. Joe Biden doesn't decide. Brian Schatz  doesn't decide. I don't decide how we spend these dollars. Families  decide. They are dollars they have earned working hard to provide for  their family--it is hard work raising children--and how they have  raised their kids.   I think all of us are hearing these stories. Some of them on our  websites, some of us in townhalls, we are hearing these stories. Let me  just briefly tell just a handful of them.   Rob, from Copley, OH, said he is going to spend it on ``bills and  necessities, especially necessities for [my] kids.''   Traci said she is going to use it to ``pay for my children's sports  fees.''   One mother said, ``My 8-year-old was able to attend a Coding Camp  this week'' for the first time. She was just thrilled.   We know how expensive healthcare is. We know how medical bills and  copays and premiums eat away at families' budgets. So many parents have  talked about how this will help them afford healthcare expenses.   Leanne, from Akron, is going to be able to afford ``my daughter's  medical bills.''   Hayley said she will use the tax cut ``to pay for speech therapy for  [her] child.''   Susan said it will allow her to ``pay for my child's dyslexia  tutoring.''   Jen said, ``Ours will be going straight''--you have to love this  one--``Ours will be going straight to the orthodontist each month.''   Brittney wrote that this tax cut ``came at a great time.'' She said:         My son got sick with pneumonia this . . . week. That led to       an urgent care visit, breathing treatment, chest X-rays, and       a lot of medicine--so our payment will go to [emergency]       medical bills to make sure our son [can thrive] and has the       medicine he needs.    The Presiding Officer may remember that there were two votes on the  child tax credit. First, an amendment to take it out--every Republican  voted to take it out--and then an amendment to pass the bill on March 6  at about this time of day and every Republican voted against it. I know  it is all about tax cuts for rich people for them, but we can get to  that later.   We know another benefit of this is, this is money spent in  communities. I am not getting any notes from parents saying: ``You  know, thank you, Senator Brown, for this child tax credit you have been  working on for a decade. I am going to put more money in my Swiss bank  account.'' Nobody is saying that. We have gotten so many stories  already how this money supports the economy and supports jobs.   Katie from Brecksville: Month 1, she is using it for ``a much-needed  family vacation.'' Month 2, she is using it for ``school supplies.''  That supports hotel jobs and restaurants jobs and retail jobs.   Lyndsay said she had used it for ``back to school clothes,'' again,  supporting local retailers.   Brittany from Butler said: ``We will be able to put new windows in  the kids' bedrooms that will keep them cooler in the summer and warmer  in the winter.'' That sounds like work for a local handyman or a woman  or a window business.   Lisa said she is spending it on ``diapers and school supplies . . .  we put a little into starting a 529 college fund.''   Think about that. These families are struggling. I don't know for  sure, but sounds like Lisa may have a couple of children, so she gets  this--they are little, so she is going to get $300 per child. So she  gets $600 July 15. She will get $600 August 15. She will get $600  September 15. She will get $600 October 15 and November 15. And she has  decided she can now afford a few things she couldn't afford. But she is  going to maybe put $100 of that every month into a 529 college fund so  her child will be--the whole idea of infrastructure is building a base,  a foundation, to launch children into better lifestyles, to launch  children into a more productive life, to give kids opportunity. That is  what this does. That is what the child tax credit does. And it is  almost everybody.   Ninety-two percent of Ohio kids' families are getting a tax cut every  single month. So many parents mention the costs of childcare. So often,  over and over, we hear how this will allow parents to afford the  childcare that allows them to go to work.   Courtney, a mother, wrote that her tax cut is already more than  half--``slightly more than half the cost of part-time daycare tuition  per month here in Athens,'' down in southeast Ohio. She said, it is  appreciated so much, the ``help getting my child back into childcare  and keeping me and my husband in the workforce.''   So it comes back to one question--I think the Presiding Officer knows  this--whose side are you on? Whose side are you on in these fights? Are  you on the side of the parents who work hard every day for their  families?   In a dignity-of-work roundtable in our Senate Banking Committee, a  woman from West Virginia said the words ``working'' and ``poor''  shouldn't be in the same sentence. The words ``working'' and ``poor''  shouldn't be in the same sentence. These are families who are working  really hard. Give them a little bit of a break so they can rise above  the poverty line so they can afford some things to launch their  children into more productive lives.   So are you on the side of these parents who work every day? Or are my  colleagues going to raise these families' taxes at the end of the year?  Because this expires next year, if we don't continue it. I haven't seen  any help yet on their side wanting to come in. I am still hopeful.   We remember what happened on 2017. The Presiding Officer remembers  this. In 2017, you could walk out this door pretty much any time of  day, and you could look down the hall in 2017, and you could see  lobbyists lined up outside of Mitch McConnell's office, all well  dressed, all really, really well paid, all hat in hand--some literally,  some figuratively--saying: Senator McConnell, we need this additional  tax break.   Do you know what? We spend $1.5 trillion on that tax cut. They don't  want to spend $100 billion a year on these children. One hundred  billion is--I should do the math really quick--about 8 percent of $1.5  trillion, something like that--6 percent. So they will  [[Page S5037]]  do $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. Seventy percent of it went to the richest  people in the country. Yet they don't want to do tax cuts for children  that elicit these stories.   I don't recall, getting on my website, stories saying: You know,  thank you, Senator Brown--even though I voted against it--thank you for  that big tax cut back in 2017. I could buy another yacht, thank you. Or  I get to go to Europe again, thank you.   We don't hear those stories. Here are the stories you hear about  these children who need that tax cut.   So you will remember when they all lined up outside of our colleague  Senator McConnell's office. You will remember that tax cut. They  promised it would trickle down to everyone else and then it would  create all this prosperity. Well, we know it didn't happen. They kept  the money for themselves--no shock there. Corporations turned around  and spent that money on--shocking--stock buybacks for their executives.  They ended up, always, in the pockets of their executives.    Now, this year, without a single vote from Republicans in Congress,  who passed tax cuts for everyone else, a pretty simple contrast: tax  cuts for billionaires and corporations--thank you very much--as they  line up down the hall, or do you want tax cuts for working families?   Every single month, we show parents and workers, every single month  these checks are coming: $300 per child if your child is from newborn  to 5, $250 a month if your child is from 6 to 17. Every single month,  we show we are on your side. We are putting more of your own money back  into your pockets.   I know the Presiding Officer joins in this. We will not stop fighting  to make sure parents' hard work pays off. We will not stop. We will  deliver on this.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
