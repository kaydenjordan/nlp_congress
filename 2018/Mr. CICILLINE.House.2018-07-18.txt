 Mr. Speaker, later today the House will vote on a  spending bill for the Department of the Interior. This bill is a  travesty that will do enormous damage to our environment. It cuts  critical funding that keeps our air clean and our water safe.   This bill eliminates $100 million in funding from the Environmental  Protection Agency, $65 million from the Land and Water Conservation  Fund, and $150 million from both the Clean Water State Revolving Fund  and the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. It will make it more  difficult to protect some bodies of water from pollution and endangered  species from extinction.   Perhaps most troubling of all, it actually eliminates protections  that help keep lead out of our water.   A vote for this bill is a vote to make our air more dangerous to  breathe and our water less safe to drink. It is a reckless bill that  should be opposed by all Members of this body.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and to oppose this  and to protect the quality of our air, our water, and our environment.  Our constituents are depending upon us.                            ____________________     Point of parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, does the vote on the matter pending  before us include restoration of funding to protect our elections from  Russian interference?    I am sorry, Mr. Speaker?    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the rule  in order to make the Quigley amendment in order to restore urgently  needed funds to prevent Russian interference in our upcoming elections.   And I would just ask the gentleman from Washington if he would yield  for purposes of considering this unanimous consent amendment so that we  can, together, Democrats and Republicans, work together to protect the  integrity of our elections. Restore funding so we can look our voters  in the face and say, ``Your vote counted. We are going to protect it  from Russian interference.''   I am imploring my friend on the other side of the aisle to permit  this unanimous consent question so we can restore this urgent funding.  This shouldn't be a Republican or a Democratic issue. It is an American  issue. This is the integrity of our democracy.   Will the gentleman yield to a unanimous consent request?    Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleague be permitted to  answer the question. I have asked him will he yield.    I have asked the gentleman from Washington: Will he  yield?    * * *.
