 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Iowa.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for  myself and Senator Lankford.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senators Ernst and  Lankford is for the counsel for the President:         Members of the House Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence, of which Manager Schiff sits as Chairman,       conducted a number of depositions related to this impeachment       inquiry. One of the individuals deposed was Intelligence       Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Has the White       House been provided a copy of this deposition transcript? Do       you believe this transcript would be helpful? If so, why?     =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S732, January 30, 2020, first and second columns, the  following appears: Members of the House Permanent Select Committee  on Intelligence, of which Manager SCHIFF sits as Chairman,  conducted a number of depositions related to this impeachment  inquiry. One of the individuals deposed was the Intelligence  Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Has the White House  been provided a copy of this deposition transcript? Do believe  this transcript would be helpful? If so, why?      The online Record has been corrected to read: Members of the  House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, of which Manager  SCHIFF sits as Chairman, conducted a number of depositions related  to this impeachment inquiry. One of the individuals deposed was  Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson. Has the  White House been provided a copy of this deposition transcript? Do  you believe this transcript would be helpful? If so, why?    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senator, thank you for  that question.   We have not been provided that transcript. My understanding is that  the inspector general for the intelligence community, Mr. Atkinson,  testified in executive session, and HPSCI has retained that transcript  in executive session and was not transmitted to the House Judiciary  Committee, and, therefore, under the terms of H. Res. 660, was not  turned over to the White House counsel, so we have not seen it.   I just want to clarify: We don't think there is any need to start  getting into more evidence or witnesses, but if one were to start going  down that road, I think that that transcript could be relevant because  it is my understanding, from public reports, that there were questions  asked of the inspector general about his interactions with the  whistleblower, and there is some question in public reports about  whether the whistleblower was entirely truthful with the inspector  general on the forms that were filled out and whether or not, you know,  there were certain representations made about whether or not there had  been any contact with Congress, and that then ties into the contact  that the whistleblower apparently had with the staff and committee,  which we also don't know about.   So if we were to go down the road, we don't think it necessary. We  think that this--these Articles of Impeachment should be rejected. But  if one were to go down the road with any more evidence or witnesses, it  would certainly be relevant to find out what the inspector general of  the intelligence community had to say about the whistleblower, along  with the other issues that we mentioned about the whistleblower's bias,  motivation: What were his connections with the whole situation of the  Bidens? And, apparently, if he worked with Vice President Biden, did he  work--he worked on Ukraine issues, according to public reports--how  does that all tie in? All of those things would become relevant in that  instance. Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
