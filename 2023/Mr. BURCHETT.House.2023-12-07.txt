 Mr. Speaker, the United States provides a lot of  foreign aid to a lot of countries. It is important that we make sure  that money is being spent wisely.   The Biden administration has not taken this responsibility seriously  at all, Mr. Speaker. The White House is currently pushing to send  billions of dollars to Ukraine, even though we have already allocated  over $110 billion to Ukraine and have no way of knowing where that  money really ends up.   We also have sent nearly $2 billion to Afghanistan since our botched  withdrawal in 2021, even though we know a lot of that money ends up in  the hands of the Taliban.   I asked an expert witness in a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing if  there is any way the United States can provide aid to Afghanistan  without any of it falling in the hands of the Taliban, and he said no.   Yet, when the president of Guatemala specifically requested aid to  help block off one of the most popular travel routes for illegal  immigrants coming to the United States, the Biden administration  refused to help.   It is pretty apparent to me, Mr. Speaker, that this administration  has its foreign aid priorities all out of order.   It needs to get serious about addressing issues that affect the  American people, like our illegal immigration crisis, instead of trying  to send billions of unchecked dollars to Ukraine and the Taliban.                            ____________________
