 Mr. Speaker, our immigrants have always been our  future. Wave after wave of moral, patriotic, hardworking, and law- abiding immigrants have kept America vibrant. Today, the majority party  intends to put another 2 to 3 million people on the path to  citizenship.   I think it is accurate to say that America does want some form of  relief for some DACA folks and some way to make them made legal, but  this bill would do a lot. This bill, in my mind, would ruin America.   First of all, I think America would want to restrict this bill to the  law-abiding, including law-abiding DACA folks. This bill does not do  that. You can commit two crimes and still be here. You can be on a list  of gang members and still be here.   As far as self-supporting, this bill doesn't begin to deal with the  problem of people who are already taking advantage of our generous  welfare safety net. They are going to be staying here under this bill.   Like I said, you can already be on a variety of public assistance  programs; it is not dealt with. You can be a bad role model for your  kids; it is not dealt with. You don't have to learn English.   People always say: Oh, all the DACA members all know English. That is  not true. You do not have to learn English and you are set on a path to  citizenship.  [[Page H4282]]    We can continue the divisive policy of having people who come here  illegally and once made legal get preferences over people who are here  native born.   I was in Texas last week, Mr. Speaker. As you know, we have over  100,000 people streaming across our border every month. The majority  party does nothing about this.   Yesterday, we passed another welfare bill continuing another, to a  large extent, failed welfare program, but we do nothing in that bill to  make sure the current welfare programs aren't being abused by illegal  or legal immigrants. That is what we should be focusing on at this  time.   A lot of people have been trying to destroy America over many years.  Go back 100 years, and people realized America is the light of the  world. America is the hope for civilization. If I wanted to destroy  America, I would craft a bill like this. I would craft a bill saying  that we have got people here on the welfare system, path to  citizenship; criminal background, path to citizenship; and we put these  folks ahead of so many wonderful, hardworking people who are trying to  do the system the right way and trying to come here legally.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recount observations I  have after spending 2 days of the Memorial Day recess at the Laredo  Sector of the Texas border.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Schweikert for giving me good  information on his musings. I feel very honored to follow Congressman  Schweikert.   Now, we have a crisis. I think it is perhaps the biggest crisis of my  lifetime, as far as the future of America, going on at our border.   In May, 133,000 people attempted to cross the border and were  recorded by the Border Patrol. It is worth remembering that they do not  record everybody. There are people who sneak  [[Page H4309]]  through. And it is worth remembering that there is a smaller number of  people who are apprehended by Customs agents at the designated points  of entry.   By point of reference, the 133,000 people in Mexico can be compared  to 48,000 people who crossed in January. In other words, over time, for  whatever reason, we have a dramatically greater number of people coming  into this country. I will point out that this is the most, in many  years.    Many years ago--say, 15 years ago--if we looked back and found  100,000 people crossing the border, it was nowhere near as serious. At  that time, we would frequently have people come, and they would be  caught and sent back. The same person may try three or four times, so  it wasn't as many people crossing the border.   I should also point out, of the 133,000 caught by the Border Patrol,  11,000 are unaccompanied minors.   I frequently hear people complain that we are breaking up families.  What is going on is that young children--in any event, people under age  18--are coming here on their own.   Another thing that is going on is that we are seeing people from more  or different countries come across. I assume that is because the word  is out, not only in Mexico and Central America but even in the Eastern  Hemisphere, that the United States is not enforcing our immigration  law.   In the Laredo Sector, if Members talk to Customs folks, the number  one country for people coming across the border is Venezuela. Number  two is Cuba. Number three is Congo. So even from the Eastern  Hemisphere, people are flooding here.   While I was down there, the Border Patrol caught a group of 116  people, all Africans coming in from Congo, Angola, and Cameroon, 116 in  one haul.   What does this mean? First of all, in addition to great changes in  our country, it means the Border Patrol is overwhelmed. The amount of  paperwork, understandably, wherever we are today, there is a tremendous  amount of paperwork. The amount of paperwork the Border Patrol has to  do takes them off the border, takes them off the reason they  volunteered to be part of the Border Patrol. This means even more  people are coming across the border.   Furthermore, the Border Patrol has to work in dangerous positions. We  have followed them as they have followed the Rio Grande River in the  Laredo Sector in the middle of the night with one person per vehicle.  We can imagine what it is like patrolling on very slow roads with a lot  of foliage on both sides of the roads. Some of the environmentalists  wouldn't let them cut it down. We may have groups of 9 or 10 people  coming across the border. Very dangerous.   The first thing that should be done is, immediately, this Congress  ought to appropriate more monies for the Border Patrol. Right now, they  have 2,000 empty positions, and the number of positions they have is  drawn out over a much smaller number of people.   We also have to improve the equipment the Border Patrol has and  increase the number of dogs. While down on the border, we watched the  great job dogs can do in pursuing people. It is expensive for these  dogs. But be it at the designated points of entry where they sniff out  drugs or sniff out cash, or out in the field with the Border Patrol,  they make them much more effective.   It is ridiculous that our Border Patrol also has equipment that is  sometimes not as good as what the cartels have. The cartels control the  border. With the exception of these big entourages, nobody gets across  the border without approval of the cartels.   The next thing to point out, as we deal with people coming across the  border, when the cartels bring them across the border, they may not  take them to safety. They may just direct people in a certain direction  or so far as they are escorting people to a place where they can be  picked up in the United States. If somebody is too weak and can't make  it, they don't call 911. They just leave them there to dehydrate and  perhaps die.   In the last year, in the Tucson Sector, about 250 people were found  dehydrated or dying of something.   This is another result of the United States' open border policy in  which we encourage people who are expecting us to ignore immigration  laws to come to the United States.   In the Laredo Sector, it is not quite as bad. About 50 people die of  dehydration every year. But there, where many more people cross the Rio  Grande, it is not unusual to have people drown. In the 2 days that I  was there, they found another person who had drowned.   The reason they drown is that people think it is shallow enough to  walk across the Rio Grande, but there are people who can't swim. We  have a situation in which there is an undertow in the Rio Grande, and  people, including children, wind up dying there.   Again, how do we deal with it? We should be creating a situation  where people think we are enforcing our laws, so they are not tempted  to do such dangerous things.   Another thing we found out is that, among people who are crossing the  border, if they are not part of a family unit, they are much more  dangerous than they were 10 years ago.   Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago, the type of people crossing the border  might be the types looking to work on a farm in Wisconsin. It is much  more common to get the criminal element, much more common to get the  MS13 gangs from El Salvador. That is kind of a subjective determination  from the Border Patrol, but they find it of great concern because they  love their country, and they see whom we are letting in our country and  where the future Americans are going to come from.   What can we do to stop 133,000 people from coming in this country  every month? We have to stop the carrot that keeps people coming.   First of all, we should deal with birthright citizenship. Again, the  United States is one of only two of the 40th wealthiest countries in  the world that allows people to become citizens because they were born  here.   We hear more stories of people coming over here. Women are coming  over here 8 months pregnant, having a baby, knowing that the baby will  be an American citizen. And eventually, because of family-related laws,  they will be able to come into the country.   Secondly, and President Trump can do this alone, I believe, we have  to get rid of the practice of giving work permits to people who come  here for asylum purposes, knowing that they probably will not show up  for an asylum hearing. Giving a work permit encourages people to break  the law.   Then, we need more judges on the border with regard to these  immigration problems. Right now, what goes on is that people come here  looking for asylum. They are given a court date 2 or 3 or 5 years out.   I am told that they even tell Border Patrol agents that they know  they are ineligible for asylum. They tell Border Patrol agents that  they will not show up for their hearing in 5 or 6 years. That has to  stop.                                time  2115    That has got to stop, and the way to make it stop is hire more  judges, put those judges right on the border, and do not let people in  the country assuming that they are here legally.   I mean, they are going to wind up with a work permit and they are  going to wind up being part of our culture even though they are here  illegally.   Next thing to do, and I am not going to spend a lot of time on this  because we talked about it before, but every Border Patrol agent I have  talked to in the Tucson sector, or in the Laredo sector, says we need a  wall. In summary, we must act now or we will lose our country. We  cannot continue to take 100,000 people crossing the border  inappropriately every month.   I want to point out, I am not talking about legal immigration. Every  year in this country, we swear in 700,000 new people as citizens. In  this country right now, we have about 4 million people here on work  permits. So it is not like we are anti-immigrant. A lot of people can  come here.   When I talk about the 130,000 people who came here in May and largely  wind up in the United States, I am talking about people who are coming  here and should not be here.   We are being inundated and it will eventually sink our country. I ask  President Trump to do all he can. It is very obvious that Congress does  not get the degree of the crisis. We should have appropriated the money  already, instead of what we did yesterday, as we spent more money on  welfare programs.  [[Page H4310]]    By the way, we know from talking to people, even in Wisconsin, that  there are a lot of people here illegally who are getting welfare, to  boot. President Trump should revoke the work permits that people are  getting if they are here for asylum reasons because we know the vast  majority of people who are seeking asylum probably are not eligible for  it, and we do not want to encourage more of that.   In any event, I encourage my colleagues to take this crisis at the  border, 130,000 a month, seriously. I encourage the press to do more to  report on it because, obviously, this is permanently going to change  America. I encourage President Trump to do all he can do without the  assistance of Congress, because the reason we are getting so many more  is the word is out.   Again, it is not just in Mexico or Central America. The word is out  in South America. The word is out in Cuba. The word is out in Africa.  The word is out in Asia. America is not enforcing our immigration laws.  And until we turn around the attitude that is out there among people,  that perception, we are going to continue to have growing numbers.   It is going to go over 130,000. It is going to be 150,000. It is  going to be 170,000 a month. America is really going to be inundated,  and we have to act quickly.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 18 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, June 5, 2019, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
