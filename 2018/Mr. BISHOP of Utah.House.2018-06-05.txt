 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5956) to incentivize the hiring of United States workers  in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5956         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Mariana Islands       U.S. Workforce Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSES.         The purposes of this Act are--        (1) to increase the percentage of United States workers (as       defined in section 6(i) of the Joint Resolution entitled ``A       Joint Resolution to approve the `Covenant To Establish a       Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political       Union with the United States of America', and for other       purposes'' (48 U.S.C. 1806)) in the total workforce of the       Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, while       maintaining the minimum number of workers who are not United       States workers to meet the changing demands of the Northern       Mariana Islands' economy;        (2) to encourage the hiring of United States workers into       such workforce; and        (3) to ensure that no United States worker--        (A) is at a competitive disadvantage for employment       compared to a worker who is not a United States worker; or        (B) is displaced by a worker who is not a United States       worker.       SEC. 3. TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.         (a) In General.--Section 6 of the Joint Resolution entitled       ``A Joint Resolution to approve the `Covenant To Establish a       Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political       Union with the United States of America', and for other       purposes'' (48 U.S.C. 1806) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``2019'' and inserting       ``2029''; and        (B) by amending paragraph (6) to read as follows:        ``(6) Fees for training united states workers.--        ``(A) Supplemental fee.--        ``(i) In general.--In addition to fees imposed pursuant to       section 286(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8       U.S.C. 1356(m)) to recover the full costs of adjudication       services, the Secretary shall impose an annual supplemental       fee of $200 per nonimmigrant worker on each prospective       employer who is issued a permit under subsection (d)(3)       during the transition program.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 5956. The Commonwealth of the Northern  Mariana Islands had a political union with the United States back in  1986. As part of that covenant, which has several different elements  that make it unique among all of the territories as well as the other  States, it authorized a local level of established programs to permit  foreign workers to enter into the Northern Marianas.   In 2008, I believe it was, Congress established this law to create a  standard with the goal of actually trying to reduce the annual number  of permits given to foreign workers--eventually, hopefully, to zero--to  stabilize so that the workforce became more American.   Three years later, they finally came up with a way of implementing  that--relatively quick for U.S. Government standards. But the  citizenship program that was established, the CW permit program,  unfortunately, it doesn't quite work as we had thought it might do.   So, in 2017, GAO reported that, since 2013, demand for these permits  had doubled, and in fiscal year 2016, the demand exceeded the numerical  cap that we have on these particular permits.   The bottom line is simple. This idea of having the American workforce  is wonderful, but if you have an area with a small population with a  good economy, which means there is low unemployment, and for some  reason there is not a whole lot of Americans who want to travel a 15- hour plane ride to get to their work destination, there is a need for a  foreign workforce on these particular islands. And in some areas, it is  unique.   It was estimated that 80 percent of all the hospitality and  construction jobs need to be filled by a foreign workforce. In the  hospitals there, if we don't make a change in this, all of the nurses  will no longer be eligible to stay on the island and do that needed  service.   And, actually, if we don't make some kind of adjustments in these  caps, it could have a negative impact on the economy of the Northern  Marianas, anywhere between 30 and 60 percent, sharply changing their  gross domestic product.   The intent of this particular bill in this version is threefold:  number one, we want to increase the percentage of U.S. workers in the  total workforce in the Marianas while maintaining a certain number of  non-U.S. workers to meet the demands of the Northern Marianas economy;  number two, encourage the hiring of U.S. workers into the Northern  Mariana workforce; and number three--and this is perhaps the important  one--to ensure that no U.S. worker is at a competitive disadvantage  compared to any non-U.S. worker or is going to be displaced by a non- U.S. worker.   But until that is accomplished, this bill will have some flexibility  on those caps, and it will be permitted to extend beyond the 2019 date  to 2029 so we can see how it does or does not work.   This bill gives necessary relief to the Northern Marianas. I want to  thank the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan) for  working with us on this bill. I am also grateful to the government of  the Northern Mariana Islands. Governor Torres has been in constant  communication with us. He is supportive of what we are attempting to  do. Oddly enough, I want  [[Page H4748]]  to thank our colleagues in the Senate who are also supportive of this  particular idea, even if they drafted somewhat of an inartful piece of  legislation so we have to come at it one more time.   But there is agreement that this is the proper thing to do so this  Commonwealth can actually maintain a steady workforce and maintain an  economy that will continue to grow in the future. All the significant  players on the island in the territory are in support of what we are  attempting to do.   Mr. Speaker, I obviously urge adoption of this measure, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the gentleman from  the Northern Mariana Islands for helping me with this particular bill.  I am very grateful also to Governor Torres of the Commonwealth and to  the business community there. I think we have found a practical  solution to a real problem that could create harm for this  Commonwealth.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of that area. I visited it once, and I  hope to go back there again and notice the economic growth that  continues there in the Northern Marianas.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1026) to revise the authorized route of the North  Country National Scenic Trail in northeastern Minnesota and to extend  the trail into Vermont to connect with the Appalachian National Scenic  Trail, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1026         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``North Country National       Scenic Trail Route Adjustment Act''.       SEC. 2. ROUTE ADJUSTMENT.         Section 5(a)(8) of the National Trails System Act (16       U.S.C. 1244(a)(8)) is amended in the first sentence--        (1) by striking ``thirty-two hundred miles, extending from       eastern New York State'' and inserting ``4,600 miles,       extending from the Appalachian Trail in Vermont''; and        (2) by striking ``Proposed North Country Trail'' and all       that follows through ``June 1975.'' and inserting `` `North       Country National Scenic Trail, Authorized Route', dated       February 2014, and numbered 649/116870.''.       SEC. 3. LAND ACQUISITION.         Neither the Secretary of Agriculture nor the Secretary of       the Interior may acquire for the North Country National       Scenic Trail land in Minnesota or Vermont that was obtained       through condemnation by a State or local government.       SEC. 4. ENERGY.         Nothing in the amendments made by this Act that change the       authorized route of the North Country National Scenic Trail       in Minnesota or Vermont shall prohibit the development,       production, conveyance, or transmission of energy in those       States, with reasonable efforts made to preserve the nature       and purpose of the North Country National Scenic Trail, and       to mitigate any damage to that trail and its associated       resources caused by such activities.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The North Country National Scenic Trail is about 4,000 miles and  links scenic, national, historic, and cultural areas across seven  States. It goes from basically North Dakota through New York and will  eventually end up in Vermont.   The issue at hand here is a section in Minnesota which is about 93  miles that has not been built because it is a swamp. You can't build it  there.                                time  1645    So what this would do--and it is strange we have to pass legislation  to do it--is simply authorize to build a trail and go around the swamp  which may add some additional miles to it, maybe around 400. It also  authorizes at the other end about, maybe 66 miles of potential road  from Vermont so that they can all connect to the Appalachian Trail  which will create one of the most significant trails, the longest trail  that we have to be able to use in this country.   I should say the National Park Service has studied this, they have  approved it; and nonetheless, it is still a good idea. I urge its  adoption, and I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to have  been able to work on a bill that makes the assumption that someone  actually does want to walk to Vermont. If indeed you can find that  individual, we will provide an opportunity for it to take place.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have five legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 2991) to establish the Susquehanna National Heritage  Area in the State of Pennsylvania, and for other purposes, as amended.

SEC. 9. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY.         The authority of the Secretary to provide assistance under       this Act terminates on the date that is 15 years after the       date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker), the author of this  particular bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am in favor of this particular bill. Heritage areas have been, for  us, somewhat problematic in the past. There have been some of those who  have looked simply on the Federal Government as a deep pocket to be  robbed and used year after year after year. Some of them have ignored  private property rights. Some of them have actually superseded legal  governments' prerogatives and initiatives.   In each of these areas, Mr. Smucker has done an incredibly good job  to make sure those problems will not exist. The idea of simply being a  funnel for money is not necessarily a part of this particular bill, and  he has specifically included the rights of property protection in this  bill.   What Mr. Smucker has done here is a national heritage area done the  right way for the right purpose and the right intent, and I hope,  because of the way he has done that, it will not tend to be a problem  in the future as heritage areas are re-looked at and renewed at some  particular point. I want to commend him not only for taking up the  specific issue that is important to his area, but for doing it the  right way. That is why I am very happy to support this particular piece  of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my fellow Members to vote  ``yes'' on this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5005) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct  a special resource study to determine the suitability and feasibility  of establishing the birthplace of James Weldon Johnson in Jacksonville,  Florida, as a unit of the National Park System.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5005         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SPECIAL RESOURCE STUDY OF JAMES WELDON JOHNSON                     BIRTHPLACE.         (a) Study.--The Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a       special resource study to determine the suitability and       feasibility of establishing the birthplace of James Weldon       Johnson located at Adams & Lee Street in Jacksonville,       Florida, as a unit of the National Park System.        (b) Study Requirements.--The Secretary shall conduct the       study in accordance with section 100507 of title 54, United       States Code.        (c) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date on which       funds are made available to carry out this Act, the Secretary       shall submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and       Natural Resources of the Senate a report that describes--        (1) the results of the study; and        (2) any recommendations of the Secretary.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This is a fairly significant but straightforward bill. It simply is  asking for a study on the potential of including James Weldon Johnson's  birthplace as part of our national park system.   Mr. Johnson was a leader in the civil rights movement of his time. He  had many talents. He was a diplomat, executive director of the NAACP,  the first African to be a member of The Florida Bar. He has also  written songs.   Having a special place in history, it is appropriate that we simply  direct the National Park Service to investigate the possibility of  adding this to the historical sites of significance within the Park  Service system.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5655) to establish the Camp Nelson Heritage National  Monument in the State of Kentucky as a unit of the National Park  System, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(2) Conditions.--The Monument shall not be established       until after the Secretary--        (A) has entered into a written agreement with the owner of       any private or non-Federal land within the Camp Nelson       Heritage National Monument boundary as depicted on the Map       providing that such property shall be donated to the United       States for inclusion in the Monument to be managed       consistently with the purposes of the Monument; and        (B) has determined that sufficient land or interests in       land have been acquired within the boundary of the Monument       to constitute a manageable unit.

(e) Administration.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary shall administer the       Monument in accordance with--        (A) this Act; and        (B) the laws generally applicable to units of the National       Park System, including--        (i) section 100101(a), chapter 1003, and sections       100751(a), 100752, 100753, and 102101 of title 54, United       States Code; and        (ii) chapter 3201 of title 54, United States Code.        (2) Management plan.--        (A) In general.--Not later than 3 years after the date on       which funds are first made available to the Secretary for       this purpose, the Secretary shall prepare a general       management plan for the Monument in accordance with section       100502 of title 54, United States Code.        (B) Submit to congress.--On completion of the general       management plan, the Secretary shall submit it to the       Committee on Natural Resources of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural       Resources of the Senate.        (f) Private Property Protection.--No private property or       non-Federal public property shall be managed as part of the       Monument without the written consent of the owner of such       property.        (g) No Buffer Zones.--Nothing in this Act, the       establishment of the Monument, or the management of the       Monument shall be construed to create buffer zones outside of       the Monument. The fact that an activity or use can be seen,       heard, or detected from within the Monument shall not       preclude the conduct of that activity or use outside of the       Monument.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), whose bill this is. It is an  excellent piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, this, to me, is an important piece of legislation, not  just for the history of it, as an old history teacher, but this Camp  Nelson is currently a county park known as the Camp Nelson Civil War  Heritage Park. In 2008, it was added to the National Park Service's  National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom. In 2013, it was  designated as a National Historic Landmark.   More important than that, this is one of those areas which deserves  to be a national monument, and what we are doing is the way national  monuments should be created in this country. It has been an open  process. We have had hearings. We have had open debate. There has been  input from the local community. This is how Congress should be creating  national monuments, not only now but in the future as well. So I am  very grateful for that.   It is a bill that has been properly drafted and properly vetted, and  we are going through the process in the way the Constitution required  for Congress to make these kinds of designations. For that reason, I am  extremely proud of this particular piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for all the effort  and the work he has put into doing this the right way. I urge my  colleagues to support this particular measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 801) to amend the National Trails System Act to  designate the Route 66 National Historic Trail, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 801         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Route 66 National Historic       Trail Designation Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF THE ROUTE 66 NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL.         Section 5(a) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C.       1244(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(31) Route 66 national historic trail.--        ``(A) In general.--The Route 66 National Historic Trail, a       trail that includes all the alignments of U.S. Highway 66 in       existence between  [[Page H4755]]       1926 and 1985, extending along a route of approximately 2,400       miles from Chicago, Illinois, to Santa Monica, California, as       generally depicted on the map entitled `Route 66 National       Historic Trail, Proposed Route', numbered P26/141,279, and       dated December 2017.        ``(B) Availability of map.--The map described in       subparagraph (A) shall be on file and available for public       inspection in the appropriate offices of the National Park       Service, Department of the Interior.        ``(C) Administration.--The Route 66 National Historic Trail       shall be administered by the Secretary of the Interior,       acting through the Director of the National Park Service.       Such administration shall be conducted in a manner that       respects and maintains the idiosyncratic nature of the Route       66 National Historic Trail.        ``(D) Land acquisition.--The United States may not acquire       for the Route 66 National Historic Trail any land or interest       in land--        ``(i) outside the exterior boundary of any federally       managed area without the consent of the owner of the land or       interest in land; or        ``(ii) that extends more than an average of one-quarter of       a mile on either side of the trail.        ``(E) No buffer zone created.--Nothing in this Act, the       acquisition of the land or an interest in land authorized by       this Act, or the management plan for the Route 66 National       Historic Trail shall be construed to create buffer zones       outside of the Trail. That activities or uses can be seen,       heard, or detected from the acquired land shall not preclude,       limit, control, regulate, or determine the conduct or       management of activities or uses outside of the trail.        ``(F) Energy.--Nothing in this Act, the acquisition of land       or an interest in land authorized by this Act, or the       management plan for the Route 66 National Historic Trail       shall prohibit, hinder, or disrupt the development,       production, or transmission of energy.        ``(G) Eminent domain or condemnation.--In carrying out this       Act, the Secretary of the Interior may not use eminent domain       or condemnation.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood), despite the fact that he  used to be a member of our committee and abandoned us, for which he  will never be forgiven.    Mr. Speaker, I want to add my support to this  particular bill. We are talking about 2,400 miles going from Chicago to  Santa Monica. It was, at one time, called the Main Street of America.  It is unique in American history.   I was just talking to the sponsor of this particular piece of  legislation who does not remember the TV show. I still remember ``Route  66'' as one of my favorite shows. I still want to go on that route and  in the same Corvette that they had.   Mr. Speaker, if others are too young to remember that, learn history.  That is why we are history teachers around here.   I will yield to Mrs. Napolitano to ask if she remembers the show.  [[Page H4758]]                                     time  1730     Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, it is running  through my head right now.   This is a good piece of legislation. This is more than just  nostalgia. This actually helps preserve our history. It is the right  thing to do. I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 3997) to waive the application fee for any special use  permit for veterans demonstrations and special events at war memorials  on Federal land, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3997         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Free Veterans from Fees       Act''.       SEC. 2. WAIVER OF SPECIAL USE PERMIT APPLICATION FEE FOR                     VETERANS DEMONSTRATIONS AND SPECIAL EVENTS.         (a) Waiver.--The application fee for any special use permit       solely for a veterans demonstration or special event at war       memorials on Federal land shall be waived.        (b) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Demonstration; special event.--The terms       ``demonstration'' and ``special event'' have the meaning       given those terms in section 7.96 of title 36, Code of       Federal Regulations.        (2) Veteran.--The term ``veteran'' has the meaning given       that term in section 101(2) of title 38, United States Code.        (3) Veterans demonstration or special event.--The term       ``veterans demonstration or special event'' means a       demonstration or special event whose primary purpose is to       commemorate, or honor either a group of people because of       their service as veterans or immediate family members of       veterans.        (4) War memorial.--The term ``war memorial'' means any       tangible object which has been erected or dedicated to       commemorate--        (A) war, conflict, victory, or peace;        (B) casualties who served in, were affected by, or killed       as a result of war, conflict, or peacekeeping; or        (C) those who died as a result of accident or disease while       engaged in military service.        (c) Applicability.--This section shall apply to any special       use permit application submitted after the date of the       enactment of this Act.        (d) Applicability of Existing Laws.--Permit applicants       remain subject to all other laws, regulations, and policies       regarding the application, issuance and execution of special       use permits for a veterans demonstration or special event at       war memorials on Federal land.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the author of  this particular piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, this is a very good piece of  legislation.   For those who have served well, to subject them to another  application fee is just ridiculous. If there was ever an example of a  good idea, a no-brainer piece of legislation, this is it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
