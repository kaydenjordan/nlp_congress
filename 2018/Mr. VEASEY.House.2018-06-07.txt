 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the incredible life  and legacy of Pauline Valenciano.   Pauline was raised in Fort Worth and was able to observe the  diversity and vast culture and traditions that are embraced in our  community.   I knew Pauline when I first got started in politics in the late  1990s, working at Town Center Mall, which is now La Gran Plaza. But  Pauline was one of the very first people that I met, and I am just very  saddened to hear about her loss.   From an early age, Pauline looked up to leaders in the community who  gave voice to injustices and fought for equal representation. From  observing local Tarrant County School Board races to statewide  campaigns, Pauline knew her calling was activism, and she became a  fierce leader for the Latino community and for women.   When Pauline got told to dial it down, that meant, for Pauline, that  she needed to dial it up. She won the respect of minority groups across  Texas as she fought for civil rights and gender equality. As a precinct  chair and election judge, she became an icon in the Latino community  for giving voice to those who felt silenced.   She also canvassed for John Kennedy and marched alongside Cesar  Chavez. Inspired by leaders who were great orators, she spoke about  raising the level of discourse in the country. And naturally, in 2016,  when the first female candidate for President was on the ballot, she  teamed up with local groups to get out the vote. The city of Fort Worth  grieves her loss.   The last time I saw her was at a Cinco de Mayo event, and she came up  and gave me a big hug. That is the type of person she was in the  community, just so inspiring, so encouraging, and a good person. We are  going to miss her very much. Her work and legacy will live in Fort  Worth for decades and years and years to come.   Everyone is thinking about you, my friend, Pauline. I know that you  are looking down, and a lot of people are sad about your loss, but know  that you helped make Fort Worth a better place to live for all of us.                            ____________________
