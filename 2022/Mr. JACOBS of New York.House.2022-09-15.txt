 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and  celebrate the 80th birthday of Alan Dewart, a business and civic leader  in our community.   Alan has been an entrepreneur and real estate developer for his  entire professional life. Alan's impact on the revitalization of the  city of Buffalo is unparalleled.   During the dark economic times of the 1980s when the city was  experiencing a mass exodus of people, businesses, and hope, Alan was a  pioneer who reinvested and revitalized a section of downtown Buffalo,  taking vacant and derelict buildings in Buffalo's theater district and  transforming it into a vibrant city center consisting of apartments,  restaurants, and music/entertainment venues, infusing life and vibrancy  back into a historically significant section of our city.   Alan's pioneering work sowed the seeds of future developers and  future projects to bring downtown Buffalo back to life.   I interned for Alan Dewart as a college student and through him  developed a passion for urban revitalization. He is a friend and a  mentor, and I thank him for all he has done for me and all he has done  for our city.                            ____________________
