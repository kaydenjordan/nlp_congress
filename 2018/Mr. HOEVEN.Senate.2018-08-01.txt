 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized  for 3 minutes for comments relating to the appropriations bill prior to  the NDAA bill debate.    Madam President, I want to thank my colleagues for  advancing these appropriations bills, specifically the ag  appropriations bill.   I also want to thank Senator Merkley, my ranking member on the  committee. Throughout the process, we have had open communications and  have worked to advance the bill and to address amendments brought  forward by our colleagues.   I also want to thank specifically Senator Merkley's staff--Jessica  Schulken, Dianne Nellor, and Bob Ross--for their work, as well as my  crew--Carlisle Clarke, Patrick Carroll, Elizabeth Dent, Dan Auger, and  Brita Endrud.   This has been a process that has involved other subcommittees as  well. I want to thank all of those who have worked on these  appropriations bills, including Senator Collins and Senator Reed and  their staffs on the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development  Subcommittee; Senators Murkowski and Udall and their staffs on the  Interior bill; Senators Lankford and Coons on the Financial Services  Subcommittee.   This has certainly been a deliberative process--again, the way  regular order is supposed to work. More than a dozen amendments that  affected, for example, our agriculture bill have been accepted over the  course of the bill. We  [[Page S5539]]  voted on others. So I am glad that we have had the open debate and been  able to advance these bills, and, of course, particularly the  Agriculture appropriations bill.   I will just conclude with what I always like to remind people of  whenever we talk about agriculture, and that is good farm policy. It  benefits every single American every single day because what our  farmers and ranchers do is they produce the highest quality, lowest  cost food supply in the world, which benefits every American every day.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.
