 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call  be rescinded.    Madam President, it is an honor to support a thoughtful,  experienced, historic nominee to our highest Court, Ketanji Brown  Jackson.   I met with her yesterday. It was so clear she has the experience, she  has the character, she has the commitment to justice needed to be an  excellent Supreme Court Justice. We talked about the legacy and the  unfinished fight of Dr. King, how we could never forget that he was  martyred in Memphis while fighting for the rights of sanitation  workers, some of the most exploited workers in segregated America-- segregated in Memphis, TN.   Dr. King understood better than perhaps anybody how worker rights and  voter rights come together. It is clear that Judge Jackson understands  the dignity of work and that the rights of workers are integral civil  rights. People think of the Supreme Court as something like an ivory  tower detached from people's everyday lives, and we know that decisions  these Justices make affect America's workplaces and their paychecks and  their safety on the job. That is why it matters so much whom we promote  to these jobs.   I am confident that Judge Jackson will be a Justice who protects the  rights of all Americans, not just the powerful, not just the  privileged. She brings with her a diverse set of experiences and a  perspective that has long been lacking from our Nation's highest  Courts.   We, of course, know she is the first Black woman nominated to serve  on the Court. She is a daughter of a public schoolteacher. She went to  public schools herself--not that common, frankly, on the U.S. Supreme  Court--and she is a former public defender. The nomination is truly  historic.   Her parents attended segregated primary schools, and now, their  daughter will ascend to the highest levels of our government. Think  about that.   Judge Jackson has a history of bipartisan support. Republicans  supported her confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals. I am glad a  few of my Republican colleagues have recognized those unimpeachable  qualifications and are supporting her confirmation this week.   I don't know how anyone could doubt her intelligence, her  thoughtfulness, her knowledge of the law, and her commitment to  justice. She clerked for Justice Breyer. She has shown she is the ideal  nominee to carry on his legacy of building consensus, in listening to  all perspectives.   It was an honor to talk with her yesterday and to hear her views. It  will be an honor to vote for her later this week.   Over the coming months and years, the Supreme Court is set to make  decisions on everything from Ohioans' healthcare to workplace safety to  their right to vote. If the Court makes these decisions that affect all  Ohioans' lives, I am confident that Judge Jackson understands the  importance of equal justice and as a commitment to our Constitution,  including civil rights and including worker rights. She will serve  Ohioans and all Americans with the same grace and dignity and  commitment to our country she has shown over the past several weeks-- meeting with Senators, speaking to the President, and in speaking to  the Nation through the Judiciary Committee hearings. I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting her confirmation.    Madam President, it is my honor to--this is something I  get to do once a year now--it is my honor to join Senator Rounds of  South Dakota and Senator Hirono from Hawaii, and then Senator Collins  later, Senator Baldwin, Senator Romney, and Senator Warnock, to join my  colleagues of both parties on the floor to read one of the greatest  pieces of writing of the 20th century, Dr. King's letter from the  Birmingham jail.   I thank those Senators for joining us. Our former colleague, Senator  Doug Jones, began this tradition. He did it in 2019 and 2020. As he  left the Senate in late 2020, he asked me to continue the tradition  that he began. He would have been here on the floor with us to watch  and to listen, but he was called to the White House on his work with  Judge Jackson.   This is a bipartisan reading. I very purposely chose three Republican  [[Page S2007]]  friends--Senator Rounds will go first--and three Democrat friends,  followed by Senator Hirono. And let me just lay out where we are and  what we are doing.   It is April 1963. Dr. King was held in the Birmingham Jail for the  supposed crime of leading a series of peaceful protests and boycotts in  the city of Birmingham, AL. The goal was to put pressure on the  business community to end discrimination in their hiring for local  jobs. Some White ministers from Alabama would take issue with these  boycotts. They said: Slow down, Dr. King. Don't move too fast. We are  for voting rights, too. We are for ending discrimination, but don't  demand too much all at once.   Dr. King rejected that premise. That is what this letter is about. It  is about demanding justice now for people in Alabama whose skin was  Black and who simply could not vote because of the color of their skin.   We can't wait around and hope that problems in families' lives will  solve themselves. It is up to us as citizens, as leaders, as members of  our churches in our communities.   Dr. King made this point more eloquently and persuasively, certainly,  than I can. We will begin the reading of the letter with Senator Rounds  from South Dakota.            I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and       Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few       years I have been gravely disappointed with the white       moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion       that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward       freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux       Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to       ``order'' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which       is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the       presence of justice; who constantly says: ``I agree with you       in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of       direct action''; who paternalistically believes he can set       the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a       mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro       to wait for a ``more convenient season.'' Shallow       understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating       than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.       Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright       rejection.        I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that       law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice       and that when they fail in this purpose they become the       dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social       progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would       understand that the present tension in the South is a       necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative       peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust       plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men       will respect the dignity and worth of human personality.       Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not       the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the       hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the       open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that       can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be       opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air       and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension       its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and       the air of national opinion before it can be cured.        In your statement you assert that our actions, even though       peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate       violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn't this like       condemning a robbed man because his possession of money       precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like       condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to       truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by       the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock?       Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God       consciousness and never ceasing  [[Page S2009]]       devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of       crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts       have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an       individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic       constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate       violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the       robber. I had also hoped that the white moderate would       reject the myth concerning time in relation to the       struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from a       white brother in Texas. He writes: ``All Christians know       that the colored people will receive equal rights       eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a       religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost two       thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of       Christ take time to come to earth.'' Such an attitude       stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the       strangely irrational notion that there is something in the       very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills.       Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either       destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that       the people of ill will have used time much more       effectively than have the people of good will. We will       have to repent in this generation not merely for the       hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the       appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never       rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the       tireless efforts of men willing to be coworkers with God,       and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of       the forces of social stagnation. We must use time       creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe       to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of       democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a       creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our       national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to       the solid rock of human dignity.        You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At       first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would       see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. I began       thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two       opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of       complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of       long years of oppression, are so drained of self respect in       the sense of ``somebodiness'' that they have adjusted to       segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who,       because of a degree of academic and economic security and       because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become       insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is       one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close       to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black       nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation,       the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammad's Muslim       movement. Nourished by the Negro's frustration over the       continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement       is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have       absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded       that the white man is an incorrigible ``devil.''        I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that       we need emulate neither the ``do nothingism'' of the       complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black       nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and       nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through the       influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became       an integral part of our struggle. If this philosophy had not       emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am       convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further convinced       that if our white brothers dismiss as ``rabble rousers'' and       ``outside agitators'' those of us who employ nonviolent       direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent       efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and       despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist       ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a       frightening racial nightmare.     Madam President, thanks to my colleagues, Senator Warnock,  Senator Baldwin in the Presiding Officer's Chair, Senator Rounds,  Senator Hirono, Senator Collins, and Senator Romney for joining me to  read these powerful words today.   This tradition began in 2019 when Senator Doug Jones from Alabama, a  leader in the civil rights movement, as Senator Warnock who just spoke  also is--he began this tradition in 2019. And then when he left the  Senate in 2020, he asked me to continue and together read these  powerful words--a diverse group on the floor today. We come from  different backgrounds. We disagree on a number of things. We love this  country. We know we can do better for the people who make it work.   In my meeting yesterday with Judge Jackson--soon to be Justice  Jackson--we talked about the deep connection between civil rights and  workers' rights. Dr. King spoke to labor audiences throughout his life.  He preached with a unique eloquence about the inherent dignity of work.  He said that  [[Page S2011]]  ``so often we overlook the work and significance of those who are not  in professional jobs, of those who are not in the so-called big jobs .  . . Whenever you are engaged in work that serves humanity and is for  the building of humanity,'' Dr. King said, ``it has dignity and it has  worth.'' He said that ``no labor is really menial unless you're not  getting adequate wages.''   I think about the campaign Dr. King waged when he was assassinated.  We will never forget that he was martyred in Memphis while fighting for  some of the most exploited workers in the country: sanitation workers  in segregated Memphis.   We know too many workers face a similar exploitation today. We have  seen, over the past 2 years, how many workers corporations call  essential but treat as expendable. It is their whole business model.   It is not a coincidence that many of those workers look like the ones  for whom Dr. King was fighting for, that they are not the ones in the  so-called--his words--``big jobs.''   When on occasion, a company tries to do the right thing when they  announce a pay raise or investment in workers, often Wall Street  punishes them.   This week, Starbucks--a corporation currently fighting its own  workers trying to organize a union--announced they are throwing a bone  to workers. The company is going to do a little tiny bit less in  executive compensation in the form of stock buybacks this year and do  some investment in the workers instead, and their stock price went  down. The Wall Street business model doesn't just do nothing for  workers--pardon the grammar--it actively discourages investment in  workers.   It has to change. Until hard work pays off for all workers, Dr.  King's work remains unfinished. That means paying all workers a living  wage. Senator Warnock is still on the floor, and Senator Baldwin, the  Presiding Officer, are two of the people that fight the hardest for  that.   All workers must make a living wage, have more power over their  schedule, provide good benefits and safety on the job, and not fight  organizing a union. That means all workers get a fair share of the  wealth that they create. It means recognizing the dignity of the  communities that Black Americans have built over generations. That is  how we bring ourselves closer to the society that Dr. King envisioned  where all labor has dignity.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise as chairman of the Banking,  Housing and Urban Affairs Committee to honor and recognize the  contributions of Kay Guinane upon her retirement from the Charity and  Security Network.   In 2009, Ms. Guinane founded the Charity and Security Network--C and  SN--a resource and advocacy center for nonprofit organizations to  promote and protect their ability to carry out effective programs that  support peace and human rights, aid civilians in areas of disaster and  armed conflict, and build democratic governance.   Kay formed C and SN after observing significant obstacles in  achieving critical humanitarian, peacebuilding and human rights  programs. She recognized laws that restricted interactions with and  financial support for designated groups and individuals were also  severely limiting the critical work of civil society programs that  provided assistance to the most vulnerable populations around the  world. C and SN blazed a trail in being one of the first nonprofit  organizations to address these issues.   Early on, in concert with colleagues around the world who had  experienced similar impediments, Kay began engaging with elected  officials and administration policymakers, seeking solutions, including  the committees in Congress responsible for illicit finance and  sanctions policy. Kay and her organization were a critical resource for  the Senate Banking Committee for years as we addressed important policy  issues, and unintended consequences of certain policies around illicit  financing, bank de-risking, the conveyance of remittances overseas from  families in the US--including large communities of Somalis, Ethiopians,  and people from across Latin America--and other issues.   In May 2010, Kay testified in the first congressional oversight  hearing since September 11, 2001, to look at the impact of anti- terrorist financing enforcement policies on the U.S. charitable sector.  The hearing entitled, ``Anti-Money Laundering: Blocking Terrorist  Financing and Its Impact on Lawful Charities,'' was held by the House  Financial Services subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. During  the hearing, a Treasury official acknowledged that the laws aimed at  stopping terrorist financing could have the unintended consequence of  harming the effectiveness of certain charitable programs. Kay outlined  specific problems faced by the U.S. nonprofit sector, including the  issue of banks freezing accounts indefinitely, and noted the negative  impact of U.S. Treasury enforcement actions on legitimate charitable  organizations operating solely to assist vulnerable populations.   Over the next decade, Kay and the work of C and SN were a driving  force in efforts to address challenges civil society groups had in  implementing their essential lifesaving, peacebuilding and human rights  work. Kay's vision and efforts built an impressive network of nearly  200 organizations internationally with a shared goal of assisting the  most vulnerable and protecting fundamental civil liberties. These  organizations addressed issues surrounding civil societal concerns and  financial access restrictions for nonprofits to combating obstacles in  reaching general populations due to specific sanctioned entities.   By drawing on legal expertise, firsthand experiences of those working  with these limitations, and policy analysis, the work of C and SN has  helped raise awareness of and craft solutions for civil society and  human rights concerns around the world. It has also resulted in  tangible improvements in regulations, international guidelines, and  policies. One notable and tangible  [[Page S2037]]  legislative victory was in key provisions of the Anti-Money Laundering  Act of 2020, which assisted to improve financial access for charities.   While her steadfast work will be missed, Kay's legacy at C and SN and  its network of affiliates will have an impact on global civil liberties  and human rights issues going forward. I offer her my heartfelt  congratulations to her on her retirement, and wish her--and C and SN,  which she leaves in good hands--all the best going forward.                            ____________________
