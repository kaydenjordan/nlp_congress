 Mr. Speaker, John Lewis' mother and his  grandmother named him John after John the Apostle, the disciple, the  Scripture says, whom Jesus loved, John the Beloved.   And John Lewis dedicated his life to building the beloved community.   And one more thing. John Lewis, being named after John, Jesus'  Apostle, it must be noted that the Apostle John was the youngest of the  disciples. John Lewis was the youngest of our civil rights leaders who  spoke at the momentous March on Washington.   God bless John Lewis, and we thank God for sending him our way.
