 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, the distinguished ranking  member, for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, there is one reason we are here today and one reason  alone. It is not to protect American workers. No, it is to protect big  labor and their bosses.   There is so much real work to be done. We should be working to  empower American workers, to modernize our employment laws, and to meet  the demands of the 21st century economy. Instead, with this  legislation, my friends on the other side want to turn back the clock  and try to force power back into the hands of union bosses.   Make no mistake, this bill is a massive job killer. It will wipe out  right-to-work laws which have now been adopted in a majority of States  in this country. It will close small businesses. It will allow union  bosses the freedom to coerce American workers, and it will force  millions to pay union dues against their consent.   For some reason, my friends on the other side refuse to see the  results of the proworker Trump agenda. When government gets out of the  way, when we put down the regulatory pen, when we let the American  economy work, American ingenuity will lead the world.   At a time of record prosperity, they propose we bring back many of  the failed policies of the Obama administration, the very policies that  led to so many years of stagnation.   My message to my friends on the other side is clear: Do not betray  the American worker. Do not turn back the clock. Vote ``no'' on the PRO  Act.
