 Madam Speaker, I first met Louise Slaughter 32 years ago  during our freshman orientation. From the first day, she stood out.   Louise was an unbelievable, kind, beautiful person. She was a born  leader who was thoughtful, mindful, and she didn't take any stuff.   I loved Louise. She called me Brother John, and I called her Sister  Louise.   We miss Louise.   I can see her standing up on this floor now speaking truth to power.  She never gave up; she never gave in; she kept her faith; and she kept  her eyes on the prize.   Madam Speaker, I thank Louise for her service, and I know she is with  her beloved Bob.                            ____________________
