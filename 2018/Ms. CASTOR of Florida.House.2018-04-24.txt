 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Judge Paul  Danahy, Jr., a leader of distinction from Tampa, Florida, and part of  Florida's Greatest Generation. Judge Danahy is celebrating his 90th  birthday this week.   Judge Danahy was one of the longest serving members of Florida's  Second District Court of Appeals. The judge may also wish to be  remembered for working his way through college at the legendary Tampa's  Valencia Garden restaurant as the only Anglo member of the Spanish  waiters for many, many years. Wherever Judge Danahy worked and served,  he earned a reputation for working tirelessly and gaining the respect  of all he worked with.   Born in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, Judge Danahy was drawn to Tampa to  play basketball at the University of Tampa. In Tampa, he found both a  new hometown and the love of his life, Georgia Reed.   Judge Danahy enlisted in the Army during the Korean war and has a  very unique military record, including three honorable discharges from  two branches of the military: the Marine Reserves, the U.S. Army  Infantry, and finally from service in the Army Counter Intelligence  Corps, a precursor to the CIA. Upon return from military service, he  found his true calling and earned his law degree from the University of  Florida in 1957.   Judge Danahy became an influential member of the Florida House of  Representatives, serving from 1966 to 1974. True to form, Judge Danahy  played a significant role as part of what many believe to be Tampa's  greatest State legislative delegations during the 1960s and early  1970s.   There, amongst other progressive policies, he drafted and championed  the first ethics law in the State of Florida, which continues in force  to this day and is now firmly ensconced in Florida's constitution. The  Florida we know and love today would not be possible without the  contributions of Judge Danahy and his partners in Florida's Greatest  Generation.   After leaving the legislature, Judge Danahy's service was only  beginning. He was appointed to the Second District Court of Appeals in  1977, and sat on the bench a record-shattering 33 years, serving as  chief judge from 1986 to 1988. In his 30th year at the court, Judge  Danahy received a fitting recognition: the largest conference room at  the Tampa branch of the Second District Court of Appeals was named the  Judge Paul Danahy, Jr., Conference Room. This recognition not only  honored his record-setting time on the bench, but also his legislative  accomplishments. He was largely responsible for obtaining the  legislative funding to bring the branch to Tampa.   Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pride to honor and send many wishes to  a great Tampanian, part of Florida's Greatest Generation of leaders,  Judge Paul W. Danahy, Jr., on his 90th birthday. His legacy continues  as the patriarch of an ever-growing family to whom he imparts his  wisdom and through whom his lessons and beliefs will surely echo in the  years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the United States of America and  our North American neighbors of Canada and Mexico have a wonderful  opportunity to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament. This is  a combined North American bid.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Representative  LaHood, and Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their support  of this resolution, and I also commend my colleagues, Congressman Bacon  and Congressman Kihuen, who also co-chair the Congressional Soccer  Caucus.   The United States last hosted the World Cup in 1994. We had nine  cities. The attendance was over 3\1/2\ million. We think now for 2026  it is going to be bigger and better than ever because we are going to  combine efforts with our North American neighbors of Canada and Mexico,  where they will also host many of the tournament matches.                                time  1715    Mr. Speaker, I noticed that Mr. Webster was on the floor, along with  Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and Mr. Deutch, and they should be proud to know that  Orlando and Miami, from our home State of Florida, will be  participating, and we love soccer in the Sunshine State.   But I also offer my strong support for this resolution because of the  inspiration that the World Cup soccer tournament provides to young  people all across this country. It is like the Olympics. It encourages  them to be healthy and well, to participate in team supports and  athletics. It exposes and encourages children and young people to be  good sports and understand what a world competition means in a friendly  way.   Studies show that team sports lead to healthier lifestyles, increased  knowledge about exercise and nutrition, positive gains in reading and  math; and that is why the Congressional Soccer Caucus works with the  U.S. Soccer Foundation because they really provide the national model  for programs about ``the beautiful game,'' and they make so many  helpful investments in communities across the country to encourage kids  to get out, be active, and learn about great sportsmanship.   So here is this resolution. We are coming together in a bipartisan  way, to recognize the effort, to support it, to make sure that  Americans everywhere know that we expect the men's team to live up to  their expectations. The women's team, national team, of course,  [[Page H3476]]  has been champion after champion after champion. It is time, also, for  the men's team and this generation to try to meet their goals.   We would like to encourage everyone to pay attention, support the  effort.   Again, I thank my colleague, Mr. LaHood, Chairman Royce, Ranking  Member Engel; and I urge the House to kick this resolution towards  passage so that we can meet our goals.
