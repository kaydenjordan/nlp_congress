 Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 25th  anniversary of Virginia Organizing, a nonpartisan grassroots group  committed to challenging injustice by empowering people in local  communities across the Commonwealth to work together, democratically  and nonviolently, for change.   For a quarter century, Virginia Organizing has led the debate on the  most important issues of our time, including economic security for  families, equal opportunity in education, a sustainable environment,  access to healthcare, and the guarantee that every person is entitled  to have their voice heard.   Virginia Organizing and I share a common goal, one that I have spoken  about many times, that all Virginians and all Americans should have a  fair shot at success. We share the belief that all people should be  treated fairly and with dignity in all aspects of life, regardless of  race, class, gender, religion, sexual orientation, age, ability, or  country of origin.   Now more than ever, I am proud to serve alongside a group that  embraces and celebrates diversity. This year, to celebrate their 25th  anniversary, I would like to again recognize and thank the leaders,  members, and staff of Virginia Organizing, who continue to work  tirelessly to provide children, low-income residents, immigrants,  veterans, retirees, people with disabilities, and other  underrepresented groups with the resources that they need to have a  fair shot. I am so grateful for their work for the people of the  Commonwealth and wish them well as they embark on their next quarter- century.                            ____________________
