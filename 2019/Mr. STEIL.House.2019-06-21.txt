 Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to ensure  that the VA suicide prevention programs are adequately funded. This  budget-neutral amendment provides $1 million to those programs.   Every day, we lose 22 veterans to suicide. These are American  heroes--fathers, husbands, wives, sons, and daughters--valued members  of our community. We must support our veterans and fight for them as  they fought for us. They will not go through this battle alone.   June is PTSD Awareness Month. We must stand together, Democrats and  Republicans, to ensure that our veterans get the help that they need.   This amendment is about supporting veterans and ensuring that they  have access to mental healthcare resources. Madam Chair, I urge my  colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Speaker, this week, my southeast Wisconsin community  lost two heroes: Racine Police Officer John Hetland and Milwaukee  Police Officer Kou Her.   Officer Hetland, a 24-year veteran of the Racine Police Department,  was shot and killed while off duty, trying to stop an armed robbery.   Officer Her, a 2-year veteran of the Milwaukee Police Department, was  killed on his way home from a shift as a speeding car crashed into him.   These men are heroes. They will always be remembered for their  service.   This is a solemn reminder of the sacrifices members of our law  enforcement make every day to protect our communities.   My prayers are with the families and friends of the officers and the  entire law enforcement community grieving for these heroes.                            ____________________
