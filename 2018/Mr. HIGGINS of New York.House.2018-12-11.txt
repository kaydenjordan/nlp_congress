 Mr. Speaker, this Friday marks the sixth  anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown,  Connecticut.   On December 14, 2012, from 9:30 to 9:40 a.m., a lone gunman armed  with an assault weapon killed 27 people, including 20 kids between the  ages of 6 and 7 years old. Five minutes, one shooter, 27 people dead.  Many of the kids had several bullet wounds in their bodies when they  were recovered.   In the years since that tragedy, we have seen high-powered assault  weapon attacks on schools, synagogues, nightclubs, churches, concerts,  and in our neighborhoods. With each horrific attack, Congress responds  with a moment of silence. We have had 50 moments of silence since Sandy  Hook.   Silence is not a response. We need rational voices, congressional  hearings, and meaningful gun safety laws now.                            ____________________
