 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of my good friend, Tennessee State Representative Ron Lollar, who  passed away on July 6, 2018, at the age of 69.   Ron valiantly served his country as a United States marine in the  Vietnam war, receiving accolades, including the Vietnam Gallantry Cross  and the Good Conduct Medal.   Ron also served multiple terms on the Shelby County School Board and  was a strong advocate for education and agriculture as a member of the  Tennessee House of Representatives.   To his wife, Brenda, and their three children: I hope you take  comfort in the memories of Ron and the legacy he leaves behind. May his  lifelong service to our local community, to Tennessee, and to the  United States never be forgotten.   We will miss you.                            ____________________     My friend from New York is my leader. I  recognize that and will yield to him in that respect.   I also appreciate his taking the time to organize this evening this  very important issue. I think we all realize that the defense of our  Nation and our allies is one of the most important reasons that we  function as a government.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of President Trump's recent  decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action also  known as the Iran deal.   In November of 2017, I spoke here on the House floor lauding  President Trump's decision to decertify the Iran deal. Today I am glad  to stand here with the news that the United States is finally  withdrawing from this deeply flawed deal and reimposing tough sanctions  on Tehran.   Just a few months ago, April 30 of this year, the Israeli Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled a massive supply of documents  revealing Iran's developments of a secret nuclear weapons program while  claiming otherwise. In reality, Iran kept these documents in a secured  vault ensuring that the International Atomic Energy Agency would never  find them during their inspection. With the Prime Minister's  revelations, the Iranian regime is believed to have been falsifying  reports to the agency for years, and the deal failed in its basic  objective to prevent the regime from obtaining nuclear weapons.   This hard evidence by Israeli intelligence only further illustrates  that Iran cannot be trusted by the international community and only  continues to harbor hostility that threatens our national security  interests.   As we have seen over the years, the Iran deal has also failed to  prevent the further testing of ballistic missiles. According to the  Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Iran has launched 23 illicit  ballistic missiles since the beginning of the signing of the Iran deal  in July of 2015.   Now, one of these was a new long-range missile with capabilities to  carry multiple warheads. This was the country's third test of a missile  with a range of approximately 1,200 miles and fully capable of reaching  Israel.   Against multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions, Iran  continues to invest time, invest energy, and invest resources into its  ballistic missile program. These illicit tests are dangerous, they are  unacceptable, and they cannot continue to occur.   Additionally, Iran continues to be one of the world's largest state  sponsors of terrorism with the IRGC operatives in Lebanon, in Syria,  and in Gaza, all of which surrounds our friend and our ally, Israel.   Just today, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps Deputy Commander Major  General Hossein Salami stated that Iran's regional allies were  ``awaiting orders to eradicate the evil regime.'' This is in reference  to Israel. It is clear that Iran's aggression in the region is  dramatically increasing, leaving Israel and other surrounding countries  vulnerable to a nuclear weapons attack.   This past February, just a few months ago, Israel shot down an  Iranian drone that had been dispatched from a Syrian airbase 30 seconds  after it crossed into Israeli airspace. It was not until April 13 of  this year when Israel revealed that the Iranian drone was carrying  explosives with plans to attack and destroy an unspecified target in  Israel. Think about it. Had this situation been escalated to nuclear  warfare, one can only imagine the devastation that would have ensued.   We have got to say enough is enough. We cannot enable Iran to enrich  tons of uranium; we cannot enable Iran to test ballistic missiles  against the United Nations Security Council resolutions; we cannot  enable Iran to funnel $150 billion of frozen assets to terrorist  proxies such as Hamas and Hezbollah; and we cannot enable Iran's  belligerence to escalate.   While the previous administration failed in their intent to inhibit  Iran from its perilous activities, quite frankly, President Trump did  not. He did the right thing for the United States; he did the right  thing for Israel; and he did the right thing for our allies throughout  the world.   I am pleased that the President saw the dangers of the Iran deal as  it did not stop Iran's ambition to become nuclear, but rather paves it.   As we work in Congress to implement further sanctions against the  Iranian  [[Page H6036]]  regime, we must protect our allies in the Middle East and effectively  prevent Iran from progressing with their nuclear weapons program.   I, again, want to thank my friend and my colleague from New York,  Congressman Zeldin, for leading this discussion so that all the issues  and, frankly, all the facts can be out on the table.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the great leadership Congressman Zeldin has  shown on this issue.
