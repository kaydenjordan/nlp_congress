 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize  Mayor Nancy Shaver and her tenure of dedicated service to the citizens  of St. Augustine, Florida. A strong advocate for the Nation's oldest  city, Mayor Shaver recently stepped down from her position with an  admirable record of leadership in her community.   Mayor Shaver, who previously served as a teacher and businesswoman,  was elected to office in 2014. During her time as mayor, she was a  tireless advocate for important issues that are very unique to the city  of St. Augustine. It was my honor to work with her in the effort to  combat sea level rise to protect our coastal economies and safeguard  the priceless historical and cultural features that make St. Augustine  so special.   As mayor, she exemplified the virtues of local government by putting  citizens, not politics, first and remaining devoted to the northeast  Florida community.   I thank Nancy Shaver for her commitment to the city of St. Augustine  and our fellow citizens, for whom she so dearly cared. I wish her and  her family the best in their future endeavors.                            ____________________
