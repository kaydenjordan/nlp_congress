 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As vice chair of the House Republican Conference, it is shaping up to  be a busy, productive week for House Republicans. I am looking forward  to hearing from my colleagues to discuss the issues our Conference is  focused on this week, including the crisis at our border, support for  Israel, and investigations into the Biden family's alleged illegal  financial dealings with foreign nations.                                time  1630    We have an energized and diverse conference, eager to make the  American Dream possible for the next generation.   My team and I are ready to help Members shine and deliver their  message straight to their constituents and the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  McClain), for the first remarks of the evening.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative McClain. I  appreciate the comments and I appreciate the clarity and work that the  Oversight Committee does on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Donalds).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida who  has a strong and clear message.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Fallon).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  a passionate speech, laced with facts that have been identified for  months and months and months. I appreciate the communication.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Owens),  my good friend and colleague.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, waiving regulations on Federal land  is a dangerous precedent, and this piece of legislation is very, very  important.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Babin for his  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, our Texas delegation, as we are all in border States and  as we see this piece of legislation this week is geared toward what is  going on in New York, as we are all border States, I am from Utah,  other States, we relied on the testimony and the experience from our  Texas delegation, our Arizona delegation particularly, they have been  through the worst of it, and we appreciate that.   We will continue to hear from our Texas delegation and someone who  has been a very consistent voice on this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  remarks and her clear communication and the heartfelt pleas to solve  this issue. There are so many simple policies. If we put them in place,  they are wins for everybody. They are political wins, and they are  policy wins. We don't understand why we don't take to see what has  worked well in the past and try to reimplement it.   Mr. Speaker, we welcome another border State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of  California (Mr. LaMalfa) to share his remarks.    Mr. Speaker, he makes one really important point  and I highlight this quite a bit: We, as a Republican majority, have to  so many times force President Biden to do very commonsense things and  that is so important. His comments actually highlight that well.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to share these messages.  I thank my colleagues for being here to communicate such clear messages  on such important aspects of legislation that we are going to be  focused on this week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
