 Based on questions and statements I have heard,       some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia       and its security services did not conduct a campaign against       our country and that perhaps, somehow for some reason,       Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative being perpetrated       and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.        The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power       that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in       2016. This is the public conclusion of our intelligence       agencies confirmed in bipartisan and congressional reports.       It is beyond dispute, even if some of the underlying details       must remain classified.        The impacts of the successful 2016 Russian campaign remain       evident today. Our Nation is being torn apart. The truth is       questioned. Our highly professional, expert career Foreign       Service is being undermined. U.S. support for Ukraine which       continues to face armed Russian aggression is being       politicized. The Russian Government's goal is to weaken our       country, to diminish America's global role, and to neutralize       a perceived U.S. threat to Russian interests.    Mr. Manager NADLER. President Trump knew this too. His former  Homeland Security Advisor, Tom Bossert, said that the idea that Ukraine  hacked the DNC server was ``not only a conspiracy theory, it is  completely debunked,'' and he and other U.S. officials spent hours with  the President explaining why.   The second false allegation that the President wanted the Ukrainians  to announce was that Vice President Biden used his power to protect a  company on whose board his son sat by forcing the removal of Viktor  Shokin, the corrupt former prosecutor general.   It is true that Vice President Biden helped remove Mr. Shokin, who  was widely believed to be corrupt. As I said a few minutes ago, it was  official policy of the United States, the European community, and  others, in order to fight corruption in Ukraine, to ask that Shokin and  Lutsenko be removed. So the Vice President, Vice President Biden, in  fulfilling U.S. policy, pressured Ukraine to remove Shokin--not to  secure some personal benefit but to advance the official policy of the  United States and its allies. Even Lutsenko, who initially seeded the  allegations against Mr. Biden in American media, later admitted that  the allegations against the Vice President were false. And Rudy  Giuliani told Kurt Volker, the Special Representative for Ukrainian  Negotiations, who had a prominent role in the scheme, that he also knew  the attacks on Joe Biden were a lie.   With Ambassador Yovanovitch out of the way, the first chapter of the  Ukraine scheme was complete. Mr. Giuliani and his agents could now  apply direct pressure to the Ukrainian Government to spread these two  falsehoods.   Who benefited from this scheme? Who sent Mr. Giuliani to Ukraine in  the first place? Of course we could rephrase that question as the  former Republican leader of the Senate, Howard Baker, asked it in 1973:  What did the President know, and when he did he know it?   Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, President's  counsel: President Trump and President Zelensky's relationship started  out well. President Trump wanted the two investigations from Zelensky,  and he had no reason to believe he would not get what he wanted.   On April 21, 2019, Volodymyr Zelensky, who was new to politics, won a  landslide victory in Ukraine's Presidential election. That evening,  President Trump called Zelensky to congratulate him. On that first  call--the first call--Zelensky invited President Trump to visit Ukraine  for the upcoming inauguration. President Trump, in turn, promised that  his administration would send someone at ``a very, very high level.''   During that same April call, President Trump invited President  Zelensky to the White House, saying:         When you're settled in and ready, I'd like to invite you to       the White House. We'll have a lot of things to talk about,       but we're with you all the way.    Zelensky immediately accepted the President's invitation, adding that  the ``whole team and I are looking forward to that visit.''   Numerous witnesses testified about the significance of a White House  meeting for the political newcomer. A White House meeting would show  Ukrainians that America supported Zelensky's anti-corruption platform.  The clear backing of the President of the United States--Ukraine's most  important patron--would also send a powerful message to Russia that we  had Ukraine's back.   During that April 21 call, President Trump never even uttered the  word ``corruption,'' but the official White House call recap falsely  stated that the two Presidents had discussed Ukraine's anti-corruption  efforts.   Shortly after the phone call, Jennifer Williams, adviser to Vice  President Pence, learned that President Trump asked Vice President  Pence to attend Zelensky's inauguration.   Williams and her colleagues began planning Pence's trip to Kyiv. At  the same time, Giuliani was trying to get Ukraine to investigate the  Bidens and alleged 2016 election interference. On April 24, Giuliani  went on ``FOX & Friends'' and had this to say:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Keep your eye on Ukraine, because in Ukraine a lot of dirty       work was done. I'm digging up the information. American       officials were used. Ukrainian officials were used. That is       like collusion with the Ukrainians and--or actually, in this       case, conspiracy with the Ukrainians. I think you'd get some       interesting information about Joe Biden from Ukraine. About       his son, Hunter Biden. About a company he was on the board of       for years, which may be one of the most crooked companies in       Ukraine.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. For this campaign to be truly beneficial  to his boss President Trump, Giuliani needed access to the new  government in Ukraine. He dispatched his associates Lev Parnas and Igor  Fruman to try to make inroads with Zelensky's team.   On April 25, former Vice President Biden publicly announced his bid  for Presidency, and immediately he was at the top of the polls.   That same day, David Holmes, an American diplomat at our Embassy in  Ukraine, learned that Giuliani had reached out to the head of President  Zelensky's campaign. As Mr. Holmes explained, the new Ukrainian  Government began to think that Giuliani  [[Page S460]]  ``was a significant person in terms of managing their relationship with  the United States.''   As Giuliani and his associates worked behind the scenes to get access  to the new leadership in Ukraine, President Trump was publicly  signaling his interest in the investigations. On May 2, the President  appeared on FOX News. When asked, ``Should the former vice president  explain himself on his feeling in Ukraine and whether there was a  conflict . . . with his son's business interests?'' President Trump  replied as follows:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         I'm hearing it's a major scandal, major problem. Very bad       things happened, and we'll see what that is. They even have       him on tape, talking about it. They have Joe Biden on tape       talking about the prosecutor. And I've seen that tape. A lot       of people are talking about that tape, but that's up to them.       They have to solve that problem.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. The tape President Trump referenced is a  video from January 2018 in which Vice President Biden explained that he  placed an ultimatum to the Ukrainian President to remove the corrupt  prosecutor general to ensure that taxpayer money would be used  appropriately. The Vice President's actions were consistent with  official U.S. policy as well as the opinions of the international  community.   On May 9, the New York Times published an article about Giuliani's  plan to visit Ukraine. In the article, Giuliani confirmed that he  planned to meet with Zelensky. At that meeting, he wanted to press the  Ukrainian Government to pursue the investigations that President Trump  promoted only days earlier. Giuliani said: ``We're not meddling in an  election, we are meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to  do.''   Giuliani even went so far as to acknowledge that his actions could  benefit President Trump personally. He said: ``[T]his isn't foreign  policy--I'm asking them to do an investigation that they're doing  already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I am going  to give them reasons why they shouldn't stop it because that  information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out  to be helpful to my government.''   That is it right there--Giuliani admitting he was asking Ukraine to  work an investigation that would be ``very, very helpful'' to the  President. He was not doing foreign policy. He was not doing this on  behalf of the government. He was doing this for the personal interests  of his client, Donald J. Trump.   The next morning, on May 10, amid coverage of his planned trip to  Ukraine, Giuliani tweeted further about Biden and then had a flurry of  calls with Parnas, who was helping in planning his trip to Ukraine.   That same day, Giuliani also spoke with Ambassador Volker on the  phone for more than 30 minutes. Ambassador Volker had learned that  Giuliani had intended to travel to Ukraine and had called to warn  Giuliani that Prosecutor General Lutsenko ``is not credible. Don't  listen to what he is saying.''   Later that day, Giuliani had a 17-minute call with a masked White  House number before speaking again with Parnas for 12 minutes.   That same day, on May 10, Politico asked President Trump about  Giuliani's upcoming trip, and he replied, ``I have not spoken to him at  any great length, but I will. . . . I will speak to him about it before  he leaves.'' But that evening, on FOX News, Giuliani announced: ``I'm  not going to go'' to Ukraine ``because I think I'm walking into a group  of people that are enemies of the President.'' Separately, in a text  message to ``Politico,'' Giuliani alleged that the original offer for a  meeting with Zelensky was a ``set-up.'' He said it was a set-up  orchestrated by ``several vocal critics'' of President Trump who were  advising Zelensky. Giuliani declared that ``Zelensky is in [the] hands  of avowed enemies of President Trump.''   But Giuliani had not stopped trying. He had Parnas send a letter to  Zelensky's senior aide on May 11 asking for a meeting. That letter made  it clear that Giuliani was representing President Trump as ``a private  citizen'' and that he was working with President Trump's ``knowledge  and consent.''   The letter is on the slide. It reads:         In my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and       with his knowledge and consent, I request a meeting with you       on this upcoming Monday, May 13, or Tuesday, May 14. I will       need no more than a half-hour of your time and I will be       accompanied by my colleague Victoria Toensing, a       distinguished American attorney who is very familiar with the       matter.    But it did not appear that Giuliani and Parnas's attempts to get the  meeting were working. That same day, Giuliani sent a text message to  Parnas asking, ``This guy is canceling meeting, I think?''  Approximately 3 hours later, Giuliani sent Parnas drafts of a public  statement that ``people advising the PRES ELECT are no friends of the  President.''   Three days later, President Trump instructed Vice President Pence not  to attend the inauguration in Ukraine--just 3 days later. Vice  Presidential staffer Jennifer Williams received a surprising call from  Pence's Chief of Staff. She described it during her public testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         On May 13th, an assistant to the Vice President's chief of       staff called and informed me that President Trump had decided       that the Vice President would not attend the inauguration in       Ukraine. She did not provide any further explanation. I       relayed that instruction to others involved in planning the       potential trip. I also informed the NSC that the Vice       President would not be attending, so that it could identify a       head of delegation to represent the United States at       President-elect Zelensky's inauguration.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Notably, Williams confirmed that the  inauguration date had not yet been scheduled at the time of that phone  call. So the reason for President Trump's decision was certainly not  due to a scheduling conflict.   Secretary of Energy Rick Perry ultimately led the delegation to the  inaugural. Accompanying Secretary Perry were Ambassador to the European  Union, Gordon Sondland; Ambassador Volker; NSC Director for Ukraine,  LTC Alexander Vindman; and Senator Ron Johnson also attended many of  the inaugural events with the delegation. When asked if this delegation  was a good group, Holmes replied that it ``was not as senior a  delegation as we might have expected.''   After the inauguration, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland left Kyiv  with a very favorable impression of President Zelensky. Ambassador  Volker said they believed it was important that President Trump  personally engage with the President of Ukraine in order to demonstrate  full U.S. support for him.   When the inauguration team returned to the United States, they had a  meeting with President Trump on May 23. The May 23 meeting with  President Trump proved to be important for two good reasons. First,  with Ambassador Yovanovitch out of the way, President Trump authorized  Ambassador Sondland, Secretary Perry, and Ambassador Volker to lead  engagement with the new administration in Ukraine; and two, President  Trump instructed them to satisfy Giuliani's concerns in order to move  forward on Ukraine matters.   These officials were all political appointees, and Ambassador  Sondland had donated $1 million to the President's inauguration. The  President saw these three political appointees as officials who would  fulfill his requests.   Ambassador Volker testified that he, Ambassador Sondland, Secretary  Perry, and Senator Johnson took turns making their case that this is a  new crowd. It is a new President in Ukraine. He is committed to doing  the right things, including fighting corruption. They recommended that  President Trump follow through on his invitation for President Zelensky  to meet with him in the Oval Office, but President Trump did not  receive the recommendation well.   At his public hearing, Ambassador Volker described the May 23 Oval  Office meeting with President Trump. Let's listen.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador VOLKER. We stressed our finding that President       Zelensky represented the best chance for getting Ukraine out       of the mire of corruption it had been in for over 20 years.       We urged him [President Trump] to invite President Zelensky       to the White House. The President was very skeptical. Given       Ukraine's history of corruption, that's understandable. He       said that Ukraine was a corrupt country, full of terrible       people. He said, ``They tried to take me down.'' In the       course of that conversation, he referenced conversations with       Mayor Giuliani. It was  [[Page S461]]       clear to me that despite the positive news and       recommendations being conveyed by this official delegation       about the new President, President Trump had a deeply rooted       negative view on Ukraine rooted in the past. He was receiving       other information from other sources, including Mayor       Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this       negative view.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Witnesses said the reference to ``taking  me down'' was to unfounded allegations that Ukraine had interfered in  the 2016 election. This was what President Trump considered to be  corruption in Ukraine.   The President's words echoed Giuliani's public statements about  Ukraine in early May. Rather than committing to an Oval Office meeting  with the Ukrainian leader, President Trump directed the delegation to  talk to Giuliani. Here is how Ambassador Sondland described that  instruction from the President.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. If we wanted to get anything done with       Ukraine, it was apparent to us we needed to talk to Rudy.        GOLDMAN. Right. You understood that Giuliani spoke for the       President, correct?        Ambassador SONDLAND. That's correct.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Ambassador Sondland saw the writing on  the wall. Sondland concluded that if we did not talk to Rudy, nothing  would move forward on Ukraine.   The three amigos, as they called themselves, did as the President  ordered and began talking to Giuliani. Dr. Hill testified Volker,  Sondland, and Perry ``gave us every impression that they were meeting  with Rudy Giuliani at this point, and Rudy Giuliani was also saying on  the television, and indeed had said subsequently, that he was closely  coordinating with the State Department.''   Like Dr. Hill, Ambassador Bolton closely tracked Giuliani's Ukraine- related activities. Hill testified about a conversation she had with  Bolton in May of 2019. That conversation was revealing, so let's  listen.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. . . . And I had already brought to Ambassador       Bolton's attention the attacks, the smear campaign against       Ambassador Yovanovitch and expressed great regret about how       this was unfolding and, in fact, the shameful way in which       Ambassador Yovanovitch was being smeared and attacked.        And I had asked him if there was anything we could do about       it, and Ambassador Bolton had looked pained, basically       indicated with body language that there was nothing much we       could do about it. And he then in the course of that       discussion said that Rudy Giuliani was a hand grenade that       was going to blow everyone up.        GOLDMAN. Did you understand what he meant by that?        Dr. HILL. I did, actually.        GOLDMAN. What did he mean?        Dr. HILL. Well, I think he meant that obviously what Mr.       Giuliani was saying was pretty explosive, in any case. He was       frequently on television making quite incendiary remarks       about everyone involved in this and that he was clearly       pushing forward issues and ideas that would, you know,       probably come back to haunt us. And, in fact, I think that       that's where we are today.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. According to Dr. Hill's description,  Bolton said that Giuliani's influence could be an obstacle to increased  White House engagement with Ukraine. He instructed his staff not to  meet with Giuliani.   In June, Volker and Sondland relayed to Ambassador Taylor that  President Trump wanted to hear from Zelensky before scheduling the  meeting in the Oval Office. Ambassador Taylor testified that he did not  understand at the time what that meant.   Around this time, the President publicly expressed that he thought it  would be OK to accept foreign interference to assist his campaign if it  was in the form of opposition research on his opponent. Let's listen  to that shocking interview.    (Text of Videotape presentation:)         STEPHANOPOULOS. Your campaign this time around, if       foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you       information on opponents, should they accept it or should       they call the FBI?        PRESIDENT TRUMP. I think maybe you do both. I think you       might want to listen, there's nothing wrong with listening.       If somebody called from a country, Norway, ``we have       information on your opponent.'' Oh, I think I'd want to hear       it.        STEPHANOPOULOS. You want that kind of interference in our       elections?        PRESIDENT TRUMP. It's not an interference, they have       information. I think I'd take it.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Shocking video. Meanwhile, Giuliani  continued to press Ukraine to do the President's political dirty work.  On June 21, for instance, Giuliani tweeted the following:         New Pres of Ukraine still silent on investigation of       Ukrainian interference in 2016 election and alleged Biden       bribery of Pres Poroshenko. Time for leadership and       investigate both if you want to purge how Ukraine was abused       by Hillary and Obama people.    The quid pro quo scheme was taking shape. Giuliani was publicly  advocating for Ukraine to conduct politically motivated investigations  while President Trump refused to schedule an Oval Office meeting for  Ukraine's new President. As Ambassador Sondland testified, the scheme  to pressure Ukraine to conduct these investigations would only get more  insidious with time.   Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, the majority leader expressed a  preference for a break about 2 hours in. So it is the House managers'  request that I present, and then we take the break, if that is  acceptable for everybody.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Any objection? Move forward.   Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, counsel  for the President, and the American people, where were you on July 25,  2019? It was a Thursday. Members of the U.S. Senate were here in this  Chamber. On July 25, across the Atlantic, our 68,000 troops stationed  throughout Europe were doing what they do every day--training and  preparing to support our allies and defend against Russia.   The professionalism and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform is  a source of great strength, but America is also strong and America is  also secure because we have friends. On July 25, 2019, one of those  friends was a man named Oleksandr Markiv. In a story told by Sabra  Ayers of the Los Angeles Times, Oleksandr was a soldier in the  Ukrainian Army defending his country and Europe against Russian-backed  forces on Ukraine's eastern front. He was in a trench. He was 38 years  old. Oleksandr would later die defending his country during a mortar  attack on his fighting position, giving his life, just like over 13,000  of his fellow Ukrainians, on the frontlines of the fight for liberty in  Europe.   That same Los Angeles Times article painted a picture of what the  Ukrainians were going through during this time.   Tens of thousands of Ukrainians, like Markiv, volunteered to help  fight the Russian-backed separatists in the east. Many of them were  sent to the front line wearing sneakers and without flak jackets and  helmets, let alone rifles and ammunition. Ukrainians across the country  organized in an unprecedented united civil movement not seen since  World War II to raise money to supply their ragtag military with  everything from soldiers' boots to bullets.   And while our friends were at war with Russia wearing sneakers, some  without helmets, something else was happening. On July 25, President  Trump made a phone call. He spoke with Ukrainian President Zelensky and  asked for a favor. On that same day, just hours after his call, his  administration was quietly placing an illegal hold on critical military  aid to support our friends.   So why should any American care about what is happening in Ukraine?  Timothy Morrison, former senior director for Europe and Russia at the  NSC put it bluntly:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Timothy MORRISON. I continue to believe Ukraine is on the       front lines of a strategic competition between the West and       Vladimir Putin's revanchist Russia. Russia is a failing       power, but it is still a dangerous one. The United States       aids Ukraine and her people so that they can fight Russia       over there, and we don't have to fight Russia here. Support       for Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty has been       a bipartisan objective since Russia's military invasion in       2014. It must continue to be.    Mr. Manager CROW. We help our partner fight Russia over there so we  don't have to fight Russia here--our friends on the frontlines, in  trenches, and with sneakers.   Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the United States has  stood by Ukraine. Our diplomats and military commanders have long said  [[Page S462]]  that supporting Ukraine makes us safer. But you don't need me to tell  you that; you all know it very well. When the funding for the security  assistance came up for a vote under this roof, 87 of you voted for the  aid.   Many of you have been staunch advocates for Ukraine, working in a  nonpartisan way to support our friends. That support makes a lot of  sense because politics should not play a part in ensuring that Ukraine  can battle Russian aggression and ensure that freedom wins in Europe.  This body has, in so many ways, set that example.   Protecting Europe from Russia is not a political game. Let me provide  some background. In early 2014, in what became known as the Revolution  of Dignity, Ukrainian citizens demanded democratic reforms and an end  to corruption, ousting the pro-Russian President. Within days, Russian  military forces and their proxies invaded Ukraine, annexing Crimea and  occupying portions of eastern Ukraine.   Since 2014, more than 13,000 Ukrainians have been killed because of  the conflict and over 1.4 million have been forced from their homes.   Russia's invasion of Ukraine is the first attempt to redraw Europe's  border since World War II.   In 2017, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis summed it up well. He  said: ``Despite Russia's denials, we know they are seeking to redraw  international borders by force, undermining the sovereign and free  nations of Europe.''   And as Ambassador Taylor put it, Russian aggression in Ukraine  ``dismissed all the principles that have kept the peace and contributed  to prosperity in Europe since World War II.''   It is clear that Russia is not just a threat in Europe but for  democracy and freedom around the world. Our friends and allies have  also responded, imposing sanctions on Russia and providing billions of  dollars in economic, humanitarian, and security assistance to Ukraine.  This has been an international effort.   Today, the European Union is the single largest contributor of  foreign assistance to Ukraine, having provided roughly $12 billion in  grants and loans since 2014. The United States has provided over $3  billion in assistance in that time, because we all know that we can't  separate our own security from the security of our friends and allies.  That is why the United States has provided economic security and  humanitarian assistance in the form of equipment and training.   Ambassador Taylor testified that American aid is a concrete  demonstration of our ``commitment to resist aggression and defend  freedom.'' He also detailed the many benefits of our assistance for  Ukraine's forces.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, the security assistance       that we provide takes many forms. One of the components of       that assistance is counter-battery radar. Another component       are sniper weapons.        These weapons and this assistance allows the Ukrainian       military to deter further incursions by the Russians against       their own--against Ukrainian territory. If that further       incursion, further aggression, were to take place, more       Ukrainians would die. So it is a deterrent effect that these       weapons provide.        It's also the ability--it gives the Ukrainians the ability       to negotiate from a position of a little more strength when       they negotiate an end to the war in Donbas, negotiating with       the Russians. This also is a way that would reduce the number       of Ukrainians who would die.    Mr. Manager CROW. I would like to make a finer point of how this type  of aid helps because I know something about counter-battery radar.   In 2005, I was an Army Ranger serving in a special operations task  force in Afghanistan. We were at a remote operating base along the  Afghan-Pakistan border. Frequently, the insurgence that we were  fighting would launch rockets and missiles onto our small base. But,  luckily, we were provided with counter-battery radar. So 20, 30, 40  seconds before those rockets and mortars rained down on us, an alarm  would sound. We would run out from our tents and jump into our concrete  bunkers and wait for the attack to end. This is not a theoretical  exercise, and the Ukrainians know it, for Ukraine aid from the United  States actually constitutes about 10 percent of their military budget.  It is safe to say that they can't fight effectively without it.   So there is no doubt. U.S. military assistance in Ukraine makes a  real difference in the fight against Russia.   In 2019, Congress provided $391 million in security assistance. This  included $250 million through the Department of Defense's Ukraine  Security Assistance Initiative, USAI, and $141 million through the  State Department's Foreign Military Financing Program, FMF.   President Trump signed the bill to authorize this aid in August 2018  and signed another bill to fund it the following month. The aid was  underway. The train was leaving the station and following the same  track it had followed every single year. But all of this was about to  change.   In July of 2019, President Trump ordered the Office of Management and  Budget, OMB, to put a hold on all of the aid. The President personally  made this decision even after his own appointed advisers warned him  that it wasn't in our country's interest to withhold the aid--after  overwhelming support in this Senate--and against longstanding policy,  even in his own administration.   But what is most interesting to me about this is that he was only  interested in the Ukraine aid, nobody else. The United States provides  aid to dozens of countries around the world, lots of partners and  allies. He didn't ask about any of them--just Ukraine.   The most important question here is why would he do that? What was  his motivation? Well, we now know why.   This hold shocked people across our own government. The Department of  Defense, along with the State Department, had already certified to  Congress that Ukraine had implemented sufficient anti-corruption  reforms to get the funds, and the Defense Department had already  notified Congress of its intent to deliver the assistance.   So let's recap all of this. Congress had already funded it. Our own  government had already certified that it met all of the standards that  it met every other year, and Congress had already been notified, just  like every other year.   In a series of meetings of the National Security Agency, everyone  except the OMB supported the provision of the assistance. OMB, as we  know, is headed by Mick Mulvaney, the President's Chief of Staff.   Ukraine experts at DOD, the State Department, and the White House  emphasized that it was in the national security interest of the United  States to continue to support Ukraine in its fight. But it wasn't just  the national security concern, because many people thought that the  hold was just outright illegal. And they were right. It was.   The President's hold did violate the law, because just last week,  Congress's independent, nonpartisan watchdog, the Government  Accountability Office, released an opinion finding that the hold was  illegal.   President Trump held the military aid money for so long that the  administration ran out of time to spend the money. Ultimately, even  after the President lifted the hold on September 11--again, with no  clear explanation why--we, the Congress, had to pass another law to  extend the deadline, delaying the delivery of the aid.   In the same L.A. Times article that told the story about our friend  Mr. Markiv, a Ukrainian defense spokesperson said that even though the  hold had been lifted--this was in September--it ``has not reached us  yet.'' That spokesperson went on to say: ``It is not just money from  the bank. It is arms, equipment and hardware.''   And to this day, millions of dollars still haven't been spent.   Although our government neither informed Ukraine of the hold nor  publicly announced it, Ukraine quickly learned about it.   On July 25, the same day as President Trump's call with President  Zelensky, officials at Ukraine's Embassy here in Washington emailed DOD  to ask about the status of the funding. By mid-August, officials at  DOD, the State Department, and the NSC received numerous questions from  Ukrainian officials about the hold. Everyone was worried. It is not  just because of the urgent need for the equipment on the frontlines but  also because of the message that it sent. You see, President Zelensky  had just been sworn in. They were very vulnerable. And, as we all know,  Vladimir Putin looks for vulnerability. He looks for hesitation. He  looks for delay. And any public sign of a hold on that aid could be a  sign of  [[Page S463]]  weakness that could show him it was time to pounce.   President Trump's hold on Ukraine assistance was eventually publicly  reported on August 28. As we will explain, Ukraine fully understood  that the hold was connected to the investigations that President Trump  wanted.   On February 28, DOD notified Congress that it intended to deliver  $125 million of assistance appropriated in September, including ``more  than $50 million of assistance to deliver counter-artillery radars and  defense lethal assistance.'' Congress cleared the notification, which  enabled DOD to begin spending the funds.   For Ukraine to receive the remaining $125 million, Congress required  that the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of  State, certify that the Government of Ukraine had taken substantial  anti-corruption reforms.   Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper and senior  officials across our government conducted a review to evaluate whether  Ukraine had met the required benchmarks.   Ms. Cooper explained that the review involved ``pulling in all the  views of the key experts on Ukraine defense, and coming up with a  consensus view,'' which was then run ``up the chain in the Defense  Department, to ensure we have approval.''   By May 23, the anti-corruption review was complete, and DOD certified  to Congress that Ukraine had complied with all of the conditions and  that the remaining half of the aid should be released. But, again, you  don't have to take my word for it. On May 23, in a letter to Congress,  one of President Trump's senior political appointees, the Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy, wrote: ``On behalf of the Secretary of  Defense, and in coordination with the Secretary of State, I have  certified that the Government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions  to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing  corruption, increasing accountability, and sustaining improvements of  combat capability enabled by U.S. assistance.''   Congress then cleared the funding, which should have allowed Ukraine  to receive the aid. But we know that is not what happened.   On June 18, as DOD was preparing to send the aid, they issued a press  release--as they normally do--announcing that it would provide $250  million in security assistance to Ukraine ``for additional training,  equipment, and advisory efforts to build the capacity of Ukraine's  armed forces.'' This included sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenades,  counter-artillery radars, command and control, electronic warfare,  secure communications, vehicles, night vision, and medical  equipment. However, according to the New York Times, 1 day after the  Defense Department issued this press release--1 day--Assistant to the  President Robert Blair, who works for Mick Mulvaney, called OMB Acting  Director Russell Vought to tell him: ``We need to hold it up.'' The  ``it'' was the assistance.    That same day, June 19, President Trump gave an interview on FOX News  where he raised the so-called CrowdStrike conspiracy theory that  Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election, a line he  would echo during his July 25 call with President Zelensky. This  theory, by the way, has been advanced by Russian propaganda to try to  take attention away from Russian interference and shift it onto  Ukraine. It is a theory that has been universally debunked by U.S.  intelligence and law enforcement.   Nonetheless, the President, spurred by the June 18 press release and  with the false theory about the Ukraine interference, supposedly, in  the 2016 election, started asking about the Ukraine assistance. On June  19, OMB Associate Director for National Security Michael Duffey emailed  Elaine McCusker, the DOD comptroller. He said the President had  questions about the press report and that he was seeking additional  information. This was a reference to an article in the Washington  Examiner, shown here on the slide in front of you.   The White House withheld this email from the House, of course. We  first learned of it from Duffey's deputy, Mark Sandy, who testified  that he was copied on it. Subsequently, as a result of a lawsuit under  the Freedom of Information Act, the public and, therefore, Congress  received a copy of that email, but the White House still refuses to  comply with the subpoenas for this and other documents.   On June 20, McCusker responded to President Trump's inquiry by  providing Sandy information on the security assistance program. Sandy  shared the information with Duffey, but he did not know whether Duffey  shared the information with the White House. Laura Cooper also recalled  receiving an email inquiry about Ukraine's security assistance ``a few  days'' after DOD's June 18 press release. She noted that it was  ``relatively unusual'' to receive questions from the President. In  response, DOD provided materials explaining that the $250 million  funding package was for additional training, equipment, and advisory  efforts to build the capacity of Ukraine's Armed Forces. DOD emphasized  that ``almost all of the dozens of vendors are U.S. companies,''  meaning that this funding also benefited U.S. businesses and workers.   Nonetheless, President Trump put the wheels in motion to freeze the  funds shortly after learning about DOD's plan to release the funds.  According to a New York Times article on June 27, Chief of Staff  Mulvaney emailed Blair:         I am just trying to tie up some loose ends. Did we ever       find out about the money from Ukraine and whether we can hold       it back?    Blair reportedly responded that it would be possible but not pretty.  He added: ``Expect Congress to become unhinged.'' I suppose he said  that for all the reasons we have talked about earlier, because this  Chamber and our Chamber on the other side of the Capitol resoundingly  supports it.   And that was just the Defense Department assistance to Ukraine. For  2019, Congress also appropriated $141 million to Ukraine through the  State Department. Unlike the Defense Department funding, which was  approved by Congress and ready to be spent, OMB blocked the State  Department from even seeking Congress's approval to release the funds.   I am going to pause here to, once again, stress that we have learned  a lot about the circumstances around the initial hold only from the  public release of and reporting about these emails in the past few  weeks. The White House has refused to provide these emails in response  to a subpoena.   Mick Mulvaney and Rob Blair refused to comply with the subpoena to  testify. These emails are just a few of the many thousands that likely  exist on this topic but which have been concealed from Congress and the  American people because of ongoing obstruction. In fact, last night, as  we were here late into the night, sometime around midnight, a new  tranche of documents were released under a Freedom of Information Act  request by an independent watchdog that had been asking for them--they  were released last night--between Mr. Duffey and Elaine McCusker, and  others, on the things that I am talking about right now. Unfortunately,  as you can see, there isn't a lot to read here because it is all  blacked out. So, if the President's lawyers contest any of the facts  that I am talking about, you should demand to see the full record. The  American people deserve to see the full truth when it comes to  Presidential actions.   Back to the timeline, from July to September of 2019, the President  and his advisers at the White House and OMB implemented the hold on  Ukraine assistance through an unusual and unlawful process. First, on  July 3, the State Department notified DOD and NSC staff that OMB was  blocking its notification to Congress. According to Jennifer Williams,  Vice President Pence's aide, the hold on this assistance ``came out of  the blue'' because it had not been previously discussed by OMB or NSC.   Around July 12, President Trump directed that a hold be placed on the  DOD security assistance as well. That day, Mr. Blair sent an email to  Duffey at OMB informing him ``that the President is directing a hold on  military support funding for Ukraine.''   Around July 15, Tim Morrison learned from Deputy National Security  Advisor Charles Kupperman ``that it was the President's direction to  hold the assistance.'' Several days later, Duffey and Blair again  exchanged emails about Ukraine's security assistance, and Sandy  testified that, in these  [[Page S464]]  emails, Duffey asked Blair about the reason for the hold. Blair  provided no explanation. Instead, he said: ``We need to let the hold  take place'' and then ``revisit'' the issue with the President.   Between July 18 and July 31, the NSC staff convened several  interagency meetings at which the hold on security assistance was  discussed. Remember those dates: July 18 to July 31. According to Mark  Sandy and other witnesses, several facts emerged. First, the agencies  learned that the President himself had directed the hold through OMB.  Second, no justification or explanation was provided for the hold,  despite repeated questions. Third, except for OMB, all agencies were  supporting military aid because it was in the national security  interests of the United States. And fourth, many were concerned that  the hold was outright illegal.   Ambassador Taylor learned of the hold on July 18. He said the  ``directive had come from the President to the Chief of Staff to OMB''  and that he ``sat in astonishment'' because ``one of the key pillars of  our strong support for Ukraine was threatened.''   David Holmes, a diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, testified that  he was shocked by the hold. Although there was initially some question  as to whether the hold applied to DOD funds, which was already cleared  by Congress, it soon became clear that the hold applied to all $391  million.   Tim Morrison testified that DOD officials raised concerns at a  meeting on July 23 about whether it was ``actually legally permissible  for the President to not allow for the disbursement of the funding.''  These concerns related to possible violations of the Impoundment  Control Act, the law that gives a President the authority to delay or  withhold funds only if Congress is notified of those intentions and  approves the proposed action. Of course, neither of those things had  been done. The issue was escalated quickly, and at a senior-level  meeting on July 26, OMB remained the lone voice for holding the aid.  According to Tim Morrison, OMB said that President Trump was concerned  about corruption in Ukraine. Cooper, from DOD, also attended the July  meeting. She received no further understanding of what was meant by  ``corruption.'' There was never a principals meeting convened on this  issue, but there was a fourth and final interagency meeting on July 31.  Remember that date? A fourth and final one.   There is a process for making sure that U.S. aid money makes it to  the right place, to the right people.   Mr. Chief Justice, I do see a lot of Members moving and taking a  break. Would you like to take a break at this time? I have another,  probably, 15 minutes.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. I think we can continue.
