 Madam Chair, my amendment, which is part of the en bloc  amendment 2, transfers $3.6 million to the Department of Commerce  Management account from NOAA's Operations, Research, and Facilities  account to facilitate the transfer of the Office of Space Commerce and  the Office of Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs back to  where they are authorized by statute, thereby advancing U.S. leadership  in space commerce and commercial remote sensing.
