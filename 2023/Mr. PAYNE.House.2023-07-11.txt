 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Team USA's recent  World Lacrosse Championship.   On July 1, the U.S. defeated Canada 10-7 to claim the title. It was  the second straight championship for the U.S. Men's team, and the 11th  time in 14 tournaments that the U.S. has won it all.   This year, the team was a perfect seven wins and zero losses through  the tournament, and it scored an incredible 86 goals in seven games.   The team was led by tournament Most Valuable Player Brennan O'Neill.  As the youngest player on the U.S. national team, O'Neill scored 5  goals in the final and scored 15 goals throughout the tournament. But  it was O'Neill's goal with close to 2 minutes left that sealed the  victory for the Americans.   Again, I congratulate the U.S. team for its World Lacrosse  Championship and hope we celebrate them again after next year's  tournament.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for  giving me the opportunity to speak on this issue tonight, and I also  thank my colleague, the gentleman from Illinois.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the U.S. Supreme Court's  horrible decision to reject affirmative action in college admissions.   Last month, the Court ruled that affirmative action programs and  college admissions violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but that ruling opposes decades of  Supreme Court decisions that said just the opposite. They said that the  use of race as an admissions factor was consistent with the 14th  Amendment.   In 1978, the Court said that institutions of higher learning had the  right to pursue a diverse student body to advance academic freedom, and  they could consider race as a factor to evaluate college applications  if it was one of many factors.   In 2003, the Court reaffirmed this ruling because student diversity  is a compelling interest in education. In addition, these policies  helped counter the historical racism that denied educational  opportunities to African Americans and other minorities, and it was  working.   In public universities nationwide, minority enrollment increased when  race was one factor of admissions. These minority students equaled or  exceeded the successes of their White peers in a variety of academic  fields when they graduated.   Today, these policies help foster a rich and diverse environment for  all Americans in higher education, and they help minority students  secure higher paying jobs in STEM fields such as engineering and  science.                                time  2030    However, the Supreme Court has decided that this type of equality is  bad for America. It wants to reject the fact that race has been a  factor in college admissions for decades. Unfortunately, it was used as  the only factor to reject candidates and not one of many factors to  consider when accepting them.   I am outraged that the Supreme Court has rejected a successful policy  that has helped millions of Black and other minority students receive  the quality education they deserve.   At one time, they weren't allowed to enter these schools. What was  the reason? Was it because of many factors that they could not attend  these schools? No. It was one factor--their race.   It is yet another indication of how our country is slowly returning  to a time when equal opportunities were not afforded to all Americans.  The Court said that race-related admission standards violated the Equal  Protection Clause, but where was that Equal Protection Clause during  slavery and Jim Crow? Where is that equal protection today in housing,  workforce hiring, and voting rights?   Conservative Justices and politicians want to pretend that our  country has no racial issues. They are not connected to reality in that  thinking.   This decision is yet another roadblock to success for Black Americans  in this country, but we have overcome them before, and we will overcome  them again. I will continue to fight to help us overcome these  roadblocks wherever we find them, and I will not stop until we have  racial justice and equality for all Americans in this country.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Bowman).
