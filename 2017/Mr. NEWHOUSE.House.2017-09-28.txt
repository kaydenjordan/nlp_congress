 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and memory of  Major General Timothy Lowenberg, former Adjutant General of the  Washington State National Guard.   After attending law school, Tim served on Active Duty at McChord Air  Force Base before joining the Washington National Guard as a Judge  Advocate Staff Officer.   He was promoted to Adjutant General, honorably serving Washington  State and our Nation. He stood up for our citizen soldiers, worked to  ensure that the National Guard had the resources it needed, and oversaw  multiple deployments to the Middle East.   In addition, Tim established the Washington Youth Academy, providing  an education and opportunity for at-risk youth across the State.   As a member of the Washington legislature, I was pleased to work with  him on this, a cause that he was very passionate about, and was able to  see his vision become a success.   Upon retirement, he continued to serve his country and community. He  will be missed by many, but his legacy of determination, kindness, and  dutiful service to Washington and these United States lives on.   Please join me in remembering Major General Timothy Lowenberg, my  friend.                            ____________________
