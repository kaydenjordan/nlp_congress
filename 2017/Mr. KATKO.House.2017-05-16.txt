 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the courage and  commitment of our policemen and -women across this great country. Every  day, individuals donning the police shield risk their lives to protect  and serve our local communities.   Having served as a Federal organized crime prosecutor for 20 years, I  have had the distinct pleasure and honor of working with countless  police organizations across this country, including in my hometown,  such as the Syracuse Police Department, the Syracuse Gang Violence Task  Force, and the Onondaga County Sheriff's Department, among many others.  Together, we worked to make Syracuse safer by going after drug and gang  organizations that plague our community. While I now proudly represent  New York's 24th Congressional District, their mission continues.   I am elated that this body will consider two bills, the Thin Blue  Line Act and the Probation Officer Protection Act, that will help  protect these individuals who protect us every day. Further, I have a  bill that will be debated tomorrow. This bill will help fusion centers  disseminate information to our policemen and -women as they continue to  tackle new and adapting threats across this country.   Again, I would like to thank all our Nation's police officers and  honor them this day for their dutiful service.                            ____________________
