 Madam President, if you have any memory of the Soviet  Union, you can remember that when Moscow was in its ascendancy in that  region of the world, their plan included a revision of history. They  rewrote chapters of history to make themselves look stronger and better  and smarter and more powerful than they ever were.   And we used to mock that in the West and say: Don't they know that  history speaks for itself? The facts speak for themselves. They did it  time and again.   It was usually the product of authoritarian rule, where one man-- strongman--would want his version of history to be written in the books  and taught to the children.   Last week, we saw an exercise in Soviet revisionism in, of all  places, Salt Lake City, UT. The Republican National Committee met in  Salt Lake City, UT, for a national conference, and representatives came  from all over the United States.   What they did to start that conference off was to censure two  Republican House Members, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger from Illinois.  To me, it was the lowest of low tactics to attack these two individuals  who are making a bipartisan effort with the January 6, 2021, House  committee to  [[Page S532]]  get to the bottom of what happened that day and who was responsible for  it.   You might remember that there was a proposal from Speaker Pelosi that  we create a bipartisan Commission wherein the House and Senate  Democrats and Republicans would turn this matter over, as we have  before to a group, to determine what happened that day and what was  behind it to avoid its ever happening again and to get one clear  definition for history from this bipartisan Commission.   The Commission idea was stopped by Senator McConnell, the Republican  leader in the Senate. He refused to agree on this bipartisan approach.  So Speaker Pelosi, realizing she had a scant majority in the House,  said that she was going to still try to put such an investigation  together. She invited Republican participation, which didn't work out  well. Eventually, two stepped forward--Congresswoman Cheney and  Congressman Kinzinger--and said they would participate.   I know Adam Kinzinger. He is from my State. We have worked on a few  things together. I respect him for his political courage time and again  to speak out as he has. I am sorry that he was the subject of that  censure.   Sadly, that was not the only mistake made in the Salt Lake City  Republican revisionary meeting. What was even worse, if anything could  be worse, was the declaration by the Republican National Committee that  what happened in this building--in this room--on January 6, 2021, was  somehow characterized by a unanimous vote as legitimate political  discourse.   The Acting President pro tempore remembers that day, and I do, too. I  can't forget it. It was when Vice President Pence was sitting where you  are today, and a few minutes after 2 o'clock, the Secret Service came  in and whisked him off the platform. We were told there was an attack  on the Capitol taking place.   Earlier, there had been a rally, sponsored by President Trump, and he  had incited this insurrectionist mob to come up to the Capitol to be  heard and seen. They knew why that day was chosen. January 6 was the  day we were counting the electoral college vote--the official vote on  the selection of Joseph Biden as President of the United States. It was  the intention of President Trump and those who came here to interrupt  that constitutional process.   It is interesting as well that last week, Vice President Pence, at a  Federalist Society meeting, spoke out on the subject and said for the  first time that I can recall since he was chosen as Vice President  that, in fact, President Trump was wrong--wrong in believing that he  had the power as Vice President to change the electoral college vote.  Pence made it clear that he did not have that authority.   Well, the Republican National Committee went further in trying to  promote the Big Lie and called what happened on January 6 in this  Capitol Building legitimate political discourse.   Do they honestly believe that breaking down the windows and doors of  this building to enter as an unruly mob is legitimate political  discourse?   Do they believe that spraying toxic bear spray in the faces of our  policemen is legitimate political discourse?   Do they believe that 140 injured policemen and 5 people who are  deceased as a result of that mob action was somehow legitimate  political discourse and that, as they came into the Chamber--these  demonstrators who were aping themselves in front of cameras for their  friends to take pictures--sitting in the chair where the Acting  President pro tempore is sitting today and going through my desk and  other desks here to see if there was anything they could take a picture  of or steal--that that was legitimate political discourse?    Do they believe that incitement to violence by President Trump to  send this mob up here was legitimate political discourse?   Shame on the Grand Old Party. Shame on Mr. Lincoln's party. They  should know better. I am glad that a handful have stood up and spoken  up. I wish more would.   If we are ever going to put an end to Trumpism in this country and in  the Republican Party, only the Republicans can get it done. They have  to decide that enough is enough and step forward.   It is interesting to me that, when Senator McConnell came to the  floor a few minutes ago, he talked about the statement of some Big Ten  professor--he didn't name his name--who was not respectful of our  police. Of all of the things that happened in the last week that were  not respectful of the police, I would certainly add the Salt Lake City  Republican national meeting, where the attack on our police was  characterized as legitimate political discourse. An incitement to  violence was legitimate political discourse.   America is better than that. I sincerely hope that real leaders  within the Republican Party will reclaim their party and put an end to  this madness that Trumpism has brought them.                            ____________________     Madam President, on an entirely different subject, on  March 26, 2020, America passed a grim milestone when 1,000 Americans  died that day of COVID--front page news. Two months later, after  Memorial Day, we passed another terrible milestone when 100,000 had  died of COVID. As many Americans had died from COVID as from the  Korean, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars combined. By this past  September, the number of Americans who had been lost to COVID hit  695,000--memorialized in a heartbreaking sea of small, white flags that  covered our National Mall. This weekend, the United States hit another  staggering milestone--900,000 Americans dead from COVID. In Illinois,  there have been 31,000 lives lost.   COVID-19 is now the third leading cause of death in the United  States, behind only heart disease and cancer. At the rate we are going,  experts say it is likely the United States will reach 1 million COVID  deaths in just a few weeks.   What makes these numbers even more tragic is that so many of the  deaths could have been prevented. COVID vaccines are safe and free and  highly effective at preventing COVID hospitalization and death. Think  about this: According to new data from the CDC, unvaccinated  individuals are 97 times more likely to die of COVID compared to those  who have been vaccinated and boosted--97 times more likely to die if  you are unvaccinated.   Just last night, I watched ``60 Minutes.'' There was a presentation  by nurses in Louisville, KY, the home State of the Republican leader.  They talked about the devastating toll on their emotions and even their  physical bodies when it comes to the deaths that they have to witness  every day. They are beaten down, these nurses. They say that some 25  percent, if I remember correctly, have already resigned and have said  they can't take it anymore. And to think how many of those  hospitalizations could have been avoided if vaccinations had become  universal across this country as they should be.   Well, this evening, Members of Congress will gather on the steps of  the Capitol for a moment of silence to remember the 900,000 souls we  have lost to this virus. May their families and loved ones find peace.   We have the tools and knowledge to bring this pandemic under control  if only we would use them.                            ____________________     Madam President, there was another set of numbers that  was released last Friday that testifies to good news, and America needs  it. It testifies to the resilience of the American people and the  American spirit.   Many economists had braced for a disastrous January jobs report. The  most optimistic among them predicted that the U.S. economy might grow  by 150,000 or maybe 250,000 jobs last month. Some warned that it could  show massive job losses. Here is what we learned:    Despite the Omicron surge and the global supply chain shortages, U.S.  employers added 467,000 new jobs last month--467,000. On top of that,  the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows us the economy added 700,000 more  jobs in November and December than we initially calculated. All told,  the U.S. economy has added 6.6 million jobs in the last year--the  strongest first-year job gain of any President in history.   When Joe Biden took over the office a little over a year ago, he  inherited  [[Page S533]]  one of the weakest and fraught economies in generations.   At the start of the pandemic, the U.S. unemployment rate spiked to  14.7 percent. Last February, the Congressional Budget Office forecasted  that the United States would not see 3.9 percent unemployment for  another 5 years. The unemployment rate now is actually 4 percent.  America's economic recovery is breaking records. The United States was  the first country in the G7 to recover all of its GDP lost by the  pandemic. Average wages were up 5.7 percent last month from a year ago.  The increases were not all at the top; workers in the middle and lower  rungs of the economy earned more too.   I have to say, as important as that is, we all know that people  working in this economy are also facing inflation and higher prices.  Whether it is for gasoline or groceries, they are finding it more  expensive to meet the basic necessities of life. Although this is good  news, that is bad news that we have to address and should address on a  bipartisan basis.   The progress that we have made was not inevitable; it was a product  of good old-fashioned American ingenuity. It is also the result of bold  and decisive economic decisions by the Biden administration.   The American Rescue Plan, which Congress passed without the support  of a single Republican Member of Congress--all Democrats all the way-- broke the grip of the pandemic on our economy. We were able to get  shots in arms, help small businesses stay afloat, and rush emergency  assistance to people who had lost jobs or had seen their hours cut  drastically. That emergency help worked in Illinois, and it worked all  over this country.   We also passed the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.  Let me remind those who follow, if you are wondering about the  infrastructure bill passed by the Trump administration, let me put your  concern to rest. There was no bill. There was no legislation. There was  no infrastructure plan despite President Trump's repeated promises to  deliver one. He walked away from the table, and I was in the room when  he did. He wouldn't even negotiate.   We have not fixed all of the weaknesses in our economy. The jobless  rate among Black workers is still twice that of White workers.  Unemployment among teens and young adults is still too high. Research  from the National Women's Law Center shows that, while men have  recouped all job losses since the pandemic started, there are nearly  1.1 million fewer women in the workforce. Daycare is part of that  calculation, I might add. If we want to reach our full economic  potential, we need to help families find affordable, quality daycare,  and we have to address the issue of inflation nonstop.                            ____________________     Madam President, last year, for the first time in more  than two decades, America's economy grew faster than China's. That is  incredible. Let's keep that streak going by passing USICA, the  bipartisan U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. We need to promote  products made in the United States by Americans and purchased in the  United States. We passed it in the Senate last June by a vote of 2 to  1. The House passed its version last Friday. Let's go to conference and  get this bill into law. If we negotiate in good faith, I believe we can  do that.   I want to thank Leader Schumer and Senator Young, a Republican from  Indiana, for their leadership.   This will boost competitiveness with China and help to  reindustrialize America, make investments in manufacturing and  research, and provide seed money to create good new jobs. Importantly,  it includes $52 billion for research and designing and manufacturing  semiconductor chips--what Senator Cantwell, chair of the Commerce  Committee, calls the ``oil of the 21st century.'' Let's agree to make  those chips here in America and not be dependent on importing them from  China.   USICA also allows for new sanctions against China for human rights  violations. We can stand up for American workers and American values.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Heinrich), the Senator  from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff)  are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senators from New Mexico (Mr. Heinrich) and (Mr.  Lujan), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff) are necessarily  absent.
