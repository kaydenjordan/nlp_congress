 Madam Speaker, last year, we achieved the best  year of job creation in history.   The bipartisan infrastructure law will build on this historic growth,  putting Americans to work, rebuilding our roads, bridges, water  systems, and more. And the COMPETES Act, which invests in American  research, innovation, and manufacturing will capitalize on this  investment in our infrastructure and ensure the technologies of the  future are made right here in America.   The COMPETES Act will accelerate the production of semiconductors. It  will strengthen our supply chain. It will boost our scientific  leadership. And it will support good-paying domestic manufacturing  jobs. Intel's recent $20 billion investment in a new computer chip  plant in Ohio shows the path to the future.   As President Biden said in his State of the Union, it is time to bury  the term ``Rust Belt.'' With the COMPETES Act, we can make more in  America. And I know Ohio workers stand ready to lead the American  manufacturing comeback.                            ____________________
