 Madam Speaker, I thank all the Members  of the North Carolina delegation for making me feel so much at home. I  thank all the Members for the warm welcome.   Just a moment of thanks:   I would like to thank my God for giving me the opportunity of life  and the ability to experience all the great wonders that He has given  us.   I thank this country for the freedom it has given me as an individual  and how much I can enjoy that freedom.   I thank most of all, here in the room, my wonderful wife, Wendy, who  has been with me side by side for all these elections. She followed me  through medical school, through surgical residency, and through the  maze of raising three wonderful children. I love her with all my heart.   I thank her parents, Gary and Carol Simes, who have supported me all  the way; my cousins, Frank Wood and Betsy Wood; and all the clan who  have come from eastern North Carolina and even from Davidson College to  support me.   I thank the people of eastern North Carolina for bringing me here,  and I thank, especially, one particular member of my campaign team,  Lynda Blount, who could not be here tonight. She is with us in heart  and spirit, and we love her very, very much.   I also want to thank Congressman Walter Jones. Walter was a friend of  mine, and he was a mentor. I know he was beloved by this institution,  and I would not be here today without him.   So, Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with each and every one  of you and getting to know each and every one of you so that we can  continue to make this the greatest nation on Earth.   May God bless you all.                            ____________________
