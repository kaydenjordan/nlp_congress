 Mr. Speaker, as my Republican colleagues debate  TrumpCare amongst themselves, they speak so often of so-called  flexibility. But let's be clear about what that wink and nod to  insurance companies actually means.   For working families, flexibility is a cold euphemism for less  choice; actually, for an impossible choice between caring for a new  child or aging parent, between lifesaving treatment or your life  savings, between an inpatient bed or monthly mortgage, desperately  needed medication or food on your table, between life, and, yes, for  some, death, because the moment essential health benefits become  negotiable, they become dispensable.   And while insurance companies might enjoy that newfound flexibility,  American families and our loved ones will pay that price.                            ____________________
