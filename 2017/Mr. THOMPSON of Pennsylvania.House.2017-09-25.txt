 Madam Speaker, I rise today during  National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month.   Madam Speaker, our Nation's veterans are 22 percent more likely to  commit suicide than their nonveteran peers. This trend is troubling,  and we all must work to reverse it.   The Department of Veterans Affairs started a new campaign this month  called Be There. The campaign emphasizes small actions, such as calling  an old friend, checking on a neighbor, or inviting a colleague to go  for a walk. These small gestures may have a real impact on someone who  is struggling or feeling alone.   Suicide rates are especially high in rural areas, where veterans may  experience isolation or limited access to VA care--often for mental  health concerns. That is why I introduced the VETS Act, which seeks to  build on the VA's existing telemedicine program. It allows veterans to  receive mental healthcare from anywhere. This will give our veterans  greater access to the care they so desperately need.   Madam Speaker, our servicemen and -women answered the call of duty.  When they return home, it is our turn to be there for them.                            ____________________
