 Mr. President, first, I would like to commend my  colleague, the senior Senator from Kansas, for his incredible ongoing  leadership on the issue of the veterans of our Nation and his strong  commitment to each and every one of those veterans and to the men and  women who wear the uniform and go to battle to keep us safe and keep us  free, and it is his long history of leadership for which I am most  grateful.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
