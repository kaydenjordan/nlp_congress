 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing MAJ Daniela Ragen, U.S. Army National Guard, of Broadwater  County, as Montanan of the Month for her service to our Nation.   Daniela knew from a young age that she wanted to be a soldier. As  soon as she enlisted in the Army, Daniela faced a challenge--a language  barrier. She persisted and studied tirelessly to pass her English exams  with high scores--so high she was accused of cheating and was forced to  retake the exam. That didn't deter her. She retook the exam and passed  again with flying colors.   Following a period of service on Active Duty, Major Ragen joined the  Arizona National Guard, where she continued her career as an analyst in  the Joint Counter Narcotics Task Force. Major Ragen then enrolled in  the selective 15-month officer candidate school, where she was 1 of  only 6 participants who graduated from a starting class of 21 students.   In addition to serving her country, Daniela has served the great  State of Montana as a coordinator for the Montana National Guard  Counter Drug Program. In this position, Daniela represents the best of  both the National Guard and the State of Montana through her values of  service, leadership, and persistence. She was even selected by her  colleagues to serve as the chair for Northwest Region Advisory  Committee for the National Counterdrug Program.   On top of being an exemplary Montanan and soldier, Daniela is a wife  and a mother of five children, one of whom is currently serving in the  Montana National Guard. Her husband, LTC Chase Ragen, is also a long- serving officer in the Montana National Guard.   Major Ragen truly embodies the values of a soldier and the spirit of  a Montanan. It is my honor to recognize Daniela for her resilience,  courage, and commitment to serving her great State and country. Keep up  the great work, Major Ragen.                            ____________________
