 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the Northern  California Power Agency, also known as NCPA, on its 50th anniversary.   NCPA was established in 1968 by a consortium of locally owned  electric utilities to make joint investments in energy resources that  would ensure an affordable, reliable, and clean supply of electricity  for customers in its member communities.   The agency's mission is to provide members with reliable, efficient,  and cost-effective wholesale power and energy-related services. I can  tell you that, during my time in Congress as well as my time in the  California State Legislature, the agency meets that mission with flying  marks.   They also own and operate nearly 260 megawatts of in-state hydropower  resources that generate carbon-free electricity for Californians while  also providing many outdoor recreational benefits, helping to meet the  renewable mandate for electricity in the State.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending the NCPA  for 50 years of invaluable service to its public power members and  their respective communities.                            ____________________
