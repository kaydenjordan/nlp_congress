 Madam President, I rise today to join Granite  Staters in celebrating the 300th anniversary, as well as the rich  history and vibrant present, of the Town of Hampton Falls, NH.   Originally a parish of the Town of Hampton, Hampton Falls later was  established as an independent town, gaining its name from the falls  located on the surrounding river. The town's history is reflected in  its rural roots; many of its early residents worked in the timber  industry or on farms in the region, and it is home to one of the oldest  working apple orchards in the country. And over the last 300 years,  Hampton Falls has been home to prominent New Hampshire citizens,  including the first Governor of New Hampshire and poet John Greenleaf  Whittier.   The residents of Hampton Falls are also dedicated to preserving this  history; the Hampton Falls Historical Society's motto is ``Our future  is a present from the past.'' Learning from our past and remembering  our history is essential to a healthy democracy, and I applaud the  Hampton Falls community for its commitment to its history.   Today with its 2,400 residents, Hampton Falls remains a small-town  residential and agricultural community. From its small business  community to the orchards and horse farms that reflect its agricultural  beginnings, Hampton Falls is a vital part of New Hampshire's Seacoast.   While Hampton Falls has changed over the years, what has remained is  the strong sense of community that makes New Hampshire a great place to  live, work, visit, and raise a family.   I want to thank everyone involved in the tricentennial celebrations  happening throughout Hampton Falls this year to help mark this  milestone. I hope that the residents and visitors alike are able to  enjoy the year's events and reflect upon Hampton Falls' abundant  history and vibrant culture.                            ____________________
