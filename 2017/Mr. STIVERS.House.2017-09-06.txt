 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would transfer funding for  the Private Enforcement Initiative at HUD to the Administrative  Enforcement Initiative. The amendment does not change the top line  appropriation.   I believe the Fair Housing Act must be strongly enforced, and I  believe this is best accomplished by strengthening HUD's Administrative  Enforcement Initiative and enhancing the role of State and local  agencies in finding and punishing bad actors.   The Private Enforcement Initiative has been abused by some nonprofits  that are more interested in winning attorneys' fees than finding and  punishing bad actors. The cost of these frivolous lawsuits ultimately  is transferred onto low- and middle-income Americans in the form of  more expensive rent and housing, worsening our country's affordable  housing crisis.   I don't believe this is fair or what was intended under the Fair  Housing Act. I believe there is a better way to more strongly and  effectively enforce fair housing protections, a similar amendment  passed 2 years ago, and I encourage my colleagues to support this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H7054]]                                     time  2100     Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, in some jurisdictions there  are many abuses. ``60 Minutes'' had a great story about this. Other  media outlets have featured the abuses as well.   The gentleman argues that, gee, we can't do this in the  appropriations process. We do limitation amendments every day.  Limitation amendments are germane and effective controls that we have  in place and we are allowed to put in place on these spending programs.   I simply believe that the administrative enforcement initiative is  more effective and will use the money to better help low- and moderate- income Americans.   I disagree with the gentleman, and I urge my colleagues to support  the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would direct the gentleman, Mr.  Chairman, to a GAO report on this very program that talks about these  abuses, and I hope he takes a serious look at it.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
