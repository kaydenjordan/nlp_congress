 Mr. President, I am glad I was on the floor to hear the  Republican leader's comments about our Supreme Court nominee, Ketanji  Brown Jackson, because there are a couple of elements that he obviously  inadvertently missed that he should have reported when he was talking  about the support that she has received from across the political  spectrum. He made her out to be a product and creation of some far-left  political cause or movement, but she is much more than that.   He went on to say that Judge Thomas Griffith of the DC Circuit was  harassed by the same special interest group that supports Judge  Jackson. He missed one key element. I just received a letter within the  last 2 weeks from Judge Thomas Griffith, a well-known, retired,  conservative Federal judge, endorsing Ketanji Brown Jackson. How about  that?   It doesn't sound like a special interest group to me. It sounds like  a Republican-appointed judge who saw her in action and wants to make  sure that she gets a chance to serve on the Supreme Court of the United  States.   It makes a big difference because, if you take a look at what he had  to say about her, Judge Griffith wrote:         Judge Jackson has a demonstrated record of excellence, and       I believe, based upon her work as a trial judge when I served       on the Court of Appeals, [that] she will adjudicate based on       the facts and the law and not as a partisan.    That is exactly the opposite of the point that was being made by  Senator McConnell. She has the support across the political spectrum.  He failed to mention that she has been endorsed by the Fraternal Order  of Police.   Oh, she is supposedly suspect of being too liberal. Well, I can just  tell you that she is a person of quality, integrity, and values, and  she has the support across the political spectrum to prove it.   I believe she is going to be an extraordinary Justice on the Supreme  Court, and President Biden made a good choice in selecting her.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms.  Duckworth), the Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein), and the  Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs. Shaheen) are necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 61, nays 36, as follows:                         [Rollcall Vote No. 80 Ex.]                                  YEAS--61       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Blunt      Booker      Brown      Burr      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Cramer      Durbin      Gillibrand      Graham      Grassley      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Kaine      Kelly      Kennedy      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shelby      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Sullivan      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden                                  NAYS--36       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Capito      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Hagerty      Hawley      Inhofe      Johnson      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Paul      Portman      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Tuberville      Young                               NOT VOTING--3       Duckworth      Feinstein      Shaheen   The nomination was confirmed.
