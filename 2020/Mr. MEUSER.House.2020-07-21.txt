 Madam Speaker, since taking office, President Trump has  delivered on his promise to rebuild our military.  [[Page H3598]]    The Mac Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act fully funds the  President's budget request, authorizing funding for national defense  commitments at home and abroad.   This bill includes a 3 percent pay raise for our troops and their  families. If anyone deserves a raise, it is the brave men and women in  uniform who sacrifice so much while defending freedom around the world.   This bill also provides critical investments in artificial  intelligence and makes sure our military can prepare for and respond to  emergent threats from China and other adversaries around the world.   This bill also provides funding for the Space Force, a strategic area  where we have fallen well behind over the years.   Parts of this bill also ensure that the Department of Defense has the  resources to protect our Armed Forces from the coronavirus, with  funding for PPE and testing capabilities.   Portions of this bill show the world that the U.S. military is strong  and will preserve peace through strength, a top priority of President  Trump. This bill continues to make up for the shortfalls of the past  and sends a clear message to our servicemembers that we have their  backs.                            ____________________
