 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia  for yielding. It wasn't too long ago that we had the gentleman visit  our district in western Pennsylvania to talk to a number of folks in  the defense industry, and I just applaud him for his very serious work  on the Armed Services Committee.   He is good to highlight the situations that we come into when we see  these continuing resolutions, the damage it does to our military, the  need for long-term planning, how we have threats around the world, both  emerging threats that continue to evolve, but there are our old  adversaries and not-so-old adversaries: Russia, China, North Korea,  Iran, and global terror networks.   We could go on and on and on, but we have to have a military that is  ready to respond. And we cannot be holding our military budget hostage  to any other part of the Federal Government. It makes no sense.   Speaking of one of those adversaries, I want to talk a little bit  about Russia, because Russia has been in the news so much lately. Mr.  Speaker, I want to talk about Russia and the threat it poses to us and  our allies.   For the past 40 years or so, I would describe myself as a hawk when  it comes to Russia. As such, I would like to welcome my friends from  across the aisle who are finally starting to express their concerns  about the Russian bear. The question I have is: What took so long?   Russia has been an adversary of the United States and the West for  decades. I will spare the House a lengthy history lesson and then,  instead, focus on the recent past. This is important because in  conversations I have had back home, there are some constituents who are  unaware of that history.   Next month will mark 10 years since Russia invaded the Republic of  Georgia. In response to this, then-President George W. Bush condemned  the action saying:         The territorial integrity and borders of Georgia must be       respected, just as those of Russia or any other country.    Less than 7 months after the 2008 Georgia invasion, however, during  the opening days of the Obama administration, then-Secretary of State  Clinton presented a reset button to Russian's foreign minister, as if  it was the prior administration's fault for Russia's aggression and  consequent chilly relationship.   And mere months after hitting the reset button, we learned President  Obama was shutting down a proposed missile defense system in Poland and  the Czech Republic. Some reset.   Within the aura of this reset, a Russian bank paid Secretary  Clinton's husband $500,000 for a 1-hour speech in Moscow. That is some  billable rate, even for a Yale Law School graduate.   At the same time, a Russian company was preparing to take a  controlling interest in Uranium One, a corporation that held 20 percent  of the U.S's uranium supply. That foreign acquisition required the  approval of the Obama administration and Secretary Clinton. Approval  was granted.   Ultimately, The New York Times reported that $2.3 million of  contributions from Uranium One connections flowed to the Clinton  Foundation. But that has not seemed to draw concerns from the new  Democrat Russia hawks from across the aisle.   Later, as Secretary Clinton wrapped up her State Department tenure in  [[Page H7678]]  2012, President Obama, not aware that a microphone was picking him up  said to then-Russian President Medvedev:         This is my last election. After my election, I will have       more flexibility.    And Medvedev responded:         I will relay that to Vladimir.    That would be Vladimir Putin. The flexibility was about missile  defense. President Obama even mocked Mitt Romney in a 2012 Presidential  debate after Romney identified Russia as our biggest geopolitical  threat.   President Obama glibly responded to Romney: ``And, the 1980s are now  calling to ask for their foreign policy back . . . ''   During President Obama's second term, we saw continued indifference  towards Russia, Crimea, Eastern Ukraine, the downing of Malaysia  Airlines Flight 17, Russian violations of the Reagan-Gorbachev  Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, ceding Middle East influence  that fueled the growth of ISIS, and failure to respond to Bashar al- Assad's use of chemical weapons, to name a few. And not once do I  recall ever hearing a peep from my friends across the aisle, even after  President Obama drew his infamous red line.   Let's compare the response to the shooting down of Korean Airlines  Flight 007 to that of flight MH17. Brilliantly, U.N. Ambassador Jeane  Kirkpatrick publicly prosecuted and convicted Russia at the United  Nations for shooting down KAL Flight 007, which killed 269 innocent  civilians, including Congressman Larry McDonald.   The KAL 007 shoot down dramatically increased our resolve to collapse  the evil empire. However, the Obama administration never thoroughly  prosecuted the case for Russia's culpability for the MH17 shoot down.   In the midst of all this, Russia was plotting to interfere in our  elections. Ignoring the 1980s calling about the foreign policy, the  Obama administration did not take the Russia threat seriously. They  never picked up the voicemail that the 1980s left.   It was the last administration's failure to understand the threat  that Russia posed that virtually paved the way for the aggressive  Russia we see today. Throughout the Obama administration, Secretary  Clinton and others failed to confront Russian hostility, the result of  a reset button.   The reality is that Vladimir Putin wants to sow discord in the West.  He would cause trouble to whoever was in the White House.  Interestingly, when Putin said in Helsinki that he wanted Trump to win,  it was amazing to see people accept his remarks without a hint of  skepticism, even though Putin is a former KGB agent and a master of  disinformation. Let me repeat that. Vladimir Putin is a former KGB  agent and a master of disinformation.    It is President Trump that wants to arm Ukrainians. He is demanding  that Germany stop buying gas from Russia. He is advancing American  energy development, as opposed to the Obama administration that sought  to curtail it. And when Russia's puppet, Assad, used chemical weapons  on his own people, President Trump responded with military force.   From that perspective, would Putin, the master of disinformation,  really have preferred President Trump over President Clinton? The  American people can draw their own conclusions. While my friends across  the aisle seem to have awoken to the threat that Russia presents, going  forward, I hope they remain as concerned about Russia and President  Putin as they are about President Trump.   For starters, they could show up by helping to get to the bottom of  the Uranium One scandal. Meanwhile, on our side of the aisle, we take  Russia seriously and have done so for decades. We are providing  military assistance to Ukraine. We are passing new Russian sanctions  legislation on top of what we passed earlier this year. We are the ones  countering Russia's influence in the Middle East and their ally, Iran.   When it comes to checking Russia, it is Republicans, not Democrats,  who have the established record of doing so, and we will continue to do  that for as long as Russian hostility exists.   I simply implore President Trump to be vigilant and clear and heed  the concerns of my fellow Republican legislators who have engaged on  Russian matters for years.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his work on this area.
