 I thank the Senator from Oregon. I agree that the report  required by the IAA on PPD-28 is critically important and central to  the committee's oversight responsibilities. I share the Senator's  dismay that this provision was modified in this way and through what I  consider to be an unfortunate conference process that should not be  repeated. More generally, I oppose legislation that would purport to  restrict full committee access and impede the critical oversight  provided by the full committee.   This provision, as modified, states that the DNI will submit the  report to the chairman and vice chairman. It does not, however,  preclude its provision to the other members of the committee. As vice  chairman of the committee, it is my intent to push for the full  committee to get this report. It is also my intent to seek to amend  this language so that it is not misinterpreted to limit full committee  access.    I agree. I strongly supported each of the five  whistleblower protection provisions in the IAA. It is my intent to keep  fighting for them so that they are on next year's IAA and are passed  into law.
