 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the heroism of  two New Jersey State troopers, Trooper Robert Tarleton and State Police  Lieutenant Edward Ryer.   On March 2, Trooper Tarleton was stopped and talking with a driver on  I-287 in Bridgewater, New Jersey, when a tractor-trailer ran off the  road, hit a structure, and burst into flames.   Trooper Tarleton immediately ran toward the scene, where he met  Lieutenant Ryer, who was off-duty but had stopped to help.   With no thought to their personal safety, they grabbed the  incapacitated driver from the wreckage, dragging him to safety seconds  before the truck exploded.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Trooper Tarleton and Lieutenant Ryer for their  selfless actions that saved a man's life.   I also want to take a moment to recognize the everyday acts of  heroism by our law enforcement officers that may not make the news or  be captured on a body cam, as this one was.   We call them when we need help, and no matter how dangerous the  situation, they always come. We are grateful.                            ____________________
