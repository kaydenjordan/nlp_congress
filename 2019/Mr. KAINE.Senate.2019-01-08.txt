 Mr. President, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent  that following my remarks, Senator Risch be permitted to speak for up  to 5 minutes.    Mr. President, tonight following this vote, Senator  Shaheen and I have organized a group of more than 15 Democrats who will  take the floor to talk about the effect of the government shutdown in  each of our States. We will talk about the effect on workers, on  families, and on citizens needing services. I don't want to repeat what  I will say in about an hour, but I want to address the issue of the  vote that is now coming before us.   The vote is a vote to proceed to a number of issues that are  important to the security of other nations. I am the cosponsor of one  of bills that is before us--a U.S.-Israel security assistance bill--and  strongly, strongly support it, but as passionate as I have been for the  security of the nation of Israel, I am every bit as passionate about  the security of the United States, and I think the first business of  this Senate should be to reopen the Government of the United States.   I think to take any other action or to focus on any other issue when  we have bipartisan bills pending in the Senate that have been supported  by our Republican colleagues that would reopen government--to skip by  those bills and push them aside for another 18 days or longer--makes  absolutely no sense.   So I will be opposing the motion that is on the floor this evening  because the first business of this body should be to reopen government.   I think of the question that Abraham Lincoln raised at Gettysburg. He  talked about this Nation dedicated to the proposition that all are  created equal and the question about whether any nation dedicated to  that proposition can long endure. I don't think President Lincoln, the  founder of the modern Republican Party, would have supported a  government shutdown for a year, for a week, for a day, or for a minute.  This issue that is on the table before us is about the endurance of the  United States Government and giving people confidence in us that we  support the government's operation.   We should not take up other items until we take up the bipartisan  proposal before this body and make sure that the government of the  United States is funded and that people are protected.   I yield the floor.                                     S. 1     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise, together with a number of  colleagues who will follow me tonight, to talk about the need to end  the Trump shutdown and to reopen the government of the greatest Nation  on Earth. I am glad to have so many colleagues here who each will share  the stories that have been experienced by folks living in our States  regarding a shutdown that has now gone on for 18 days and will soon  become the longest shutdown in the history of the U.S. Government.   The shutdown is unnecessary, the shutdown is embarrassing, and the  shutdown is painful. It is unnecessary. Why punish American workers?  Why punish American citizens? No patriotic leader in their right mind  would want to do that.   The thing that is so troubling about this shutdown is that the  overwhelming majority of people who are affected are not connected to  the dispute between Congress and the President over immigration reform  and border security. Why should that dispute lead to farmers not being  able to reach their extension agents? Why should that dispute lead to  small businesses not getting their small business loan applications  processed? Why should a dispute about immigration block the courts of  DC from issuing marriage licenses to people?   The President praying for, urging, and then being proud of a shutdown  is hurting all kinds of people who are completely unconnected with the  issue in dispute between Congress and the President. In that sense, it  is unnecessary.   Second, it is unnecessary because there are bills on the floor right  now that would solve this--bills that are bipartisan, bills that were  supported by the Presiding Officer and other Republican colleagues in  the Chamber just a few weeks ago. If we took action right now, we could  stop the punishment. We could end the pain--the gratuitous pain--that  is affecting American families and workers.   The shutdown is unnecessary. The shutdown is embarrassing. This is  the United States of America. This is the greatest Nation on Earth. The  fact that we are in an 18-day shutdown of critical components of our  government, where people are not getting paychecks and citizens are not  being served, is beneath what we should aspire to as Americans and  certainly as U.S. Senators.   Finally, before I yield to my colleague from New Hampshire, the  shutdown is painful. There are statistics about the numbers affected  during the shutdown. Others may get into the statistics; I just want to  share stories because Virginians are reaching out to Senator Warner and  me and sharing their stories with us.   Allen is a veteran and a Federal civil servant in Yorktown, VA. He  has been working without pay since the shutdown began. He wrote to our  office saying that his emergency savings are exhausted, he is behind on  his bills, and the situation will not get any better as long as his  Agency is unfunded. I will repeat that. Allen is a veteran who  voluntarily served the military, this country, and this is how this  President is treating him.   Joanna is from Woodbridge, VA. She wrote to me saying that she  doesn't know what she will do if she doesn't get paid by the end of the  month, as her family ``can't afford to miss a single paycheck.'' She  writes that ``even a slight decrease'' in her pay means her family  cannot afford their rent.   A family from Culpeper wrote to me wondering how they will feed their  children and pay their mortgage without being paid for their service to  our government. They say that if this shutdown goes on for a month or  more, they will have to worry about losing their home.   Michael and Chris, two Federal employees in Annandale, have three  kids, two in college. They are going to have to miss their kids'  tuition payments that are due for the semester this month. If the  shutdown continues, they are not sure whether they will be able to make  their mortgage payment.   James is a furloughed Federal employee from Fredericksburg. He says  he is the ``sole breadwinner'' for his family. He tells me a shutdown  that goes into months would spell financial ruin for his family and  others.   A Virginian from Haymarket wrote me and told me that her loved one is  a Federal employee who is working without pay. She had to postpone a  necessary medical procedure because their family could no longer cover  the costs of copays for testing and surgery.   Teresa is a Federal employee from Springfield. She is worried about  paying her mortgage, utilities, food and more, but most of all, she is  worried about the health of her son, Tommy. Tommy has a disability. She  writes: Because of his medical fragility, Tommy must have numerous  prescription medications; therefore, there are copays to pay. Missing a  single dose could land him in the ICU. President Trump needs to stop  holding Federal employees hostage. When I start missing paychecks,  Tommy is possibly jeopardized in his own life.  [[Page S50]]    Finally, John--a NASA contractor from Virginia--and his wife, who  also works for the same Agency, have lost 100 percent of their  household income since President Trump's shutdown started. Get this:  Their daughter, who lives at home, is a schoolteacher, and it is their  schoolteacher daughter who is helping pay for the parents' expenses  during this shutdown.   The shutdown is unnecessary. The shutdown is embarrassing. The  shutdown is painful. We need to end the Trump shutdown and reopen the  government.   With that, I yield the floor to my colleague from New Hampshire.    Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?    Mr. President, prior to Senator Markey, I wanted to ask  Senator Heinrich this: If I heard correctly, you indicated that half a  million New Mexicans are currently participating in the SNAP program.    What is the total population of New Mexico?    So nearly one-quarter of the State is participating in the  Food Stamp Program that is jeopardized by this shutdown.   To the Senator from New Mexico, are you aware that 95 percent of the  employees of the Agency that administers SNAP have been sent home and  furloughed? Are you aware of that?    That is causing problems not only for your half a million  but for any new family who falls into hunger and needs to apply for  SNAP every day.    Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from  Massachusetts.    Mr. President, I would like to finish the colloquy of the  Democratic Senators who talked about this important issue--the need to  reopen the government and to stop the shutdown--and I intend to do so  before 9 o'clock. I want to thank my colleague from New Hampshire and  all the colleagues who appeared on the floor today.   On Friday, January 11, if we do not end this shutdown, it will be  tied for the longest shutdown of government in the history of the  United States. It is also a payday where more than 800,000 Federal  employees will not get a paycheck. My quick census research suggests  that is essentially the population of South Dakota. More than 800,000  people who just want to serve their country, some of whom have been  forced to work without a paycheck, will not get a paycheck on January.   Friday, January 11, is right after Christmas, when a lot of Christmas  bills come due. Friday, January 11, is in the middle of winter, when  heating bills are at their highest. Friday, January 11, is right before  the beginning of the college spring semester, and families will be  sitting around kitchen tables to write tuition checks for their kids to  go to school for the spring semester. That will be this Friday.   This shutdown hurts workers. I told stories of workers in Virginia  who have already suffered, and my colleagues have as well.   It hurts citizens. I had the experience two Saturdays ago of going to  four Federal--either national forests or Park Service operations and  seeing gates closed. I watched families come up. They had driven. They  may not get a lot of vacation. They had a lot of kids in the car, and  they were coming up to have fun with their families that day. I watched  the looks on their faces as they pulled to the locations and saw the  gates closed and the sign saying that they weren't able to enjoy the  day they had planned with their family. That is not the same as missing  a mortgage payment, but for families who are stretched in time and want  to spend a day enjoying time with each other--I saw the looks on their  faces as they were turned away.   Mr. President, you and I have worked together on an important  initiative to train students, college students, to be our next cyber  professionals. Today is the cyber jobs fair that the National Science  Foundation sponsors for college students all over the country. It was  at National Harbor. I went there. I walked by a lot of students who had  come because they want to serve the country as cyber professionals, and  they were having interviews. But a lot of the booths--the Department of  Justice--there was a booth, there was a sign, but there was nobody  there. There was nobody there from the Federal Agency to hire.   These are effects on everyday citizens, kids who want jobs, Federal  agencies that want to hire workers, families who just want to go to the  parks.   This is hurting workers, it is hurting citizens, and it is hurting  our country.   In conclusion, I just want to say: Why? Why would we want to hurt  Federal workers? Why would we want them to be without a paycheck? Why  do we want to hurt everyday citizens? Why do we want to hurt the  reputation of the country?   Because I could see from the looks on the faces of those getting  turned away at the park not just aggravation, I could see: What kind of  country is this? I am a hard-working person, I pay taxes, I am coming  to a national park, I am coming to a national forest, and I am getting  turned away because the President wants to shut down the government  over a debate about border security.   You know, Mr. President, because you and I worked on it together, in  February, $25 billion for border security, that wasn't enough. The  President blew up the deal. Five years ago, $44 billion of border  security wasn't enough for the Republican House.   We want to fund border security, but as I conclude, I just would say  to this President: Do not hurt American workers. Do not hurt American  citizens. Do not hurt the reputation of the greatest country on Earth.   I would say to my Republican colleagues, please be willing to vote  and support exactly what you voted and supported just 3 weeks ago.   Why the change in position? Why was it OK in December, and it is not  OK now? Is it not OK because the President suddenly said he didn't like  it? Is it the job of the article I branch to play Mother May I with the  President and seek his permission to be an article I branch? I don't  believe it is. Let's end this shutdown. Let's reopen government. Let's  do border security and immigration reform the right way.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
