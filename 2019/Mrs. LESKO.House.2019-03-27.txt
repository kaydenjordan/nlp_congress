 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas,  Representative Burgess, for yielding me time on this most important  issue.   First, I would like to talk about the underlying bill. Equal work  does deserve equal pay, regardless of the sex of the employee. In  America, this is already the law of the land, and it has been since  1963 when Congress passed the Equal Pay Act. However, we stand here  today debating a rule for a partisan Democrat bill that offers no  protections against pay discrimination in the workplace. Instead, the  bill makes it easier for trial lawyers to score unlimited paydays while  dragging working women through never-ending legal dramas.   This bill also prevents women from utilizing their expertise, skills,  talents, and education to their advantage. It effectively ties  employers' hands from considering factors that would allow them to  potentially give employees better working environments or for employees  to negotiate a higher salary.   According to Camille Olson, who testified as a witness in the House  Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Human Services and on the House  Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, there can indeed be unintended  negative consequences from this bill.   Let me read an example from her written testimony. This is her  statement, and she gave an example.   It basically says: In this example an employer has chosen to pay a  higher salary to a female law firm office administrator who has a J.D.  degree. The job duties for that position do not include legal work.  Nevertheless, in the employer's judgment, the performance of those job  duties will be enhanced by the additional qualifications of a J.D.,  justifying the higher salary.   In this example, the male employee had a lesser degree. So in this  example--because in this bill it requires business necessity--the male  could sue. Even though he doesn't have as high a degree as the woman,  he could say: I want equal pay.   So, what I am trying to say is because of the wording of this bill, I  believe--and the witness in the committees believes--there are  unintended consequences that could actually hurt women.   The employee may have a claim even if the advanced degree does  actually improve performance or serve another legitimate business goal  where it was not absolutely required for the job, because of the  business necessity requirement in the bill.   This example may not be the exception. As our economy and culture  shifts, we are finding ourselves in a world where women are attending  and graduating college far more often than men. According to the U.S.  Department of Education data, nearly 60 percent of those who graduated  with a bachelor's degree were women. So, certainly, we do not want the  unintended consequences of an employer not being able to consider the  advanced education of a woman under this business necessity language in  the bill.   H.R. 7 is more of the same from the new majority: government knows  best. It will tie the hands of employers and prevent employees-- especially female employees--from negotiating a salary and working  environment that works for them and their family. It is already against  the law to discriminate, and commonsense approaches to amending the law  were summarily rejected by my colleagues from the other side of the  aisle.   Madam Speaker, if the previous question is defeated, we would amend  this rule to include a simple change. It provides working parents more  flexibility so that they can go to baseball games and science fairs; in  other words, to be better parents.    I would like to read a portion of that amendment:         Notwithstanding the other provisions of the subsection, an       employee and an employer may voluntarily negotiate       compensation and benefits to provide flexibility to best meet       the needs of such employee and employer consistent with other       provisions of this act.     We all know that the greatest benefit working parents  with young children want and value is flexibility. Our concern is that  this radical proposal which is called paycheck fairness would actually  limit the flexibility employers can give to working parents, so parents  can go to their activities.   This amendment is a very simple amendment. It simply restates the law  and makes it clear that if you run a dry cleaner with five people in  it, you don't have to hire a lawyer to define a job for an employee  with a child in such a way that the employee can go to the science fair  or a baseball game.   Instead of being about more litigation and trial lawyers, it is about  giving more flexibility for working parents. Working Americans should  have the freedom to choose what is best for them and their families,  not the Federal Government. Hardworking men and women need more  flexibility to balance work, life, and family. This amendment seeks to  provide additional relief in this area.   Madam Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question and ``no'' on  the underlying measure.  [[Page H2846]]                                     time  1300
