 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and my friend as well  for holding this Special Order tonight. I agree with the comments my  colleagues have made here on the floor this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to underscore the severity of the  situation at our southern border. We are in the midst of a real crisis,  and we must act now.   According to Homeland Security, in the last 2 months, our Border  Patrol has apprehended roughly 140,000 illegal immigrants at the  southern border. This is an increase of 86 percent over the same period  last year. Additionally, there were more than 25,000 families  apprehended last November. This is the highest monthly number ever  recorded by Border Patrol.   Mr. Speaker, here in Congress, my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle are talking about this issue as though it is something new. This  is not a new issue. For the past decade, the people who I represent in  southeast Alabama have consistently expressed to me their frustrations  with our country's illegal immigration problem.   I believe now is the time that we must use every tool available to  enhance border security. And we must do it now. We cannot wait another  decade.   I really appreciate the gentlewoman taking this time, her leadership  on this issue tonight, and her giving me the opportunity to speak.                                time  1745
