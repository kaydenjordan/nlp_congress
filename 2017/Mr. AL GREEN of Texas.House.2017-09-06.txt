 Mr. Speaker, I also thank the ranking member  for her kind words. I would like to thank the chairperson for bringing  this to the floor, both of them.   Mr. Speaker, this is a seminal moment in time, a moment in time that  can shape the rest of our time. This is an opportunity for those of us  who contend that we are our brother's keeper to, in fact, become our  brother's keeper. You see, you can't be your brother's keeper without  keeping your brother. This is a chance to be your brother's keeper.  This is a chance for the unity that we express when we are before the  cameras to manifest itself in the votes that we cast here in Congress.  This is a seminal moment in time.   This is a moment in time for us to care not only about those who live  in the suites of life, but also those who dwell in the streets of life,  those who live on benches, those who sleep under bridges. It is an  opportunity for us to cast a vote that will send aid, send assistance  to those in Houston, Texas, and all across the area that has been  devastated by this monster. It is a chance for us to help them.   But this is only a downpayment, only a downpayment. There must be  much more. We need help in Houston posthaste, as is the case with other  places around the country that have been devastated.   We need help for housing, not only for those who had homes before the  monster hit, but also for those who didn't have homes who need to  transition to a place that they can call home. If home is where the  heart is, where is the heart of the homeless, people who sleep under  bridges? Where is the heart of the homeless?   They have to be given a place that they can call home as well, which  means, at some point, we have got to have dollars appropriated for the  organizations that help those who live in the streets of life: the  homeless. We have got to help them, too. If we can help those in the  suites, we can help those in the streets.   I would also say to my colleagues: Please understand, people who are  here and undocumented have needs, too. They live in places that are  horrible. I have been in their homes. I have smelled the mold. I know  what it is  [[Page H6665]]  like to see the conditions that they dwell in. It is time for us to put  aside the politics that divide us from people who need help and help  those people, too. Let's send some more money to the organizations that  help them.   This is a moment in time. This is a seminal moment in time. It is  time for us to step up and help everyone that is harmed, not be  selective. If you are in this country and you are hurting, we ought to  help you. God bless you.   I thank you, Madam Leader on my side, the ranking member. I thank you  again, Mr. Chairman, and I beg that we do what we can to make sure  every person in this country receives the help he or she deserves.
