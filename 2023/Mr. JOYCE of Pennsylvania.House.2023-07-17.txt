 Mr. Speaker, since the Wright Brothers  first took flight in 1903, exploration, commerce, and transportation  have relied on the ability to fly.   For decades, regional airports have been the sole provider of flights  in and out of rural communities, and it is crucial that we protect the  Essential Air Service program for years to come.   It is time to invest in our next generation of pilots, ensuring that  students from across the country are properly trained and equipped to  fly the passengers and the cargo that our economy needs.   In the past 2\1/2\ years, we have seen the consequences of failed  aviation policy from the Biden administration, leading to a record  number of delays and cancellations for travelers across our country.   These delays are the result of a Department of Transportation that  has failed to put in place systems that support our airlines and our  airports.   The Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act  will provide the reforms necessary to support air travelers and ensure  that the DOT addresses their fault in preventing on-time arrivals.   This legislation is the next step in our commitment to creating an  economy that is strong. It will enhance our infrastructure, uphold our  safety standards, promote innovation, and support the 850 million  passengers who fly each year.      Newburg Volunteer Fire Department Celebrating 100 Years of Service     Mr. Speaker, this weekend the Newburg  Volunteer Fire Department celebrated 100 years of service in Blair  County, Pennsylvania. We owe a debt of gratitude to the selfless  volunteers who have dedicated their time and resources to protecting  our community.   Their willingness to leave home at the sound of a bell and rush  toward those in need shows an incredible commitment to the residents of  Blair County.   For decades, the fire station has been more than a place to house  trucks or to conduct training. It has been a place for the community to  gather and to come together to celebrate special occasions.   Under the leadership of Chief Mike Zeigler, the Newburg Volunteer  Fire Department has strived to reach a standard of excellence.   Further, the department has worked tirelessly to recruit multiple new  members, training students who will continue to work and serve in Blair  County.   As these firefighters continue their education, it is essential that  Congress provides our volunteer departments with the tools and the  training that they so desperately need.   On behalf of the entire 13th Congressional District, I congratulate  the Newburg Volunteer Fire Department on reaching this milestone, and I  thank them for their continued service.                            ____________________
