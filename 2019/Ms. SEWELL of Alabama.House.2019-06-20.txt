 Madam Chair, I would like to thank so much the  subcommittee chairperson, Mr. Bishop, for allowing me this time.   My amendment is part of the en bloc, and it deals with wastewater  treatment.   No person in America and living in this country should be allowed to  not have adequate plumbing. This is why I have introduced an amendment  asking the USDA to prioritize our ongoing efforts to address failing  septic systems in rural communities.   Approximately 20 percent of Americans are responsible for the  installation and maintenance of their own sewage disposal systems,  which isn't provided by their municipalities or their county  government. At least 200,000 families live in homes that lack a sewage  system altogether.   We offer little assistance to people who live in unincorporated areas  to have basic water and sewer. Rural communities across this country  struggle with this issue.   Just this week, I read lots and lots of articles that dealt with the  failure of those folks in rural communities to have adequate sewage  systems.   This amendment is part of a multiyear effort to address this once and  for all for all Americans.   Last year, my bill, the Rural Septic Tank Access Act, was included in  the farm bill.   Madam Chair, I thank Chairman Bishop and his staff for allowing me to  speak on this underlying en bloc bill today.   In fiscal year 2018, we secured an additional $1.8 billion in rural  wastewater funding with the help of Congressman Aderholt.   Madam Chair, again, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this en  bloc amendment.
