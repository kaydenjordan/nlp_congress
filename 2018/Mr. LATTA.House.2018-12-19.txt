 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Ohio,  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 7279, the Water  Infrastructure Improvement Act.   Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have worked on legislation to  give our Nation's communities more flexibility to comply with costly  regulations in regards to their wastewater infrastructure improvements.  In each Congress since 2008, I have introduced legislation that  addresses these issues and provides relief to our local communities.   I have heard from many villages, towns, and cities across my district  over the years that struggle to meet wastewater and stormwater  improvement demands. This legislation is a key step to build on the  work I have previously done to provide relief to our constituents by  allowing them to more effectively and efficiently meet their specific  water needs.                                time  1615    There are billions of dollars worth of water, wastewater, and  stormwater infrastructure needs in the State of Ohio. It is critical to  provide communities with the ability to meet their obligations in a  more cost-effective manner.   This legislation will codify the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  Integrated Planning Framework and provide additional tools and  flexibility for communities to comply with mandated wastewater  infrastructure improvement projects.   This is important because it allows municipalities and clean water  utilities to decide how best to spend their limited resources.  Integrated planning allows communities to allocate funds in a targeted  manner, allowing them to focus on the most effective water quality  improvements.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank my colleague Representative  Gibbs, as well as Representatives Chabot, Napolitano, Fudge, and Bustos  for working together to get this bipartisan piece of legislation  passed. I will continue to work with my colleagues in both chambers to  ensure that this bipartisan bill reaches the President's desk in order  to help improve our Nation's water infrastructure and protect the  ratepayers.   I urge all my colleagues to support this measure, and, again, I thank  my colleague for introducing the legislation.
