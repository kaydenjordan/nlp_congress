 Mr. Speaker, it is with my deepest sympathy that I  rise today to recognize the tragic loss of Sergeant La David Terrence  Johnson, one of four brave U.S. Special Forces soldiers--and you see  them here listed--killed during an ambush in Niger on October 4 as a  result of enemy fire.   Sergeant Johnson was a proud south Floridian, a decorated soldier,  having been awarded several honors, and well-loved throughout our  community.   Sergeant Johnson was a loving husband to his wife, Myeshia, and a  devoted father to their wonderful children, Ah'Leeysa Jones and La  David Johnson, Jr. He leaves behind a baby girl due in January.   Sergeant Johnson will always be remembered as a loyal family man, a  dedicated soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.   I offer my deepest sympathy to Sergeant Johnson's mourning family,  friends, and loved ones.   Godspeed to Sergeant La David Terrence Johnson.                            ____________________
