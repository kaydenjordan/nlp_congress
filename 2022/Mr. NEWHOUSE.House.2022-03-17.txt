 Madam Speaker, today, in recognition of Women's History  Month, I rise to honor three incredible women from central Washington.   Shannon Polson of the Methow Valley became one of the first women  combat pilots in the U.S. military. After graduating from the  University of Alaska ROTC, she was commissioned as an Army aviator and  was one of the first women to fly the Apache attack helicopter. She  served two tours as an Apache platoon leader, and one as a company  commander, deploying to three continents.   Kathy Bryson of Richland is the Pacific Northwest disaster response  coordinator for the United Methodist Church. Kathy has provided the  overall leadership for recovery from fire disasters in Okanogan and  Whitman Counties over the last 2 years, as well as for the wildfire  disasters in Oregon and northern California.   Kayla Barron of Richland was not only a member of the first class of  women commissioned into the submarine community for the U.S. Navy as a  submarine warfare officer, but is currently serving as mission  specialist of the NASA SpaceX Crew-3 mission to the International Space  Station. In fact, just yesterday morning, she successfully completed a  spacewalk. She has accomplished much since graduating from Richland  High, and you can bet that we are all rooting for her every step of the  way.    These women exemplify the very best of central Washington: Service to  community, determination, integrity, and grit. They have paved the way  for women in our communities and across the world. Their stories are an  inspiration for all of us in central Washington, and it is a privilege  to honor them during Women's History Month.                         Congratulating Jared Balcom     Madam Speaker, today I rise to congratulate National  Potato Council's newly elected president, and fellow central  Washingtonian, Mr. Jared Balcom.   Jared is the owner of a fourth-generation potato growing and fresh  packing company, Balcom & Moe, based in Pasco, Washington, so he knows  firsthand the challenges our central Washington producers face and how  to best address them.   I have had the pleasure of working with and getting to know Jared  over the years and know that he is well-equipped to advocate for the  potato farmers who provide so many jobs and boost our local economy.   Congratulations, Jared, on this new role. I look forward to  continuing to work together to advance our shared goals of modernizing  water infrastructure, improving trade agreements, supporting  agricultural research, and fixing our agricultural labor crisis.                     Honoring the Service of Clifton Malm     Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor one of central  Washington's veterans, Clifton Malm of Omak.   Clifton served our country honorably as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam  and risked his life to protect his fellow servicemembers. His courage  earned him a Purple Heart which, unfortunately, he never received until  just now. While it may be just a small piece of metal, it represents  what I believe is the gratitude of a truly thankful Nation.   Clifton, thank you for your service and for your continued dedication  to  [[Page H3787]]  the United States of America. Your story is a reminder to all of us of  the sacrifices the men and women in our Armed Forces make every single  day.                            ____________________
