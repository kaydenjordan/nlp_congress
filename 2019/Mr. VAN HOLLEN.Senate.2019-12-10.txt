 Madam President, after a discussion that we will have  on the Senate floor, I intend to ask unanimous consent that the Senate  pass S. 1060, which is a bipartisan piece of legislation called the  DETER Act.   What is the DETER Act? The DETER Act is legislation that I introduced  with Senator Rubio. It has bipartisan sponsorship, and it is designed  to send a very clear and simple message to Russia or any other  countries that are thinking about interfering with our elections and  undermining our democracy that, if we catch you, you will suffer a  severe penalty. It won't be a few  [[Page S6931]]  sanctions against a few of the oligarchs. It will hit big parts of your  economy. It will hit your banking sector. It will hit your energy  sector. It will hurt, so you better think before you try to interfere  in any future election.   Now, Senator Rubio and I introduced this legislation a number of  years ago, and in response to concerns that were raised, we made a  number of important changes, but despite those changes, we are still  here in the U.S. Senate with less than 1 year to go before a national  election, and we have not passed this bill to deter foreign  interference in our elections.   We know what Vladimir Putin's ambitions are. He wants to sow division  in our electorate. He wants to make our political process even more  polarized. He wants to undermine the public faith in the democratic  process. That is not just my conclusion. That is the unanimous verdict  of the U.S. Intelligence Committee and the community after the 2016  election, but it is not just them.   Our own Senate Intelligence Committee, on a bipartisan basis, issued  its findings. It also found that those were Putin's intentions, and it  found that, in 2016, Russia interfered in all 50 of the States, to a  greater or lesser extent--all 50 of the States. And what Vladimir Putin  clearly has learned and taken away from all of this is that he can  attack our democracy and attack our elections with impunity because the  rewards are high. He creates division. He accomplishes his objectives.  And the price is zero. There is currently no cost to Vladimir Putin  from interfering in our elections.   So what the DETER Act is designed to do is to raise the costs for the  coming elections, to make it clear that, if we catch you next time,  there will be a penalty to pay. We know that Putin hasn't gotten this  message because there is no penalty right now, and that is why, on  November 5, just a few weeks ago, we got another unanimous prediction  from U.S. intelligence agencies. All of them jointly stated:         Russia, China, Iran, and other foreign malicious actors all       will seek to interfere in the voting process or influence       voter perceptions. Adversaries may try to accomplish their       goals through a variety of means, including social media       campaigns, directing disinformation operations or conducting       disruptive or destructive cyber-attacks on state and local       infrastructure.    That was just a few weeks ago--unanimously, from the intelligence  agencies. Clearly, Vladimir Putin hasn't gotten the message. What the  DETER Act is all about is sending that message that he will now know  that there will be a penalty to pay upfront.   Look, there are only two ways we can protect our elections, and we  need to do both. One is to harden our election infrastructure here at  home, which is to try to make it harder for somebody to use cyber  attacks to get into our election systems and make it harder for them to  abuse our social media platforms. This is a case where the best defense  is a good offense because we can harden our systems, but you can be  sure that the Russian Government cyber security folks will always be  looking for a way around it, just like the arms race. So just like the  arms race, deterrence is the best way to protect the integrity of our  democracy by letting them know upfront that there will be this very  tough price to pay.   We hoped and thought we could address this issue in the National  Defense Authorization Act. What better place is there to defend the  integrity of our democracy than in the legislation that is designed to  protect our national security? In fact, the U.S. Senate unanimously  passed the resolution I have in my hand, S. Res. 330, which says very  clearly that we wanted folks at the NDAA conference to require the  administration--any administration, future administration--to promptly  submit a report on Russian interference or other interference following  every Federal election, and that would include a detailed assessment of  the foreign governments that were involved in that interference. The  Senate, as part of that resolution, also voted to promptly impose  sanctions on any foreign government determined to have interfered in a  future Federal election, including individuals and entities within that  country's territories.   Let me emphasize that point. Every Senator here supported that--or at  least nobody objected to that. We have been working for over 2 years to  get this done, and we keep hearing that the Trump administration  doesn't want to do it. Of course, we haven't been told by the Trump  administration why they object. Even Secretary Pompeo, in testimony  before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he supported the  concept. In fact, every witness in the Senate Banking Committee and  Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked about this and supported this  legislation. You have to ask the question why: Why is there such  opposition? If it is because of President Trump, we need to be doing  our job here in the legislature, not the bidding of the White House.   I yield to the Democratic leader.    Madam President, I thank the minority leader. As he  indicated, the Russian Foreign Minister, Foreign Minister Lavrov, is in  town. There is a report saying that Secretary Pompeo said to the  Russians: Don't interfere in our elections.   Wagging your finger is not enough to scare off Vladimir Putin. That  is why you need the DETER Act.   Of course, saying that is a big advance over the President of the  United States, who has been denying Russian  [[Page S6932]]  interference in our elections. It is not enough to scold the Russians.  It is not enough to scold Foreign Ministers. It is not enough to scold  Vladimir Putin. You have to raise the price for interference, and they  need to do it upfront.   Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged  from further consideration of S. 1060 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration. I further ask that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I want to address some of the  comments made by the chairman of the Banking Committee and start by  saying that I have appreciated the conversations he and I have had on  this legislation over the years. Let me just address some of the  comments that were made.   One is to say that, currently, the CAATSA scheme is enough to deter  future Russian interference in our elections. If that were true, you  would not have had every single one of our intelligence agencies just a  few weeks ago predict that Russia will interfere in our elections  again, along with other foreign malign actors.   If the laws on the books could deter that interference, why did they  predict just a few weeks ago that they are coming for us in the  upcoming elections?   Second, this is not a partisan attack on President Trump. This is a  bipartisan bill. This bill not only has Senator Rubio as the chief  author, coauthor of the legislation, there are a number of other  Republican and Democratic Senators on this bill as cosponsors. In fact,  they are evenly matched on this legislation.   This has nothing to with President Trump. In fact, this determination  and this law would not even kick in until after the 2020 elections. I  don't know who is going to be President then. This has nothing to do  with President Trump. This has to do with protecting our elections. Is  it informed by what happened in 2016? You bet it is. We know--again,  from all our intelligence committees and community agencies, every one  of them headed by somebody nominated by President Trump--that the  Russians attacked us in 2016. A few weeks ago they said the same thing  will happen in 2020, and that will happen especially if we don't raise  the price.   The CAATSA legislation, as the Senator knows, was put in place by an  overwhelming veto-proof vote in the U.S. Senate. It was required  because the Russians interfered, but it was retrospective. So, yes, we  punished some of the oligarchs who were close to Vladimir Putin, but  that is not enough, clearly, to raise the price to Vladimir Putin from  deterring him from doing it again.   Again, we just heard that from our own intelligence agencies. If you  want to raise the price for future interference, you need to not just  hit a few oligarchs, you need to let them know, some of those Russian  Government banks are going to get hit; their energy sector is going to  get hit.   By the way, there is actually more flexibility in this bill than I  would like. As the chairman of the committee knows, the original bill  Senator Rubio and I introduced did not have waiver authority for the  President of the  [[Page S6933]]  United States. The version that is before us right now contains waiver  authority for every single one of the sanctions if the President makes  a national determination and says the waiver will not hurt our national  security.   It has more flexibility than I would like because my view is you need  to set up a machine that is almost automatic. If we catch you  interfering, there will be a price to pay. Under this bill, if we catch  them, yes, there will be sanctions, but the reality is, the President  can decide to waive those sanctions.   We have come a long way. This is a bipartisan bill. This is about  protecting our democracy. It is not about any particular individual or  any particular President. It wouldn't even kick in until after the next  elections, and those sanctions will only kick in if there is  interference. The whole purpose of this bill is to have sanctions that  are tough enough so Putin doesn't interfere or another foreign  government doesn't interfere and so they don't go off the sanctions.  That is the whole purpose.   I hope we will vote on this. The clock is ticking. I am going to be  on this floor week after week until we come together and pass something  that actually has some teeth and will deter that very foreign  interference that every intelligence agency predicted will happen as  recently as 5 weeks ago. That will happen unless we act.   I yield floor.    Madam President, I hope we will get down to the  serious business of legislating. As I indicated in the hearings that  have been held in the Senate Banking Committee and Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, there was overwhelming support for moving forward  with the DETER Act; that is, deter Russian interference in our  elections.   I will say it again. This authority, this sanction, if there is  interference, does not kick in until after the next Presidential  election. It is not designed to focus on any particular President. It  is designed together on a bipartisan basis--and this is a bipartisan  bill--to set up a mechanism in advance to let Vladimir Putin or other  malign foreign actors know, if they interfere, there will be a price to  pay. Not maybe, not let's just guess about it, there will be a price to  pay unless a President decides to waive it, which, as I said, was a  concession we made to address people's concerns about some flexibility,  but we need to send the upfront message that at least initially these  sanctions will take effect, and they will hurt. That is the only way to  deter someone like Vladimir Putin and the Russians from interfering in  our elections: raise the price and make it clear they will pay it.
