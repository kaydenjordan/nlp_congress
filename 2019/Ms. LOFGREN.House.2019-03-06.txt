 Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and add extraneous material on H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2019.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, H.R. 1 will begin the process of returning the government  to the people. Many provisions of H.R. 1 have been pending and ignored  for years in this House. No more.                                time  1430    H.R. 1 has been the subject of hearings in five committees and 15  hours of testimony from witnesses. Throughout these hearings, we have  heard our Republican friends bemoan a rushed process when, in fact,  they had 8 years to consider these proposals but failed to do so.   Today, we deliver on our promise to the American people. H.R. 1 is  critically important at this point in our history.   Trust in government and in many institutions has eroded because of  years of putting profit before the people and letting politicians pick  their voters.   Dark money has been allowed to poison our system, drowning out the  voices of the very people who we were sent here to represent.   Access to the ballot box has been impeded by arbitrary obstacles that  have made voting a privilege, not a right.   Without trust, our representative system suffers. Too many Americans  view themselves as shut out from our democracy. Others cannot  participate because of election administration procedures that fail to  account for how Americans live and work in the 21st century.   Some of these barriers make it harder for certain populations,  including communities of color and other underrepresented groups, to  vote. This is especially the case after the Supreme Court gutted core  provisions of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder.   Meanwhile, the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision has  further empowered wealthy special interests and ushered in nearly a  billion dollars in money from undisclosed sources, even though the  Court affirmed the importance of disclosure by a vote of 8 to 1.   H.R. 1 reverses course and strengthens our democracy and makes it  easier and more convenient for all eligible Americans to vote. It  offers solutions to the dominance of big money in politics, and it  ensures public officials will work in the public interest.   One of the things that has been discussed is the proposal for a  freedom from influence fund that will allow for small donors to reclaim  control of candidates through $200 or less donations.   I want to make it clear that no taxpayer funds are permitted to flow  into this freedom from influence fund. Instead, as was approved in our  last vote, a modest additional assessment of 2.75 percent on Federal  fines, penalties, and settlements for certain tax crimes and corporate  malfeasance will be the sole source of funding for this freedom from  influence fund. In fact, the bad guys will be funding the clean system.   This bill will lower barriers to voting for all eligible Americans.  It will save costs, bolster the integrity of election administration,  and, for example, it will modernize voter registration systems by  enabling automatic voter registration and same-day voter registration,  taking advantage of technology to ensure all Americans can register and  update their voter registration status online. Automatic voter  registration, alone, may bring up to 50 million new American citizens  onto the rolls and, therefore, able to vote.   It makes improvements to ensure ballot access for voters with  disabilities as well as our overseas and military voters.   It ensures early voting for at least 15 days and will require States  to use voter-verified paper ballots. This is a commonsense safeguard to  cybersecurity threats, especially after the 2016 election showed  vulnerabilities in our system.   H.R. 1 will reform redistricting to ensure fairness in the process to  guard against partisanship and respect communities of interest.   This legislation will shine a light on dark secret money that  influences campaigns and will protect everyone's right to know who is  influencing their votes and their views.   As I mentioned earlier, it provides an alternative voluntary system  for candidates to finance their campaigns by empowering small dollar  contributors all without taxpayer money. This will reduce candidates'  reliance on wealthy special interests and open the political process to  more people. This will create a government for the people.   H.R. 1 will also implement high ethical standards and boost  confidence in self-government.   It has been said that we should not take these steps, but Article I,  Section 4 of the United States Constitution provides that Congress may,  by law, regulate votes in Federal elections.   It is time that we take this step. Democracy is resilient, but it  requires our continual work to ensure that it lives up to its promise.   H.R. 1 is a major, comprehensive step forward, a step that we must  take if we are to be true to our promise of our representative  government.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler), chairman of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price), a pioneer and leader in clean government.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have to note that the last speaker failed to read the entire  section. Article I, section 4 says: ``The times, places and manner of  holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed  in each State by the legislature thereof;'' as was mentioned. And it  then goes on to say, ``but the Congress may at any time by law make or  alter such regulations. . . . `' And that is what we are doing here.   Why? Because we have seen in States throughout the country efforts to  prevent people from voting in Federal elections. And so a voter in one  State is treated differently than in another State, and that is what we  are going to change with H.R. 1.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Krishnamoorthi).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Davis), a valued Member of the House Administration  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who is my colleague on the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, it is my honor to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the Democratic leader.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), who has served so faithfully on the House  Homeland Security Committee.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time remains on  each side.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), the one person who probably has worked harder  than anyone else on this bill.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a leader for civil rights and justice in our  country.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    I yield the gentleman from Washington an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Before yielding to the gentlewoman from Michigan, I would just like  to quote one of the most conservative justices, who said that ``the  public has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate  shortly before an election.'' That was in the Citizens United decision.                                time  1545    Now, I didn't agree with that decision, but the court posited that  the solution to the dark money that they were unleashing on the country  was disclosure, and that is what this bill does.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Tlaib).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, before yielding to the chairman of the Homeland  Security Committee, I would just like to say that saying it is tax  money does not make it so. We have prohibited appropriations into the  freedom from influence fund. The total source of funding is a 2.75  percent assessment on people who have committed tax crimes or corporate  malfeasance.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Thompson), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, before yielding to the gentleman from New Jersey, I would  like to just address a couple of simple points.   The DISCLOSE Act really pivots off the Supreme Court decision in  Citizens United. And as they said in that decision: Disclaimer and  disclosure requirements impose no ceiling on campaign-related  activities and do not prevent anyone from speaking.   Concern has been expressed about the ability to remain private. That  is provided for in this bill. It is simple. If you don't want to be  disclosed, note that your donation is not for campaign purposes, and  you will not be disclosed.   Further, there is an express protection provided for any donor who  fears that they may face threat of harassment or reprisal. So we have  thought of this, and this was dealt with in our markup.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Chairman, I am honored to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Mr. Chairman, how much time remains on both sides?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Haaland).    Mr. Chairman, it is my honor to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), the chairman of the House  Oversight and Reform Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the  District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), the prime author of this bill.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman from Maryland an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I just want to make a couple of observations and perhaps  corrections.   It has been alleged that somehow the assessment on tax crimes and  corporate malfeasance has been transformed into taxpayer money--I think  that is clearly incorrect--but that if the money is insufficient, then  the taxpayers would be on the hook.   When we marked up the bill in the House Administration Committee, we  outlined how the money would be reduced if there were not enough money  in the fund; and in section 5101(f)(3), it talks about mandatory  reductions of payments in the voucher program. In 541(d)(2), it talks  about mandatory reductions in the congressional program and  Presidential and so on, if there were insufficient funds.   So there is no way under the terms of this bill that the taxpayers  could ever be on the hook for these funds, and I think it is important  to know that.   I want to talk a little bit about the concern about free speech.   I am an advocate of free speech. I think we all are and honor our  Constitution here in the House of Representatives. But the ACLU has a  storied history of litigating constitutional issues. They have done  good work, but we have differed on our approach to campaign finance  law, particularly on how to shine a light on secret, dark money in  elections.   The ACLU has opposed applying disclosure laws to organizations  spending money on electioneering communications, which are paid ads  that mention candidates in the days leading up to the election.   As we have mentioned earlier, the Court, in Citizens United, said the  public has an interest in knowing who is speaking about a candidate  before an election and pointed out that disclosure does not prevent  speech. I think that is one of the reasons why we have  [[Page H2406]]  gotten a marvelous letter from the National Association for the  Advancement of Colored People, the NAACP, which I include in the  Record.                                       National Association for the                                   Advancement of Colored People,                                      Washington, DC, March 4, 2019.      Re NAACP strong support for H.R. 1, legislation to greatly           improve and expand the democratic voting process       Hon. U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's       oldest, largest and most widely-recognized grassroots-based       civil rights organization, I would like to urge you, in the       strongest terms possible to support through passage H.R. 1       and to oppose any weakening amendments. This legislation will       expand Americans' access to the ballot box, reduce the       discriminatory influence of big money in politics, prevent       voter fraud, and strengthen ethics rules and accountability       for public servants. H.R. 1 is supported and celebrated by       the NAACP: since our founding in 1909, free and unfettered       access to the ballot for all eligible Americans, and the       assurance that our vote has been counted, has been a critical       driver behind all that we do.        H.R. 1 represents a coordinated effort to protect and       promote the voting rights of all Americans. This vital       legislation includes many of the tools the NAACP has       identified throughout our nation as improving voter turn-out       and successful voter participation: it includes provisions to       establish on-line and automatic voter registration. H.R. 1       would require early voting in all states; voting would have       to start at least 15 days before an election, including       weekends. H.R. 1 would require same-day voter registration on       election-day and during early voting. Under a provision in       H.R. 1, states would be prohibited from restricting an       individuals' ability to vote by mail. H.R. 1 would require       that ``provisional ballots'' be counted and provides       assistance to states and localities in improving the       provisional ballot process. The measure would prohibit voter       caging, voter deception and voter intimidation. H.R. 1 also       promotes voter registration via the internet and establishes       a strict code of ethics for all federally elected and       appointed officials, including the President, the Vice       President, his cabinet, and every Member of Congress, so we       are not constantly distracted by the ``scandal of the day.''        H.R. 1 would also re-enfranchise ex-felony offenders who       have served their sentence and have been released from       prison. Because voting is such an integral part of being a       productive member of American society, the NAACP has       advocated strongly to allow felons who are no longer       incarcerated to reintegrate themselves into society and vote       in federal elections.        H.R. 1 also begins to fix the damage done to the crucial       1965 Voting Rights Act by the US Supreme Court decision in       Shelby v. Holder. The legislation specifically states that       Congress is committed to reversing the effects of the 2013       Supreme Court decision which effectively invalidated a       requirement that certain states and jurisdictions receive       federal preclearance on changes to voting procedures. Prior       to the Shelby decision preclearance was required for states       and local jurisdictions that had a history of voter       discrimination.        The measure would state that Congress should respond by       modernizing the electoral system to improve access to the       ballot, enhance voting integrity and security, ensure greater       accountability, and restore protections for voters. Finally,       but no less importantly, H.R. 1 contains strong provisions to       bring about genuine campaign finance reform measures which       will withstand the scrutiny of the Courts.        The NAACP strongly supports H.R. 1. This is not a partisan       issue: the right to vote should be supported by all Americans       who believe in democracy. We should be making voting and       involvement in the democratic process easier, not throwing up       barriers which may seem insurmountable to whole groups of       eligible voters. Should you have any questions or comments,       please do not hesitate to contact me at my office.            Sincerely,      Hilary O. Shelton,        Director, NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President       for Policy and Advocacy.    Mr. Chair, I will not read the entire letter, but it  does say this:   ``Dear Representative,   ``On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's oldest, largest, and most  widely-recognized grassroots-based civil rights organization, I would  like to urge you, in the strongest terms possible, to support through  passage H.R. 1 and to oppose any weakening amendments.''   It goes on to say: ``This legislation will expand Americans' access  to the ballot box, reduce the discriminatory influence of big money in  politics, prevent voter fraud, and strengthen ethics rules and  accountability for public servants. H.R. 1 is supported and celebrated  by the NAACP.''   I would urge us to support this bill and listen to the advice that we  have received from the NAACP on this, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House, representing San  Francisco.    Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman would like to wrap up, I  will also wrap up.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, this is an important bill for many reasons. We have  seen all over the United States efforts to prevent Americans from being  able to vote, from moving polling places out of a jurisdiction without  any public transportation so voters can't get there, to reducing early  voting, to voter ID requirements that have a disparate result and  disadvantage young people. For example, in Texas you can show your  hunting license but not your University of Texas ID. I think there is a  rationale behind that.   We have had enough. We believe that American citizens ought to be  able to vote and that we should do everything in Federal elections as  the Constitution provides to allow those American citizens to vote.   That is why this bill provides for at least 15 days of early voting  for Federal elections, no-excuse absentee ballots, that provisional  ballots are treated uniformly so a voter in one State is treated the  same way as a voter in another State when they are voting for the House  of Representatives. We want to improve access for voters with  disabilities and for overseas and military voters.   We know that we are vulnerable to hacking. We have voting machines  that are using software that is no longer even updated. They are  vulnerable to hacking. We have got to have paper ballots that are  subject to a recount.   Much has been said about elements of this, but one of the things that  I think is very important is the Federal congressional redistricting  provisions. If there is one thing that makes Americans upset it is  politicians manipulating the districts so that even if they don't get  the votes, they get to win the seats. That is gerrymandering. This bill  does away with it for the House of Representatives.   It requires all States to establish independent redistricting  commissions for the purpose of developing and enacting congressional  redistricting plans. It exempts States that meet the minimum  requirements, including the State of Arizona, contrary to one of the  comments made earlier here today.   There has been a lot of discussion about money, but I will include in  the Record the preliminary report we have received from the Joint  Committee on Taxation.   The estimate of the proposed 2.75 percent special assessment on  criminal penalties and civil penalties is that it would raise $1.948  billion between 2019 and 2029 and that it would reduce the deficit by  $83 million because people would be deterred by the additional penalty.  That is from the Joint Committee on Taxation. I didn't make that up.   So this bill has a lot of sound provisions in it. It discloses big  money so that there is transparency, as the court in Citizens United  suggested that we do. It empowers small donors so the big money guys  don't own the government. It reforms the ethics process for the  President, the Congress, and for the judiciary.   I am sorry to say that some candidates win only when they suppress  the vote, and we have seen that happen across the United States. We are  not going to allow that to happen. Every American has a right to vote,  to have their vote counted and let the chips fall where they may. That  is what H.R. 1 will do.   Mr. Chairman, I urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I would just note that the ballot harvesting  issue, I think, has very little to do with the amendment offered by Mr.  Hastings and that the remedy that has been suggested by my friend, Mr.  Davis, was to use the system that was in place in North Carolina.  Obviously, that didn't work. The remedy to fraud is prosecution, which  is what is happening in North Carolina.   I would note that, as we mentioned at the Rules Committee last night,  in California, you can give your ballot that is sealed not only to your  son, but to your next-door neighbor. You might be an elderly person who  doesn't have family around.   There has been no credible allegation of fraud, and we had monitors  from both the Republican and Democratic parties, people from House  Administration. There was no credible allegation of a problem.   Mr. Chair, let's not compare apples and oranges. Let's support Mr.  Hastings' amendment.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   The gentleman's amendment to H.R. 1 would keep in place a provision  of law that was inserted into must-pass pieces of legislation over the  past few years. It makes it harder for voters to follow the money when  it comes to government contractors and political spending.   The amendment is anathema to the purposes of H.R. 1, which is to  bolster confidence and trust in the American Government and shine a  light on secret spending in elections. The gentlemen's amendment would  further the status quo of dark money in our elections, and it would  protect a culture of pay-to-play politics that Americans reject.   Republicans in Congress, as Mr. Cole has mentioned, first included  this language in the 2012 appropriations bill, then the 2014  appropriations bill, and finally in the 2015 Consolidated  Appropriations Act.   H.R. 1, in title IV, subtitle G, repeals the restriction on requiring  disclosure of campaign-related spending by those submitting an offer  for a Federal contract. Repealing this restriction will curb the  appearance of corruption that can go along with campaign-related money  in government contracts. It will shine a light on dark money in  politics.   Americans have a right to know who is trying to influence them with  political advertisements and campaign spending and what big campaign  spenders want from the government in return.   The Federal Government spends hundreds of billions of dollars a year  on Federal contracts. Campaign-related spending should have nothing to  do with influencing a contract, and disclosure will protect the  integrity of the process and curb any appearance of corruption.   After the Supreme Court decided Citizens United in 2010, undisclosed  sources have spent more than $950 million in dark money to influence  Federal elections, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive  Politics. The money flows through a complex web of corporations, dark  money, nonprofit organizations, super-PACs, and other groups. When  money from  [[Page H2485]]  government contractors enters this web, it poses the exact type of  threat to the integrity of our democratic system that our campaign  finance laws are intended to protect against.   While Federal law prohibits contracting entities from contributing to  political candidates and parties, their directors, officers, and other  affiliates could still give unlimited sums of dark money to groups that  do not disclose their campaign-related donors, and that is why H.R. 1  would repeal the restriction on disclosure.                                time  1745    The court held 8 to 1 in Citizens United that ``The First Amendment  protects political speech; and disclosure permits citizens and  shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper  way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed  decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages.''   The public has a right to follow the money, including money from  government contractors to dark-money groups that did not disclose their  spending.   H.R. 1 ensures disclosure and transparency, both of which are  critical to open and responsive democracy that protects the public  interest. And this amendment, although I am sure well-intentioned,  takes us in the wrong direction.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just note that when a rider is  added to the appropriations bill, you have to vote for the whole  package to keep the government open.   Mr. Chairman, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would require applicants for  motor vehicle licenses to indicate whether they previously resided in a  different State and which State the applicant intends to be their  residence for the purpose of voter registration. I think it could be  helpful in terms of preventing registrations in two States. However, it  is potentially redundant with other provisions in H.R. 1.   When all States implement automatic voter registration, States will  transmit change of address duplicate license information electronically  and wouldn't need to collect this information from individuals.   Further, States are able to use a reliable set of data for sharing  information on registered voters, called the Electronic Registration  Information Center, established originally by the Pew Charitable  Trusts, currently utilized by 26 States--by the way, including  Arizona--so it has a very high accuracy rate.   Nevertheless, redundancy is our friend, and I certainly do not oppose  this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.    Mr. Chair, I withdraw my motion for the Committee to  rise.    I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Mucarsel-Powell) having assumed the chair, Mr. Cartwright, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1)  to expand Americans' access to the ballot box, reduce the influence of  big money in politics, and strengthen ethics rules for public servants,  and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
