 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 7 invoking the War Powers  Resolution to withdraw U.S. military support for the Gulf coalition in  Yemen.   For 4 years, the war in Yemen has ground on, killing tens of  thousands of Yemeni civilians, and putting millions at imminent risk of  starvation and deprivation.   The cause of the war is complicated and has much to do with Iran's  malign influence.   But our interest today is not in debating the blame for the war, but  in bringing it to an end. That is why I urge all Members to support  this resolution, because it is in our interest and, above all, in the  interest of the Yemeni people to end the war.   U.S. military support for the Saudi coalition has not prevented  civilian suffering, and it is my hope that, by withdrawing our support,  we will make clear that a diplomatic resolution is the only resolution  to the conflict.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this resolution. I urge Members to  oppose any motion to commit, which would have the effect of killing  this bill and prolonging the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
