 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the Rules Committee for making my  amendment in order, as well as Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member  Visclosky for their hard work on this important Defense Appropriations  bill.   Mr. Chairman, I offer this bipartisan amendment with my good friends  Mr. Correa, Mr. Lieu, Ms. Shea-Porter, Mr. Ratcliffe, and Ms. Stefanik  in order to support the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program.   Since 2001, DOD has funded the Information Assurance Scholarship  Program, or ASP, in order to boost the Nation's cyber workforce through  scholarship and capacity-building grants. Scholarship recipients are  required to fulfill a service obligation by working in a cybersecurity  position at DOD upon graduation.   This program has been extremely successful, bringing nearly 600  students into the DOD workforce. However, due to budget constraints,  the Department reduced funding for the program beginning in 2013 and  stopped recruiting new students. Now, this program received $7.5  million in 2005, its peak funding level, but for FY 2017, it received a  mere $500,000.   The cybersecurity challenges that we face, Mr. Chairman, are growing  every day. This scholarship program will help ensure that students are  encouraged to pursue degrees in cybersecurity-related fields and that  more of them can then work defending our Nation.   Across every industry, across the public and private and nonprofit  sectors, qualified cybersecurity professionals are, indeed, in short  supply, and the Department of Defense must compete for this very small  pool of candidates. These funds will assist in alleviating the  challenges that the Department of Defense is experiencing in recruiting  and retaining cybersecurity personnel by providing additional  opportunities to develop a qualified cyber workforce and expanding  awareness at public educational institutions.   Mr. Chairman, in last year's National Defense Authorization Act, we  reinvigorated the funding while simultaneously expanding it to include  students pursuing associate's degrees so as to tap into a larger  candidate pool.   The committee also made in order a similar amendment in last year's  appropriations bill to ensure the newly reauthorized expanded program  would be appropriately funded. It was passed by the whole House during  amendment consideration, and we aim to do the same this year to finally  get this critical program back off the ground.   Cybersecurity, Mr. Chairman, is the national security and economic  security challenge of the 21st century, and every armed conflict today  and in the future will include a battle in this domain. It is incumbent  upon Congress to recognize this fact and appropriately support  USCYBERCOM and our other cyber defenders. All the policies in the  world, though, are meaningless without personnel to execute them, and  this amendment makes vital investments in our human capital.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be withdrawn.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I spoke a little bit earlier on the cyber  scholarship program, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her support  and her work, along with Ranking Member Visclosky's work on the Defense  Appropriations bill, and in particular their support of the Assurance  Cyber Scholarship.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  want to thank the ranking member for his work on this Defense  Appropriations bill as well as Congresswoman Granger. In particular, I  want to thank my colleague, Mr. Courtney, for his tireless work as the  ranking member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee and  Mr. Wittman for his tireless work.   Our submarines are the true unsung heroes of our naval fleet, and I  know from firsthand experience because much of the critical fabrication  work of these amazing submarines is done by my constituents in my home  State of Rhode Island.   Admirals continuously tell us that they cannot get enough submarines,  which are desperately needed across the globe to protect the interests  of the United States. In fact, they are only able to meet some 60 or 65  percent of the demands of the requests of the combatant commanders for  the use of these submarines.   Despite this urgent need, the number in our fleet is actually  dropping. By 2028, it has been reported the number of submarines will  drop from 52 to 42. So how can we support this near 20 percent drop  when we have the ability to do something about it?   Thankfully, there is a plan to close at least some of this gap by  procuring additional submarines in 2022 and 2023. But we can't increase  our sub production by 50 percent on a dime. We need to make investments  today if we are to be in a position to help reduce the bottoming out of  our sub fleet.  [[Page H5810]]    The hardworking employees of our defense industrial base need to  build additional capacity now. We need to act immediately if we are  going to be in a position to provide more submarine reactors in the  out-years.                                time  1845    This amendment will ensure that we have the flexibility going  forward. That is why we included similar language in this year's  National Defense Authorization Act, which overwhelmingly passed this  Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, the urgency is particularly evident because our  adversaries are not standing still. DOD has estimated that China will  have an estimated between 69 and 78 submarines in 2020, and the CSBA  has estimated that they will have between 80 and 100 submarines  somewhere between 2022 and the 2030 time frame. We cannot, in good  conscience, ignore the startling growth of this adversarial fleet.   Mr. Chair, subs not only deter our adversaries, but they also build  up our allies and ensure a more prosperous, secure world. Funding our  Virginia-class and Columbia-class programs must remain an absolute  priority. Anything less is an affront to our national security.   This amendment continues our practice of robust investment in our  submarine fleet, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.
