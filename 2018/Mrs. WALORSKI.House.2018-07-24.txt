 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 184, the  Protect Medical Innovation Act.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will permanently repeal the job-killing  medical device tax. Hoosiers are proud to be leaders in medical  innovation with more than 300 medical device manufacturers in our State  that support nearly 55,000 jobs. These are high-paying jobs, with  workers in the industry earning about $50,000 per year, on average.   However, after ObamaCare's medical device tax took effect, the  industry lost almost 29,000 good-paying jobs nationwide from 2012 to  2015, according to Department of Commerce data. That is why Congress  took bipartisan action in 2015 to suspend the tax for 2 years, and did  so again earlier this year. But if it goes back into effect after 2019,  it will impede new discoveries and stifle medical innovation while  destroying good jobs.   Right now, our economy is booming because of historic tax cuts and  regulatory reforms, and we need to keep that momentum going. It is time  to end the medical device tax once and for all. Permanently repealing  this job-killing tax will protect American workers and help patients  access the lifesaving medical technology they need.   Mr. Speaker, the medical device tax would have a devastating impact  on Hoosier workers and people from across the country who depend on  these products. The Protect Medical Innovation Act will boost American  innovation and manufacturing, and it will encourage medical research  and development that make a real difference in people's lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this vital piece of  legislation.
