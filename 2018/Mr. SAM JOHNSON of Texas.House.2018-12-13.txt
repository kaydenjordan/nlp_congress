 Mr. Speaker, this is going to be my last  time up here. You all are great, and it is a pleasure to talk to you.   Someone once told me that being at the House of Representatives was a  different kind of hell. So, when I was sworn into the U.S. House of  Representatives 27 years ago, I said that I had survived hell on Earth  at the infamous Hanoi Hilton and the Texas House of Representatives,  and that I guess I had gone from hell to hell to hell.   While there have been some hellish long nights here--and days--what I  will remember is how thankful I am to have had the opportunity to serve  America and defend freedom from the Halls of Congress.   I thank all of the constituents of my Third District of Texas, thank  all of my colleagues and friends in this room, and thank my country.  Serving in the Congress has been one of the highest honors of my life.   We live in the greatest country in the world, and don't forget it. If  I leave any legacy behind, I hope that it is one of service above self.   God bless you. God bless America. I salute you and this great Nation.                            ____________________
