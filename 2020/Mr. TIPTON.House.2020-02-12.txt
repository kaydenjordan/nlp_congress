 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition to the amendment  before us.   Apparently, the bill that is before us today didn't include enough  wilderness in my district. As we see in this amendment, we are now  trying to be able to add more.   The amendment adds an additional 60,000 acres of wilderness in  Colorado. One proposed addition that is particularly concerning,  because it has local opposition, is the Papoose Canyon. Montezuma and  Dolores Counties oppose the wilderness designation of Papoose Canyon.   The wilderness study area falls within the Canyons of the Ancients  National Monument, which I have worked to preserve. The land already  has strict Federal protections so wilderness designation is not  necessary.   Mr. Chairman, again, the BLM has studied these lands and found them  to be unsuitable for wilderness. Montezuma and Dolores Counties have  requested the Papoose Canyon Wilderness Study Area be released because  the canyon is surrounded by private land, which has created challenges  when it comes to wildfire prevention.   Papoose Canyon Wilderness was not originally in my colleague's bill.  Instead of consulting the counties that would be impacted by the  addition and considering their objections, we are here debating a last- minute amendment.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I would encourage my  colleagues who believe that local voices must be a part of any land  management decision to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I do appreciate the comments. Here is the reality: In the  Canyon of the Ancients in the area that I am speaking to, these are  already protected lands. The BLM, when we are talking about a  wilderness study area, has stated that these do not qualify as  wilderness.   When we look at our county commissioners, they are going to be the  ones in our remote rural areas who are going to be responsible for  dealing with the potential of wildfire, which is something that all  Coloradans ought to be well concerned about.   Without their support, with recognition that this land is protected,  and with the BLM stating that this does not qualify as a wilderness  area, I would encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr.  Cunningham, for putting forward this amendment.   I do rise in opposition, though I am not opposed, ultimately, to the  amendment. I am glad to join my colleague from South Carolina as a  cosponsor, ultimately, of this amendment to be able to ensure that  military overflights can continue over areas that will be designated  wilderness under the Protecting America's Wilderness Act.   As my good friend from South Carolina is aware, my district is home  to the High-Altitude Army National Guard Aviation Training Site or  HAATS, where our men and women in uniform learn how to fly rotary-wing  aircraft safely in high-altitude environments.   Mr. Chair, five wilderness or potential wilderness areas are to be  established within the HAATS training area under the Protecting  America's Wilderness Act. It is essential that when the time comes for  aviation training to take place for the readiness of our Armed Forces  that it is not interfering with the current and future wilderness  proposals being debated and introduced in Congress.   Although the gentleman's amendment doesn't deal with the issue of  landing zones, I do believe it is an important protection and a  promising step forward. I would urge all of my colleagues to be able to  support this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter and a resolution from the  Mesa County Board of County Commissioners and a letter from the  Montezuma County Board of County Commissioners in opposition to the  legislation that we have on the floor today.                                              Mesa County, Colorado,                                   Board of County Commissioners,                                  Grand Junction, CO, June 24, 2019.      Re Colorado Wilderness Act of 2019, H.R. 2546.       Hon. Diana DeGette,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Ms. DeGette: As the Board of County Commissioners       (``Board'') for Mesa County, Colorado, we are submitting this       letter to voice our opposition to the Colorado Wilderness Act       of 2019, H.R. 2546.        Mesa County has a well-established history of supporting       sensible, multiple use of public lands and resources. The       Board finds the proposed Wilderness designations of more       140,000 acres within Mesa County unacceptable and in direct       conflict of the Mesa County Resolution adopted in opposition       of the Colorado Wilderness Act of 2015, H.R. 3336 (enclosed).       The areas proposed for Wilderness in Mesa County include:        1. South Shale Ridge & Little Book Cliffs Proposed       Wilderness--29,045 acres (proposed ``Little Bookcliffs       Wilderness'')        2. South Shale Ridge & Little Book Cliffs Proposed       Wilderness--27,517 acres (proposed ``South Shale Ridge       Wilderness'')        3. Bangs Canyon Proposed Wilderness--20,996 acres (proposed       ``Bangs Canyon Wilderness'')        4. Unaweep & Palisade Proposed Wilderness--27,150 acres       (proposed ``Palisade Wilderness'')        5. Unaweep & Palisade Proposed Wilderness--20,420 acres       (proposed ``Unaweep Wilderness'')        6. Sewemup Mesa Proposed Wilderness--15,208 acres (proposed       ``Sewemup Mesa Wilderness'')        As the most restrictive designation in land management, the       Board believes Wilderness designations are often punitive in       nature for many public land users whose impact is negligible.       In addition to ending multiple use of public lands,       Wilderness designations:        1. eliminate the opportunity to manage forest level       concerns with the flexibility necessary for ever-changing       conditions;        2. remove the ability to properly address the tremendous       buildup of natural fuels due to unprecedented beetle kill       thus compounding the potential and severity of wildfires;        3. abolish future uses that enhance the social and economic       futures of area residents and businesses;        4. place undue burden on adjacent property owners, lessees       and other non-recreation forest users who face potential loss       of income due to restricted travel;        5. discriminate against citizens unable to walk or ride       horseback, including those with disabilities and the elderly.        As a County comprised of 72% public lands, the Board       believes the management of these public lands should be       decided with area resource management plans developed in       cooperation with federal, state and local governments as well       as the multitude of user groups and area citizens, not by a       process where those most affected have no voice. Given the       above concerns and those in the attached Resolution, Mesa       County cannot support this proposed legislation. Furthermore,       we encourage the Colorado Congressional delegation to       introduce legislation to release all Wilderness Study Areas       from their perpetual existence as de facto Wilderness.        Please do not hesitate to contact the Mesa County       Commissioners should you wish to discuss this further.            Sincerely,      Rose Pugliese,        Chair, Board of County Commissioners.      Scott McInnis,        Commissioner.      John Justman,        Commissioner.                                   ____                               Resolution # ___      A Resolution of the Board of County Commissioners of Mesa County,   Colorado Opposing the Colorado Wilderness Act of 2015 (H.R. 3336) and   Calling on Congress to Release all Wilderness Study Areas in Colorado         Whereas, the Colorado Wilderness Act of 2015 (H.R. 3336)       (the ``Wilderness Act'') has been introduced into Congress as       the latest annual attempt to create Wilderness Areas without       the participation or endorsement of the communities in which       the areas are located; and        Whereas, Mesa County has formally declared its position on       previous Wilderness proposals throughout the past years, (see       Exhibit A--MCA 2001-17, MCM 2008-049, MCM 2009-175); and        Whereas, the Wilderness Act has been introduced by a       Congressional Representative who does not reside in or       represent the congressional districts that would be most       impacted by this proposed legislation; and        Whereas, motorized and mechanized recreation are prohibited       within Wilderness Areas; and        Whereas, motorized and mechanized recreation are areas of       important and steady economic growth throughout Colorado and       specifically in Mesa County; and        Whereas, the Wilderness Act will close off approximately       715,000 acres across the state to all mechanized use, such as       mountain bikes, chainsaws, ATV's, snowmobiles, and       motorcycles; and        Whereas, Colorado will face a potential firestorm with the       tremendous buildup of natural fuels due to unprecedented       beetle kill and the inability to lower fuel loads by       mechanized thinning under Wilderness designation; and        Whereas, the Wilderness Act would place undue hardship on       anyone who cannot walk or ride horseback to enjoy these areas       of Colorado, such as the physically disabled or elderly, and       would seem to violate the spirit of the Americans with       Disabilities Act, if not the letter of the law; and        Whereas, Wilderness designation would place undue hardship       on livestock growers to maintain fences and water sources       within the Wilderness Areas; and        Whereas, once designated a Wilderness Area, an act of       Congress is needed to take the area out of Wilderness; and        Whereas, the numerous ``Wilderness Study Areas'' identified       within the Wilderness Act have been inventoried as such over       the past several decades, are mandated to be managed as de       facto Wilderness Areas, and can only be released from this       designation by an act of Congress; and        Whereas, Mesa County has acted in good faith through       various memoranda of understanding and as a cooperating       agency as a partner in land use planning with the Bureau of       Land Management, the U. S. Forest Service and other agencies       regarding the long-term protection and management of special       areas worthy of unique management; and        Whereas, Mesa County intends to continue to coordinate       cooperatively with the Bureau of Land Management, the U. S.       Forest Service and other agencies on land management issues.        Now, therefore the Board of County Commissioners of Mesa       County, Colorado finds that:        1. The Colorado Wilderness Act of 2015 (HB 3336) is not in       the best interest of the citizens of Mesa County and the       State of Colorado, and it would cause undue economic hardship       on the surrounding communities.        2. Congress should release all Wilderness Study Areas (WSA)       in Mesa County from such designation to allow for true       multiple use those lands that are unduly restricted from       appropriate use as WSAs.        Now, therefore, be it        Resolved that the Board of County Commissioners of Mesa       County, Colorado:        1. stands opposed to the Colorado Wilderness Act of 2015       (HB 3336) in its current form; and        2. calls upon the Colorado Congressional delegation to       introduce legislation to release all Wilderness Study Areas       within Mesa County from such designation.         Passed and Adopted this 21st day of September 2015.         Board of County Commissioners of Mesa County: Rose       Pugliese, Chair.                                   ____                                                   Montezuma County,                                   Board of County Commissioners,                                           Cortez, CO, May 28, 2019.      Re Colorado Wilderness Act of 2019.       Hon. Diana DeGette,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman: Respectfully, we are writing you as a       County Commission to let you know that Montezuma County       objects to the Colorado Wilderness Act of 2019. We have been       consistently opposed since the Act was first proposed.        We ask you to permanently withdraw those portions of       Montezuma County that are included in the bill as per the BLM       and our recommendations. These areas include; Weber Mountain,       Menefee Mountain, Cross Canyon, Cahone Canyon and Squaw and       Papoose Canyons.        Since the early 1990's, Montezuma County has collaborated       with federal land managers  [[Page H1098]]       in effort to develop public land management strategies that       provide reasonable and responsible protection for our natural       resources and wild lands. This collaboration has built an       effective working relationship with federal land managers       that allows us better protect natural resources while also       ensuring the public have access to their public lands.        We believe we already have a good strategy in place for the       protection of the WSAs being proposed for wilderness that       maintains or improves their current characteristics for       future generations while providing better access for the       public to enjoy those lands in a responsible and appropriate       manner.        Congresswoman,        We have seven major areas of concern with regard to the       proposed Wilderness designations in Southwest Colorado that       we feel have not been addressed with us and you need to be       aware of:        1. Compatibility; the potential Wilderness Area designation       has some compatibility problems with the surrounding private       lands, their maintenance, and public access.        2. Best Protection of Resources; The proposed wilderness       designations present a threat to landscapes that have been       well protected under the current management.        3. The proposed legislation will create management       difficulties for both federal land managers and for       surrounding private landowners and threatens public health,       safety and wellbeing.        4. The proposed legislation undermines the integrity of the       BLM Land and Resource Management Planning process.        5. Proposed wilderness designations can trigger intense and       protracted disputes over downstream water rights.        6. Economics. Wilderness Areas are not always good for a       local economy. Often Wilderness leads to rural gentrification       and disrupts local cultures and traditions.        7. The proposed legislation is a breach of the local-      federal cooperation that we have all worked so hard to       cultivate in Southwest Colorado.        Conclusions and Recommendations.        Montezuma County objects to the proposed Wilderness       designation of;        1. Weber Mountain        2. Menefee Mountain        3. Cross Canyon        4. Cahone Canyon        5. Squaw and Papoose Canyon        We request that these five WSAs be dropped from your Bill.       And we further request your support in Congressional       delisting of those five WSAs.        We also would request your support in working with the BLM       to re-designate those WSAs as Special Recreational Management       Areas (SRMAs) and provide input in developing a customized       protection plan for each SRMA that analyzes and mitigates the       specific threats to the resources without throwing away       recreational opportunities that may be perfectly suitable,       and compatible with protection of resources.        We can't speak for the rest of the Western Slope, but in       Montezuma County, we ask that our efforts to work with the       federal land management agencies be respected. Any needed       land protection measures should be developed through an open       collaborative process in conjunction with mandated land and       resource management planning and NEPA processes.        We do not feel that Wilderness Designation has been propose       through a collaborative and transparent process at all.       Please contact us at your earliest convenience. We look       forward to working with you to craft specific protections       that meet the public expectations, respects our culture and       traditions, and truly protect resources.            Sincerely yours,      The Montezuma County Board of Commissioners, Keenan G. Ertel,       Larry Don Suckla, Jim Candelaria.     Mr. Chairman, the majority of the land in Title I of the  underlying bill would be converted into wilderness and it is in my  district.   While I am never pleased when another Member of the House tries to  tell my constituents what is best for them, I get especially frustrated  when they ignore the opinions of elected officials in the communities  in which they are seeking to make land management designations.   For instance, I might think that designating wilderness between  Denver and Boulder would cut down on the challenges the State is facing  with population growth might be something to consider, yet I have  refrained from introducing such a proposal.   The underlying bill seeks to convert several wilderness study areas  in the Third Congressional District into wilderness. The two that I  focused on in this amendment are in Montezuma County.   During the hearing on the underlying bill, Montezuma County  Commissioner Keenan Ertel testified in opposition to the proposed  wilderness additions in the county. In a letter he sent to me and to  the bill's sponsor, the board of county commissioners wrote:         We have been consistently opposed since the act was first       proposed. We ask you to permanently withdraw those portions       of Montezuma County that are included in the bill as per the       BLM and our recommendations.        Since the early 1990's, Montezuma County has collaborated       with Federal land managers in an effort to develop public       land management strategies that provide reasonable and       responsible protection for our natural resources and wild       lands. This collaboration has built an effective working       relationship with Federal land managers that allows us to       better protect natural resources while also ensuring the       public have access to their public lands.        We believe we already have a good strategy in place for the       protection of the WSAs being proposed for wilderness that       maintains or improves their current characteristics for       future generations while providing better access for the       public to enjoy those lands in a responsible and appropriate       manner.    In the letter, the commissioners mention the BLM's recommendation.  This is because the BLM studied the lands that my colleague is  proposing to be added to wilderness and determined that they are not  suitable. In fact, one of the parcels has a D8 bulldozer sitting on the  land. This doesn't meet the standard of untrammeled by man.   Aside from the fact that the BLM has determined that these lands are  not suitable for wilderness, the current WSA designation has created  management challenges for the county when it comes to noxious weeds,  wildfire prevention and mitigation, and managing the challenges of the  Federal-private checkerboard that we see throughout the West.   It is for all of these reasons, but especially because of the local  opposition, that I urged my colleagues to remove the land in Montezuma  County from the bill during the legislative process.   Additionally, my colleague's amendment to the underlying bill added  additional land to Montezuma and Dolores Counties for wilderness  designation. I will note that the counties are also opposed to these  lands being added as indicated in their opposition letter.   While this amendment focuses on land in Montezuma County, I also want  to say that the Mesa County Board of County Commissioners has written  to me and the bill's sponsor about its opposition to the bill and the  proposed wilderness additions in its county. There seems to be a common  theme here.   I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment. But given the lack  of local support this bill has in western Colorado, this amendment is  not enough to fix the flaws of the bill.   Therefore, I will encourage my colleagues who believe that local  input is important in land management decisions to oppose the  underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am grateful that my colleague, who I also  have a lot of respect for, did come down to Montezuma County.   I hope while the gentlewoman was there, she had the opportunity to  spend a little money, buy a few presents to take back and help an area  that is often left out and forgotten in Colorado.   What the gentlewoman spoke to is important. She mentioned that the  city council and the mayor were supportive. That is great. But they  aren't responsible for the county lands, which the county commissioners  are responsible for. It was within the confines of the city limits.  Does that diminish their right to be able to have an opinion? It does  not.   What is not being addressed is these are already protected lands.  There isn't a person in the State of Colorado or in the country that  can go on any of those lands and try to develop them, to put in a road,  to put in a tower for transmission. That would have to go through a  planning process, a comment process, if anything were to happen.   Those local comments, the impacts that our county commissioners are  seeing, those who are responsible for the land should not be ignored,  should be listened to, and I would encourage the adoption of my  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  [[Page H1102]]     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, military aviation and training is critical to the  national security interests of the United States and the readiness of  our Armed Forces.   My district is home to one of the installations that conducts  military aviation training missions for our men and women in uniform,  the High Altitude Army National Guard Aviation Training Site, or HAATS,  located in Gypsum, Colorado.   It is both an honor and a privilege to be able to represent the lone  U.S. Department of Defense schoolhouse where rotary-wing aviators in  our Nation's Armed Forces and our foreign allies learn how to be able  to safely fly rotary-wing aircraft in mountainous high-altitude  environments. The life-saving training that is required by our  servicemen and women at HAATS is vital to our national security and our  readiness.   Mr. Chairman, Title I of the Protecting America's Wilderness Act  would establish five wilderness or potential wilderness areas within  the HAATS training area.   During this Congress, numerous pieces of legislation designating  wilderness continue to be introduced without taking into consideration  the potential effects that these designations would have on readiness.  Proactively, Congress should work to be able to ensure current and  future wilderness proposals do not interfere with readiness of our  Armed Forces when it comes to aviation training.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to  conduct a study, which would examine the impacts of the expansion of  wilderness designations in the western United States and what they  would have on the readiness of our Armed Forces with respect to  aviation training.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments of Ms. DeGette of  Colorado, and I yield back the balance of my time.
