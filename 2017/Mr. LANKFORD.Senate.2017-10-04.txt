 Madam President, I would recommend to this body  something that is obvious to all of us. Our economy is stuck. We are in  a bad spot of just treading water. Over the last 11 years, our gross  domestic product--that is how much our economy is growing--has been 1.9  percent, and 1.9 percent is a tiny change.   Just to give you a perspective, over the last 100 years, there has  not been a single decade when we have not had a year without at least 3  percent growth, until the last decade. Literally, our economy, is  typically growing; that is, more jobs are being added, people are  making more money, there is more happening, and we are selling more  internationally. In America, over the last 100 years, it has just  slowly grown and grown and grown until the last 10 years, and, then, it  has flattened out. We are stuck.   Now, when I was younger, we had a record player in the house. Now,  for all of you under 40, I would explain that a record player is kind  of like a CD player, only it was larger and made of vinyl. But if I say  that, then, all the under-20 crowd will say: What is a CD player?   Let me just say this. The big black pieces of vinyl that played music  at my house occasionally would get stuck. The record needle would land  in the same groove and play the same part of the song over and over. It  was my job, as the youngest one in the house, to go over to the record  and bump it and get it out of that. Our economy needs that.   We need to be able to get over to our economy, which is stuck in the  same groove at 1.9 percent in this incredibly low-growth rate, and give  it a bump. Now, that bump can come in a lot of ways: increasing  international trade would be a great help, engaging more  internationally, keeping our regulations common sense and as  nonintrusive as possible so that small businesses and medium-sized  businesses aren't panicked all the time of what the Federal Government  is going to do to them with a new regulation. Just keep them common  sense and simple.   How about making sure that there are fewer Federal forms and that the  Federal forms that people have to fill out not only are simple to do  but they don't duplicate over multiple different agencies. It would be  good if people who worked in small, medium, and large businesses spent  more time selling products than they did filling out a form for some  Federal bureaucracy that is never going to read that form anyway.   The obvious way to be able to bump the record needle in our economy  right now is tax reform. It is not the main thing that is going to do  everything, but it is a pretty big element. If we can get tax reform  done, it actually gives our economy a little bit of a boost. Now, I  have folks that will say: How does that make a difference? When you do  tax reform, why does that actually increase economic activity?   Well, quite frankly, people around the country and in my State of  Oklahoma are struggling to be able to save money because their wages  aren't growing at the same speed that everything else is going up in  price. So people need to be able to save more money and to be able to  have more money to be able to spend.   Also, we need to create more jobs and we need to get companies going  again and actually developing more jobs. If people can actually get a  job, if people can make more money at that job, and if people actually  have more take-home pay, they spend a little more, they save a little  more, and the company expands a little more. If each  [[Page S6304]]  place does that a little bit, it dramatically increases our economy  around the country, and we know it because we feel it.   Making the Tax Code simpler for every person in every business means  people don't have to pay as much to have their taxes done. Maybe you  can do your own taxes because it would be simple enough to do it, and  it wouldn't cost so much. Accountants who work for businesses could go  back to working for their businesses to see how they can make their  businesses more efficient rather than spending all of their time just  on tax policy.    I think we should follow the lead of the President on this. The  President made a very clear statement. He said: Let's help our  companies compete, but to do that we have to also knock down barriers  that stand in the way of their success. For example, the President  said:         Over the years, a parade of lobbyists have rigged the tax       code to benefit particular companies and industries. Those       with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up       paying no taxes at all. But all the rest are hit with one of       the highest corporate tax rates in the world. It makes no       sense, and it has to change.        So tonight, I'm asking Democrats and Republicans to       simplify the system. Get rid of the loopholes. Level the       playing field. And use the savings to lower the corporate tax       rate for the first time in 25 years.    Did I fail to mention that the President who said that is President  Obama? President Obama did, right down the hallway, in 2011, in his  State of the Union address. That is what he said we should do: simplify  the system, lower the corporate tax rate, and be able to deal with all  of the loopholes that are in the system.   This shouldn't be a partisan issue. Everyone sees this, Republicans  and Democrats alike.   So my focus is this. How do we actually get this done and not make it  into a partisan food fight here but actually do what is right for the  American people and help bump the economy to be able to help get us  going again?   In my State--whether you live in Valliant, Gotebo, Healton, Sayre,  Muskogee, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, or Lawton--this matters because  everyone unfortunately pays taxes. Everyone knows it is a necessary  thing, but we want to have it as simple as possible and to have it as  low as possible, and we want to make sure it is as fair as possible.   So the framework has been presented this past week. It is a simple  framework for how we deal with tax policy. It talks about consolidating  our rates. We have seven rates now. We would drop that down to four  rates. There would be a 0-percent rate, a 12-percent, a 25-percent, and  a 35-percent rate.   Now, some folks have asked me about the 0-percent rate, because a lot  of Americans say one simple thing: Every American is an American, and  every American should pay a little bit in taxes. I would agree, by the  way. But every American is paying some taxes. For those folks at the  lowest end of the scale, I would propose dropping the rate to zero for  them on income taxes, but they are paying their fair share in property  tax, in gas tax, and in sales tax. They are helping their local fire  department and their local police department. They are paying for the  roads that are federally subsidized, based on their gas tax. They are  paying taxes, but if they are not at a rate and at an income high  enough to be able to survive at that rate, then let's drop theirs to 0  percent for income tax. They will keep some of the other taxes so they  can still contribute to society and still be a part of this great  Nation.   Dropping those rates down to the lowest bracket being 0 percent for  income tax, then 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent is a pretty  standard rate. Quite frankly, this is something that was proposed in  the Simpson-Bowles proposal before, which was a bipartisan proposal,  for it to be able to come out, on how we can reform the system.   Eliminating the alternative minimum tax--do you want to talk about a  complicated tax code? Basically, we have two Tax Codes. We have the  standard Tax Code, and then we have the alternative minimum tax.  Everyone who does their taxes has to do them twice to be able to  evaluate which one of the codes they actually fit into. Now, if are  using an electronic system, you lose track of it because the electronic  system on the computer is doing that for you. But the AMT dramatically  increases the complexity of the code. We should do away with that.    If we want to be able to protect the folks who are in the lowest  bracket, then let's double what is the standard deduction. Right now  the standard deduction is about $12,000. Let's double that to about  $24,000. That $24,000 amount for families would mean that the first  $24,000 of income that you would make as a family would fall into that  0-percent bracket. So you are paying zero income tax to the Federal  Government until you make more than $24,000. That protects a lot of  families in the lowest end of the bracket to make sure they are not  falling into this.   Quite frankly, in Oklahoma, most Oklahomans just use the standard  deduction. They don't itemize. Doubling the standard deduction would  mean that for a lot of those specialized deductions that everyone else  gets, it actually flattens that out. It makes it fair. The No. 1 thing  I hear from people when they fill out their taxes is not only that they  filled them out and turned them in, but they say: I have no idea  whether I did them right. It was so complicated, and I don't know if it  is right. Then, the second thing they say, though, right behind that,  is this: Why is it that, when I read through the hundred pages of  instructions on the 1040 form, every deduction seems to be for someone  else?   So let's increase the standard deduction so everybody gets a flatter,  simpler, and fairer system, and let's keep the biggest of the  deductions that most Americans use, like the charitable deduction or  the mortgage interest deduction. If there are any two deductions that  most people use, it is those two. So let's protect those two in the  system.   As for reducing the corporate tax rate, I have folks say that it only  benefits the biggest businesses. I always smile and say: Those are  actually people who employ people. If you reduce the corporate rate,  that means they are more competitive internationally and that means  they are not having to move their corporate headquarters overseas.   For years, as a nation we have used the carrot-and-stick approach on  trying to keep businesses here in the United States; that is, if they  go overseas, beat them with a stick and try to punish them for trying  to move. Why don't we use the carrot approach? Why don't we find out  why they are moving overseas and fix that? Many of these companies are  moving overseas because of the very high corporate tax rate here in the  United States. Let's fix that. Over the decades, many of our competing  nations have done that. We should fix that. That increases the number  of jobs, that increases economic activity, and that keeps American jobs  in America.   We should deal with the child tax credit and continue to be able to  protect that for families.   We can deal with how we do expensing. Now, if you don't run a  business, that doesn't matter much to you. But if you are the one who  owns the small business, you understand how expensing works. If you  have a cost to your business this year and if you can't write it off in  this year, you have to expand that out, and you know that slows you  down.   Here are the basics. If you are running a small business and you need  to buy a new pickup for your business, if it takes you years to be able  to depreciate that out, you are slower to do it. But if you know you  can depreciate it out this year in your business, you are more likely  to buy that. So that business buys a new truck this year. Well, that  not only benefits that business in having new equipment, but it also  benefits the Ford dealership down the street that actually sold them  the truck, and it benefits all of the people in the area who helped  supply that vehicle. So it trickles down through the rest of the  economy.   There are ways to be able to accomplish all of these things and to be  able to be as simple as we possibly can be.   There has been a lot of conversation about worldwide taxation as  well. People seem to get confused on that area because most people  don't live in that world. Here are the basics of it: Right now, if you  are an American company and you are selling things overseas and  [[Page S6305]]  doing business overseas, when you make a profit overseas and you try to  bring that money back, you get taxed overseas at their tax rate, which  you should, in that country you are making the product and selling it,  but you get taxed again when you bring it back to the United States. We  are the only country that does it that way.   If we will just simplify the system, it will actually encourage  companies to be able to stay in America and then do business all over  the world rather than moving their company out of America. It is a  simple way to be able to do it, and it is a way that we can do and  should do. You will hear the term ``repatriation,'' and that is really  what it is about. It is Americans being able to move their money from  overseas accounts back to the United States and get that money moving.   There was a lot of conversation about the stimulus plan back in 2009  trying to get almost a trillion dollars of government money--that is  money from you and me--and to be able to move that around in a stimulus  package. Let me give you the figure. Right now, it is estimated that  American companies have about $2.5 trillion of private money parked  overseas that they are not going to bring back to our economy because  of the high cost of the tax coming back. If we were able to change that  system, $2.5 trillion of private money would move from overseas back  into the United States. What effect would that have on our economy? I  would stipulate that it would be a pretty dramatic effect that it would  have on our economy.   We can fix this. We can resolve this. This shouldn't be as hard as we  are making it, and it can be a bipartisan approach to be able to  address some basic things--taking care of our families, making sure we  are watching out for those who are in poverty, simplifying the code,  making sure deductions aren't for a few but that they are spread out  across the way that we handle it, protecting things like charitable  giving and the mortgage interest deduction and things that most  Americans use. These are the parameters we are trying to be able to  work through over the next couple of weeks.    Hopefully in the coming months, as we work through all the details in  the committee process with amendments and coming to the floor and being  able fight our way through the process, we will be able to actually get  to a decision that will help us long term as a nation. This is  something that can and should be resolved. It is one of the issues I  have to raise to this body again.   This body has had a hard time actually moving on the biggest issues  we face as a nation because the rules of this body prohibit us from  debating them. The rules haven't changed over the past multiple  decades, but the way we operate has. The American people are ticked  about it, and rightfully so. The Senators in this body are frustrated  with it. May I remind us that the rules of the Senate are set by the  Senate? So if we are frustrated with the rules, we should address them.   Many of you have heard me speak about this in the past.   There are three basic rule changes that I think will change  dramatically how business gets done in the Senate. The biggest one is  the filibuster rule. We have two filibusters for every single bill that  comes up. There is one at the beginning. You have to get 60 votes to  start debate; you have to get 60 votes to stop debate; then the bill  passes with 51. That needs to change. We should take away the first 60  votes at the beginning. We should be able to get onto a bill.  Regardless of whether it is Republicans or Democrats in the majority,  the majority party should be able to bring up a bill and debate it  without being stopped. Let's bring up any issue and actually debate it.  Let's not inhibit debate in this body. If we can't find agreement, keep  the 60 votes at the end of it so we can keep the debate going until it  gets resolved, but we should be able to debate the issues.   The second big issue is that we have to deal with nominations in an  appropriate time period. Currently, my Democratic colleagues are  forcing the long periods of time in debate for every single nominee who  comes up. I had folks say that is what Republicans did in the past.  That is actually not true. This is the first time it has happened like  this.   This week, we are going to move four nominees for the President in 1  week--four. Under the current structure, it will take 11 years for  President Trump to get his staff. Let me give you a barometer of where  things have been in the past. As of yesterday, President Trump had 153  confirmations. At this same point, President Obama had 337 total.  President Bush had 358 total at this same point. President Trump is not  getting his nominees heard, and they are being slow-walked through the  process.   We have to fix that. A simple way to fix it is to allow only 2, 4, or  8 hours of debate, not this protracted 30 hours of debate per nominee.  It is already a resolved issue. Everybody knows it. These individuals  have already gone through committee. They were already voted on in  committee. By the time they get to the floor, it is resolved. The 30  hours of debate time is purely delay tactics. We should be able to  resolve that within 2, 4, or 8 hours total.   Here is a radical idea: If we want to get the Senate going again, we  can agree to a rule change that would allow for what is called dual- tracking. We would do nominations in the morning and legislation in the  afternoon. Right now, we can only do one thing at a time in the Senate,  so while we are waiting on a nomination vote, everything waits until  that is done. It slows down the process. Why can't we do nominations in  the morning and legislation in the afternoon?   There are basic rule changes that will help that are not partisan  issues. They are designed to get the Senate moving regardless of who is  in the majority. We have to resolve this long term. If we don't, the  American people will continue to be frustrated, and we as Senators will  continue to be frustrated.
