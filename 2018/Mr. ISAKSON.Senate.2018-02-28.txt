 Mr. President, today America and the world have lost a  great man in Billy Graham. As Senator Thune said in his own remarks  quoting Billy Graham, don't grieve for Billy Graham--he has not gone  anywhere except to be at the right hand of his Father Almighty at home  in Heaven. He has left us, but he is in Heaven.   For his entire life, 99 years, he witnessed on behalf of that place  called Heaven and his Father to try to take his message around the  world and to people around the world.   I spend a lot of time working with young people, and when I do, many  times I work with them in my church. I taught Sunday school for 30  years. That is a hard challenge sometimes, trying to figure out what it  is you are going to do to get through to people, especially young  people, but I learned from Billy Graham that the best way to teach  people about God is to witness for God. Billy Graham was the preeminent  witness for faith, if there ever were one.   We all could turn on the TV tonight and find a televangelist who, for  a $25  [[Page S1266]]  donation, will send you a Bible and a cross and tell you that you are  saved. That is not true. You may be saved from him, but you haven't  been saved with Jesus.   Billy Graham lived the kind of life that teaches all of us that we  should respect and understand and honor what Jesus Christ stands for  and what Christianity means, and we should live our lives as an example  to others of what it is like to be a Christian.   In the sadness of the loss of Billy Graham, I am reminded of the Book  of Thessalonians and Paul's letter to the Thessalonians, where in two  of the shortest verses in the Bible, he says:         Rejoice evermore. Pray without ceasing.    In terms of Billy Graham's life, I think we are in that period of  time right now. We should rejoice for the great service that he gave to  all of us, the great messages he brought in his crusades around the  world, and we should pray without ceasing that the world will continue  to be blessed by God and by great people like Billy Graham and those  who would follow him and, in our small way, if we will do the  witnessing we need to do to see to it that we are disciples of that  faith and for Jesus Christ.   For me, coming to the floor today, I have an important task, because  witnessing and evangelism is about other people taking the message for  other folks.                            ____________________     Mr. President, back in my home State of Georgia, in my  neighborhood in east Cobb County, there is a man by the name of Henry  Holley. In my few minutes left, I want to honor Henry Holley because he  is an interesting individual.   Although there is no such thing as a former marine, he was a U.S.  marine for 22 years. He met Dr. Graham at a crusade. He volunteered to  help him in his off-duty time and so impressed Dr. Graham that Billy  Graham asked him to join his crusades.   He said: I can't do it right now. I have 2 more years in my  commitment.   Billy Graham said: If you come to me at the end of those 2 years, I  will put you on my team.   Forty-eight years ago, Henry Holley joined the team of Billy Graham.  He became his Asian representative. In fact, today Henry Holley is the  last of the original Billy Graham team who is left alive on this Earth.  Henry is 90 years old, living in east Cobb County, and witnessing every  single day all that he learned from Billy Graham and what Billy  Graham's crusades meant to him.   They set up crusades in Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, South Korea, and all  over the world. Henry Holley has been in and out of North Korea more  than anybody in this country. He goes there with Samaritan's Purse to  help people who are oppressed, taking to them the message of Jesus  Christ, working and doing everything he can to improve the plight of  those people who are oppressed and depressed by a rogue regime.   Henry Holley is one of the finest people I have ever known. I know  when Dr. Graham passed away, Henry was not sad but happy because he has  always talked about knowing that ultimately Billy Graham's place in  Heaven would be his just reward. Henry could not wait until he could  join Billy Graham there so they could be together at the end.   So I know Henry is probably watching, or if he isn't watching,  somebody will tell him about my mentioning his name. I am doing it to  honor Henry but also to honor Billy Graham, because the one-on-one  passing of the Word from me to someone else, from Henry Holley to  someone else, from Dr. Graham to someone else, is the way Christianity  was built over the decades and over the years and will continue to be  preserved in the years to come.   So as we honor in the U.S. Senate and in the United States of America  a great man, a great leader, a man of God, and a servant of God, I am  just so thankful I had the opportunity to be in this Chamber on the day  we honored Billy Graham and his life. I am so happy I had the ability  and the opportunity to know his servant, Henry Holley, and be one of  those along the way whom Henry helped to live a more responsible and  loving life.   I yield the floor.
