 Madam Speaker, each year I am lucky to work  with smart, dedicated students in my district through our student  advisory panel. I am amazed and motivated by their passion, civic  engagement, and thoughtfulness. They give me hope.   Throughout this month, our communities smile, as some of these young  leaders graduate from high school.   To celebrate this milestone, I congratulate each of my graduates by  name:   Will Bond, Sreekara Dandibhotla, Emma Eby, Mark Ellison, Michael  Gribbin, Frances Holcomb, Chloe Jeon, Elisabeth Kokorin, Phoebe Lee,  Aditi Mangal, Noah Pletcher, Jayleen Santana, Caden Schaeffer, Charlie  Sywulak-Herry, and Gabriella Thomas.   In addition, our task force would not be possible without the care  and organization of teachers Alan Malachowski and Jenn Statler of the  Pennsylvania State Education Association. I thank them both.   I wish each of our students the brightest future. I thank them for  being leaders in our community, and I know they will continue to be  leaders wherever life takes them.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition  to H.R. 288, the Separation of Powers Restoration Act, SOPRA.   If passed, Federal agencies would have a harder time protecting  Americans from threats to our health, safety, and our well-being at a  time when we need our agencies with their expertise and resources to be  their most effective.   In just one of the most egregious examples, this bill would make it  easier for weapons to fall into the hands of the wrong people,  endangering countless American lives.   For example, it would make it harder for the Attorney General to  implement regulations to improve our National Instant Criminal  Background Check System.   Madam Speaker, I will offer a motion to recommit this bill to our  committee, the Committee on the Judiciary, and to amend this bill to  ensure that the AG's rules and regulations around the background check  system remains unaffected.   The system is used nationally for determining someone's ability to  possess a firearm. Its effectiveness is crucial to the safety and  security of our communities, communities that are already struggling  and reeling with far too many guns in the wrong hands.   While Republicans and Democrats are debating on how to address the  gun violence epidemic in this country, 97 percent of Americans have  made up their mind. They are angry, and they know we need effective  background check systems.   As part of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a bill that was  signed into law just 1 year ago, we enhanced our background check  system. We cannot afford to go backwards in any way, and this bill  would do just that.   Ignoring the fact that in this country we suffer the scourge of  48,000 people a year dying of gun violence, more than 60 percent of  those deaths are suicide; 8 children a day die in this country of gun  violence.                                time  0930    I can't believe I must say this. Gun violence has become the leading  cause of death for America's children. Shame on us.   Keeping firearms out of the hands of dangerous people is good for  American communities, will save lives, will save our children's lives.  We have to save more people.   SOPRA, this bill, is a dangerous bill. Thus, I hope my colleagues  will join me in voting for the motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment into the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion  to recommit.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit  at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
