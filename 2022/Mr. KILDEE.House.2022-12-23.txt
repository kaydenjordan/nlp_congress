 Mr. Speaker, the Great Lakes are essential to Michigan's  economy and our way of life. They foster billions of dollars in  economic activity in our local economies and support millions of jobs  in the fishing, boating and tourism industries. That's why I am pleased  the Great Lakes Authority was included in the FY2023 Omnibus. By  investing in job training and workforce development, this new federal  entity will empower our workers, lift up the Great Lakes region and  build back our communities. The regional plan will help us combat  climate and create more good-paying jobs here in Michigan. I look  forward to developing the Great Lakes Authority further in the next  Congress and working across the aisle to advance meaningful community  engagement and economic growth for our region.
