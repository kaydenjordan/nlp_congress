 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote  on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate National Court  Reporting and Captioning Week.   As an attorney, from firsthand experience, I can say that court  reporters have had and continue to have an enormous impact on our legal  system, both in a practical matter but also in an important historical  sense. As we attorneys talk away, court reporters tirelessly capture  every single word. The importance of this cannot be underestimated.  Without their record, there would be no Brown v. Board of Education,  Miranda v. Arizona, or countless other legal decisions of importance to  the American people.   Captioners also do wonderful work to help better the lives for  millions of Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing by providing  captioning realtime.   So, on National Court Reporting and Captioning Week, I want to thank  the thousands of Americans who work in this industry for their hard  work and dedication.                            ____________________
