 Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand in  support of the most defenseless among us, unborn children.   Since Roe v. Wade in 1973, we have seen more than 60 million fellow  human beings lose their lives. This is the greatest human rights  violation, largest humanitarian crisis, and gravest assault on  inalienable rights of our time. We will not sit by and watch this  happen.   As a doctor and a soldier, I have spent my whole life fighting to  save lives, to protect the innocent. I work now to see the end to this  assault on life.   Part of that starts with ending funding to Planned Parenthood,  America's largest abortion provider, which performs more than 320,000  abortions every single year. This is more than one out of every three  abortions.   Abortion must end, because America stands on the equal worth of every  human being.
