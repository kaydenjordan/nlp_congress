 HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  the opportunity to speak on behalf of my bill, H.R. 6108, the  Preserving America's Battlefields Act.   Mr. Speaker, the American Battlefield Protection Program was first  authorized in 1996 by Congress in order to promote and protect  significant American battlefield sites, as well as to provide an  educational platform for current and future generations of Americans.  Since the inception of this program, Battlefield Land Acquisition  Grants have been used extensively to preserve portions of dozens of  battlefield sites that have played a significant role in the American  Revolution,  [[Page H9776]]  the War of 1812, and the American Civil War.   These dollar-for-dollar matching land grants have saved more than  30,000 acres of battlefields across 20 States. Just this past year, in  my own district, this program assisted in securing 180 acres of  battlegrounds surrounding the site of Kettle Creek Battlefield, which  is the site of the only significant patriot victory in Georgia during  the Revolutionary War.   This bill would reauthorize the successful bipartisan Federal grant  programs, and would dedicate a portion of that authorization for  educational purposes and for the restoration and interpretation of  high-priority battlefield sites.   This will help make these battlegrounds beautiful, historic, and  educational tourist destinations. This program has been one of the most  successful and efficient land grant programs in our Nation's history,  continually receiving bipartisan support. Both former Presidents George  W. Bush and Barack Obama supported the program's authorization and  subsequent reauthorizations, respectively. I am very proud to say that  this bill has continued in that rich tradition of bipartisan support  here in the 115th Congress.   With the 250th anniversary of our Nation's founding fast approaching,  there is no better time to protect our battlefields and prepare them  for the influx of visitors expected during that time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Bishop, the minority, our hardworking  Natural Resources Committee staff, and the American Battlefield Trust  for helping us get this bill across the finish line.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 6893) to amend the Overtime Pay for Protective  Services Act of 2016 to extend the Secret Service overtime pay  exception through 2019, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6893         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Secret Service Overtime Pay       Extension Act''.       SEC. 2.

[[Page H9793]]     HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Secret Service is the premier protective agency  in the world. Secret Service agents and officers play a vital role in  defending the President, high-ranking government officials, and events  of national significance.   Protection is a round-the-clock job, and Secret Service personnel  often work extensive overtime to fulfill their zero-fail mission.   Under current law, Federal employees across the government may not be  paid above an annual premium pay cap. The cap consists of base pay,  including locality pay, and premium pay, such as overtime. The cap is  in place to ensure a hierarchy of pay so that frontline employees do  not earn more than their supervisors who are ineligible for overtime  pay. It also helps to control agency spending on compensation.   The cap, however, has led to issues at the Secret Service. Due to a  staffing shortage and increased protective responsibilities, Secret  Service personnel are expected to work increasing amounts of overtime,  causing them to hit the premium pay cap well in advance of the end of  the year.   Secret Service personnel are expected to continue working once they  hit the cap, but they receive no extra compensation for this work. This  phenomenon is known as maxing out at the agency, and it can cause  morale and attrition problems.   Committee staff recently traveled to observe Secret Service  operations in Europe. During that trip, the topic of maxing out came up  as an issue consistently on the minds of personnel in the field. The  maxing out issue is expected to get worse in 2020, when the burdens of  the Presidential campaign cycle cause a large increase in hours worked  by the Secret Service.   In the previous Presidential election cycle, Congress raised the  premium pay cap for Secret Service personnel to the Executive Schedule  Level II, ensuring Secret Service personnel receive additional  compensation commensurate with the amount of time they must work.   This waiver of the governmentwide premium pay cap was extended to the  end of 2018 by the Secret Service Recruitment and Retention Act.  Without a further extension, Secret Service personnel will once again  be subject to the lower pay cap.   H.R. 6893 extends the premium pay cap waiver to the end of 2020.  Between 700 and 900 personnel will be eligible for extra pay in 2019,  while approximately 1,150 will be eligible in 2020.   The bill also continues a series of reports due to Congress on the  premium pay cap, to ensure its appropriate use.   Extending the premium pay cap waiver also gives time for the  Government Accountability Office to complete ongoing review of the  Secret Service's staffing issues.   Finally, it ensures the agency doesn't backtrack on staffing progress  made to date. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee continues  to maintain that the premium pay cap waiver cannot be a permanent  change and that the Secret Service must fix its own staffing issues and  problems.   For now, however, I do urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I will take just a moment to give a huge thank you to  the sponsor of this bill, Mr.  Steve Russell from Oklahoma.  Unfortunately, his flight was delayed. I know he would have loved to  have been here to speak on this bill. I give a shout-out to him,  thanking him for his leadership here. And also, as the gentleman from  Massachusetts mentioned, other cosponsors, Mr. Cummings, Mrs. Watson  Coleman, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), and others, thanks to  each of them.   Mr. Speaker, may the gentleman from Massachusetts be aware that I  have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close.  [[Page H9794]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I also urge adoption of  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
