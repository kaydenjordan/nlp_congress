 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the eyes of the American people and  the entire world are fixed on Eastern Europe. Vladimir Putin is  continuing his unjustifiable invasion of a sovereign country and his  unprovoked killing of innocent people.   Over the weekend, Senators were honored to speak electronically with  Ukraine's brave leader, President Zelenskyy. His courageous leadership  has helped rally freedom-loving people the world over to the  Ukrainians' cause. One of his main pleas was that America and our  partners continue providing Ukraine with additional military assistance  and to do so very quickly. Long before the invasion began, I was on  this floor warning the Biden administration that we could not let  assistance be trickled out at the speed of bureaucracy. I certainly  hope that lesson has finally been learned.                                     Iran    But even while one foreign policy nightmare plays out in Eastern  Europe, inexplicably, the Biden administration is reportedly poised to  announce a giant, gratuitous capitulation to our principal adversary in  the Middle East as well.   The nature of the Biden administration's approach to Tehran thus far  has concerned not just Republicans but Members of both parties.   Our Democratic colleague, the chairman of the Foreign Relations  Committee, recently exhorted the administration and our partners to  ``exert more pressure on Iran to counter its nuclear program, its  missile program, and its dangerous behavior around the Middle East,  including attacks on American personnel and [American] assets.''   I would note that Senator Menendez also stressed the importance of  building bipartisan support for any new deal which the President's team  wants to cook up with the Iranians. This is the same message I conveyed  to the President and his top advisers at the beginning of the Biden  administration. If he wants his policy or his deal to endure beyond his  Presidency, he must bring Republicans on board.   Regrettably, President Biden appears to have ignored this good  advice. Reports indicate a sequel--a sequel--to the bad 2015 nuclear  deal may be imminent. Yet the administration has laid zero bipartisan  framework.   Rumors of this impending deal--because rumors are all that Congress  has--suggest it would be an enormous step in the wrong direction. It  appears not to be a longer and stronger deal than the JCPOA, as was  promised, but a weaker and shorter deal. It appears  [[Page S1002]]  not to safeguard and increase our leverage over Tehran and its  Revolutionary Guard but instead to breezily, sort of, sign our leverage  away.   President Biden appears to want to give Tehran enduring sanctions  relief now in exchange for limited and short-term curbs on their  nuclear program. A reminder of how bad President Obama's Iran deal was  is the fact that these restrictions will begin to expire as soon as  next year. That will put more pressure on Western negotiators, not on  Iran.   This is extortion playing out step by step, and this administration  seems prepared to sign on to it. Iran gets serious sanctions relief and  expanded trade with Russia and China, their price is even fewer  restrictions than the original failed Iran deal, and those restrictions  begin to expire in just 2 years. This is really wildly reckless. This  is an administration chasing a deal--any deal--instead of pursuing our  interests.   There is some suspicion the administration is desperate for any  excuse to ease sanctions on Iranian oil exports to help blunt the  impact of the European crisis on American's pocketbooks. This White  House seems determined to go hat in hand and beg every bad actor around  the world to ramp up their own fossil fuel production but still will  not stop their holy war against our own American energy production here  at home.   If press reports of the deal are accurate, the President and the  Democrats on Capitol Hill surely understand that it will not be  accepted widely or quietly.   If the President seeks to remove sanctions on Iran, there will be  votes. Democrats who now regret their recent vote to protect the Nord  Stream 2 Pipeline should think twice before voting to help President  Biden ease sanctions on Iranian entities that engage in terrorism,  missile proliferation, or human rights abuses.   Given Chairman Menendez's concerns, I hope and would expect the  Foreign Relations Committee will hold major hearings. But I know this  much for certain: The next time Republicans control the Senate,  vigorous oversight will take place over the diplomatic mess that is  unfolding in the Middle East: the failure to consolidate the historic  gains of the Abraham Accords; gigantic unilateral concessions to the  most active state sponsor of terrorism in the entire world; pointless  capitulation to Iran-backed Houthi terrorists that has only yielded  even more violence in Yemen and increased ballistic missile and drone  attacks against Saudi and Emirati cities.   It is bad enough that Democrats in Congress have spent months  actively fighting against sufficient funding for our national defense  and our Armed Forces, but these dynamics are made even more dangerous  by a White House that is actively choosing weakness in the Middle East.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
