 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the hard  work and dedication of Ms. Charolette Tidwell and her organization,  Antioch for Youth and Family, in Fort Smith, AR. This nonprofit, all- volunteer organization has played an important role in feeding local  families for several years, but its efforts in 2020 made it a critical  lifeline for thousands of people in western Arkansas.   Last year alone, Antioch distributed more than 3.5 million pounds of  food, including almost 1 million pounds of fresh produce, milk, dairy,  and cooked meats provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture  Coronavirus Food Assistance Program. By hosting regular drive-up events  at Martin Luther King Park in Fort Smith, Ms. Tidwell and her team  provided help to families who needed it most during the COVID-19  pandemic. In 2020, their efforts meant more than $6 million worth of  food went to local residents, making it one of the largest food  assistance efforts in the State. More than one in six households in  Arkansas is food insecure. In Fort Smith, that number is one in five.  Unfortunately, the current crisis has only increased those needs.   I have been honored to visit with Ms. Tidwell and see her impressive  efforts to fill the gap in her community in action. Before the  pandemic, she was already hard at work with a food pantry, a community  garden, and mobile food deliveries to low-income elderly and disabled  residents and other struggling families.   She has been an inspiration whose work has been recognized  nationwide. L'Oreal Paris honored her in 2017 as one of 10 Women of  Worth and in 2020 with the L'Oreal Paris Karen T. Fondu Impact Award  for her tireless efforts to address the area's hunger crisis. Last  year, she was featured on bags of Lay's potato chips as part of the  company's initiative featuring ordinary people who do extraordinary  things.   Those awards and acknowledgements speak to the nature of her impact  and the vital role she plays within the community. Fortunately, she has  once again dedicated herself to meeting a tremendous need with the same  compassion and care she brings to every challenge.   I am grateful for Ms. Tidwell, the entire team at Antioch for Youth  and Family, and their wonderful partners. With support from the River  Valley Regional Food Bank, Feeding America, local businesses, and many  volunteers, Antioch continues to make a difference and set an example  for organizations across the State and the Nation.                            ____________________
