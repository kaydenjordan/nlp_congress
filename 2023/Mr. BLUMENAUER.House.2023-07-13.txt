 Mr. Speaker, I couldn't disagree more with my  distinguished colleague who just spoke.   Even with 1,500 proposed amendments to the National Defense  Authorization Act, it remains a disgrace. The majority talks big about  cutting money, but they fail on some of the most fundamental  opportunities.   They reject commonsense solutions and have failed to support  meaningful cost-saving reforms. They have held the global economy  hostage over spending levels, but I hope they will take advantage yet  to make some adjustments, including my amendment with Representatives  McGovern and Garamendi to end the wasteful funding of the outdated,  ineffective B83-1 bomber that the 2022 defense posture laid out. It was  unnecessary and wasteful.   If they wanted to get serious about addressing spending levels, we  should stop wasting taxpayer dollars on weapons that don't work, on  ships the Navy doesn't want, and nuclear weapons that are outdated and  increasingly costly to maintain.   Adding even more money to an all-time record defense spending regime  does nothing to improve American security or strengthen our allies,  including the valiant Ukrainians in a fight for their very survival.    At a time of renewed security threats to the United States, a war  raging in Ukraine, tensions in Asia and the Pacific, so much  controversy over government spending, this legislation falls so  painfully short of the mark.   It is funding battleships that don't work after spending billions to  develop the Freedom-class littoral combat ships that marked their  initial run with engine failures. The Navy doesn't want them. Retiring  them would save $4.3 billion over the next 5 years, but Republicans  continue to protect it to have jobs in Florida.   This bill leaves unfinished business in the work of protecting our  troops, their families, and their neighborhoods from military toxins  and explosives. Congress has long failed to make UXO and toxin cleanup  a priority, and our servicemen and civilians continue to pay the price.   The United States is the largest energy consumer in the world. We  should be focusing on ways to make them even more energy efficient.   The Department of Defense has appropriately been a leader in clean  energy, water protection, and disaster preparation. These are not arts  and crafts projects. It is all about readiness. Improving efficiency  and energy resilience makes our troops safer and saves critical money.   The newly empowered Republican majority has decided to throw money at  mismanaged priorities in terms of taking the culture wars to the  Department of Defense, stripping away protections and programs that  deal with the diversity of our military.   Social issues are defense issues, and the continued onslaught of  restrictions against people of color, those who are LGBTQ, or those  whose healthcare is under attack causes America to lose potential  servicemembers we need most.   We are not meeting our recruitment objectives now, and taking the  culture wars against the Department of Defense, fighting against  diversity, makes us less ready.   Recruitment and retention are serious challenges plaguing our  military, and the Republican attacks on those they don't like make us  more vulnerable. These are honorable people, and the military needs  them.   The good news is that most of the sideshow we will be dealing with  today and into the night will never be enacted into law, but making  these attacks and forcing these votes on readiness is not harmless.  Even though they are ineffective does not mean that damage is not being  done.  [[Page H3484]]    Look at the charade from Alabama's junior Senator paralyzing the  orderly function of the military command structure over an ill-advised,  unpopular, wrongheaded crusade against giving American military  personnel the healthcare they deserve.   Denial of healthcare is another way we are driving qualified people  out of the military. It is a travesty to deny them the same option, for  instance, for medical cannabis that Americans enjoy in most States.   With so many of our veterans and servicemembers suffering from  wounds, visible and hidden, the record is clear that medical cannabis  can be transformative. It will help our servicemembers save money and  improve the quality of their care.   I am pleased that my colleague Brian Mast and I have been able to  develop bipartisan legislation to remedy the situation, and I hope this  Congress will relent and allow us to enact it.   While I may disagree with the spending priorities and the massive  increase in spending, I remain impressed with our men and women in  uniform, from the brave recruits to the senior officers. They reflect  so much of what is good about America. We should embrace our  responsibilities for today and into the future by respecting the  differences and strengthening opportunities to serve.   Mr. Speaker, we have a duty to them and our national security to do  so.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer amendment No. 27.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the Rules Committee permitting this to be in  order to be discussed. These are important issues, and we don't often  spend time on the floor discussing them.   In my career, I have worked to contain nuclear weapons, their danger  and cost. Many of these weapons we cannot afford and cannot afford to  use. Unfortunately, we continue to spend hundreds of billions of  dollars on weapons that pose serious risk to safety and physical  security.   We have an opportunity this afternoon to take a small but significant  step prohibiting the use of funds for the B83-1 bomb.   This amendment reflects the conclusion of the 2022 Nuclear Posture  Review, which, unfortunately, was not reflected in the majority report.   The B83 was added to the nuclear arsenal 30 years ago and has  dramatically diminished utility.   Remember, Mr. Chair, we are on a trajectory to spend over $1.7  trillion in the next 30 years on nuclear weapons, most of which are no  longer necessary for our security. Eliminating support for the B83 will  save $1.5 billion over that period at no risk at all to our security.   As Everett Dirksen once famously said: ``A billion here and a billion  [[Page H3519]]  there, and pretty soon you are talking about real money.''   Here is a chance to make a long-overdue reform at no cost to our  national security and save some real money.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I respectfully disagree with my colleagues. This is a  weapon whose time has passed.   It can only be delivered by the B-2 bomber, which is aging out. It  cannot be delivered by a B-52 or a B-21. This antiquated weaponry is  not enhancing our defense. It is an example of weaponry that really has  outlived its usefulness.   These are serious issues. We are looking at trying to contain  government spending. Some of my colleagues were willing to actually  risk the global economy to make their point and grind things to a halt.   This isn't low-hanging fruit. This is literally picking the fruit up  off the ground.   The security review, I think, is clear. This has outlived its  usefulness. We have to start somewhere.   The $1.7 trillion that we have in the pipeline for nuclear  modernization is, to be charitable, overkill. We need to start  someplace. We ought to start with dealing with the B83 consistent with  the national security review.   Mr. Chair, I urge approval of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentlewoman's tenacity  and her leadership on this issue.   We have more than we need to have a credible deterrent; more than we  need. This small but important amendment would allow the military  leadership to evaluate how to evolve the needs.   The land-based nuclear ICBMs are far in excess of what we need, and  we have been seeing scandal in the papers in terms of the management of  them, drug use, cheating on tests, and they are not necessary for our  security. There is no security benefit in this sort of redundancy.   We ought to at least be able to examine the path going forward.  Locking into 400 permanently is lunacy, it is expensive, and it is  dangerous, as anybody who has read, for example, Eric Schlosser's book,  ``Command and Control,'' to see how close we have come to nuclear  disaster with this stockpile.   The record is not very rosy. We at least ought to allow our military  leadership to evaluate what we need to do going forward.
