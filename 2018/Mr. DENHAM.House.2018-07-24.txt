 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking member for  their support of H.R. 5974, the VA COST SAVINGS Enhancements Act.   This bipartisan bill improves care for our veterans. It also ensures  that the VA is using the latest cost-saving technology. It directs the  VA to install onsite medical waste treatment systems in facilities  where this will result in a cost savings within 5 years. Systemwide,  this will save the VA millions of dollars each year and directly  improve safety and healthcare for our veterans.   In addition to the significant cost savings, this technology is safer  and increases crisis readiness. Safety is paramount when caring for our  vets, and treating waste onsite prevents the spread of dangerous  infections. Both the CDC and the World Health Organization recommend  this technology, and this policy brings the VA in line with recommended  practices for private medicine.   Likewise, in the event of an earthquake or a wildfire, which we saw  in California, transportation infrastructure can be compromised and  prevent hazardous waste from being trucked to a disposal site or  through a city. We need to make sure that this is handled onsite. In a  disaster scenario like this, treating waste is critical to preventing  an outbreak and keeping the facility actually up and running without  huge backloads of the waste.   Our veterans deserve the highest quality of care. This technology  improves crisis-readiness and is safer, more efficient, more cost  effective, and more environmentally friendly than traditional medical  waste disposal. Installing these machines will immediately begin saving  the VA millions of dollars per year and directly improve care for our  veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5974.
