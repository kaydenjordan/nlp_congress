 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  where our country is in the fight against coronavirus.   The simple message on the coronavirus is this: Vaccines work. The  single most important thing you want to do to protect yourself and to  protect your family is to get vaccinated. That is the only message we  ought to be sending out.   I am a doctor. I have been vaccinated. My wife has been vaccinated.  Our kids have been vaccinated. There is overwhelming evidence that  vaccines are highly effective against serious illness.   Yet we are talking about this issue today because of the chaos and  the confusion that have come about due to messaging coming out of the  White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is  why, with limited floor time during this important debate on spending,  I come to the floor today to discuss this specific issue.   President Biden and the CDC ought to be found guilty of medical  malpractice for the comments that they have been making. Back in May,  the Centers for Disease Control said, and the President repeated it at  the White House, that if you have been vaccinated, if you have been  fully vaccinated, you don't need to wear a mask either indoors or  outdoors. Now they are saying that even if you have been fully  vaccinated, you need to wear a mask again indoors.   At a time when we are trying to encourage people to get vaccinated, I  ask, how is this going to help someone who hasn't been vaccinated,  encourage them to get vaccinated if you are telling them that even if  you get vaccinated, you still have to wear a mask?   This flip-flopping in policy is why Americans, I think, are very  worried and concerned and somewhat anxious about the activities of this  administration. They are wondering: What comes next--flip-flop on  masks? Is this administration going to flip-flop on lockdowns, on  shutdowns, on closing schools?   People say: Oh no, don't worry about that.   Well, Mr. President, let me tell you, just this past weekend, Randi  Weingarten--she is the head of one of America's biggest teachers  unions, the American Federation of Teachers--she refused to commit to  in-person learning this fall, this coming school year.   The president of America's biggest teachers union refused to commit  to in-person learning this fall. So the American people have every  right to be concerned and anxious and angry with the communications  coming out of this administration and the directives this week. Parents  are angry that kids have already lost too much.   And think about this: Now Nancy Pelosi is requiring fully vaccinated  Members of the House of Representatives to wear masks or they will be  charged a fine. She has even threatened--threatened--to tell the  Capitol Police to arrest staff members--fully vaccinated staff  members--who aren't wearing masks. These are people who have been  vaccinated.   At the same time, the Biden administration is throwing our southern  border wide open to 180,000 illegal immigrants a month, with almost  every disease known to man. We are talking about people who are  undocumented and unvaccinated.   When I went to the border earlier this spring, our border agents told  me that they had arrested people from 50 different countries. Of  course, these people are all coming from places where vaccination rates  are much lower than they are in our country.   Since the start of the pandemic, more than 8,000 Border Patrol  officers have tested positive for coronavirus. Thirty-two of these  agents have died. When I visited the border, roughly 1 in 10 of the  unaccompanied children in custody had tested positive, and they were  intermingled with others who had tested positive and those not tested  [[Page S5693]]  positive. They were all crammed in like sardines, and the testing  occurred only when they were getting ready to be released and then sent  all around America, spreading the coronavirus wherever they went.   And it is interesting to listen to Democrats in the national media  and on the Hill who want to blame Republicans for any vaccine hesitancy  that is out there. Well, let me set the record straight on that.   Republican elected officials have gone out of our way to encourage  vaccinations. It is the responsible thing to do. I have traveled from  one vaccination site to another all around the State of Wyoming; made  public service announcements with other doctors and doctors who are  members of the Doctors Caucus in Congress, in the House and the Senate;  made public service announcements; put them out on videos and sent them  around the country.   The truth is that there are a large number of Democrats who are still  unvaccinated. Forty percent--forty percent--as of today, of New York  City public school employees have not been vaccinated, and it is ready  for the school year to start. And yet we don't have a commitment from  the head of the teachers union to have in-person learning this year.  Forty percent of the public hospital workers in New York City are  unvaccinated. Forty-one percent of Chicago residents are not  vaccinated. If you take a look, city by city--Democrat-run cities--a  high percentage of people are not vaccinated, and yet President Biden  and the Senate majority leader continue to point fingers.   It does seem to me that Democrats have utterly failed to communicate  a clear message to get the American people vaccinated. In fact, I think  Democrat politicians have been a big part of the problem from the  beginning.   Early on, when the vaccine was currently being developed, people were  hoping for a vaccine. We saw the Vice Presidential debate--57 million  people watching--and then, at the time, Vice Presidential candidate, at  the time Senator Harris, now Vice President Harris, said she would not  get a vaccine developed under the Trump administration.   She said: ``If Donald Trump tells us we should take it, I'm not going  to take it.''   Before Democrats point the finger at Republicans, they should get  their own cities vaccinated.   There is much more to talk about.   There have been many mistakes made by this administration and  Democrats over the last 6 months, but it is no coincidence that, over  the last 3 months, we have seen a historic drop in national optimism. A  majority of the country says America is now on the wrong track. Just  one in three Americans is satisfied with the way things are going in  this country. Fully, only one in five Americans has switched from  optimistic about our future to pessimistic about our future in just 3  months.   Fully, one in five Americans flipped on their thoughts on the  direction of the country, and it is easy to see why. They see inflation  eating away at their paychecks. They see Democrats piling up debt on  our kids and grandkids. They see their taxes are about to go up again.  They see an open southern border. They see rising crime in Democrat  cities. And independent voters are running away from Democrats as fast  as they can.   It is time for Democrats to get the message. We want to get the virus  behind us. The answer is not open borders. The answer is not more flip- flops, and it is not more mandates on the American people.   It is time for the Democrats to stop pointing fingers. The school  year returns in just a matter of weeks. Every school in America must be  open. It is time for Democrats to follow the science. No more flip- flops, no more mandates, no more lockdowns--no more excuses                         Nomination of David Chipman    Madam President, I come to the floor, at this point, to oppose the  nomination of David Chipman as Director of the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.   David Chipman is an anti-gun extremist who would politicize one of  the world's greatest law enforcement Agencies, the ATF. If confirmed,  he would be the most radically anti-gun Director in ATF history.   David Chipman's views are completely out of touch with those of the  American people. He opposed the Supreme Court case that struck down  Washington, DC's ban on handguns, the Heller case. He was party to a  legal brief in the case which said the Second Amendment, he said, only  protects militias. He supports bringing back the 1994 assault weapons  ban, which President Biden often brags that he wrote. Congress let that  ban expire because there was never any proof that it brought down  crime.   During his hearing with the Judiciary Committee, Senator Cotton  specifically asked Mr. Chipman to define what an ``assault weapon'' is.   Mr. Chipman said: ``An assault weapon would be whatever Congress  defines it as.''   Senator Cotton went on to ask Mr. Chipman for his own definition of  an ``assault weapon.''   He said: ``Any semi-automatic rifle capable of accepting a detachable  magazine above a 22.''   Well, as Senator Cotton rightly pointed out, this would ban most  sporting rifles in America. If David Chipman made our gun laws, most  sporting rifles would be banned. States could ban handguns. Private gun  sales would be illegal.   These views are completely out of touch with the views of more than  100 million Americans who are law-abiding gun owners.   Worst of all, David Chipman does not have the character and integrity  to lead the ATF. He has repeatedly mocked gun owners and impugned  people's motives for owning a gun.   David Chipman said: Gun ownership ``is a way you can act patriotic  without having to'' serve in the military.   He said: ``I [would] compare gun ownership . . . to the same reason  Americans might want a muscle car.''   This is not why people buy guns. The American people buy guns to  protect themselves and to keep their families safe.   The American people are buying guns by the millions right now because  they are afraid of Democrats' gun control policies, and they are afraid  of crime in Democrat cities.   Last year, Democrats cut $1 billion in police funding across America,  and as a result, we saw the largest increase in murder in 60 years. In  response, the American people bought more than 20 million guns,  including 8 million guns by first-time gun owners--first-time gun  owners--because they realized they weren't able to be protected when  those are trying to defund the police. Gun ownership is still going up  because the Democrats are still defunding police, and Democrat cities  are in chaos.   We don't need an ATF Director who mocks nearly half of the country.   Recently, we found out another serious concern about Mr. Chipman's  character. According to media reports, multiple ATF agents say David  Chipman was accused of making racist comments about African Americans.  I won't repeat them here. The comments are of great concern. According  to the reports, the racist comments were reported to the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission, and a complaint was filed against  him.   Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee have called for another  hearing in light of this new information that has come out. I commend  my colleagues for their due diligence.   Yet I don't think another hearing is necessary. What is necessary is  for President Biden to withdraw this nomination. There are plenty of  qualified Democrats out there who could be nominated to do this job.   The men and women of the ATF deserve a leader with integrity and with  respect for the Second Amendment to our Constitution. More than 100  million legal gun owners in this country deserve it, too.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I rise today in recognition of the  100th anniversary of the formation of Teton County, WY.   On Sunday, August 29, 2021, Teton County will come together in honor  of this milestone with a 100th anniversary picnic celebration. The day  will include barbequed food, lawn games, live music performances,  children's activities, and exhibits of Teton County's historical photos  and artifacts. This event provides an exceptional opportunity to  demonstrate and celebrate Teton County's strong, remarkable character.   Teton County was established by an act of the Wyoming Legislature and  signed into law by Governor Robert D. Carey on February 18, 1921. The  area was initially part of neighboring Lincoln County. Residents grew  weary of travelling over 200 miles to the Lincoln County seat:  Kemmerer, WY. Travel was often impossible in the winter as snowy roads  were closed, leaving the residents of now Teton County completely  isolated.   One of the chief proponents of the effort to carve out Teton County  was Wyoming legislator W.C. Deloney. In January 1920, Representative  Deloney introduced a bill in the legislature establishing an  independent county he then called ``Jackson Hole County.'' To select  the county seat, a vote was held between the communities of Jackson and  Kelly. Though Jackson seems like the logical seat today, the landscape  was very different in 1920. Of 826 votes cast, Jackson won by only 22  votes.   The first three Jackson Hole County Commissioners, T.R. Wilson of  Alta; W.P. Redmond of Kelly; and Peter Christofferson--P.C.--Hansen of  Jackson were appointed. This was the beginning of a legacy of civic  service for the Hansen family. P.C. Hansen was the father of U.S.  Senator Cliff P. Hansen and the great-grandfather of Wyoming Governor  Matt Mead.   Today, Teton County boasts four communities, Jackson being the  largest with more than 10,500 residents led by Mayor Hailey Morton  Levinson. The tight-knit communities of Wilson, Moran, Alta, Kelly, and  Teton Village bring the county's population to over 23,400. Five county  commissioners, Chairwoman Natalia D. Macker, Vice-Chair Luther Propst,  Mark Newcomb, Greg Epstein, and Mark Barron represent Teton County.   The story of Teton County echoes the stories of communities across  Wyoming, carving out their homes in the American West. Even today,  Teton County is 97 percent public land, including the Bridger-Teton  National Forest, Grand Teton National Park, and most of Yellowstone  National Park.   From its beginnings, tourism was an important business in the region.  The first homesteaders in the 1880s hosted and outfitted the earliest  tourists. Today, the wilderness attracts tourists from all over the  world for numerous activities like camping, sightseeing, hiking,  hunting, and snow-skiing, to name only a few. Three significant ski  areas, Snow King Mountain Resort, Teton Village, and Grand Targhee  Resort ensure the tourism industry stays vibrant in the winter.   The National Elk Refuge in Teton County is a winter-safe haven for  upwards of 8,000 elk. The refuge, part of the National Wildlife Refuge  System, provides critical habitat for a number of species, including  elk, bison, pronghorn, swans, eagles, and trout.   It is my honor to commemorate this historic milestone for Teton  County. Their centennial celebration is a tribute to generations of  determination and commitment. My wife Bobbi and the people of Wyoming  join me in our appreciation of the people of Teton County. We thank  them for opening their communities to our great State, the Nation, and  the world. We extend our congratulations as we look forward to the next  100 years.                            ____________________
