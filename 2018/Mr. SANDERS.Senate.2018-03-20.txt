 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 1013 of the  Department of State Authorization Act, fiscal years 1984 and 1985, and  in accordance with the provisions of section 601(b) of the  International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976,  I make a motion to discharge S.J. Res. 54 from the Committee on Foreign  Relations.    Thank you, Mr. President.   Article I, section 8 of the Constitution states in no uncertain terms  that ``Congress shall have power to . . . declare war.''   Let me repeat it. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution states it  is Congress that has the power to declare war.   The Founding Fathers gave the power to authorize military conflicts  to Congress, the branch most accountable--not to the President but to  Congress--and that is the issue we are going to be debating today.   For far too long, Congress, under Democratic and Republican  administrations, has abdicated its constitutional role in authorizing  war. The time is long overdue for Congress to reassert that  constitutional authority, and that is what today is about.   That is why I and 14 cosponsors of this resolution--Senators Lee,  Murphy, Warren, Booker, Durbin, Leahy,  [[Page S1802]]  Markey, Feinstein, Wyden, Merkley, Blumenthal, Gillibrand, Schatz, and  Baldwin--that is what we are doing with S.J. Res. 54.   What we are saying is, if Congress wants to go to war in Yemen or  anyplace else, vote to go to war. That is your constitutional  responsibility. Stop abdicating that responsibility to a President,  whether it is a Republican President or, as in the past, Democratic  Presidents.   I expect that colleagues today will be arguing about what the word  ``hostilities'' means within the context of the 1973 War Powers  Resolution. What does the word ``hostilities'' mean? Some will argue  that American troops are not out there shooting and getting shot at,  not exchanging gunfire with their enemies, and that we are not really  engaged in the horrifically destructive Saudi-led war in Yemen. That is  what some will argue on the floor today--that we are really not engaged  in hostilities; we are not exchanging fire.   Well, please tell that to the people of Yemen whose homes and lives  are being destroyed by weapons marked ``Made in the USA'' and dropped  by planes being refueled by the U.S. military on targets chosen with  U.S. assistance. Only in the narrowest, most legalistic terms can  anyone argue that the United States is not actively involved in  hostilities alongside Saudi Arabia in Yemen.   Let me take a minute to tell my colleagues what is happening in Yemen  right now because a lot of people don't know. It is not something that  is on the front pages of the newspapers or covered terribly much on  television.   Right now, in a very poor nation of 27 million people--that is the  nation of Yemen--in November of last year, the United Nations Emergency  Relief Coordinator told us that Yemen was on the brink of ``the largest  famine the world has seen for many decades.'' That is from the United  Nations. So far, in this country of 27 million people--this very poor  country--over 10,000 civilians have been killed and 40,000 civilians  have been wounded. Over 3 million people in Yemen, in a nation of 27  million, have been displaced--driven from their homes. Fifteen million  people lack access to clean water and sanitation because water  treatment plants have been destroyed. More than 20 million people in  Yemen--over two-thirds of the population of that country--need some  kind of humanitarian support, with nearly 10 million in acute need of  assistance. More than 1 million suspected cholera cases have been  reported, representing potentially the worst cholera outbreak in world  history. That is what is going on in Yemen today as a result of the  Saudi-led war there.   Here is the bottom line: If the President of the United States or  Members of Congress believe that support for this war is in the U.S.  interests--and I think some do--if you think that the United States  right now, for our own interests, should be involved in the civil war  in Yemen, being led by Saudi Arabia, then Members of the U.S. Senate  should have the courage to vote for U.S. participation in that war. It  is nothing more complicated than that.   If you want to come to the floor of the Senate and make the case as  to why you think it is good public policy for us to be involved in the  civil war in Yemen, come to the floor and oppose our resolution, but  what I hope very much that we will not see today is the tabling of this  motion and the refusal by Members of the Senate to vote up or down as  to whether we wish to continue aiding Saudi Arabia in this humanitarian  disaster.   If you believe, as I do, that we should not get sucked into this  civil war, which has already caused so much human suffering, please  vote against tabling the motion to discharge and vote with us on final  passage. If you believe the United States should continue to assist  Saudi Arabia in this war, I urge you to have the courage to tell your  constituents that is your decision and why you have made that decision  when you vote against final passage. In other words, if you support the  war, have the courage to vote for it; if you don't, support the  resolution Senator Lee, Senator Murphy, and I have introduced.   Let me give my colleagues at least two reasons why Congress must  reassert its constitutional authority over the issue of war and why we  cannot continue to abdicate that responsibility to the President, and  those have everything to do with the two most significant foreign  policy disasters in the modern history of the United States--the war in  Iraq and the war in Vietnam. In both of these cases, Congress sat back  and failed to ask the hard questions as two administrations--one  Republican, one Democratic--led us into conflicts with disastrous  consequences.   Interestingly, today is a historically significant day for us to  debate this resolution. Fifteen years ago today, on March 20, 2003, the  war in Iraq began, and the bombs started falling in Baghdad--15 years  ago today. I was one of those who opposed the Iraq war in the  beginning, and today it is now broadly acknowledged that the war--that  war--was a foreign policy blunder of enormous magnitude. That war  created a cascade of instability around the region that we are still  dealing with today in Syria and elsewhere and will be for many years to  come. Indeed, had it not been for the war in Iraq, ISIS would almost  certainly not exist.   That war deepened hostilities between Sunni and Shia communities in  Iraq and elsewhere. It exacerbated a regional conflict for power  between Saudi Arabia and Iran and their proxies in places like Syria,  Lebanon, and Yemen, and it undermined American diplomatic efforts to  resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   The devastation experienced by Iraq's civilians was enormous. A  recent academic study by U.S., Canadian, and Iraqi researchers found  that over 400,000 Iraqi civilians--nearly half a million people--were  killed directly or indirectly as a consequence of that war.   That war led to the displacement of nearly 5 million people, both  inside and outside Iraq, putting great stress on the ability of  surrounding countries to deal with these refugee flows.   We have also seen this more recently in Europe as the large numbers  of people fleeing the Syrian war have generated a backlash in European  countries, giving rise to anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiments.   The war in Iraq led to the deaths--to the deaths--of some 4,400  American troops and the wounding, physical and emotional, of tens of  thousands of others, not to mention the pain inflicted on family  members. By the way, that war in Iraq cost us trillions of dollars-- money that could have been spent on healthcare, education,  infrastructure, and environmental protection.   The Iraq war, like so many other military conflicts, had unintended  consequences. It ended up making us less safe, not more safe.   It must be said that the Bush administration and the President lied  when he told the American people: ``[Saddam's] regime is seeking a  nuclear bomb, and with fissile material could build one within a  year.'' That was not true.   Vice President Dick Cheney lied when he told us:         There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of       mass destruction. There is no doubt he is amassing them to       use against our friends, against our allies, and against us.    Dick Cheney--not true.   No one disagrees that Saddam Hussein was a brutal, murderous  dictator, but it is now known he had nothing to do with 9/11. The Bush  administration lied to the American people. Iraq had no weapons of mass  destruction. It was not connected to 9/11.   The American people were misled by the Bush administration into  believing that the Iraq war was necessary to prevent another 9/11, and  Congress did not challenge them on those claims in a way that Congress  should have--with disastrous consequences.   That was a Republican administration. Now let me tell you about a  Democratic administration where, once again, Congress refused to assert  its constitutional responsibility.   Let us go back to 1964, to a conflict that began under similarly  false premises. President Lyndon Johnson cited an attack on a U.S. ship  in the Gulf of Tonkin as a pretext for escalating the U.S. intervention  in Vietnam and sending more and more and more troops into that  quagmire.   But we now know from declassified recordings that Johnson himself  doubted that the USS Maddox had come  [[Page S1803]]  under fire on August 4, 1964. As we all know, that alleged attack was  used to push for the Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorizing Johnson to  escalate U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, and we now know that the  Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, misled Congress and the public  in order to generate support for that resolution.   You don't have to believe me. This is what LCDR Pat Paterson wrote in  a paper for the U.S. Naval Institute: ``The evidence suggests a  disturbing and deliberate attempt by Secretary of Defense McNamara to  distort the evidence and mislead Congress.''   Paterson, interestingly enough, also quotes another author who wrote:         To enhance his chances for election, [Johnson] and McNamara       deceived the American people and Congress about events and       the nature of the American commitment in Vietnam. They used a       questionable report of a North Vietnamese attack on American       naval vessels to justify the president's policy to the       electorate and to defuse Republican senator and presidential       candidate Barry Goldwater's charges that Lyndon Johnson was       irresolute and ``soft'' in the foreign policy arena.    Interestingly enough, that author is H.R. McMaster, President Trump's  current National Security Advisor.   Lyndon Johnson's administration misled both Congress and the American  people into that war, just as the Bush administration misled us into  the war in Iraq, and what disasters both of those wars were. The war in  Vietnam nearly destroyed an entire generation of young people. Almost  60,000 died in that war, and God knows how many came back wounded in  body and in spirit. It almost destroyed an entire generation. Yet  Congress abdicated its responsibility in Vietnam, as it did in Iraq.   The truth about Yemen is that U.S. forces have been actively engaged  in support of the Saudi coalition in this war, providing intelligence  and aerial refueling of planes whose bombs have killed thousands of  people and made this humanitarian crisis far worse. U.S. involvement in  the Yemen war has also proved counterproductive to the effort against  al-Qaida's affiliates. The State Department's ``Country Reports on  Terrorism 2016'' found that the conflict between Saudi-led forces and  the Houthi insurgents has helped al-Qaida's and ISIS's Yemen branch to  ``deepen their inroads across much of the country.'' In other words, as  we see again, when there is chaos, when there is mass confusion, ISIS  and their allies are able to jump in.   Furthermore, while Iran's support for Houthi insurgents is of serious  concern for all of us, the truth is that this war has increased, not  decreased, the opportunities for Iranian interference.   The Trump administration has tried to justify our involvement in the  Yemen war as necessary to push back on Iran. Well, another  administration told us that invading Iraq was necessary to confront al- Qaida, and another told us that the Vietnam war was necessary to  contain Communists. None of that turned out to be true.   The Congress, at those times, should have asked the hard questions,  which they didn't ask. The Congress should have taken its  constitutional role seriously and should have done what the  Constitution demands that it do, and that is what my cosponsors and I  are doing today.   I see my colleague Senator Lee here. He has been very active in  standing up for the Constitution on this issue, and I will yield to him  in a minute. But here is the bottom line--and it is not a complicated  line; the Constitution is clear: The U.S. Congress decides whether we  go to war. There is no question in my mind that by aiding Saudi Arabia  in the way that we are doing, we are assisting in war. We are in a  conflict.   If Members of the Senate think that conflict makes sense and is good  public policy for the United States of America, vote down our  resolution. If you agree with Senator Lee and me that it is a bad idea,  support us. But what I would urge in the strongest possible terms is  that Members of the Senate have to end the abdication of our  constitutional responsibility. Accept it; vote yes or vote no. Do not  vote to table this resolution and duck the constitutional  responsibility that we have.   I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator Mike Lee.    Mr. President, may I ask my colleague from Utah a very  simple question? Whether or not he agrees with me that we are talking  about two separate issues.    It seems to me we are talking about two separate issues,  one of which is really a no-brainer. The no-brainer is that the  Constitution is very clear that it is the Congress, not the President,  that determines whether we go to war; that we are currently in an  unauthorized war in Yemen; and that the first vote--if there is an  attempt to table this, that would be absolutely unacceptable because we  would be abdicating our decisionmaking. And then the second vote is the  vote on whether we think it is a good idea to be in Yemen.   Would the Senator agree with me that at least on the motion to table,  every Member of the Senate should allow us to go forward and vote  against tabling so that people in the Senate accept their  constitutional responsibility to vote yes or no on the war in Yemen?    Let me concur with what Senator Lee just said. There may  be disagreements about the wisdom of being allied with Saudi Arabia on  the war in Yemen. There will be honest disagreements about that. But  there cannot be and there must not be an abdication of constitutional  responsibility in terms of making that decision.   If you think that U.S. participation in the war in Yemen is a good  idea, you can vote against our resolution. If you agree with us that it  is a bad idea, support our resolution. But simply to abdicate your  responsibility on this issue would be absolutely irresponsible.   I hope we have virtually unanimous support in voting against the  effort to table. Then let's get into the debate about the wisdom of the  war and vote it up or down. Needless to say, I hope  [[Page S1805]]  the Members support our resolution. Let's at least have that vote and  not abdicate our responsibility.    Mr. President, I speak only for myself on this issue and  will tell you why I am so motivated about this resolution.   If we think back on the modern history of our country and if we think  of the two most significant foreign policy decisions--the war in  Vietnam and the war in Iraq and the unbelievable unintended  consequences that those two destructive wars had--what we conclude is  that in both of those wars--one under a Democratic President and one  under a Republican President--the Congress abdicated its  responsibility. It did not ask the right questions. In both instances,  we got into those terrible wars based on lies. The Johnson  administration lied as to why we should get involved in the war in  Vietnam, and the Bush administration lied as to why we should get  involved in the war in Iraq.   It just seems to me that if nothing else, based on those two examples  of what the war in Vietnam did and what the war in Iraq did, Congress  has to take a deep breath and understand that the people who wrote the  Constitution were not fools when they said it must be the elected  people who are closest to the constituents who have to debate these  issues and who know that decisions being made will result in the loss  of lives of the people in their own States, and we have abdicated that  responsibility.   No one can predict whether the decisions made by Congress are going  to be good decisions with regard to war and peace, whether we are going  to do better than Presidents did. I don't know. At the very least, we  have to accept our responsibility and not simply take the word of  Presidents who in the two most recent, significant wars have lied to  the American people.   Once again, I know there may be differences of opinion regarding the  wisdom of involvement by the United States in the war in Yemen. If you  think it is a good idea, vote against our resolution. There should be  no difference of opinion about accepting our responsibility under the  Constitution and voting on whether it is a good idea.   I yield to the Senator from Utah.    Let me ask my friend from Connecticut the same question  I asked Senator Lee, and that is whether he agrees with me that we are  really dealing with two separate issues here.   The first issue is really, in a sense, a no-brainer. It is whether  the Congress or, in this case, the Senate of the United States accepts  its constitutional responsibility on issues of war. We are now engaged  in a war in Yemen with Saudi Arabia. The Constitution is very clear in  article I, section 8 that it is the Congress that determines whether  this country goes to war.   I believe what will happen in a few hours is that a motion to table  will come up. Would you agree with me that it would be an act of  cowardice, in a sense, an irresponsibility, an abdication of  congressional responsibility, for somebody to vote to table that  resolution?    In other words, no matter what one's view may be about  the wisdom of the war, to vote to table is to abdicate our  constitutional responsibility?    All right. Let me just concur with Senator Murphy.   If you think it is a good idea for the United States to be involved  in the war in Yemen with Saudi Arabia, you can vote against our  resolution. Yet I can think of no reason at all as to why any Member of  Congress would vote to table this resolution and prevent that  discussion, and I would hope that we would have strong support against  any motion to table and allow that debate to go forward.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the resolution that we will soon be  voting on is really very simple. It has two basic points. Point No. 1,  I and the 14 other cosponsors of this resolution believe that under the  definitions laid out in the 1973 War Powers Resolution, U.S. forces  have been introduced into the Saudi-led war in Yemen, a war which is  causing a humanitarian disaster.   I would say to my good friend Senator Corker, the chairman of the  Foreign Relations Committee, that this war has been going on for 3  years. Some 10,000 civilians in Yemen are dead and 40,000 have been  wounded. A million are dealing with cholera right now, and millions  have been displaced. You come tonight on the floor and you say: We are  going to hold a hearing. That is good, but it is 3 years too late.   The issue that we are dealing with right now is whether or not the  U.S. Senate and the U.S. Congress accepts its constitutional  responsibility on the issues of war. This is not a complicated issue,  and I don't think anybody here disagrees. Article I, section 8, of the  Constitution says not that the President can make war and send our  young people into harm's way. It is the Congress of the United States  that should make war.   Our role now in Yemen working with the Saudi-led intervention there  is one of hostilities under the War Powers Resolution of the United  States. It is not just my view on this. As many may know here--as I  suspect the chairman of the committee knows--last November, by a vote  of 366 to 30, the U.S. House of Representatives agreed with the essence  of what Senator Lee and I are trying to do, and the House passed a  nonbinding resolution stating that U.S. involvement in the Yemen civil  war is unauthorized. Every Member of the Democratic leadership voted  for that, as did the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, Ed Royce.   An editorial in the New York Times today states:         The United States initially deployed forces to combat Al       Qaeda in Yemen under post-Sept. 11 congressional       authorization measures. But Congress never specifically       approved military involvement in the Saudi-Houthi war even       though the Constitution and the 1973 War Powers Act give       lawmakers a role.    The New York Times:         For too long, Congress has abdicated its role as America       prolonged its stay in some wars and expanded into others. And       presidents have been too reluctant to share these crucial       decisions with lawmakers. Resolutions like this--    The one we are debating--       can and must force serious debate and accountability.    I say this to my friend the chairman: I think now of the two major  foreign policy disasters that have taken place in our lifetime--No. 1,  the war in Vietnam. In that war--a Democratic administration under an  otherwise very good President, Lyndon Johnson--he and the Secretary of  Defense misled and lied to the American people with regard to the Gulf  of Tonkin Resolution. That is now established fact as a result of  declassified information. The United States got sucked into that war,  and my generation--the young men of my generation--suffered so  terribly. Over 60,000 died, and many others came home wounded in body  and in spirit. The U.S. Congress abdicated its responsibility at that  point in 1964.   Fifteen years ago--oddly enough, on this day--there was the war in  Iraq, under a Republican administration, and the administration lied to  the American people again. Where was Congress getting the facts? We had  the  [[Page S1827]]  Vice President of the United States: Oh, Saddam Hussein is building  weapons of mass destruction. There is a connection between Saddam  Hussein and Iraq and the 9/11 perpetrators.   It was a lie. It was a lie. Mistakenly, Congress voted to approve the  war based on false information.   So what I say today is that it is time for the Congress to accept its  constitutional responsibility. I don't know how well we will do. Maybe  we will screw it up as well. It is very possible. But that is what the  Founding Fathers suggested, and I think they were right. We are closer  to the people--the House and the Senate--than is the White House, this  White House or any other White House.   So there are two issues today. Do we accept our constitutional  responsibility to vote on matters of war? I would suggest that every  Member of the Senate vote yes. Don't duck your responsibility. Don't  abdicate your responsibility. Second of all, this war in Yemen, in my  view, has been a humanitarian disaster as a result of Saudi  intervention. But the most important vote is, do we actually have a  vote on whether American troops are involved in the war in Yemen?   I hope very much we will vote against Senator Corker's motion to  table, and I hope that after we do that, we will vote for the  resolution that says it is time for the United States to get out of  Yemen.   Thank you.
