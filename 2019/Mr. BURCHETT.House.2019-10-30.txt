 Mr. Speaker, October is Domestic Violence Awareness  Month, and I rise today in support of those who have experienced  domestic abuse.   Over 73,000 Tennesseans were victims of domestic violence last year.  Sadly, many victims struggle for support after experiencing violence.   In Tennessee, and across America, victims of domestic violence are  oftentimes afraid to speak up about their abuse. Even worse, sometimes  victims are not able to receive the help they need. This is  unacceptable.   Communities across America must create safe environments for victims  of domestic violence and encourage them to seek assistance.   Local organizations and shelters are always ready to help. As elected  officials, we have a responsibility to make sure our constituents are  aware of these resources.   I am proud to partner with the YWCA, which employs a good friend of  mine, Maggie McNally, whose father I worked with for over 15 years in  Nashville and who now is the speaker of the Tennessee State Senate, to  raise awareness for Domestic Violence Awareness Month.   The YWCA and organizations like it are committed to ending domestic  violence in our communities, and I fully support them in their mission.
