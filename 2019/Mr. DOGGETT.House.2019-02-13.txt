 Mr. Chair, finally, this House is doing what the  Constitution demands: to debate war and peace.   The problem here is that President Trump has essentially  subcontracted out American foreign policy in the Middle East to a  murderous Saudi regime, and the result has been that 85,000 little  children under the age of five have been starved to death or have died  of disease as a result of Saudi blockades and aggression. Indifference  to their suffering is dooming a generation--unlawful, murderous  airstrikes with bombs made in America on schools, on hospitals, on  weddings, on markets.   All these people who speak out about the security of Israel and of  America, they seem to have forgotten that these same Saudis have been  giving away American-made weapons to al-Qaida--al-Qaida--once the sworn  enemy of the Houthis about whom they complain.   The Saudi leadership, which approved the killing and dismemberment of  an American resident journalist, is unsurprisingly not moved by the  suffering of these children. They are intent on annihilation of the  Yemenis.   We cannot let the slaughter continue in the name of American  taxpayers. The Saudis do not represent our values, but they are using  our tax dollars and our weapons.   Instead of shutting down our government, President Trump needs to  shut down cooperation with the regime that tortures women who speak  out, that kills its enemies who dare to speak the truth, and that is  waging an immoral conflict, the world's largest humanitarian  catastrophe.   Mr. Chairman, the days of symbolic action have far passed. Months,  years, hundreds of small graves ago this Congress should have acted.  Today, we can act to put a stop to this nonsense, this misappropriation  of our values in the Middle East.
