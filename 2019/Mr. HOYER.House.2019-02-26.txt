 Mr. Speaker, this issue is not about a wall. It is about  the Constitution. It is about this institution. It is about the balance  that we say is equal between the Article I institution and the Article  II institution.   That is important to remember. That is why this argument is so very  important.   It is not about just a single policy. It is about the kind of  government that our Founding Fathers instituted, which has been the  envy of the world and the example to many.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman Castro of Texas, and the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus for introducing this resolution.   I was at the border in California and in New Mexico just a few days  ago. I was at the border in El Paso with my distinguished colleague,  the former executive, called judge, of that area. She will speak  shortly. Ms. Escobar will say there is no war at the border and there  is no crisis at the border. She will explain that better than I can.  She lives there.   At the border, I saw a lot of heartbreak and challenge, but I did not  see a national emergency that would justify the President ignoring the  Constitution and trying to make funding decisions without congressional  approval. That is the issue.   For my colleagues to say this is a partisan issue, let me call your  attention to the statements of approximately 20 Members of the United  States Senate.   The President admitted on February 15 that this is not a true  emergency when he said: ``I could do the wall over a longer period of  time. I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.''   Not that he needed to do it much faster, but he would just rather do  it much faster. Of course, if the Mexicans were paying for it, perhaps  he could have.   Congress has a chance to answer the President and make it clear that  he cannot make an end run around the Constitution and claim powers  reserved for the taxpayers' representatives.   Mr. Speaker, the Congress of the United States needs to have a spine  and not lay at the feet of the President of the United States and say,  ``Whatever you want, sir.'' That is not what the people elected us to  do. We are their representatives, not the President's representative,  whether it is President Obama, President Trump, President Clinton,  President Bush, or President Reagan, all of whom I have served with-- two Bushes.   Our Founding Fathers had enough of King George, so they adopted a  Constitution that said: We are not going to have a King George. We are  not going to have an authoritarian regime. We are not going to have the  executive setting policy. They said the Congress sets policy.   By the way, 300 of us in this body voted for the funding levels for  border security. It didn't squeak by, by some partisan advantage--300  of us, which is to say well over 66 percent.   Now, Congress has a chance to answer the President and make it clear.  He demanded that the American taxpayers give him billions for the wall  that Democrats and Republicans alike say is expensive and ineffective.   Again, this is not about the wall. This is about our Constitution,  our institution, and our self-respect.   He has chosen to ignore the will of the American people, as expressed  by their representatives. He has opted to set aside the wisdom of our  Founders for the expedience of getting his own way.   Constitutional law professor Roger Sloane of Boston University noted,  last week: ``To my knowledge, no President has ever tried to use  national emergency funding to appropriate funds Congress refused to  appropriate.''   Overwhelming Senate vote; overwhelming vote in this body.   He went on to say: ``Politically, it would mean the President would  be seeking . . . to override a bipartisan judgment of Congress.''   Have we no self-respect? Have we no sense of the balance between the  executive and the legislative branches of government?   We are the Article I branch, the policymakers, the people who raise  money and spend money, not the President--any President, Republican or  Democrat. And a lot of Republican colleagues, including Senator  McConnell, said: Mr. President, don't do this.   Right up until the time Senator McConnell said: I will support you,  Mr. President.   First, he was against this, and now he is for it.   The respected Harvard Law School constitutional scholar Laurence  Tribe said of the President, on Thursday: ``He is simply trying to do  what emperors and kings do, not what a President of the United States  should do.''   In The Washington Post this weekend, columnist Max Boot noted why we  are now at a pivotal moment for Members of the President's party in the  Congress, who are being asked to choose between loyalty to the  President and fidelity to the Constitution.    I am sorry the Chamber is not filled. I thought of asking for a  quorum call. I didn't.   Fidelity to the President or fidelity to the Constitution, that is  the choice we make today. That is why this is a pivotal moment. We  choose between the Constitution and its principles, which have made our  country the world's envied democracy for almost two and a half  centuries.   Boot continued with this: ``Trump's action is an affront to all that  Republicans stand for.''   The premise is you continue to stand for this institution and our  Constitution.   ``They claim to be pro-military, but Trump's action would take money  away from the defense budget. They claim to be pro-property rights, but  Trump's action would result in the taking of private property along the  border. And they claim to be constitutional conservatives, but Trump's  action is an obvious violation of Article I of the Constitution: `No  Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of  Appropriations made by Law.' ''   I used to have people coming up here and taking out the Constitution  and saying: Have you read this document? Do you know what it says?   Let me repeat it: ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in  Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.''   Now, I have heard the scare rhetoric, and I suggest to my colleagues,  with all due respect, that kind of rhetoric has preceded every despot's  takeover of power in the world. There was a crisis. They had to declare  military law. They had to suspend the constitution and suspend the  laws.   That is how despots take power. We stand at the gate to ensure that  doesn't happen. But we will say more with our votes.   If we vote yes, we will say that Congress is still the voice of the  American people. We will say that we are still faithful to the oath we  took to protect the Constitution and laws of our land. And we will say  that America, as our Founders promised, has no sovereign but we, the  people--``we,'' not me, not I. We, the people.   We must not allow the President to set a dangerous precedent  stripping Congress of its power of the purse. This is the first time.  You can say there are a lot of other emergencies. That is correct. But  this is unique. We must not  [[Page H2136]]  allow him to set the precedent whereby any chief executive, Republican  or Democrat, can declare an emergency any time he or she doesn't agree  with Congress' funding.   This is not a partisan resolution. It is supported and encouraged by  former and current Republican Members who recognize how dangerous it  would be for the Congress not to act. A group of 23 former Republican  Members of Congress, including former Senators Olympia Snowe, Dick  Lugar, Chuck Hagel, and John Danforth have sent a letter to currently  serving Republican Members yesterday. In it they wrote this: ``It has  always been a Republican fundamental principle that no matter how  strong our policy preferences, no matter how deep our loyalties to  Presidents or party leaders, in order to remain a constitutional  Republic, we must act within the borders of the Constitution.''   Today, a conservative Senator from North Carolina, a Republican  conservative Senator from North Carolina, said this: ``I have grave  concerns when our institution looks the other way at the expense of  weakening Congress' power.''                                time  1630    Senators Murkowski and Collins have already said they would support  this resolution.   So let us act and do so in one powerful voice--not as Democrats, not  as Republicans, as Americans; as representatives; as people who have  put their faith in us to make a judgment to protect their country,  their Constitution; as Americans who believe in our Constitution and  the wisdom of our Founders who gave Congress alone the authority to  appropriate funds and gave the representatives of the people and the  States a powerful check on the executive.   I ask all my Republican colleagues: How would you vote if Barack  Obama were President of the United States today? Think of that. Because  if you cannot answer ``I would vote the same way,'' then you are not  being true to your country, to our Constitution, and to your oath.   If any Member cares at all about the equal status of the Article I  branch of the Constitution, he or she should vote for this resolution.  Vote for conscience and Constitution, not party and politics.
