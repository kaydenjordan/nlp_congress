 Mr. Speaker, conflicts of interest lead to a crisis of  confidence.   Government officials shouldn't be able to use their Federal  contracting authority to line their own pockets. Pentagon officials  owning stock in big defense contractors not only invites waste and  abuse, it causes Americans to doubt whether the Department of Defense  always spends taxpayer dollars in the public interest.   I am proud that the House passed my proposal to ban Pentagon  officials from owning stock in companies that receive over $1 billion  in defense contracts.   This safeguard will better protect the hundreds of billions of  taxpayer dollars we send to the Pentagon each year. It will help  prevent sweetheart deals for big defense contractors, and it will  reduce the self-dealing that erodes trust in our government and  undermines national security.   Americans deserve confidence that their government is working for  them.                            ____________________
