 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the full committee for  having us on the floor today to talk about S. 2155.   I have heard all of this cold water from the opposition today, but  this is the definition of bipartisanship. Sixty-seven votes in the  Senate, in this environment, in this town, is bipartisan. So many of  our bills emanated here in the House with strong bipartisan support.   As a former local chamber of commerce chairman and a local community  banker, I have seen firsthand, Mr. Speaker, the negative effects of the  Dodd-Frank Act since it was passed in 2010.   I know we have had 140 hearings on how to make sense of improving  Dodd-Frank, to rightsize the regulatory system for small financial  institutions, allowing our community banks and credit unions to  actually serve our small businesses and our consumers.   Rather than spending too much time on compliance, these institutions  can redirect resources toward what they do best: approving loans,  mortgages, and providing credit to small business.   This bill has widespread support. You would never know it, listening  to the opposition, but it has widespread support on a bicameral,  bipartisan basis in this building.   One particular provision, led by my friend Mr. Barr from Kentucky, I  know will help hundreds of Arkansans, hardworking families who need  access to credit for manufactured housing in the rural parts of our  State. This bill will help people get housing, thanks to the work of  the Senate and the House.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of S. 2155.
