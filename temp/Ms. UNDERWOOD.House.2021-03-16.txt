 Madam Speaker, I rise to call on our colleagues in the  Senate to swiftly pass H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act;  and H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act.   These bills are bipartisan, commonsense solutions to our Nation's gun  violence crisis. Together, they accomplish what the vast majority of  Americans want, to keep guns out of the wrong hands. I was proud to  cosponsor both bills and vote for them when they passed the House last  week. Now it is time for the Senate to take action.  [[Page H1369]]    In 2020, the Gun Violence Archive reported more than 40,000 deaths  caused by gun violence, including over 1,300 children. Yet, despite the  fact that gun violence continues to rise--and 90 percent of Americans,  including 80 percent of gun owners support universal background  checks--Republicans in Congress have spent years blocking bipartisan  legislation to close our biggest loopholes and keep our communities  safe.   Gun violence is preventable, yet it is such a tragically routine  occurrence in this country that every community has a story. Mine is no  exception.   I recently joined the Aurora Historical Society in Illinois to pay  tribute to the five people murdered and the seven heroic first  responders who were injured 2 years ago during a shooting at the Henry  Pratt Company.   The mayor of Aurora, Richard Irvin, said after the shooting that ``we  as a society cannot allow these horrific acts to become commonplace.''   Yet, absurdly, we have already reached the point in which this  unspeakable tragedy in Illinois is not even America's most lethal mass  shooting in a town named Aurora. So I call on my colleagues in the  Senate to take action with us so that our children can someday live in  a country in which gun violence is no longer commonplace.   Madam Speaker, as a nurse, I am thrilled that, in 2019, we finally  directed Federal funding toward public health research on gun violence,  for the first time in two decades. This type of research is critical  for evidence-based policymaking, and I will keep fighting to make sure  that that funding continues. But studying the problem is just the first  step in our work to solve it. It is already past time to make simple  changes that we already know work.   Madam Speaker, background checks are a simple, effective way to keep  guns out of the wrong hands. A 1995 Connecticut law requiring  background checks for firearm purchases was associated with a 40  percent decline in gun homicides and a 15 percent drop in gun suicides.  Meanwhile, when Missouri repealed a similar law in 2007, gun homicides  jumped by 23 percent, while firearm suicides rose by 16 percent.  Homicides and suicides by other means stayed flat in both States; only  gun violence changed.   I wish all our public health crises had such a clear, straightforward  solution.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 8 would require a lifesaving background check for  every gun sale, while H.R. 1446 would give the FBI more time to  complete those checks before a single sale goes through. These bills  would not add any new restrictions on who can buy a gun or what kind of  gun that they can have. Rather, it would make it easier to enforce our  existing gun laws and stop guns from being sold to people who are  already prohibited from owning one.   Madam Speaker, I am not willing to wait for the next murderer to  attack the next church in the next Charleston. I am not willing to wait  for the next angry employee to murder his coworkers at the next Henry  Pratt in the next Aurora, Illinois. I am not willing to wait for the  next Aurora, Colorado, or the next Pulse Nightclub, or the next  Parkland, or the next Tree of Life, or the next Sandy Hook. I am also  not willing to wait for more women to be murdered by their abusers, or  for more children to be lost to gun violence.   I am done waiting. My constituents are done waiting. Enough is  enough.   Americans deserve to feel safe in their schools, in their houses of  worship, in their movie theaters, in their workplaces, and in their  homes. We can no longer live in a country where any building can so  easily become a battlefield.   Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I in the House voted last week for a  safer future for our children. Now I call on my colleagues in the  Senate to save lives and send H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 to the President's  desk.                            ____________________
