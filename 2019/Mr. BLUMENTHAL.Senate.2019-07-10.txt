 Mr. President, I am here to talk about insulin. You  may wonder why someone would talk about insulin, given all the weighty  and pressing issues we have before us in this Chamber and even more so  in the world today. I will not begin to recite them, but insulin for  millions of people--in fact, 30 million people in the United States--is  a matter of life and death.   Many of us are fortunate because we never have to think about  insulin. Our bodies make enough of it to keep us healthy, and we go  about our lives without a second thought concerning blood glucose or  how our pancreas is functioning, but for those 30 million people--and  quite a few of them visited us this morning in our offices, and they  were present in the Committee on Aging at our hearing--insulin is a  constant worry. It is top of mind. It is always present as an issue for  them, in fact, on a daily basis. Patients with diabetes need to  carefully monitor and adjust their insulin levels along with managing  their physical activities, their diet, stress, pain, sleep levels.   Many of those young people who came to the Committee on Aging today-- by the way, I want to thank Senators Collins and Casey for holding that  hearing and giving them an opportunity to come to the Nation's Capitol  and make us more aware--were wearing monitoring devices, hidden but a  constant concern. They depend on insulin as a matter of life and death.  It is not a luxury for them. It is not like ice cream or ball games. It  is life and death. They are fortunate, too, because they have access to  insulin, unlike a lot of people around the world and unlike the whole  world, including America, about 100 years ago when diabetes was, in  fact, a death sentence, not in a matter of years ahead but right then  and there. Diabetes was lethal.   That changed when two researchers, Dr. Frederick Banting and Dr.  Charles Best, succeeded in isolating insulin from an animal pancreas in  1921. By the next year, they had collected enough to treat their first  patient. He was a 14-year-old boy with diabetes, and he lived  miraculously for another year. That was unheard of at the time. It was  a tremendous breakthrough--an extra year of life because of their  discovery.   So Dr. Banting and Dr. Best filed a patent. They patented their  discovery in 1923, and they stated their goal was not to make a lot of  money, not to make profit but to make insulin available to the world,  make it available to everyone who needed it, make it available to  patients, regardless of their means and circumstance. Do you know what  they did with that patent? They sold it for $1--just $1.   Dr. Banting said: ``Insulin does not belong to me, it belongs to the  world.''  [[Page S4762]]    He was right. Insulin belongs to the world of people, whatever their  ages, whatever their circumstances, whatever their means, wherever they  live. Certainly, in the greatest country in the history of the world,  where that patent, about 100 years ago, was sold for $1, shouldn't it  be affordable and accessible to everyone?   Well, this story has a really discouraging sequel, which is today in  real time. The price of insulin has skyrocketed. When I say  ``skyrocketed,'' there are different numbers. It doubled, according to  one authoritative site, between the years 2012 and 2016. There is  another study that says it has risen 10 times in price over just the  last several years. Beyond question, it has risen and not just by a  little bit but by literally hundreds of dollars for the average  American who has to afford it, day in and day out. Those yearly costs  are forcing people to choose, literally, between putting food on the  table and buying insulin, between paying mortgages and buying insulin,  between the kinds of fun that ordinary young people would enjoy and  buying insulin.   I know we say this about choices made by Americans, but today in this  very Capitol, just steps away, I listened to the parents of Logan and  Emma talk to me, along with them, about the real-life consequences of  these exploding insulin costs, and it broke my heart. Their experiences  are truly heartbreaking and gut-wrenching.   Logan is 12 years old, and he told me in the reception area right  here about his diagnosis at 18 months. He talked about the advances in  technology around diabetes treatment with extraordinary technological  knowledge--impressive not just for someone our age but truly for  somebody who is 12 years old. These advances are a tribute to American  science, innovation, and ingenuity. They are groundbreaking, but at the  end of the day, if his family cannot afford insulin, even the best,  most groundbreaking technology means nothing. That is Logan's reality.   His mom told me about sitting in a CVS parking lot and crying while  she held a box of pasta because that was all she could afford--pasta  for the rest of the week for dinner for that family. It was all she  could afford after the insulin costs. For their family, Logan's insulin  has cost as much as $750 a month. That is their deductible. That is  what they pay even with insurance. So they have sacrificed not only in  terms of what they eat but how they live. He was with Emma, and the two  of them are extraordinary ambassadors for the Junior Diabetes Research  Foundation, the JDRF, which does so much wondrous work for diabetes  patients.   Emma is 15 years old, and her father told me about a similar struggle  to afford insulin. In fact, her own dad was diagnosed with type 1  diabetes in his midthirties after Emma's diagnosis. He told me that  ``the price of insulin is illogical.''   There is no reason why the cost keeps going up. In fact, Emma and  Logan, both from Connecticut, have become world-wise--not world-weary  but world-wise--about the American drug industry. They know those costs  are rising without any reason in terms of the cost to the  manufacturer. There are costs and prices rising for consumers without  any justification in the real cost of producing the insulin they need.    Last week, I held an event on insulin with other diabetes patients to  discuss the skyrocketing costs. One of my constituents who spoke was a  little bit older than Logan and Emma. Dr. Kathryn Nagel, a physician  and resident at Yale University, was also diagnosed with diabetes when  she was 18 months old. She is a resident now, training to become a  pediatrician, among other specialties. As she put it to me, ``Banting  would be ashamed of the state of things now.'' Dr. Banting said,  ``Insulin does not belong to me, it belongs to the world.'' He would be  outraged and embarrassed by what is happening in America today.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kathryn Nagel's full  remarks be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      July 10, 2019.        I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was 18 months       old. As you can imagine, this was terrifying for my family.       But we were lucky. We lived in America, where we had access       to the most advanced health care in the world. I was       immediately connected to a team of doctors who taught my       family everything we needed to know about managing this       disease. I had health insurance. Through my insurance, I       received insulin and all the other supplies I would need, and       my family was able to devote its attention to mastering the       regimen required to keep a type 1 diabetic alive.        I was lucky.        I didn't have to worry about where my insulin came from. I       didn't have to worry about having to scramble for a new       prescription because my insurance company had switched       allegiances to a different insulin company. I didn't have to       worry about how much it cost because of a high deductible,       copay, or god forbid, no insurance at all.        This, unfortunately, is not the reality for many Americans       living with diabetes today.        I had this access, not because it is a right granted to all       Americans, but because my dad was the employee of a       University. When I was in high school, my parents started to       impress upon me a vital truth: I must always be employed by       someone who would give me good health insurance.        With the help of protections from the Affordable Care Act,       and the decision to pursue the path to medicine, I continued       to have good access to health insurance. The insulin pricing       crisis and healthcare chaos in our country poked through in       subtle, but never catastrophic ways for me.        I saw it when I went to fill my prescription, and was told       that because of some back door deals my insurance company was       no longer covering the type of insulin I had used for the       past 20 years. If I wanted to take that type of insulin, I       would have to pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket for just       one vial. For reference, when I first started this insulin,       its list price was $26 a vial.        I've seen this chaos even more in my practice as a doctor.       In medical school we are taught how to treat disease. We are       taught which medicines to use and when. In clinical training,       however, we learn that that is the easy part. The much harder       part, is figuring out how people can get access to the       treatments we know they need. We learn to fight with       insurance companies, we spend hours on the phone with       pharmacies making sure that our patients can actually get the       medications we prescribe.        I want to impress upon you, how vital insulin is for a type       1 diabetic to stay alive. This is not something we should       take to stay healthy. It is something we must have, every       hour of our lives, to stay alive. It is akin to oxygen. For       me, it takes just hours without insulin before my body starts       developing ketones. Ketones produce an acid biproduct that is       toxic to the body, creating an environment where the other       organs can no longer function. Without sufficient insulin, it       does not take long before a diabetics heart goes into a fatal       arrhythmia, causing an entirely preventable death.        This is what happened to Alec Smith. This is what happened       to Kevin Houdeshell. This is what has happened to too many       diabetics in this country, many of them quite young, because       they lose access to insulin. It happens to too many of them       at age 26, when they are left to fend for themselves for       health insurance. This should NEVER happen.        I want to tell you about a childhood hero of mine,       Frederick Banting. Banting, with his team, discovered insulin       in 1921. It is because of Banting I am still alive. But       Banting did more than discover insulin. Knowing that it was       the difference between life and death, he did what he could       to ensure that no greedy company would ever deny people       access to insulin. He sold his patent to the University of       Toronto for $1 so that it would remain accessible to       everyone. He stated, ``Insulin belongs to the world, not to       me''.        Banting would be ashamed of the state of things now.        It turns out, it's not always such a lucky thing to live in       America. Today, 1 in 4 Americans with type 1 diabetes rations       insulin due to the cost. In the time since I was diagnosed,       the cost of insulin has increased over 1200%. These stats       don't even include the huge financial sacrifices people with       diabetes are making as copays, deductibles, and premiums rise       to meet the sky rocketing costs of insulin and other       medications. It does not capture the stress and gut-level       fear every one of us holds of not being able to access our       insulin or supplies.        We cannot be fighting on a case by case basis for access to       what we need to stay alive. We must do better.        Thank you Senator Blumenthal for giving us the       opportunities to share our stories. Thank you for fighting       for us, and working towards a better future for those of us       dependent on insulin to stay alive.                                                 Kathryn Nagel, MD.     Mr. President, Kathryn Nagel--who will be an  extraordinary physician because she has not only a great mind, but she  also has a great heart--is absolutely right. Drug companies today have  moved far from the outreaching motives of insulin's original discovery.  Advancements in biotechnology have allowed manufacturers to make  slightly more purified and precise versions of insulin, but it works  the same as Dr. Banting's original insulin from the 1920s because that  is what our body needs to do its work.  [[Page S4763]]    Even incremental changes to an insulin product open up new patent  opportunities for manufacturers and companies that have been taking  advantage of these loopholes in our patent system for too long at the  expense of patients and their families.   Let me give one particularly egregious example. Sanofi manufactures  the insulin product Lantus. Sanofi filed a total of 74 patents on  Lantus, with 95 percent of those applications happening after Lantus  was introduced to the market in the year 2000. That is a variation of  insulin--almost 20 years old--protected by 74 patents way beyond the  life of the original patent on a medicine discovered 100 years ago by a  doctor who said, ``Insulin does not belong to me, it belongs to the  world.'' Sanofi has constructed such an elaborate web and tangle of  patents surrounding their product that they could have a competition- free monopoly on their particular version of insulin for 37 years. They  are exploiting it relentlessly and tirelessly and inexcusably.   The effect of elaborate patent thickets like Sanofi's--constructed by  companies--are felt by consumers in the form of higher drug prices. It  is that simple. Create a monopoly without competition, and the prices  can be raised without real limit. Lantus has increased in price 24  percent from 2016 to 2018. In 2 years, there was a 24-percent increase  unrelated to the cost of the product. In fact, the overall costs of  insulin have doubled in recent years, with patients having paid an  average of $2,864 for insulin in 2012 and $5,705 in 2016. That is the  average out-of-pocket for insulin patient. That is the story I heard  from Emma Del Vecchio of Orange and Logan Merwin of Haddam, as earlier  today they shared their life-and-death struggle with the cost of  insulin.   One more story that has resonated with me over the past few days is  from Kristin Whitney Daniels. She is from Shelton, CT.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the remarks of Kristen  Whitney Daniel and Jonathan Chappell printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      July 1, 2019.        Thank you, Senator Blumenthal.        My name is Kristen Whitney Daniels and I am the chapter       leader for Connecticut's #insulin4all group, part of the TI       International organization. We are a patient-led advocacy       group committed to ensuring affordable and equitable access       to all diabetes related supplies, including insulin. Insulin       is critical for every diabetic--before it's discovery in       1922, type one diabetes was a death sentence. Today,       diabetics can thrive . . . if they have access to insulin.        I was diagnosed with type one diabetes 13 years ago at the       age of 15. Being an advocate never crossed my mind when I was       diagnosed over a decade ago. Type one diabetes completely       took over my life after I was diagnosed. It was like learning       a new, complex language and continues to be a relentless       disease that requires constant vigilance. So why would I       devote any free time to a disease that has already taken so       much?        Why? Because of Alex Smith and Kevin Houdeshell and Micah       Fischer and the countless others who lost their lives due to       a lack of affordable access to insulin. Because one in four       type one diabetics have had to ration insulin, playing a       deadly game to survive as pharmaceutical companies continue       to unabashedly raise their prices. Because I am the one in       four who have been forced to rationed their insulin.        My story is a familiar one for the diabetes community.       While pursuing my dream internship, I turned 26 and lost my       health insurance. I purchased the only health insurance I       could afford--a high-deductible plan that cost more than my       monthly paycheck and whose monthly payments already consumed       15% of my income. But I had prepared for this time period. I       hoarded supplies and medications for months, resorting to       underutilizing my supplies. I hoped this would buy me time to       work off my deductible. It didn't; putting any money towards       that deductible was like chipping away at an iceberg with a       toothpick.        By the time I reached the last of my insulin vials, I knew       things were becoming critical. There was no way I could meet       my deductible without forgoing housing and food. And at over       $250 a vial, my monthly supply of insulin far-exceeded even       my deductible. So, I did what seemed like my only choice: For       weeks, I ate significantly less, exercised more, and       dangerously started rationing my insulin by cutting my dose       and letting my blood sugars rise to unhealthy levels.        Even as those last vials turned to the last few drops, I       refused to panic. Surely this is what all the patient       assistance programs were meant for. I called my doctor, my       pharmacy, my insurance company, the insulin manufacturer, 3       different prescription assistance programs and faced the same       answer every time: there was nothing they could do to help       because I had insurance. With every call I became       increasingly more desperate, finally resorting to begging and       pleading.        Didn't they understand I would be dead in less than 48       hours if I didn't get my insulin? I wasn't just frustrated at       that moment; I wasn't just angry . . . I felt insignificant.       Like my survival, my life amounted to absolutely nothing.        At the end of the day, none of those avenues helped me.       None of those programs pharmaceutical companies tout to the       media saved me from death. No, my help came from a last-ditch       visit to a government funded community health clinic. There,       my insulin was provided to me for $14--$2,386 less than at       the pharmacy.        The insulin crisis is at a critical juncture in America. We       can no longer talk about hypotheticals--diabetics have been       and are continuing to die from a lack of affordable access to       a drug we need just as much as oxygen. I may not have set out       to be an advocate, but I refuse to sit idly by while       diabetics suffer at the hands of companies that continue to       make exorbitant money off our bodies. Our community will not       stop until every diabetic has equal access to insulin. And we       will not be silenced when parents, friends, and family       continue to bury their loved ones.        Thank you, Senator Blumenthal for sponsoring this bill.       This is one bill, of hopefully many, where America chooses to       stand with those who have suffered greatly at the hands of       pharmaceutical companies.                                           Kristen Whitney Daniels,      CT#insulin4all Chapter Leader.                                   ____         Hi, my name is Johnathan Chappell and I'm an attorney at       the law firm Feldman, Perlstein, and Greene in Farmington,       Connecticut.        As far as background goes, I was diagnosed as Type I       diabetic in 1999 and started used Humalog insulin in 2001.       Just to see what we're talking about, this is one vial of       insulin, for those who do not know. For me, it's about ten       days of life.        It being July 1st, we're getting close to the Fourth of       July--the country's birthday, if you will. I'll show you       this, which is three vials of insulin in a box, with a rubber       rand around them, that says ``One of three, two of three,       three of three.'' So that's about a month of life, for me       anyway.        I filled my prescription--I think, smartly--on June 15th.       The key date in my life is July 1st. That's the reset date of       my high-deductible plan. So this amount of insulin, again,       this being a vial (There are three of them in these boxes. I       trust you will trust me)--if I got this today, it would be       $1,008. I got it on June 15th for a $25 co-pay. There are a       lot of words that I could choose, but ``insane'' seems to be       pretty fitting if you ask me.        And we're here to talk about insulin, but the cost of       equipment to put that insulin into my body is also not cheap.        The good news is that I get a lot of gas points at the       pharmacy. The bad news is I have to figure out how to feed my       family, which includes my wife and three children, and       continue to do so. And that, even for me, is quite a task at       times.        So what do I do? I try to stockpile as much insulin as I       can grab, while my deductible has been exhausted. Like a       squirrel before hibernating, I tried to get as much of this       as I could before today. So I have about a month or two while       I'm okay, or very good. But this is unacceptable. This is not       the point of healthcare reform. It has not been addressed, in       my opinion.        I thank Senator Blumenthal. With my years of involvement       with JDRF I've met him and his wonderful office members a       number of times. I'm a past president of the JDRF and       obviously I can tell you that I'm not the only Type I in       Connecticut who is worried about this. I'm fortunate that       they still asked me to come and tell my story.        So, again, this was $25 and, if I went back today, or in       two weeks, it would be $1,008. And it would probably be more       expensive, to tell you the truth, because the price of       insulin just keeps going up. The minute you drive your car       off the lot, it depreciates but, for some reason, insulin has       appreciated every day for the past twenty years I've been       using it. In November, it will be twenty years with Type I       diabetes--pretty tightly controlled, but to do that is not       cheap.        So again, if Senator Blumenthal's bill is right near a       vote, let's get it voted on and let's do what we can to get       this issue solved. Short-term, mid-term and forever. I thank       Senator Blumenthal and everybody out there for the support.     Mr. President, Kristen is the chapter leader of  Connecticut #insulin4all and attended the event I mentioned. She was  inspired to become an advocate for affordable and equitable access to  insulin after facing tough barriers in her own medical treatment. She  was forced to become one of the one in four patients with diabetes in  the United States who has resorted to insulin-rationing in the face of  high drug costs.   Let's be clear about insulin-rationing. It means reducing the  dosage--rationing the consumption--to lower the cost. When we talk  about folks who have to cut pills in half or seniors who take a pill  every other day instead of every day, that is rationing. That is  [[Page S4764]]  what Kristen had to do in the face of these rising drug prices.   In order to pursue her dream internship, Kristen had to purchase the  only health insurance she could afford, which was a high-deductible  plan whose monthly payments consumed 15 percent of her income. To try  to prepare for the realities of this kind of coverage, she had to hoard  her insulin and other diabetes supplies for months in advance,  deliberately starving her body of the medicine she needed in order to  keep her head above water financially.   I have submitted bipartisan legislation that was recently approved  unanimously by the Judiciary Committee, along with my colleague Senator  Cornyn, that would end these abusive practices surrounding patents-- patent-thicketing and product-hopping. You don't need to know the  details of those abuses or of our legislation to understand the need  for protection and the need for security and safeguards for these kinds  of patients--the 30 million who suffer from diabetes and who are paying  exploding costs for insulin that are rising exponentially and  astronomically for not only insulin but also many other drugs, as we  know from listening to our constituents.   All of our colleagues understand the high cost of prescription drugs  that continue to plague America across all walks of life. Every day,  patients are forced to choose, in fact, between paying for the  medicines they need and the needs of their families. Drugs to treat  everything from depression, to arthritis, to cancer, and even basic  saline solution for IVs have increased in price in recent months. They  are not new, wondrous, magic discoveries; they are workhorse medicines.  Insulin has been around for 100 years. Many of these other drugs have  been around for decades as well. We owe it to Americans.   As citizens and as patients ourselves, we know that these rising  prescription prices are ruining families, tearing apart communities,  and destroying the basic trust we have in our healthcare system.  Nothing is more basic. Healthcare is a right. Prescription drugs should  not be available just to the wealthy.   The bill Senator Cornyn and I are hoping this Chamber will pass is  just one step toward making prescription drug prices more affordable;  making these cures that are America's pride--developed by great  researchers and wonderful minds--available to all of our citizens.   Logan Merwin, Emma Del Vecchio, and all of the children in America  who suffer from diabetes understand something maybe we don't as well:  that insulin is a matter of life and death and that they are alive  because they live in the greatest country in the history of the world,  where insulin is available to them even at times when it is difficult  for their families to afford. They know, too, that with the great  advocacy of Kathryn Nagel, Kristin Whitney Daniels, Jonathan Chappell,  and others who are taking their cause to America, as well as the JDRF,  which is supporting wonderful discoveries, we will be a better country.  We will make these prescription drugs affordable.   Insulin will be available to all. Insulin does not belong to me or to  you; it belongs to the world. And I hope America will be an example of  making insulin belong to the world.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the American  Legion as it celebrates 100 years of dedication to serving and  advocating for veterans on a local and national level.   Chartered and incorporated by Congress in 1919, the American Legion  has grown to support veterans nationwide. The American Legion  Department of Connecticut was established in the same year and is home  to some of the first posts in the country.   Over the past century, the American Legion has established itself as  our Nation's largest veterans service organizations. As a nonpartisan  and not-for-profit organization, the Legion uniquely offers a multitude  of local programs devoted to our servicemembers and their communities.  Through youth mentorship and athletics, reintegration assistance for  wounded veterans, and many other critical activities, the Legion plays  an important role in their communities throughout the United States.   With around 150 posts across Connecticut, the organization helps  bring together and shape the lives of many veterans, their families,  and their neighborhoods. The Department of Connecticut follows the four  pillars of the American Legion: supporting Americanism, national  security, advocating for veterans' affairs and healthcare, and  preparing children throughout our state for future success.   In particular, they generously help children of all ages in  Connecticut explore their potential with activities such as State  Police Youth Week, an oratorical contest focused on deepening high  school students' understanding of the U.S. Constitution, American  Legion Baseball, and summer government education programs.   As a member who has regularly attended events for the Legion,  including several of their youth programs, annual conventions, Veterans  Day events, and mid-winter conferences, I can proudly attest firsthand  to the impressive work they accomplish on behalf of Connecticut  veterans and their families. As the American Legion and its Department  of Connecticut recognize and celebrate their rich and productive 100- year history, the dedicated staff and volunteers continue to look  toward the future and expand the positive impact of their outreach and  programs.   Committed to serving veterans and their communities throughout our  State, the American Legion Department of Connecticut provides essential  advocacy and services that help to better lives and create new  opportunities. I applaud the accomplishments of the American Legion's  devoted officers and volunteers, and I hope my colleagues will join me  in congratulating the American Legion and the American Legion  Department of Connecticut on a century of excellence.                            ____________________
