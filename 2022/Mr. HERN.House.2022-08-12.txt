 I rise today in strong opposition to the bill before us  today.   Never in our history has the Federal Government responded to a  recession by raising taxes on Americans. It is simply unthinkable.   Nearly everything our colleagues across the aisle have said about  this bill has been proven false. I have noticed they have stopped  calling it the inflation legislation because they know it is not true.  They are hailing it as a climate and tax plan. I will give them that  because this legislation will raise American taxes and give that money  to handpicked socialist green companies. I wouldn't be proud of that if  I were them.   What this bill will absolutely do is not reduce inflation. In fact,  even liberal economists are warning it will do the exact opposite.   Just today, 56 percent of Democrats and 91 percent of Independents  are now gravely concerned with the direction of our economy. I have  received thousands of phone calls, text messages, and emails from my  constituents over the last week pleading with me to stop this bill from  passing. They understand what half of this Chamber does not.   When the Federal Government spends more, American families have less.  I find nothing redeemable in this legislation and, therefore, I urge my  colleagues to vote a resounding ``no.''
