 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend,  Mr. Jordan, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this anti-Second Amendment  legislation. I know firsthand how important firearm ownership and the  Second Amendment are for self-defense.   Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago, I was in the batter's box at a baseball  field in Virginia, practicing for our Congressional Baseball Game, when  a deranged gunman tried to kill us because we were Republicans.   The attack would have been a massacre if not for the armed U.S.  Capitol Police Officers, my heroes, David Bailey and Crystal Griner,  who were there.   The actions on that field that day solidified my support for the  Second Amendment. Remember, Mr. Speaker,  [[Page H5912]]  this gunman wanted to settle his political differences with us, who  were trying to fix a broken healthcare system, with bullets on a  baseball field.   It is not what we do in the United States of America, but that day,  my thought was, I wish I had my firearm to protect myself.   We don't need more laws and restrictions that make it more difficult  for law-abiding, gun-owning citizens to exercise their constitutional  rights and protect their families.   We need to support law enforcement and get tough on criminals who  steal guns and commit violent crimes and further improve mental health  programs.   I am a proud gun owner. I am a concealed carry licensee and a strong  supporter of our Second Amendment. I always have and always will work  to preserve the Second Amendment for law-abiding, American citizens. I  urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this attack to undermine the  Second Amendment.
