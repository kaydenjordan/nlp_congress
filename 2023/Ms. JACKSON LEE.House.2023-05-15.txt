 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me, first of all, indicate that today is the  National Fraternal Order of Police 42nd Annual National Peace Officers'  Memorial Service, which I will make comments on throughout my  discussion and debate of other bills. It is important to note the  hundreds and hundreds of police officers that are here to honor those  who have fallen in the line of duty and the many families who are here,  as well, mourning and receiving recognition today.   At the same time, I render my sympathy and concern for Congressman  Gerry Connolly and two staff members who have been violently attacked  in his congressional office in Virginia and indicate our prayers and  best wishes for these particular staff persons' speedy recovery. I know  that we all are stunned, but we also offer our concern to our colleague  and wish him safety, along with his staff.   Mr. Speaker, I now rise to offer strong support for H.R. 3089, the  NDO Fairness Act, the crucial bipartisan surveillance reform  legislation that passed out of the Judiciary Committee last week on a  voice vote.   I thank Mr. Fitzgerald. I thank Mr. Nadler, the ranking member, for  his leadership in working together with Mr. Fitzgerald and, of course,  all of us on the committee that saw the rightness and reason for this  legislation.   The NDO Fairness Act is a simple, straightforward bill that addresses  a narrow problem by establishing essential guardrails for when the  government seeks to assess someone's electronic communications without  that person's knowledge.   This legislation would insert balance into a system that, for too  long, has been a free-for-all for government prosecutors.   Let me be very clear: Nothing that we are doing is intending to  undermine the fair prosecution of those who have done wrong, those who  are criminals and otherwise who warrant the prosecution of the Federal  Government.   It is, as we debated right after 9/11, an attempt to uphold the  values of this Nation. I remember the intense discussions we had on the  PATRIOT Act when the inclination after the heinous, devastating murder  of 3,000-plus Americans on 9/11 was that we needed to do everything to  insist that no one had even an inch of freedom.   I am glad that, in the Judiciary Committee, of which I was a member  at that time, we saw the rhyme and reason, and we worked in a  bipartisan way to establish a PATRIOT Act that could, in fact, fight  terrorism, as it has done, but also protect the constitutional rights  of Americans.   I see this in this NDO Fairness Act today. Under current law, after  the government obtains a court's permission to search the contents of a  person's electronic communications, a wish they would not know,  prosecutors must then compel the email service provider to produce the  relevant data. To avoid having the service provider turn around and  tell its customer about the search, the government can also ask the  court to grant a nondisclosure order, or NDO, colloquially referred to  as a secrecy or gag order. You are gagging the American citizen.   There is no time limit for these orders. There is no standard to  meet. Today, all the government needs to do is cite one of five  potential adverse results, without showing that it is necessary, and  the court may grant the request.  [[Page H2323]]    Prosecutors frequently seek these secrecy orders in cases where there  is clearly sometimes no need and in situations where the government  alone benefits. In many instances, there is no need.   Unlike when a physical search order occurs and a person has the right  to go to court to dispute the warrant, NDOs can keep the subject of the  search in the dark until the court reverses the order.   The NDO Fairness Act would do away with the rubberstamped process  that governs gag order requests by ensuring that courts apply a strict  scrutiny standard to government requests with a written determination  explaining their reasoning.   By time limiting nondisclosure orders, raising the standard of  review, and ensuring that service providers have standing when they  object, H.R. 3089 inserts transparency, reason, and balance into a  system and fairness and justice on both sides that far too long has  been a free-for-all for government prosecutors simply by virtue of it  being just too easy to overuse.   In the 21st century, Federal prosecutors no longer need to show up to  your office. They just need to raid your virtual office. Unlike  physical searches, they can search an email in secret. The House  surveillance laws have not kept pace with rapidly changing technology.   Mr. Speaker, just wait on the march of AI. I think this bill is  extremely timely because we have to be engaged with our constitutional  values no matter what the level of technology is. It is imperative that  the House of Representatives act to ensure that Americans are still  protected as everyday life moves increasingly online.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Fitzgerald for introducing this bill  and Ranking Member Nadler, again, for his leadership on this issue. I  also thank Chairman Jordan for moving this bill swiftly through the  Judiciary Committee and Senator Lee for his leadership in the Senate. I  was glad to serve as the ranking member of the subcommittee dealing  with this bill, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and to pass  this important legislation today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me cite an example that I think is worthy of my  colleagues hearing. Between 2016 and 2021, Microsoft received between 7  and 10 NDOs every day. That is, on average, from 2,400 to 3,500 secrecy  orders a year.   Apple has received roughly 13,200 requests with secrecy orders from  Federal agencies over the past 5 years, which is approximately 2,600  requests annually or the equivalent of 7 to 8 requests per day that are  accompanied by a gag order.   Just think of how many Americans that impacts. They are not the only  service providers to feel the legal burden. Google has about 130,000  secrecy orders right now. Meta averages more than 100,000 requests per  year.   For example, in the first half of 2021, 70 percent of the 63,657  search requests Meta received included gag orders. That is an enormous  tally. That is a lot of Americans.   To be very clear, as I conclude my remarks, this is in no way  attempting to thwart the important prosecution of individuals who are  intending to do harm in any way to the United States by way of criminal  acts. Certainly, we believe in justice for any person who is accused.  They have a right to due process, a trial by their peers and otherwise,  but we do believe that it is important to protect the vast number of  Americans who would not know what is happening to their online searches  or their online privacy.                                time  1715    Mr. Speaker, the NDO Fairness Act would insert process and  deliberation into gag order requests and make it more likely that  Americans whose electronic communications are searched can assert their  rights in court.

There is no time limit to these orders. There is no standard to meet.  Today, all the government needs to do is cite one of five potential  adverse results--without showing that it is necessary--and the court  may grant the request.

This is good bipartisan legislation, I urge all  Members to support it.   Mr. Speaker, this is good bipartisan legislation, and I urge all of  the Members to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier today, and I will say again, there are  thousands of police officers and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of  families who are here for the National Fraternal Order of Police, 42nd  Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service, and their families  that are obviously in pain today.   This legislation is appropriately debated today to be able to express  and recognize our support for National Police Week. In this little book  are the names of the people from State after State who have fallen  while on duty. In  [[Page H2327]]  visiting and participating in the ceremony just a few hours ago, we met  the families of those who had fallen in the line of duty: those  officers who died of COVID, who were on the front lines protecting our  communities; and the wife of Sean Rios, who was with the Houston Police  Department who lost his life.   There were many, many others who we could personally meet or engage  with. The Houston Police Department, the Harris County Sheriff's  Department, as well as members of other departments from Atlanta to Los  Angeles were there. I am proud to say that Houston's Honor Guard was  there, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 363, expressing support for  recognizing National Police Week.   Today, there are more than 800,000 sworn law enforcement officers  serving in the United States. Each day, in every corner of this  country, these brave men and women risk their lives to keep the peace  and keep us safe.   From responding to 911 calls, to investigating wrongdoing, to  securing our public spaces, to being a friend to a lost 3-year-old, we  call on our law enforcement officers to help us in times of need.  During National Police Week, we recognize the sacrifices that officers  make in serving their communities, and we thank them for their service.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad that the expression of support is neither  Democrat or Republican, it is, as we stand here today, as Americans.   On this day, Peace Officers Memorial Day--and every day--we  especially recognize the brave men and women who have perished in the  line of duty. Each year, the National Law Enforcement Memorial must  bear the names of more fallen heroes who have given their last full  measure of devotion to the communities they swore to protect and serve.  This year that number is 556.   This includes men and women--and increasingly women are joining the  many law enforcement agencies locally across America. There are even  women police chiefs and heads of police organizations. We applaud that  reach, that welcoming, and that diversity of law enforcement officers,  it makes a community better.   H. Res. 363 honors those who have lost their lives in service to  their communities. This resolution includes my amendment, which  clarifies that of the 556 law enforcement officers honored at Peace  Officers Memorial Day this year, 224 were killed in the line of duty in  2022, 332 were killed in previous years but their stories had been lost  until now.    While every officer named in this resolution deserves our respect and  their families are owed both gratitude and sympathy, it is important to  make clear that we have not allowed more than 500 officers to die on  our watch for a second consecutive year.   The country is still reeling from the loss of 586 officers who died  in the line of duty almost entirely because of COVID-19 in 2021. They  never stopped. They never went home. They were in the line of duty, and  they died. It is important to make that note so their story is not  lost.   Although America's law enforcement officers continue to battle the  effects of the pandemic, there has been a significant reduction in such  deaths--due in part to reduced infection rates and the widespread  availability and use of vaccinations.   Last year, of the 224 officers killed in the line of duty, 70  officers died after contracting the disease while carrying out their  official duties. That is down from 405 officers in 2021--a decrease of  83 percent, for which we should be forever grateful and thankful-- despite COVID-19 remaining the number one cause of law enforcement  death in 2022.   It is important to acknowledge every line of duty death. I met a  family, a mother, whose son died of COVID after 37 years on the force.  That is why I am glad we have come to know of the sacrifices made by  the remaining 332 officers, some who gave their lives as far back as  1857. Their courageous stories have finally been brought to light.   Just as this resolution notes, law enforcement officers across the  United States serve with valor, dignity, and integrity, and we must do  the same--ensuring that we maintain the public trust and the integrity  of this body--by legislating with specificity and transparency and  making sure that each officer be honored in their loss and our loss of  them.   It is equally important to fully and accurately understand the  challenges that law enforcement officers are facing so that we make  sure officers have the equipment, training, resources, and support they  need to remain healthy and safe while they endeavor to keep us safe, as  this resolution also recognizes. The law enforcement trust and  integrity legislation that I introduced deals with equipment and  training for law enforcement agencies from very small to the major  cities.   If we truly care about the well-being of America's law enforcement  officers, we must also work to end gun violence, particularly by  keeping guns out of the hands of the wrong people, where they endanger  officers and the communities they serve.   Mr. Speaker, it is important to take note that, unfortunately, today  in New Mexico, three civilians are dead, and two cops were injured in a  New Mexico shooting. The suspect opened fire in Farmington, New Mexico.  Several were injured and there were three dead civilians. Officers shot  and killed the gunman. Two officers were wounded, and they have been  taken to a local hospital. They are, hopefully, listed in stable  condition, and, hopefully, will survive and recover. It is so very  important that we realize that there is more that we can do in honoring  these officers. Tragic, another shooting.   We should also continue to hear from law enforcement about the other  dangers they face and work to improve their ability to respond to new  challenges while also identifying opportunities to simultaneously  promote the safety of law enforcement officers and improve public  safety.   Though we do not have legislation before us today that addresses the  needs of all law enforcement, I will continue to support bills that  provide for the equipment, training, resources, and how to interact  through community-police relationships to strengthen ties between law  enforcement and the communities they serve. We need to provide them  with the ability for intervention to bring down gun violence in our  communities and all kinds of violence, and particularly give them the  tools to help with a mental health crisis, so that they are not the  only ones that are called when a family has a mental health crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Representative Guest and the bipartisan  coalition of Members, including Ranking Member Lofgren and Chairman  Issa, for introducing this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support the resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   We will see many of our local police officials and officers this  week. I acknowledge that the week of May 1 through May 5, the city of  Houston and the Houston Police Department had our own annual Police  Week. I acknowledge publicly our great concern as a community in  honoring police.   We had, of course, the Police Week award ceremony that was held on  May 2. We had a day of prayer that was held on May 3 in front of the  police corporate headquarters where our Houston area clergy came  together to reinforce the partnership between community and the police.  We had the annual Police Week memorial service that was held on May 5  at a very important memorial in our city where candlelight and the  placement of the wreath occurred, as well as the roll call and  ``Taps.''   We are excited that the HPD honor guard will participate this week in  the National Police Week ceremony.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article titled ``HPD to Host  Police Week 2023 Events.''                 [From City of Houston News, Apr. 28, 2023]                    HPD To Host Police Week 2023 Events         The Houston Police Department invites the community to       observe and participate in National Police Week from this       Monday (May 1), through Friday (May 5).        This annual event allows our city to celebrate the       contributions police officers make to our communities and       honor those officers who have lost their lives in the line of       duty.        This year's activities for HPD include three important       events:        The Police Week Awards Ceremony Luncheon will be held on       Tuesday, May 2, at noon, at Hilcorp--Headquarters, 1111       Travis Street. The ceremony will feature the reading of the       Mayor's Proclamation and award presentations to HPD       employees. This event is by invitation only.        The Day of Prayer Ceremony will be held at 10 a.m. on       Wednesday, May 3, at the Edward A. Thomas Building, 1200       Travis. Houston-area clergy members will gather to reinforce       the partnership that exists between the community and the       department. The public is invited to attend.        The Annual Police Week Memorial Service will be held on       Friday (May 5), at 7 p.m., at the Houston Police Officers       Memorial site at 2400 Memorial Drive to honor those officers       who have given their lives in the line of duty. A procession       of police officers will walk down Memorial Drive. A       candlelight vigil will be held and include the placing of a       wreath on the Houston Police Officers Memorial, a roll call       of deceased officers, a 21-gun salute, the playing of TAPS       and a fly-over by HPD helicopters. The public is invited to       attend.        The HPD Honor Guard will participate in the National Police       Week Ceremony in Washington, D.C., from May 11 through May       15.        Please join the Houston Police Department in commemorating       the law enforcement officers who have paid the ultimate       sacrifice, selflessly dedicating their lives in the line of       duty while serving to protect the citizens of our great city.        All officers and citizens are encouraged to drive with       their headlights on, in remembrance of the peace officers who       have sacrificed their lives in the line of duty.

I acknowledge the words of our chief, Chief Troy  Finner: ``We honor the heroes and heal their families' heart.''   Chief Troy Finner said that HPD commanders and officers joined  thousands tonight with a candlelight vigil in Washington, D.C., to  honor the memory of HPD Sergeant Sean Rios, one of 556 recent fallen  officers, to recognize from the sheriff's department, Major Susan  Cotter, honoring those who paid the ultimate sacrifice, and to honor  their families, including Sergeant Gutierrez, Deputies Almendarez and  Howard. Gone but not forgotten.   I honor those words, and I honor those leaders coming from my local  community.   Whether they are State, local, Tribal, or Federal agents or officers  of any of those agencies, we are grateful for the service of all law  enforcement. We thank them and their families. Many families and  children were there today at this memorial on the grounds of the United  States Capitol.   I also wish to thank the many law enforcement officers who serve in  my district working to keep Texans safe. I was proud to see the Houston  Police Department and Harris County Sheriff's Office participate in  this year's observances here in Washington, D.C.   To the Capitol Police who protect the people, Members of Congress,  our staff, and the work we do, I thank them for protecting our  democracy.   I am proud to support and recognize law enforcement officers for the  tremendous work they do each day and to uplift in special reverence the  names of all of those men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for  us and the Nation.   May I offer these names to be held in high esteem and reverence who  have passed away: Charles Eudell Galloway, Harris County Constable's  Office. He died January 23, 2022. We honor Jennifer Lauren Chavis,  Constable's Office, who died on April 2, 2022; Darren Almendarez, who  died on March 31, 2022; and Ramon Gutierrez, who died on January 24,  2022; Harris County Sheriff Robert Adam Howard, who passed away in  recent years. Ramon Gutierrez and Darren Almendarez, I mentioned. And,  of course, Sean Sebastian Rios in the Houston Police Department died on  November 9, 2020.   They are the names of those who have passed over the years.   Mr. Speaker, I support passage of this resolution without question,  and I hope my colleagues will do the same. At this moment we are not  different, we are the same, and we mourn for those who have fallen.   We pray for those officers in the hospital in New Mexico.   Protecting the American people, and we can do it together.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 363, Expressing support for  recognizing ``National Police Week.''   Today there are more than 800,000 sworn law enforcement officers  serving in the United States. Each day, in every corner of the country,  these brave men and women risk their lives to keep the peace and keep  us safe.   From responding to 911 calls, to investigating wrongdoing, to  securing our public spaces, we call on our law enforcement officers to  help us in times of need. During Police Week, we recognize the  sacrifices that officers make in serving their communities, and we  thank them for their service.   On this day, Peace Officers Memorial Day--and every day--we  especially recognize the brave men and women who have perished in the  line of duty.   And each year, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial must  bear the names of more fallen heroes who have given their last full  measure of devotion to the communities they swore to protect and serve.  This year that number is 556.   H. Res. 363 honors those who have lost their lives in service to  their communities. This resolution includes my amendment, which  clarifies that--of the 556 law enforcement officers honored on Peace  Officers Memorial Day this year--224 officers were killed in the line  of duty in 2022 and 332 officers were killed in previous years, but  their stories had been lost. Until now.   While every officer named in this Resolution deserves our respect and  their families are  [[Page H2329]]  owed both gratitude and sympathies, it is important to make clear that  we have not allowed more than 500 officers to die on our watch for a  second consecutive year.   The country is still reeling from the loss of 586 officers who died  in the line of duty almost entirely because of COVID-19 in 2021.

Mr. Speaker, at least 3 civilians dead and 2 cops are injured in a  New Mexico shooting.   The suspect opened fire in Farmington, New Mexico. Several injured &  3 dead civilians. Officers shot & killed the gunman.   Two officers were wounded & have been taken to a local hospital where  they are listed in stable condition.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, today I managed on the floor of the  House a legislation that would honor the fallen of our many, many  police officers, some 800,000 across America.   I had the privilege of joining many, many families and police  officers in the National Fraternal Order of Police 42nd annual National  Peace Officers Service to hear the names, one after the other, of the  many States of those who lost their lives.   As I said earlier in debate, the Houston Police Department was  present, along with the Harris County Sheriff's Office, and we  recognized those who had fallen in those two departments. It was a time  when I even said to the families: Never let them walk alone.   I honor them.   I will take a moment because I recognize the importance of children,  and I am asking the Department of Justice and the Department of  Education to help us stop the hostile State takeover of the Houston  Independent School District. It is urgent and imperative that this  district survives, and we need Federal Government intervention now.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Jackson) for gathering us this evening.   As I have often said, this is National Police Week. Today, we honor  those who have fallen in battle. That is why I think this debate on the  debt ceiling is so crucial, and it is really important to have the  American people recognize, particularly those impacted in the African- American community, as the Congressional Black Caucus rises today to  specifically focus on the, if you will, economic infrastructure around  a community that has in its history in this country been deprived of  economic wealth and has a wealth disparity between Anglo Americans of  $174,000 versus about $17,000, which leads us to understand how  important it is to have a stable economic structure and for the country  to pay its bills.   Madam Speaker, what is the debt ceiling?   It is simply a procedure that has been designated as required for the  Nation to pay her bills. Every single family, independent, working  person, and people who are in need understand the need to pay bills.  They understand the crisis of not paying bills.   Tonight, I just want to briefly discuss some of the challenges that  will be faced by poor people, people of color, but also by our law  enforcement. Tragically, we see circumstances when law enforcement on  the front lines are in jeopardy. As we see that, we are hearing about  who is for the police and who is not for the police.   Let me tell you what the default on America bill that has been passed  by my Republican friends will do. Frankly, that bill is what we are  being held hostage for. They want to move the default on America bill  before we do the right, constitutional, and definitively important act  of raising the debt ceiling simply to pay the bills, simply to have  America continue to be rolling on all wheels, simply to make sure that  the military is paid, and the massive numbers of law enforcement are  paid.   With this bill, the Department of Justice budget will be cut by over  $8 billion and threatens nearly 30,000 law enforcement jobs.   The default on America bill cuts nearly $1 billion in grants for  State, local, and Tribal law enforcement. That includes $150 million in  the bill that I wrote, the Violence Against Women Act, and it cuts the  programs created by the Violence Against Women Act, which will  especially harm women in Native communities.   The bill cuts $1 billion in FBI funding that the agency uses to  conduct background checks to solve violent crimes and combat terrorism.  This is protecting individual family members and neighborhoods. By  cutting these dollars, you are putting them in jeopardy.   It eliminates $564 million in funding for the Drug Enforcement  Agency. We are trying to stop fentanyl which, by the way, has been  brought in by U.S. citizens through legal points of entry.   It eliminates $384 million more from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms and Explosives. We have seen what guns can do to law  enforcement officers on the front lines. I am stunned that we are where  we are today. It has already been noted that, in fact, under the past  administration, the Trump administration, if I might say, the debt  ceiling was raised in a collegial, responsible way by former Speaker  Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic majority with the Trump administration  doing what is right.   The only thing that undermined a strong economy was the major deficit  and debt that was created by the Trump tax cuts.   So, here we are today. Why, I ask, are we, in essence, being  stumbling blocks instead of building for eternity, instead of working  together, instead of finding common ground?   If we voted today, we would be voting to honor those who have fallen,  we will be voting to honor those who serve. We need to provide those  funds to local, State, and Tribal Governments to ensure that we have  law enforcement, that 800,000 police are not diminished but they are  enhanced with skills, training, and funding that we are able to do in  the Federal Government.   Let me add, this will be making poor people poorer. Food stamps and  other nutritional programs will be cut by $14.7 billion in August and  September; Pell grants that cover higher education--which is the  underpinning of creating a new America, an America that is an  opportunity for all of us--for low-income students will be cut $8.8  billion. Educational programs designed to improve academic achievement  for disadvantaged children, will be cut $2.5 billion by August and  September; early childhood development services for low-income  children--these are lifelines for these children--will be cut by $1.3  billion. All of these are very special and close to my heart, but job  training programs for dislocated workers, youth employment services-- which directly relate to young people having an opportunity in the  summer, not being distracted, not being subjected to potential violence  or loss of life because they are not being constructively engaged--will  be cut by $800 million.    I am wondering, can we not work together as we did under the  Democratic majority, working with a Republican President?   Can't we work with a Democratic President and a Republican House and  do what is right for the American people and ensure that the poor don't  get poorer, and that people of color don't get thrown, not just off the  rails but out of the train and out of the bus to be rolled over?   We have got to be able to respond to our early histories, many of us  know what being poor is, but most of us know what it is to come up  without much, but because of education and opportunities, we are here  in this Congress today. I see that in my constituents. I see that in  the high schools I go to. The graduating classes I went to over the  weekend where I saw the graduates who individually had stories where  their original beginnings were not the best, but look at them,  graduating with an undergraduate business degree, graduating from law  school, graduating with associate degrees, making life better because  part of that was funded by Federal resources.   We need to raise the debt ceiling, not by being held hostage, but by  doing the responsible thing. We need to pay America's bills and to make  sure that the American people who are pulling themselves up by their  bootstraps have the shoes to be able to pull themselves up. We need to  make sure during this very special week that we honor police officers  by providing those local police departments, State departments, Tribal  departments the resources that they need, and particularly that we  don't underfund the Violence Against Women Act--some of the most  violent calls are domestic violence calls--by $150 million. We need to  make sure that we do not take money away from police officers, $8  billion, with 30,000 law enforcement officers lost.   How outrageous are we going to be?   Raise the debt ceiling and do what is right for the American people  and our children.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus,  and on the House Budget Committee, it is my duty to speak on the  Republican manufactured debt crisis and the devastating impacts of the  failure to lift the debt ceiling would have on Black families.   Breaching the debt limit would provoke unprecedented economic damage  and instability in the U.S. and around the world.   Every single American would feel the effects of a first-ever default:   An estimated 8 million people would be out of work and the  unemployment rate would double;   Social Security checks would be halted to 67 million Americans;   Medicaid services would be in doubt, affecting 75 million people's  health coverage;   The average worker close to retirement could see their retirement  savings decrease by $20,000 due to Republican brinksmanship impacting  the stock market.   Republicans suspended the debt ceiling three times under President  Trump.   In fact, the massive Republican tax cuts over the last 25 years have  cost $10 trillion to date and are responsible for 57 percent of the  increase to the debt ratio since 2001.   Instead of investing in America, Republicans would rather focus on  holding our economy hostage to advance unpopular and dangerous right- wing priorities.   Their plan would expand so called ``work requirements'' in the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).   Everyone needs enough resources to afford the basics including food,  a roof over their heads, and healthcare.   Taking food, health care, or income support away from people who do  not meet work-reporting requirements causes harm and does not increase  work.  [[Page H2337]]    SNAP already has a requirement for some participants and it's a  failure--it takes basic food assistance away from people who need it  and doesn't boost their employment.   Most people who get help affording food or health coverage do work.  But this proposal will cause many working people to lose assistance.   Not only would their unpopular policies negatively impact millions of  people across America, their proposed spending cuts would specifically  have devastating impacts on thousands of hardworking families across  Texas.   Republicans are threatening food assistance for up to 855,000 Texans  with their proposals for harsh new eligibility restrictions in SNAP.  This proposal would also mean 139,000 women, infants, and children  would lose vital nutrition assistance through the Women, Infants, and  Children (WIC), increasing child poverty and hunger.   This proposal would not only eliminate Pell Grants altogether for  6,800 students in Texas, but it would also reduce the maximum award by  nearly $1,000 for the remaining 581,100 students who receive Pell  Grants--making it harder for them to attend and afford college.   Under this proposal, 39,700 families in Texas would lose access to  rental assistance, including older adults, persons with disabilities,  and families with children, who without rental assistance would be at  risk of homelessness.   Under this proposal, people applying for disability benefits would  have to wait at least two months longer for a decision. With fewer  staff available, 5 million seniors and people with disabilities in  Texas would be forced to endure longer wait times when they call for  assistance for both Social Security and Medicare.   This proposal would mean 46,100 fewer veteran outpatient visits in  Texas, leaving veterans unable to get appointments for care like  wellness visits, mental health services, and substance disorder  treatment.   The proposal would mean 17,500 children in Texas lose access to Head  Start slots and 9,900 children lose access to childcare--undermining  our children's education and making it more difficult for parents to  join the workforce and contribute to our economy.   The proposal would deny admission to opioid use disorder treatment  for more than 1,100 people in Texas through the State Opioid Response  grant program--denying them a potentially life-saving path to recovery.   More specifically, the impacts on my home district, Texas-18, would  be catastrophic:   Kill 7,300 jobs in TX-18;   Jeopardize Social Security payments for 61,000 families in TX-18;   Put health benefits at risk for 242,000 people in TX-18 who rely on  Medicare, Medicaid, or Veterans Affairs health coverage;   Increase lifetime mortgage costs for the typical homeowner in Texas  by $50,000;   Threaten the retirement savings of 81,400 people near retirement in  TX-18, eliminating $20,000 from the typical retirement portfolio.   There never has been and never will be anything fiscally responsible  about refusing to pay America's bills, risking millions of jobs, or  threatening economic ruin.                                time  2000    Ms. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Madam Speaker, you have heard from my  distinguished colleagues about our topic today, which is raising the  debt ceiling, all issues of great importance to the Congressional Black  Caucus, our constituents, Congress, and all Americans tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
