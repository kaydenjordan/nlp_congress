 Mr. President, tax reform represents our best chance  today to get the economy living up to its true potential, and it is a  once-in-a-generation opportunity.   The last time major tax reform happened was more than 30 years ago.  In the years since, our country, our economy, and the global  marketplace have changed in profound ways. Moreover, the lingering  economic challenges of the last decade only compound the urgency to get  this done.   Jobs went overseas. Wages didn't grow like they should have. Hard- working families worried if they would be able to send their kids to  college or save for retirement. It is clear that families and small  businesses had a rough go of it during the Obama economy.   They deserve relief. They deserve the chance for something better.  Tax reform is an important way to help get the economy, jobs, and  opportunity moving again in a serious way.   Listen to this small business owner and franchisee from Lexington,  KY. She recently wrote to my office expressing the need for tax reform:  ``With the rising cost of doing business,'' she wrote, ``and the  [g]overnment regulations that have been imposed on small businesses  over the past several years, we desperately need tax relief and  competitive rates. The current high tax rate that I pay,'' she  continued, ``reduces the amount of earnings I can invest into my  businesses, [into my] employees, and [into my] community.''   For small business owners in Kentucky and throughout the country, we  want to make it easier to grow, invest, and hire. For families  everywhere, we want to make taxes lower, simpler, and fairer. In short,  we want to take more money out of Washington's pockets and put more in  the pockets of the middle class. That is why we are pushing tax reform.   Yesterday, the Senate Finance Committee began to mark up its tax  reform legislation. The meetings this week represent the next step in a  years-long campaign, which included dozens of hearings and significant  input from both sides.   Chairman Hatch said yesterday:         First and foremost, this legislation will provide much-      needed tax relief to American workers and families. It       reduces rates across the board, particularly for those in the       middle class who have struggled to get through the past 8       years of economic stagnation.    Indeed, under the Finance Committee's proposal, the typical American  family of four earning the median income could see a tax cut of nearly  $1,500.   As these hearings continue, I would like once again to commend  Chairman Hatch for his leadership of the committee and his commitment  to regular order. As the tax proposal advances through an open process,  members of the Finance Committee will consider many of the hundreds of  amendments that have already been filed on the bill. Once the committee  completes its work, the bill will come before the full Senate.   Along with our colleagues in the House, as well as President Trump  and his team, we will continue to push for tax reform to fulfill  important shared goals for our country. We have a lot of work ahead of  us, but we are committed to getting this done for the  [[Page S7186]]  American people. I hope that our Democratic friends will join us.   As I said before, until very recently, our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle used to support many of the ideas included in this  bill. The underlying ideas haven't changed. The urgent need for tax  reform hasn't changed. The only thing that has really changed is the  occupant of the White House. So I hope Senate Democrats will put aside  partisanship and work with us in a serious way to deliver this much  needed relief to small businesses and the middle class.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in addition to the other work being  done by the committees, the Senate is continuing to confirm qualified  and talented nominees sent to us by the President. Yesterday we  confirmed an important official for the Department of Transportation,  and today we will confirm another.   Then, we will advance the nomination of David Zatezalo to serve as  the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, a position  of particular importance in my home State of Kentucky, where mining  supports thousands of good jobs.   Mr. Zatezalo has spent a lifetime working in the mining industry. He  began as an underground coal miner and worked his way up through the  ranks to most recently lead a mining company based in Lexington, KY. He  knows about various levels of the business, which would be an important  asset as he works with operators, miners, and inspectors to ensure that  mining operations are safe for our Nation's mine workers.   Having begun his career as a coal miner himself and having later  managed and operated a number of mines, Mr. Zatezalo has a keen  understanding of the challenges and risks sometimes associated with  mining. This firsthand experience will serve him well in his new role.  As Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, Mr.  Zatezalo will be given the responsibility to reduce workplace accidents  and promote safe and healthy workplaces for miners.   I strongly support his nomination to serve in this role, and I would  ask my colleagues to join me in advancing this nomination.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with  respect to the Bradbury nomination, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.
