 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 366) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the  Under Secretary for Management of the Department of Homeland Security  to make certain improvements in managing the Department's vehicle  fleet, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 366         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Stop Asset and Vehicle       Excess Act'' or the ``DHS SAVE Act''.       SEC. 2. DHS VEHICLE FLEETS.         Section 701 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       341) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(5), by inserting ``vehicle fleets       (under subsection (c)),'' after ``equipment,'';        (2) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections       (d) and (e), respectively; and        (3) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new       subsection:        ``(c) Vehicle Fleets.--        ``(1) In general.--In carrying out responsibilities       regarding vehicle fleets pursuant to subsection (a)(5), the       Under Secretary for Management shall be responsible for       overseeing and managing vehicle fleets throughout the       Department.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs.  Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I stand before you in support of H.R. 366, the DHS Stop Asset and  Vehicle Excess, or DHS SAVE, Act of 2016.   In October of 2015, the DHS inspector general released a scathing  report of the Federal Protective Service's management of their vehicle  fleet, a report that reads like a laundry list of poor management  decisions. The IG found that the FPS had more vehicles than officers,  and officers were authorized to drive from home to work with  government-owned vehicles and, actually, put more miles on the vehicles  in driving from home and back to work than they did on the job, among  many other things. Additionally, the report stated that the FPS was not  in compliance with Federal and departmental compliance, which is why I  introduced the DHS SAVE Act.   This bill improves the management of DHS' vehicle fleets by  authorizing the Under Secretary for Management at the headquarters  level to oversee the components' vehicle fleets, requires the  components to evaluate their fleets on an ongoing basis, includes  penalties for the mismanagement of component fleets, and requires the  DHS to identify alternative methods for the management of component  fleets. With the second largest civilian vehicle fleet in the Federal  Government, the DHS simply must have stricter controls in place at the  headquarters level in order to rein in rogue components.   As the new administration scrutinizes the DHS' operations, this bill  will provide important authorities to root out waste, fraud, and abuse  from the Department.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 366, the DHS Stop Asset and Vehicle Excess  Act.   H.R. 366 seeks to improve the Department of Homeland Security's  management, acquisition, and oversight of its fleet of roughly 53,000  vehicles. H.R. 366 requires the Under Secretary for Management to  provide departmental components with a standardized vehicle allocation  methodology for components to utilize to develop fleet management  plans.   This legislation was informed by oversight that was conducted by the  Department's inspector general. The inspector general found that, in  2014 and 2015, the DHS did not adequately manage or have the  enforcement authority over components to ensure that the composition of  its motor vehicle fleet was right sized. This lack of effective  management led to the overuse of sports utility vehicles, unnecessary  discretionary equipment packages, and overpayments to the GSA.   Further, the Committee on Homeland Security received testimony from  the Director of the Federal Protective Service that roughly half of the  1,100 vehicles in FPS' fleet were underutilized or had fewer than  12,000 miles. H.R. 366 grants authority to the DHS headquarters over  components with respect to managing vehicle fleets.   Specifically, under H.R. 366, the DHS is directed to establish  requirements for components to more rigorously evaluate their fleets on  an ongoing basis. Additionally, this bill directs the DHS to identify  alternative methods for managing component fleets, such as a shared  motor pool. The DHS has the second largest civilian vehicle fleet in  the Federal Government at an operating cost of about $462 million.   There is a critical linkage between the Department's operational  effectiveness in national security missions and the effective  management of the resources and requirements by the DHS leadership. As  such, enhancing oversight and management should help the Department  more effectively spend limited taxpayer dollars on what the Department  actually needs to carry out its mission.   H.R. 366 seeks to improve the management of DHS' vehicle fleet by  strengthening the oversight and management of the Department's fleet by  the Under Secretary for Management. It is also worth noting that H.R.  366 includes language that I authored to ensure that the inspector  general's oversight of the DHS' management of its vehicle fleet  continues.   I commend the OIG for its robust and ongoing oversight of the  Department's vehicle fleet. I also commend my colleague on the Homeland  Security Committee, Mr. Perry, for introducing this legislation and  working in a bipartisan fashion to advance it.   I urge the passage of H.R. 366.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleague for her hard work on  this bill and for her bipartisan spirit in getting it to the floor with  me.   I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 366.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 366.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.  [[Page H790]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 347) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide for  requirements relating to documentation for major acquisition programs,  and for other purposes.

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ACQUISITION                     DOCUMENTATION.         (a) In General.--Title VII of the Homeland Security Act of       2002 (6 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end       the following new section:       ``SEC. 708. ACQUISITION DOCUMENTATION.         ``(a) In General.--For each major acquisition program, the       Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary for Management,       shall require the head of a relevant component or office to--        ``(1) maintain acquisition documentation that is complete,       accurate, timely, and valid, and that includes, at a       minimum--        ``(A) operational requirements that are validated       consistent with departmental policy and changes to such       requirements, as appropriate;        ``(B) a complete lifecycle cost estimate with supporting       documentation;        ``(C) verification of such lifecycle cost estimate against       independent cost estimates, and reconciliation of any       differences;        ``(D) a cost-benefit analysis with supporting       documentation; and        ``(E) a schedule, including, as appropriate, an integrated       master schedule;        ``(2) prepare cost estimates and schedules for major       acquisition programs, as required under subparagraphs (B) and       (E), in a manner consistent with best practices as identified       by the Comptroller General of the United States; and        ``(3) submit certain acquisition documentation to the       Secretary to produce an annual comprehensive report on the       status of departmental acquisitions for submission to       Congress.        ``(b) Waiver.--On a case-by-case basis with respect to any       major acquisition program under this section, the Secretary       may waive the requirement under paragraph (3) of subsection       (a) for a fiscal year if either--        ``(1) such program has not--        ``(A) entered the full rate production phase in the       acquisition lifecycle;        ``(B) had a reasonable cost estimate established; and        ``(C) had a system configuration defined fully; or        ``(2) such program does not meet the definition of capital       asset, as such term is defined by the Director of the Office       of Management and Budget.        ``(c) Congressional Oversight.--At the same time the       President's budget is submitted for a fiscal year under       section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, the       Secretary shall make information available, as applicable, to       the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate regarding the requirement       described in subsection (a) in the prior fiscal year that       includes the following specific information regarding each       major acquisition program for which the Secretary has issued       a waiver under subsection (b):        ``(1) The grounds for granting a waiver for such program.        ``(2) The projected cost of such program.        ``(3) The proportion of a component's or office's annual       acquisition budget attributed to such program, as available.        ``(4) Information on the significance of such program with       respect to the component's or office's operations and       execution of its mission.        ``(d) Major Acquisition Program Defined.--In this section,       the term `major acquisition program' means a Department       acquisition program that is estimated by the Secretary to       require an eventual total expenditure of at least       $300,000,000 (based on fiscal year 2017 constant dollars)       over its lifecycle cost.''.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 347, the Department of Homeland Security  Acquisition Documentation Integrity Act. This legislation requires the  Department of Homeland Security to improve the management of its major  purchases of systems to secure the border, better screen travelers,  protect our shores, and other vital missions.   Too often, the DHS has failed to document what these programs will  cost, when they will be complete, and what they actually will deliver.  It is unacceptable to spend billions of taxpayer dollars and not  document this very basic but important information. H.R. 347 will help  our committee and congressional watchdogs hold the Department  accountable and ensure taxpayer dollars are being spent in both an  efficient and effective manner. Safeguarding Americans' hard-earned tax  dollars is why our constituents sent us here in the first place.   I commend Ranking Member Watson Coleman for her leadership on this  issue, and I ask all Members to join me in supporting this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 347, the DHS Acquisition Documentation  Integrity Act of 2017.   I reintroduced H.R. 347, a measure that the House unanimously  approved on February 23, 2016, to ensure that the progress that the  Department of Homeland Security has made with respect to how it manages  acquisitions continues.   H.R. 347 requires complete, accurate, timely, and valid documentation  to be maintained for each of the Department's major acquisition  programs, which is defined as one with a life cycle cost estimate of  $300 million or more. The required documentation includes information  regarding operational requirements, a complete life cycle cost  estimate, a cost-benefit analysis, and a schedule.   Under this legislation, the DHS component heads would also be  required to submit certain documentation to the DHS Secretary for  inclusion in an annual status report on the Department's acquisitions.  While there have been improvements to acquisitions management under  former Secretary Jeh Johnson, the Department has struggled when it  comes to delivering a specific program on time and at an established  cost.   Most of the DHS' major acquisition programs continue to cost more  than expected, take longer to deploy than planned, or deliver less  capability than promised. For example, the DHS' efforts to deliver a  Department-wide human resources IT system--HR-IT--have spanned almost  14 years and have cost millions of dollars with little to show for it.  As can be seen with the case of HR-IT, anything less than up-to-date  acquisition documentation increases the odds of cost and schedule  overruns, risks delayed delivery of critical capabilities, and depletes  resources needed to address future requirements.   As such, H.R. 347 codifies ``best practices'' already embodied in the  DHS' acquisition policy and necessary for the success of the DHS'  mission. H.R. 347 requires the DHS Secretary, through the Under  Secretary for Management, to require components to maintain specific  types of acquisition documentation.   Representatives McCaul and Thompson, the chairman and ranking member  of our committee, and Representative Perry, the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency, cosponsored this  legislation, which reflects a strong commitment to bolstering the  effectiveness of the DHS' acquisition programs in a bipartisan fashion.   I urge the passage of H.R. 347, a bill that will help ensure that the  DHS is a good steward of taxpayer dollars and can provide the DHS'  operators in the field with the tools they need to protect the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I, once again, commend my good friend and  [[Page H791]]  colleague from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) on her hard work in  offering this viable and meaningful solution.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 347.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 347.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
