 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2339 will hurt farmers in North Carolina,  disrespect the free choice of Americans--especially African Americans-- and do nothing to advance public health.   The uncertainty this bill will create serves no legitimate purpose  and will hurt 1,300 hard-pressed, hardworking farmers all across North  Carolina.   Why are Democrats so dismissive of the interest of farmers and the  challenges they face?   Consider this: Nearly 30 percent of adult tobacco users report  flavored tobacco use.                                time  1000    Almost nine in ten adult African American smokers choose menthol.  This bill would ban them all.   How can you not only dismiss but discriminate against their adult  choices?   Do you really expect that no black market will emerge to cater to  those choices?   Have you considered the harms that will result from that?   Kids shouldn't use tobacco, nor, in my opinion, should adults, but  more bureaucracy, trampling arbitrarily on adult free choice, and  destroying family farmers are nowhere close to the solution.
