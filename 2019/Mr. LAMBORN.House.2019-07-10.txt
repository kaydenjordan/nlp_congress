 Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for yielding and  for his leadership.   Mr. Chair, as we consider H.R. 2500, the 2020 National Defense  Authorization Act, it is important to remember that this bill is about  ensuring the men and women in our Armed Forces and their families that  they have what they need to defend our great Nation. We have done well  in some respects, but we have come up regrettably short in other areas  vital to our military.   I am proud of the bipartisan work the Readiness Subcommittee  completed under the leadership of my friend, Chairman Garamendi. We  funded all MILCON projects on the unfunded requirements lists,  prohibited nondisclosure agreements in privatized military family  housing, directed development of a tenants' bill of rights, directed  TRANSCOM to do a business case analysis before awarding a global  household goods contract, and took major steps to address fluorinated  firefighting foams.   This bill comes to the floor as we emerge from a dangerous readiness  crisis. We have made big strides to rebuild readiness while also  modernizing for near-peer competitors, but we cannot move backward now.   Secretary Mattis and General Dunford said we needed 3 to 5 percent  real growth to keep our competitive edge against Russia and China. By  not supporting the $750 billion request, we are not maintaining that  edge.   The bill does not support strategic priorities such as hypersonic and  low-yield weapons, and it fails to fund almost $1.5 billion in key  readiness accounts. It also failed to fund a high-value detainee  complex at Guantanamo Bay.   For these reasons, I could not support final passage of the NDAA out  of committee. I am hopeful that we can improve the bill in a bipartisan  way through the amendment process. Failing that, I will urge my  colleagues to vote against final passage.    Madam Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chairman, there are a number of flaws with this  amendment. I oppose it, and I would ask everyone to vote ``no'' on it.   There are a number of reasons why this is not a good amendment. For  one thing, what is being asked for in this amendment has already been  done. I have some documents here I would like to show you.   This is the defense budget overview. It goes into exhaustive detail,  thousands of line items on where the Pentagon spending is going right  now--domestic, foreign, everything.                                time  2015    This is available to all Members of Congress. This is the National  Security Strategy, the National Defense Strategy, and just a smattering  of other documents: the Missile Defense Review, the National Defense  Strategy Commission, the Nuclear Posture Review. All of these documents  do what is being asked for.   So it is unnecessary. Any Member of Congress, even if they are not on  the Armed Services Committee, can come to the committee, can ask the  Pentagon, can ask staff on the committee for all of these documents.  These are already available. So to ask the Pentagon to regurgitate this  to us is just a big waste of their time and money.   So for that reason, and there are other reasons also--I will see if  there are any further arguments--this is unnecessary and wasteful, and  I would urge a ``no'' vote.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, it is not even really easy or practical to  do what the chairman and the sponsor of the amendment are just  proposing. There is not a fine line between what is overseas and what  is domestic. Let me give you an example.   I have a brigade combat team from Fort Carson in my district that is  now in Afghanistan. One of the things that is called for to be expensed  in this report is training exercises.   Okay. When the brigade combat team is in Fort Carson in Colorado  training to go over to Afghanistan, at what point do you draw the line  and say: Oh, that is domestic; everything beyond that is foreign?   Is it when they step on the airplane?   Is it when the airplane lands at Bagram in Afghanistan?   Is it when they start doing live-fire exercises in Colorado?   Where do you draw the line there?   This is really not even a well-written amendment. It is very  impractical.   But the worst objection to this amendment is it abdicates  responsibility. The chairman said let's have the Department tell us  what they are doing. No, they tell us what they are doing, and we  determine whether that is what they should be doing.   This amendment is calling for the national security benefits to be  told us by the Department of Defense. That is our oversight role as  Congress. We oversee the Department of Defense. We determine if they  are giving us the national security benefits that we tell them to give  us.   We don't tell them: Tell us what you are doing and tell us if what  you are doing is okay and helpful. No, they tell us what they are  doing. They specify, including the dollar amount, then we determine,  with our oversight role, if that fulfills the national security  purposes that they are supposed to be doing.   The way this amendment is written, we are abdicating that  responsibility to them. They are supposed to tell us what the benefits  are of what we are doing. That is Congress' role. That is not their  role to tell us. That is our role as oversight.   For that reason alone, we should reject this amendment. It is an  abdication of our responsibility.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.  [[Page H5557]]     Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, to conclude, let me offer this to every Member of  Congress. Almost 300 pages, with thousands of line entries, of where  every dollar in the Pentagon is going, we have this information right  now. Why should they have to regurgitate that for us all over again?   And then let's exercise our responsibility and not have them tell us  if what they are doing fulfills national security. Tell us what you are  doing, and then we will determine if that fulfills national security.   So for all these reasons, Madam Chair, I would say because it is  wasteful, it is duplicative, it is impractical, and it abdicates our  responsibility, I would urge that we reject this amendment.   The work has already been done. If anyone wants to show a little bit  of initiative, they can get this information already. It is available.  It is right here.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
