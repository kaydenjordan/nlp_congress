 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the West Coast  Dungeness crab fishery agreement.   This successful, two-decades-old tristate Dungeness crab management  agreement expired on September 30, 2016. This bill simply extends the  working management authority between Washington, Oregon, and California  and makes this arrangement permanent. A similar measure passed the  House last year with flying colors.   For approximately two decades, these States have successfully  overseen one of the most valuable fisheries in the Pacific Northwest.  In 2014, fishermen delivered 53 million pounds of crab to market,  totaling $170 million. This economic activity helps support more than  60,000 jobs related to the seafood industry in Washington alone.   How has it maintained its success? The fishery has been managed in a  sustainable, science-based way, and, importantly, it doesn't cost  taxpayers a  [[Page H714]]  dime. If we do not renew this agreement, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, says its management of this  fishery will cost taxpayers $1.15 million per year.   Simply put, this bill maintains local control of a crucial resource  and ensures sustainability of the Dungeness crab fishery, all while  saving taxpayer dollars. This bill is the kind of commonsense policy  that those folks I represent at home in southwest Washington expect to  see out of Washington, D.C.   I want to thank Chairman Bishop and the House Natural Resources staff  for bringing this bill to the floor. Passage of this bipartisan bill  gives fishermen and coastal communities on the West Coast peace of  mind.   I urge the House to vote ``yes'' on this bill and to ensure a bright,  sustainable economic future for coastal crab-dependent communities like  Ilwaco, Washington, and many others on the West Coast.
