 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment to  strike a critical provision of this year's NDAA.   I do share my colleague's concern for the current state of our U.S.  Coast Guard icebreaker fleet. I do believe there are ways that we can  address that issue, but I disagree with his proposed solution.   To be clear, the National Defense Authorization Act authorizes funds  for the Department of Defense. The U.S. Coast Guard falls under the  Department of Homeland Security.   This amendment seeks to take millions of dollars away from the Navy  in the long term and shift it to the Coast Guard for their  expenditures. Make no mistake about it: if this amendment passes, there  is no stopping the Department of Homeland Security or any other agency  from poaching enormous sums of our Defense Department budget in the  future. Today it is Coast Guard icebreakers, and next year it may be  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research and survey  vessels. The possibilities are endless; unfortunately, the funds are  not.   Mr. Chair, I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  amendment to ensure that our Navy and Department of Defense funds are  used only by the Navy and the Department of Defense.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Turner), my friend and colleague.
