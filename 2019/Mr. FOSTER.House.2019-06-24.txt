 Mr. Chair, I thank the chair for yielding.   My amendment provides direction to do everything possible to fix the  indefensible disparity between States in the per capita allocation of  transportation funding through the Highway Trust Fund. Under the  current process, known as apportionment, many States receive far more  in Federal funding for surface transportation than they contribute  through the gas tax.   Apportionment in no way is a scientific or mathematical formula but  is simply grandfathering in a table of numbers that were used to buy  votes in the Senate generations ago. Unsurprisingly, this table of  numbers greatly favors the low-population States that are  overrepresented in the Senate.   This problem is compounded by the fact that high-wage States like  Illinois pay more in taxes but get no credit for this when income tax  funds are transferred into the Highway Trust Fund. As a result, some  States receive sometimes five times more per person than Illinois and  other large States.   My amendment represents a clear statement by the House of  Representatives that we should move toward a per capita allotment that  is fair to people no matter what State they live in.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this en bloc  package.
