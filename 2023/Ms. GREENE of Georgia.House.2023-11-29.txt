 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of  rule IX, I seek recognition to give notice of my intent to raise a  question of the privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   Resolution impeaching Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, Secretary of  [[Page H5945]]  Homeland Security, for high crimes and misdemeanors.   Resolved, that Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland  Security, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors and that the  following Articles of Impeachment be exhibited to the United States  Senate:   Articles of Impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives of  the United States of America in the name of itself and of the people of  the United States of America against Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas,  Secretary of Homeland Security, in maintenance and support of its  impeachment against him for high crimes and misdemeanors.   Article I. Rather than adhering to an oath he took to defend and  secure our country and uphold the Constitution when he was sworn in as  Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas has engaged  in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with the laws of the  United States as follows:   Article II of the Constitution requires that the executive branch,  which today includes the Secretary of Homeland Security, ensures the  laws passed by Congress and signed into law by the President are  faithfully executed.   The Secure Fence Act of 2006, Public Law 109-367, requires that the  Secretary of Homeland Security ``maintain operational control over the  entire international land and maritime borders of the United States.''                                time  1215    In his willful admittance of border crossers, terrorists, human  traffickers, drugs, and other contraband, Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas  has failed to maintain operational control of the border, thereby  violating the Secure Fence Act of 2006.   The Guarantee Clause set forth in Article IV, Section 4 of the  Constitution dictates, ``The United States shall guarantee to every  State in this Union a republican form of government, and shall protect  each of them against iInvasion; and on application of the legislature,  or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against  domestic violence.''   The Guarantee Clause clearly dictates that the Federal Government has  a constitutional duty and obligation to protect each of the States from  invasion. As Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security,  Alejandro Mayorkas has violated his oath to uphold this constitutional  duty by allowing the invasion of approximately 10 million illegals  across our borders. The ongoing invasion at our southern border is a  direct national security threat against the States and against the  citizens therein. Secretary Mayorkas has willfully abandoned his duty  to secure the border and protect States against invasion, thereby  violating Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution.   To wit, since Mayorkas has headed the Department of Homeland  Security, there have been approximately 10 million illegal border  crossers who have invaded our country at our border. This is broken  down between 8 million encounters and approximately 1,800,000 known  got-aways who have evaded United States authorities and are roaming the  interior of the United States; at least 280 people on the terrorist  watch lists caught while attempting to cross the border between ports  of entry; approximately 400,000 unaccompanied illegal alien children  encountered at the southern border, with at least 85,000 of these  children having gone missing; at least 1,424 deaths of illegals at the  southern border; approximately 73,000 special interest aliens arrested  at our border, which are aliens from a nation that promotes terrorist  activity, harbors terrorists, or poses a security threat to the United  States. This is the number arrested at the border not counting however  many of the 1,800,000 known got-aways are special interest aliens;  approximately 659 special interest aliens from Iran; approximately  6,386 special interest aliens from Afghanistan; approximately 538  special interest aliens from Syria; approximately 3,153 special  interest aliens from Egypt; approximately 12,624 special interest  aliens from Uzbekistan; approximately 30,830 special interest aliens  from Turkiye; approximately 1,613 special interest aliens from  Pakistan; approximately 164 special interest aliens from Lebanon;  approximately 185 special interest aliens from Jordan; approximately  123 special interest aliens from Iraq; and approximately 15,594 special  interest aliens from Mauritania.   In fiscal year 2021, Customs and Border Patrol seized approximately  11,200 pounds of fentanyl. In fiscal year 2022, CBP seized  approximately 14,700 pounds of fentanyl. In fiscal year 2023, CBP has  seized a record of approximately 27,000 pounds of fentanyl. Over 70,000  Americans died from fentanyl in fiscal year 2022. Fentanyl is now the  number one killer of Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. Fentanyl  kills approximately 300 Americans a day. This is the amount of fentanyl  that has been seized at the border, yet 300 Americans are being killed  by fentanyl poisoning every day. The amount of unseized fentanyl has  not even been taken into account.   The Constitution also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to  observe the Immigration and Nationality Act, (8 U.S.C. 1101). This law  requires Homeland Security to detain inadmissible aliens arriving in  the United States or illegal aliens presently in the United States.  Instead, the Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Mayorkas  has practiced catch and release policies, whereby illegals are detained  but then released without any mechanism to ensure they show up to court  for processing.   By terminating contracts for border wall construction, ending the  migrant protection protocols, which is remain in Mexico, unlawfully  granting categorical parole, and being complicit in ending title 42,  Mayorkas has made it easier for illegal aliens and drugs to enter the  United States, endangering American citizens, and has made it harder  for CBP to expel such threats.   Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas in his inability to enforce the law has  engaged in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with his duties as  a civil officer of the United States.   Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, in his failure to uphold the oath he  took, has, by his actions, lost the trust of the citizens of the United  States to faithfully execute the laws of the United States.   Wherefore, Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas thus warrants impeachment and  trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any  office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.
