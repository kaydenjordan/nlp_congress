 Mr. President, last night on television, we saw a  stark contrast between two different visions of healthcare in our  country. One is an idea that is gaining increasing currency with our  friends on the other side of the aisle. Some call it single payer.  Others try to dress it up with poll-tested PR labels.   No matter what you call it, at its core, here is what it is: a  massive expansion of a failed idea, a quadrupling down on the failures  of ObamaCare, a totally government-run system that would rip health  insurance plans away from even more Americans and take away even more  of their personal healthcare decisions. The costs of implementing it  would be astronomical. The taxes required to pay for it would be sky  high. Yet, after years of ObamaCare's failures--its higher costs,  diminished choices, collapsing markets--it seems this is the best our  Democratic friends can come up with--not a new idea but quadrupling  down on an old one that has already failed. What a contrast with the  general approach Senators Graham and Cassidy and many other Republicans  have pursued.   We think the American people deserve a better way forward--like  returning more power from the Federal Government to the States where  Americans actually live, allowing for reforms that can actually lower  costs and improve care, and actually moving beyond the growing failures  of a failed law called ObamaCare.   As I said, what we saw last night reminds us of this stark contrast  in vision. It is an important debate for our country. It is one that  will certainly continue.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, we have seen all the  serious problems facing the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin  Islands as a result of recent hurricanes. The damage has been terrible.  The latest hurricane was especially devastating.   We want the people of Puerto Rico and the islands to know that we are  thinking of them, and, more importantly, we want them to know that we  will continue to work with FEMA, the Department of Defense, and the  rest of the administration to help in the recovery.   I expect we will hear more soon on what additional resources will be  necessary in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the paths of the storms. The  recovery effort is certainly not going to be easy. It is not going to  be quick. But we are here to do our part.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 312, Ralph Erickson.
