 Mr. Speaker, I stand with Democrats for the people.   Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act, risking  healthcare for 24 million newly enrolled Americans and 129 million with  preexisting conditions. I stand with the people.   That is why I held a healthcare roundtable listening session where 53  healthcare administrators attended, talking about strengthening the  ACA, improving the delivery and access to healthcare, and addressing  social detriments.   Making homeownership a reality for Americans, I stand with the  people. Democrats on the Financial Services Committee want to expand  affordable housing and provide more homeownership opportunities to  people like Mrs. Joyce Mayne, who, at 75 years of age a few weeks ago,  purchased her first home on her birthday. Happy birthday, Mrs. Mayne.  It was with the help of a nonprofit, Homeport, and the low-income  housing tax credit.   We are working to fix our broken immigration system. Right now, Mr.  Speaker, families in my district are being ripped apart, like Edith  Espinal and members of the Mauritanian, Somali, Latin American, and  Central  [[Page H9141]]  American communities. In the nearly 365 days, Edith has been in  sanctuary, my staff and I have met with her family, legal  representatives, advocates, and community stakeholders.                            ____________________
