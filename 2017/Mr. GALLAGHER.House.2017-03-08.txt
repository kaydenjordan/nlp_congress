 Mr. Speaker, over the last 8 years, the United States  has experienced a sharp rise in the number of military threats from  foreign aggressors. Last month, Russia secretly deployed two batteries  of new nuclear-capable cruise missiles. North Korea test-launched four  ballistic missiles just this week, and China continues to bolster its  military presence in the South China Sea, while going toward a naval  fleet that may surpass 351 ships by 2020.   Meanwhile, our own Navy is the smallest it has been in 99 years,  satisfying only 40 percent of the demand from regional commanders.  Fifty-four percent of the Air Force's major weapons systems now qualify  for antique vehicle license plates in the State of Virginia.   The Army, to quote the Vice Chief of Staff, is ``outraged, outgunned,  and outdated.''   These are the bitter fruits of defense sequester; defense sequester  which must be pulled out, root and branch. To quote Secretary Mattis:  ``No foe in the field can wreak such havoc on our security that  mindless sequestration is achieving.''   I agree with General Mattis. I agree that defense sequester is  mindless. It is also dangerous. So today, while I speak in support of  this rule and this bill, I applaud the Appropriations Committee for its  critical work, and I urge my colleagues to support final passage.   This is just the first step. We will not have fulfilled our first and  foremost constitutional duty to keep the country safe until we have  completely eliminated defense sequester and truly begun the process of  restoring peace through strength.   Einstein's words are as true today as they were in 1931, when he said  of America: ``The part of passive spectator is unworthy of this country  and is bound in the end to lead to disaster all around.''   If we do not act now to rebuild and modernize our military, if we  continue to play the role of passive spectator, not only will it lead  to disaster, at some point we will no longer be worthy of global  leadership.   So to my colleague, I will say that this is our job. This is our most  basic job. So let's do what the American people sent us here to do to  keep the country safe, restore peace through strength. That is doing  our job.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained.
