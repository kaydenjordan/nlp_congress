SEC. 7. GAMING PROHIBITION.         No class II or class III gaming, as defined in the Indian       Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.), shall be       conducted on lands subject to this Act.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 548, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 548, the Eastern Band of  Cherokee Historic Lands Reacquisition Act, introduced by my friend from  Tennessee, Congressman Fleischmann. H.R. 548 places approximately 96  acres of Tennessee Valley Authority land and permanent easements into  trust along the shores of the Little Tennessee River and Tellico  Reservoir in Monroe County, Tennessee, for the benefit of the Eastern  Band of Cherokee Indians.   These areas include the Sequoyah Birthplace Museum, the Chota  Memorial, the Tanasi Memorial, and land to support these properties and  cultural programs.   The parcels placed into trust under the bill will primarily be used  to memorialize and interpret the history of the Eastern Band of  Cherokee Indians.   The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is one of three federally  recognized Cherokee Tribes and is the only federally recognized Tribe  in North Carolina. Their ancestral homeland includes substantial parts  of seven eastern States, including Tennessee.   The 57,000-acre Qualla Boundary is the name of the Cherokee Indian  Reservation in North Carolina. In 1979, after the completion of the  Tellico Dam by the Tennessee Valley Authority, or TVA, the Tribe  approached the TVA about lands that are of historical significance to  the Tribe that were impacted by the dam.   The Tribe and the TVA informally agreed to allow the Tribe to manage  two easements in 1984 and 1986, including the Sequoyah Birthplace   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann), the sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  for closing.   Again, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for introducing this  bill, and I appreciate his tireless work on it. I thank the gentlewoman  from New Mexico and the minority support on this piece of bipartisan  legislation.   I will say that H.R. 548 is a commonsense bill that facilitates  greater control for the Eastern Band of Cherokee over their sacred and  historic homelands in Tennessee. It ensures the protection of their  timeless heritage, culture, and tradition, and gives them the  opportunity to memorialize the history and culture of the Cherokee  people.   The Tribe has worked with the Tennessee Valley Authority for more  than three decades, and this legislation is long overdue.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Fleischmann for his leadership and  fulfilling a vital constituent service. I urge my colleagues to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 423) to take certain land located in San Diego County,  California, into trust for the benefit of the Pala Band of Mission  Indians, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 423         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Pala Band of Mission Indians       Land Transfer Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. TRANSFER OF LAND IN TRUST FOR THE PALA BAND OF                     MISSION INDIANS.         (a) Transfer and Administration.--        (1) Transfer of lands into trust.--If, not later than 180       days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Tribe       transfers title to the land referred to in subsection (b) to       the United States, the Secretary, not later than 180 days       after such transfer, shall take that land into trust for the       benefit of the Tribe.        (2) Administration.--The land transferred under paragraph       (1) shall be part of the Pala Indian Reservation and       administered in accordance with the laws and regulations       generally applicable to land held in trust by the United       States for an Indian Tribe.        (b) Land Description.--The land referred to in subsection       (a)(1) is the approximately 721.12 acres of land located in       San Diego County, California, generally depicted as ``Gregory       Canyon Property Boundary'' on the map titled ``Pala Gregory       Canyon Property Boundary and Parcels''.        (c) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall--        (1) enlarge, impair, or otherwise affect any right or claim       of the Tribe to any land or interest in land that is in       existence before the date of the enactment of this Act;        (2) affect any water right of the Tribe in existence before       the date of the enactment of this Act; or        (3) terminate or limit any access in any way to any right-      of-way or right-of-use issued, granted, or permitted before       the date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Restricted Use of Transferred Lands.--The Tribe may not       conduct, on the land taken into trust for the Tribe pursuant       to this Act, gaming activities--        (1) as a matter of claimed inherent authority; or        (2) under any Federal law, including the Indian Gaming       Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) and regulations       promulgated by the Secretary or the National Indian Gaming       Commission under that Act.        (e) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:        (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.        (2) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Pala Band of       Mission Indians.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 423, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 423, the Pala Band of Mission Indians Land Transfer  Act, introduced by my good friend from California, Congressman Issa,  places approximately 721 acres of land the Pala Band of Mission Indians  currently owns into trust.   The Pala Band of Mission Indians are in the southern California town  of Pala, with the reservation totaling approximately 12,000 acres.  While the Tribal economy is largely supported by agricultural  enterprises, the Tribe also operates a 86,000-square-foot Class III  casino and resort.   In the early 1990s, San Diego County voters approved a plan to  establish the  [[Page H693]]  Gregory Canyon landfill project on a 1,700-parcel of land along State  Route 76 west of the Pala Band's reservation.                                time  1715    Plans for development of the landfill ceased when the original owner  of the property fell into bankruptcy in 2014.   A successor company began exploring other development opportunities  and began meeting with the Tribe to sell a portion of the land to the  Tribe for cultural preservation as it contains cultural sites and  components meaningful to the Pala Band.   In 2016, 721 acres were purchased by the Tribe. Pala Band Chairman  Robert Smith testified to Congress that these acres were historically  occupied by Native peoples and are the site of an ancestral village,  rock art paintings, and ancient artifacts.   H.R. 423 does not affect any current land and water rights, nor does  it impact any rights-of-way or rights-of-use that are currently  permitted. The bill also prohibits any gaming pursuant to the Indian  Gaming Regulatory Act on these lands.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Issa for his leadership on this  issue. I support the bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Issa), the sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his tireless  advocacy on behalf of his constituents, and particularly the Pala Band  in this instance. I know he has worked on this more than just this  year.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I have no further  requests for time. I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, H.R. 423 is commonsense legislation,  just like the previous bill that we looked at. It will enable the Pala  Band of Mission Indians to protect their sacred land and ensure the  protection of the Tribe's timeless heritage, culture, tradition, and  history.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Issa, for his leadership and for fulfilling  a vital constituent service.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
