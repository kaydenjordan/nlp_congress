 Mr. Speaker, the clock is ticking and thousands of  Minnesotans are running out of time. Business owners are going to lose  their workforce, workers are going to lose their jobs, and children are  going to lose their parents, and it will be because we here in Congress  failed to take simple action when we were called to make change.   We have been handed a game-winning layup or, in Minnesota terms, an  empty net, and all we have to do is tap in the puck. All we have to do  is say to our Liberian population who came here fleeing bloody civil  war and the terrors of the Ebola virus: You matter; you are doing  everything right. The world took everything from you, and you came to  our country. You work hard, legally, you pay your taxes, and you are  valued members of our community.   But because we gave Liberians an immigration status DED, that does  not allow a pathway to citizenship; and because that status expires now  in 4 days, these friends, neighbors, and family members will be subject  to deportation, and it will tear our community apart, and it will be on  us.   Mr. Speaker, I recently heard from Nicole Mattson, a healthcare  employer in senior care back in the Twin Cities: ``We don't have enough  workers. At my facility, 60 percent of employees are immigrants, and  over half of those are Liberians. We would have to say good-bye to a  pool of talent that is highly skilled and educated.   ``I have no idea why we would leave behind such a critically  important group of people to the healthcare industry. Very simply, we  cannot do the work, we cannot care for people, we cannot care for  seniors without them. We need them here, and we are glad they are  here.''   Mr. Speaker, I would say that we need courage to pass a legislative  fix to save Minnesota's healthcare industry and keep hardworking  members of our population home. I would say that we need courage to  keep our families and communities and brothers and sisters together.  This is so simple and so easy, that we do not even need courage. We  just need to pass a bill.  [[Page H2832]]    These are immigrants who have done everything the right way: They are  here legally; they work hard; they pay their taxes; and they have made  themselves irreplaceable contributors to our communities.   Their immigration status has been extended by every President from  Bill Clinton to Donald Trump. These would be undocumented citizens of  our very own creation.   If you need the human argument, hear it from my constituent, Michael:  ``Going back to Liberia is not an option for me. My only brother, who  we were not able to bring to America, died in Liberia a few years ago.  My parents and siblings all live here in the United States.   ``I was recently accepted into a doctoral program in education. My  whole life is here. This is my home. Liberia is a fragile country still  recovering from a decades-long war.''   Or Matthew, who could lose his older brother: ``It affects me deeply  as a U.S. citizen. This is someone I look up to. If he was to up and  leave the U.S., that would be very difficult for him, for me. He has a  daughter. I cannot take on that responsibility of being my niece's  caretaker.   ``I cannot even imagine the nightmare that this will create in my  community. This is not just about me and my family; it is about our  community. We are going to be losing friends and family. I am not ready  for this.''   We have the legislation. We have a fix ready to go to move DED  holders to TPS for 3 years while we pass a more comprehensive fix.   So, Mr. Speaker, I say to my colleagues, ask yourselves: Are we here  to make a difference? Are you here to make people's lives better? Are  you here to help business owners and workers, or are you here to keep  playing politics with people's lives?   Let's rise to the occasion and be better than that and finally, at  long last, give our Liberian community the peace of mind that they so  richly deserve.                            ____________________
