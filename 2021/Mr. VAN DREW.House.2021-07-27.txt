 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this shameful  legislation.   This single vote encompasses seven unrelated spending bills. This is  a broken legislative process.   The bill includes poison pills that make it impossible for me and for  my colleagues to support this in good conscience. This is exactly as  the majority intended. Today's vote is simply an attempt to  strategically inflict political pain.   Our country is tired, tired of political gamesmanship, tired of  partisan maneuvering, tired of this selfish dysfunction.   On behalf of the American people, I ask the majority to stop. I must  ask the majority to stop. There is an ability to work together. This is  not it.   If this were an earnest attempt at legislating, I could lend my  support where appropriate. Unfortunately, I must oppose this rule and  this legislation.
