 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  INVEST in America Act, which includes the legislative provision based  on my bill, the Reconnecting Neighborhoods and Strengthening  Communities Act.   This act is a long overdue matter of racial justice and environmental  justice. The Federal Highway Act of 1956 built highways through the  middle of cities, sometimes to intentionally displace Black families,  disconnecting thriving communities, and made devastating economic  impacts that still exist today.   We have a responsibility to undo the harm of these intentional  decisions. Two examples of these disenfranchising projects are in the  Fifth District of Georgia that you see right next to me. The Sweet  Auburn and Summerhill communities were divided by the construction of  the downtown connector and I-20.   Millions of people in the districts across the country will benefit  from the Reconnecting Neighborhoods Program because the government  built these projects in virtually every major city.   My program invests in the redesign or removal of infrastructural  barriers built through communities of color. It ensures the  infrastructure of the future will serve communities rather than divide  them.  [[Page H3512]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
