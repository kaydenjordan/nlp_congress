 Madam Speaker, I rise to offer my strong support for the  rule and for the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement  Act.   This is an important retirement savings measure that has the support  of a wide range of stakeholders, from the United States Chamber of  Commerce to the Girl Scouts. What a credit to the committee for taking  up this important legislation for the people.   I want to highlight section 105, a provision that the committee  included to offer a tax incentive to small businesses for setting up  automatic enrollment for their employees' retirement plans.    Madam Speaker, while half of private-sector employees have access to  a retirement plan through their employer, it is estimated that just 15  percent of small businesses offer a retirement plan. Yet small  businesses employ approximately half of the Nation's private-sector  workforce.   Ensuring that small business employees have retirement options just  like those who work for larger companies will increase small  businesses' competitiveness at a time when the job market is  tightening, and it will position these employees for a secure  retirement.   Establishing automatic enrollment in retirement plans is critical.  Participation rates in defined contribution plans like a 401(k) are  above 90 percent among new hires when automatic enrollment is the  default. Moreover, 80 percent of participants increase their  contributions over time. Alternatively, when employers do not offer  automatic enrollment, new hire participation is below 50 percent.   Section 105 is based upon a bill that Mr. Kelly and I introduced, the  Small Employer Retirement Savings Auto-Enrollment Credit Act. It would  provide small businesses--those with up to 100 employees--a $500 tax  credit to defray the start-up cost of offering automatic enrollment.  The tax credit would also be available to small businesses that convert  their existing employee retirement program from an opt-in to auto- enrollment.   I was pleased to work with the chairman and his staff as well as the  gentleman from Pennsylvania on this issue. I urge adoption of the  resolution and the SECURE Act.                                time  1215     Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the passage  of the 19th Amendment 100 years ago today.   It is remarkable to imagine that the fundamental right to vote was  only granted to women this recently. If only the suffragettes who  sacrificed so much for so long could see the results of their movement,  that I would be serving in Congress shoulder to shoulder with 131  women, the most in our Nation's history.   We know that better decisions are made when more women are at the  table, from the boardroom to the floor of this historic Chamber.   Women have been blazing the path of social progress in the United  States for centuries, marching for civil rights, striking for workers'  rights, organizing against gun violence, and speaking out on sexual  harassment. Today, we continue to reshape our country, writing new  history in the Halls of Congress.   We stand on the shoulders of those who came before us, women like  Susan B. Anthony, Shirley Chisholm, Edith Nourse Rogers, and many more,  and make sure we do our part to pave the new path for women to follow  after us.   Madam Speaker, I am proud and honored to take part in celebrating the  anniversary of the 19th Amendment.                            ____________________
