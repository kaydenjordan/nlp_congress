 Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise today to  congratulate Mr. Rick Bucher, assistant director for District 7 of the  United Steelworkers, on his retirement.   Rick began his career as a pipefitter with the Steelworkers Local  6103 in Portage in 1978. Throughout his 45-year career, Rick  consistently demonstrated his commitment to our union brothers and  sisters as he held multiple union leadership roles, including grievance  chairman, international staff representative, and District 7 Sub 5  director.   Rick is the embodiment of the unwavering dedication, loyalty, and  hard work exemplified by the incredible members of the United  Steelworkers.   For his lifetime of exceptional service and outstanding leadership,  Rick is worthy of the highest praise, and I wish him all the best in  his retirement.                            ____________________
