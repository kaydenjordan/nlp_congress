 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman of the Budget  Committee for yielding.   I was in strong support of this bill, Mr. Speaker, that finally  provides relief to the American people across this country from the  failures of ObamaCare.   Just how bad is it failing?   You don't have to look any further than what happened in Iowa  yesterday, where literally they are going to have in 94 out of 99  counties nobody to write insurance for people that are in the ObamaCare  exchanges.   So what do the people, Mr. Speaker, that are opposed to this bill say  to those millions of people in Iowa who are about to have no place to  go to get health care?   What are the people that oppose this bill, Mr. Speaker, going to say  to the millions of people with preexisting conditions across the  country who are being faced with double-digit increases in their health  insurance every year and, oh, by the way, premiums and deductibles as  high as over $10,000, which are creaming those folks that are  struggling under the weight of this bill?   So what we are replacing it with, Mr. Speaker, are reforms that  actually lower premiums, that actually put patients back in charge of  their healthcare decisions so that elitists up here in Washington won't  tell you what you have to buy. You actually get to make that choice  yourself.                                time  1300    You get to focus on plans that are good for your family at lower  costs so that you can be in charge. And, by the way, reforming the  Medicaid system, one of the most broken forms of health care so that  States actually have the ability to innovate and help low-income  families.   This bill is important, Mr. Speaker, to rescue the American people  from a law that has failed dismally. Let's end the skyrocketing premium  increases. Let's lower costs and put patients back in charge of their  healthcare decisions.
