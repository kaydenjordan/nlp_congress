 Mr. President, let me thank Senator Udall for his kind  remarks and his great leadership.   I rise today to add my voice to his voice and to that of so many of  my colleagues in calling attention to the growing threat of climate  change, and to encourage the Senate to take meaningful action. First,  let me join all of my colleagues in recognizing and thanking my  colleague, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island. His tireless  work to raise awareness about the devastating impacts of climate change  has truly made a remarkable difference in our country and around the  world.   Senator Whitehouse comes to the Senate floor every week to tell us  why it is ``time to wake up,'' and I am pleased to be able to join him  as he gives his 200th such speech. These 200 speeches provide at least  200 reasons why we should be acting quickly and decisively to address  climate change. Just one of those reasons, which I would like to  highlight, is the impact of climate change on our national security.  Climate change acts as a threat multiplier, exacerbating other problems  in unstable areas around the world. It is already creating conflict  related to a lack of resources, whether it is access to food, water, or  energy.   I was just traveling through Djibouti and Somalia--adjacent to  Yemen--and one of the great crises in Yemen is not just the conflict on  the ground, but it is a water crisis that is causing massive drought.  Then I moved on up to Jordan, and there spoke with our representatives.  There is a water crisis in Jordan also and another threatened drought.   These national security problems are climate problems, and these  climate problems are national security problems. When it comes to our  national security, decisions are made through a careful evaluation of  risks, and we must be sure to include risks caused by climate change.  It is particularly troubling to me to see that the current  Administration is instead choosing to ignore the reality of scientific  consensus by removing all references to climate change from documents  like the ``National Security Strategy'' and the ``National Defense  Strategy.''   The Department of Defense must be able to execute its missions  effectively and efficiently. So it is disconcerting that climate- related events have already cost the Pentagon significant resources-- measured in both monetary costs as well as in negative impacts on  military readiness.   In fact, Secretary Mattis, who understands these issues very well,  and despite the official publication of the Department of Defense  speaks very candidly and directly, has declared the following before  the Senate Armed Services Committee:         Where climate change contributes to regional instability,       the Department of Defense must be aware of any potential       adverse impacts. . . . climate change is impacting stability       in areas of the world where our troops are operating today. .       . . and the Department should be prepared to mitigate any       consequences of a changing climate, including ensuring that       our shipyards and installations will continue to function as       required.   [[Page S1679]]     Across the globe, we see our forces in conflict. They are in the Horn  of Africa. They are there facing not just radical fighters, but drought  and environmental issues. Here at home, we have shipyards and naval  bases on the coast that are seeing rising waters that are going to cost  us hundreds of millions of dollars to remediate so they can continue to  function. If we don't respond, if we put our heads in the sand on the  issues of climate change, our national security will be in endangered.   I was very pleased as the Ranking Member of the Armed Services  Committee to support my colleagues when they included in the fiscal  year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act a direction that the  Department of Defense conduct a threat assessment and deliver a master  plan for climate change adaptation. That was a bipartisan bill led by  Chairman McCain and supported by vast numbers on both sides of the  aisle who understand that climate change must be addressed. It also  codified several findings related to climate change and expressed the  sense of Congress that climate change is a threat to our national  security. We are on record as a Congress saying that national security  is jeopardized by climate change. That has to be embraced by the whole  of government, not just the Senate or the House acting together.   I must commend our colleague--Sheldon's and my colleague--Congressman  Jim Langevin of Rhode Island because he pushed for the same measure in  the House of Representatives, and he was successful.   Just like other threats to our national security, it is critical that  we recognize, plan for, and take steps to address climate change.  Combating climate change may not seem as urgent as other threats we are  facing today, but I would argue otherwise. If we don't begin to take  aggressive action to protect ourselves from the effects of climate  change, we will face ever increasing and severe consequences. Because  of his clarion call to pay attention to climate change, Senator  Whitehouse is advancing our national security interests in an important  way, and I stand here to commend him and thank him.   I yield the floor.
