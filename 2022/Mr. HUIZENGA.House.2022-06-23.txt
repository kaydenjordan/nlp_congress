 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague yielding. As we  come to the floor to honor Matt, I know that Matt and his colleagues  are watching right now.   My colleague was able to run through the litany of his career, but I  will note that, in 1987, I was just graduating from high school when  Matt was hired. He has had an incredible tenure.   I can tell you that throughout his career, Matt has put the staff and  Grand Valley community at the center of it all, but most importantly,  it was about the students for him. It was always about the students.   Whether it was him looking out for who would be the next leader for  the student council and the student body president or who would be a  great intern in an office like mine or many others, whether it be in  Lansing or in Washington, D.C., Matt was always there for the students.   As was said, when he joined the university, it was a smaller college  of 8,000 students literally in the middle of a cornfield, and it now is  this juggernaut, powerhouse of a university in Michigan with five  locations and 23,000 students. That is, in part, due to Matt's efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege of knowing Matt personally for  well over 25 years, and I, too, grew up listening to Matt on local  television at first. I can tell you that his wisdom, his counsel, and  his encouragement that he has to offer to friends, family, and  colleagues is something that he is known for. I have never met anyone  quite so positive as Matt when it comes to life.   In addition to his time at Grand Valley and his time on television,  he served the State in lots of various ways, on committees and  commissions.                                time  1115    One very notable one was the Public Service Commission as he was  there serving and trying to help lead the direction of the State  through multiple administrations and various Governors.   I will tell you this though, Mr. Speaker, the thing that Matt is  especially known for is his Michigan political trivia. Now, I can tell  you that if you had been wondering who the Lieutenant Governor was in  1923, all you had to do was ask Matt. He would be able to tell you, and  he is probably telling and saying the name right now to his colleagues  as he is watching this.   So here is what I need to say today: Congratulations, Matt, and thank  you. Jane is going to enjoy that time together with you. I know that  you have got more coming. Even though you may not have quite figured it  out, I know you are fighting to the very end for Grand Valley and for  that budget period that is in Lansing right now.   But here is something that we all need to know: Matt is a Laker for  life, and I thank him for his service.                            ____________________
