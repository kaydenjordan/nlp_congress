 Mr. Speaker, at 11:59 tonight, we will see the end of title  42, and President Biden has been stepping up to meet the moment.   We secured additional border security patrol officers in our omnibus.  We have a new parole program to help out with countries like Venezuela,  Cuba, Nicaragua, and Haiti, where we are seeing a lot of folks come to  the border. We also see 1,500 troops going down there.   In this moment, this body should be working together in a bipartisan  fashion. We should be coming together with a supplemental to help with  the funding that we need down there at the border, not a messaging  bill, not a political points potshot bill at a time when the clock is  ticking. This body could do so much more if we worked together.   I have been down to the border, Mr. Speaker. We know what works:  sensors and technology to help make sure we have border awareness  across the southern border; having more Customs and Border Protection  agents to be able to work on apprehensions; and getting civilians to do  processing of asylum. We should be funding a bill that does those  things.   Mr. Speaker, we don't have the southern border in Florida. We have  ports, and we have had a lot of challenges with those ports. This bill  doesn't do anything for our ports. It does nothing for the ports of  entry, our front lines in the Sunshine State.   We see Governor DeSantis, on the other hand, has a law coming in  Florida that is going to attack hospitals. It is going to attack  nonprofits. It is going to hurt agriculture. It is going to hurt  construction at a time when we need to lower food prices and build more  affordable housing. We are already seeing crops not being picked in the  field as fear comes over the Sunshine State. Construction sites are  abandoned.   This isn't going to help immigration at all. What it will do is jack  up inflation and food prices at a time when we need to work together.
