 Mr. President, when they write the history of our times,  I am sure that when it comes to Senate history, this is going to be a  chapter, a monumental event in the history of the Senate not for the  better but for the worse. After we are all long dead and gone, somebody  may be looking back and trying to figure out what happened or what  motivated people.   I am going to tell you what has motivated me since I have been in the  Senate: an understanding that the job of a Senator, when it comes to  advice and consent, is not to replace my judgment for that of the  President, not to nullify the election, but to be a check and balance  to make sure that the President of either party nominated someone who  is qualified for the job and is capable from a character point of view  of being a judge for all of us, having the intellect, background,  judgment, experience to carry out the duties of a Supreme Court  Justice.   When President Obama won the White House, I suspected that he would  pick judges who I would not have chosen, based on our different  philosophies of liberal-conservative jurisprudence.   This is what Greg Craig, the former White House Counsel in the Obama  administration, said about Elena Kagan, who is now on the Court:  ``Kagan is . . . a progressive in the mold of Obama himself.''   This is what Vice President Biden's Chief of Staff Ronald Klain said  about Elena Kagan: ``Elena Kagan is clearly a legal progressive . . .  [and] comes from the progressive side of the spectrum.''   I think that was an accurate description of her and Sonia Sotomayor,  who both are progressive Justices who come from the progressive side of  the judicial spectrum. Both are highly qualified, capable women who had  stellar legal records. Even though they had outcomes I did not agree  with, they were certainly in the mainstream. Both had been judges. I  think he chose people I would not have chosen, but they were really  highly qualified.   I was the only member of the Judiciary Committee on the Republican  side to vote for either Justice Kagan or Justice Sotomayor because I  used a standard that I thought was constitutionally sound. I am not  telling any other Senator what they should do. I am just trying to  explain what I did. In the Federalist Papers, No. 76, written April 1,  1788, Mr. Hamilton said:         To what purpose then require the co-operation of the       Senate? It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of       favoritism in the President. It would portend greatly to       prevent the appointment of unfit characters from state       prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment,       and from a view to popularity.    So, from Hamilton's point of view, it was a check and balance against  a crony or unqualified person, someone who was popular but not  qualified for the job, somebody who was supported because they were  close to the President and not qualified for the job, someone who was  appointed because they were a favorite son of a particular State. That  would not be fair to everybody else. When you look at the history of  the advice and consent clause,  [[Page S2401]]  it is pretty clear that the Founding Fathers did not have in their  minds that one party would nullify the election when the President of  another party was chosen by the people when it came to Supreme Court  confirmations because they chose somebody they did not agree with  philosophically.   I voted for Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, knowing they come from  the progressive judicial pool. Neil Gorsuch is one of the finest  conservatives that any Republican President could have chosen, and he  is every bit as qualified as they were. His record is incredible--10\1/ 2\ years on the bench, 2,700 cases, and 1 reversal. He received the  highest rating of the American Bar Association, ``well qualified,''  just like Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.   To merit the committee's rating of ``well qualified,'' a Supreme  Court nominee must be a preeminent member of the legal profession, have  outstanding legal ability and exceptional breadth of experience, meet  the very high standards of integrity, professional competence, and  judicial temperament. The rating of ``well qualified'' is reserved for  those found to merit the committee's strongest affirmative endorsement.  By unanimous vote on March 9, the standing committee awarded Judge  Gorsuch this highest rating of ``well qualified,'' just like they did  for Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. He has 2,700 court decisions, 1  reversal, and praise from all areas of the law--left, right and middle.  The ABA report of 900 cases describes a very thoughtful man, an  incredible judge, and a good person. So I don't think anybody could  come to the floor and say--even though they may disagree with the  outcome--that Judge Gorsuch is not qualified, using any reasonable  standard, to be chosen by President Trump. He is every bit as qualified  as the two Obama appointments. So, clearly, qualifications no longer  matter like they used to.   Antonin Scalia--whom Judge Gorsuch, hopefully, will soon replace as  Justice Gorsuch--was confirmed by the Senate 98 to 0. Ruth Bader  Ginsburg was confirmed 96 to 3. I would argue that you could not find  two more polar opposite people when it comes to philosophy than Justice  Ginsburg and Justice Scalia. They became very dear friends, but nobody  in their right mind would say there is not a difference in their  judicial philosophy.   Strom Thurmond, my predecessor, a very conservative man himself,  voted for Ms. Ginsburg. Clearly a conservative would not have chosen  her because she was general counsel of the ACLU. I can tell you that  Ted Kennedy and other people on the progressive side of the aisle would  not have voted for Antonin Scalia based on philosophy. Something has  happened in America from 1986 to 1993. The Constitution hasn't changed.  Something has changed. I think the politics of the moment have taken  the Founding Fathers' concept and turned it upside down. From the time  that Scalia was put on the Court and Ginsburg was put on the Court,  everything has changed.   I was here when the first effort to filibuster judicial nominations  was made in earnest. In the first term of Bush 43, there was a  wholesale filibuster on the circuit court nominees of President Bush. I  was part of the Gang of 14 that broke the filibuster. We lost a couple  nominees but we did move forward. We said there would be no further  filibuster of judges unless there were extraordinary circumstance. That  allowed Alito and Roberts to go forward. Both of them got a good vote.  On Alito we had to get cloture, but we got 78 votes.   Clarence Thomas was probably the most controversial pick in my  lifetime. If you can remember that hearing, it was front page news  every day and on TV every night. Not one Democratic Senator chose to  filibuster him. He got an up-or-down vote and he passed 52 to 48. They  could have chosen to require cloture, but they didn't.   So this is the first time in the history of the Senate that you have  a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. Abe Fortas  was filibustered to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by almost an  equal number of Democrats and Republicans because of ethical problems,  and he eventually resigned.   So we are making history today--the first successful filibuster in  the history of the Senate to deny an up-or-down vote on a nominee to  the Supreme Court. It breaks my heart that we are here. I don't know  what to do other than to change the rules to have some sense of  fairness. I can't believe that Judge Gorsuch is not qualified by any  reasonable standard. I voted for Sotomayor and Kagan. Nobody even asked  for a cloture vote. They went straight to the floor. One got 62 votes  or 63 votes, and the other got 68 votes. I don't know why we can't do  for Judge Gorsuch what was done for Sotomayor and Kagan.   We keep hearing about Judge Garland. Judge Garland is a fine man and  would have been a very good Supreme Court Justice. Justice Scalia died  in February of 2016 after three primaries were already held. The  nominating process was well on its way for picking the next President.  So this was an election year. I remember what Joe Biden said in 1992,  the last year of Bush 41's term, when there was the suggestion that  somebody might retire in the election year, and he said, basically: If  someone steps down, I would highly recommend that the President not  name someone, not send a name up. If he, Bush, did send someone up, I  would ask to seriously consider not having a hearing on that nominee.  It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political season is  underway, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put  off until after the election campaign is over. That is what Vice  President Biden said when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary  Committee in 1992.   That made sense. President Trump put a list of names out that he  would choose from if he became President, which was historic. Part of  the contest in 2016 was about the Supreme Court. I have no problem at  all saying that, once the campaign season is afoot, we will let the  next President pick. That is no slam on Judge Garland. I have zero  doubt that if the shoe had been on a different foot, there would not  have been a different outcome. I can't imagine Harry Reid being in  charge of the Senate in 2008 and allowing President Bush, in the last  year, to nominate somebody in the Court and that they would approve  that decision once the campaign season had started in 2008. I say that  knowing that it was Senator Reid who chose to change the rules in 2013,  which broke the agreement of the Gang of 14 in part.    Here is what Harry Reid said in 2005:         The duties in the U.S. Senate are set forth in the       Constitution of the United States. Nowhere in the document       does it say the Senate has a duty to give the Presidential       nominee a vote.    All I can say is that in the 100-year history of the Senate, from  today going backward, there has been one person put on the Court when  the President was of one party and the Senate was held by the other  party and a vacancy occurred in the last year of a Presidential term.   We have done nothing that would justify Judge Gorsuch to be treated  the way he has been treated, and he has been treated pretty badly. Here  is what Nancy Pelosi said: ``If you breathe air, drink water, take  medicine, or in any other way interact with the courts, this is a very  bad decision.''   All I can say is that Judge Gorsuch does not deserve that. That is a  political statement out of sync with the reality of who this man is and  the life he led, and it is that kind of attitude that has gotten us to  where we are today.   I can also say that there is blame on my side too. Nobody has clean  hands completely on this. When Justice Sotomayor was nominated, she  made a speech to the effect that a White man would have a hard time  understanding what life is like for minorities. That was taken to  believe that she somehow could not be fair to White men. That was a  speech she gave that was provocative, but I never believed it was an  indication that she somehow was prejudiced against White men. The  reason I concluded that was because anybody who had known her,  including White men, said she was a wonderful lady.   I remember Elena Kagan. The attack on our side was that she joined  with the administration of Harvard to kick the ROTC unit off campus.  Somehow that made her unpatriotic. My view was that it was the position  of a very liberal school called Harvard, and no one could ever convince  me that Elena Kagan was unpatriotic. She seemed to be a very nice,  highly qualified lady,  [[Page S2402]]  and that decision by Harvard could not be taken to the extreme of  saying that she is not fit to serve on the Court. So I was able to look  beyond the charges leveled at these two ladies on our side to  understand who they really were. When you look at people who know these  judges the best, they can tell you the most accurate information. In  the case of Kagan and Sotomayor, there were a lot of people, left and  right, who said they were well-qualified, fine ladies. When you look at  what was said about Judge Gorsuch in the ABA report, it is just an  incredible life, well lived.   So here we are. We are about to change the rules. Up until 1948, it  was a simple majority requirement for the Supreme Court. As a matter of  fact, as for most Supreme Court nominations in the history of the  country, a large percentage were done based on a voice vote. It is only  in modern times that we got in this political contest over the Court.  It probably started with Judge Bork.   There is some blame to go around on both sides, but I can say that  while I have been here, I have tried to be fair the best that I know  how to be. I voted for everybody I thought was qualified. I said, as  for Judge Garland, let the next President decide. At the time I said  that in March 2016, I had no doubt in my mind that Donald Trump would  lose and that Hillary Clinton would probably pick somebody more liberal  than Garland. But it made sense to me in that stage of the process to  let the next President pick.   The fact that we are filibustering this man says a lot about the  political moment. If this were a controversial character, I might  understand it better. When you look back and try to figure out what we  did and how we got here, I can say that we took one of the best people  that President Trump could have nominated--somebody I would have chosen  if I had gotten to be President. I think Paul Ryan, Mike Pence, or any  of us would have chosen Neil Gorsuch, and he was denied an up-or-down  vote. That says all we need to know about the political moment.   We will change the rules. It will have an effect on the judiciary,  and it won't be a good one, because in the future, judges will be  selected by a single party, if you have a majority with no requirement  to reach across the aisle, which means the judges will be more  ideological.   When you have to go over there to get a few votes or when they have  to come over here to get a few votes, you have to water down some of  your choices and the most extreme ideological picks or a party or  President are probably not going to be able to make it through. Now  they will. I think what you will see over time is that the most  ideological people in the Senate are going to have a lot to say about  who is chosen by the President. It will change the nature of the  judiciary.   To the Senate itself, every Senate seat now becomes a referendum on  the Supreme Court. So when we have a contest for a Senate seat, it is  not just about the Senate. It is about the seat affecting the outcome  of the Court, because all you need is a simple majority. Whether or not  it leads to changing the legislative filibuster, which would be the end  of the Senate, I don't know, but I don't think it helps. There will be  a majority around here one day, a President of the same party, with  control of the House, and they will get frustrated because the other  side will not let them do everything they want to do, and they will be  tempted to go down this road of doing away with the 60-vote requirement  to pass a bill--not appoint a judge--and that will be the end of the  Senate. We have made that more likely by doing this. It was more likely  in 2013. I hope I am wrong, but I think we have set in motion the  eventual demise of the Senate. The one thing I can say--I am  optimistic, though--is that while I will vote to change the rules for  this judicial nomination, I will not ever vote to change the rules for  legislation.    The reason I am voting to change the rules is that I do not know what  I would go home and tell people as to how Sotomayor and Kagan got on  the Court and Gorsuch could not, why President Obama was able to pick  two people who were highly qualified and why Trump was not able to pick  one person who was highly qualified. You just can't have it where one  side gets the judges and the other side does not. To rectify that  wrong, I guess we had to change the rules.   It is not a good day. I was hoping it would never come, but it has.  To the extent that I have been part of the problem, I apologize to the  future. I think, at least in my own mind, I have tried to do the right  thing as I saw it. I took a lot of heat for voting for their judges at  a time when there was a lot of heat on our side. I am glad I did.   It is not that I am not partisan--certainly, I can be. I just think  history is going down a very dark path, and the Senate is going down a  very dark path. There will never be another 98 votes for a Scalia or  another 96 votes for a Ginsburg. That is a shame because even though  they may be different, they have one thing in common: They are good  people who are highly qualified to sit on the Court. I can understand  why a liberal President would choose one and a conservative President  would choose another. Yet what we are doing today is basically saying  that in the Senate, we do not really care about election results  anymore.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, on a more upbeat note, the lady Gamecocks  are national champions.    On April 2, this past Sunday, the University of South Carolina  women's basketball team beat Mississippi State 67 to 55 to end a  magical season and become the national champions.   This is a magical year for the State of South Carolina. We have the  Clemson Tigers, who are the national football champs. Coastal Carolina  University is the College World Series title holder for baseball. Now  we have the lady Gamecocks as the national champs and in women's  basketball. Dustin Johnson is the No. 1 golfer in America, who hurt his  back today and had to withdraw from the Masters. So that was bad.   This was a great year. I went to the University of South Carolina. I  still have 4 years of eligibility in all sports for a reason: I was no  good. My colleague who is here actually played college football, and we  are both Gamecocks fans.   Coach Dawn Staley came to South Carolina in 2008. She has been on  three gold medal national championship teams as a player. She is now in  the Hall of Fame for basketball and is one of two African-American  female head coaches to win the national title in women's basketball.  She is the real deal. She is a wonderful lady.   A'ja Wilson, our dominating junior forward, was the MVP for the Final  [[Page S2412]]  Four and SEC player of the year, and first team All American. All the  girls played really, really hard.   The men's basketball team made it to the Final Four and lost in a  very tough contest. I could not be more proud of the University of  South Carolina men's basketball team.   Frank Martin, the men's basketball coach, is the National Coach of  the Year.   This is a special time in South Carolina. If you are a Gamecocks fan,  you have been long suffering for a while, and our ship finally came in.   So congratulations to the lady Gamecocks. I can't wait until next  year. We always say that with a sense of dread, but I can't wait until  next year for South Carolina, Clemson, and every other sports team in  South Carolina. We are doing something right. I don't know what it is,  but we are all grateful in South Carolina.   I yield to my colleague, who actually played college football, and I  don't think he has any eligibility left because he was good.
