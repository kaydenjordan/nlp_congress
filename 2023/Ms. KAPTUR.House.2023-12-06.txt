 Mr. Speaker, the production of nuclear power in our  country is an awesome responsibility. Put in the hands of the wrong  people, it can be deadly.   Those who operate nuclear facilities must be highly trained and  honorable. Recall Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima? They all  teach us nuclear power in the hands of careless and, indeed, corrupt  people can be deadly to thousands of innocent people.   This morning, let us turn to Ohio's two financially strapped nuclear  plants, both located in northern Ohio, adjacent to our people's  freshwater kingdom, Lake Erie.   In Ohio, the largest corruption crimes in America's commercial plant  nuclear history are being litigated. These crimes are also the largest  public corruption trials in Ohio's history.   Last week, a Federal grand jury in Cincinnati indicted former chair  of Ohio's Public Utilities Commission, Sam Randazzo, on bribery and  embezzlement for his role in receiving $4.3 million in kickbacks for  what has been labeled the biggest political bribery scandal in Ohio's  history.   The nuclear power company, FirstEnergy, ultimately paid more than $60  million in 2018 and 2019 to bribe public officials like the Speaker of  the Ohio House, who has now been sentenced to 20 years in prison.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article entitled ``Sam  Randazzo, Ohio's former top utilities regulator, charged with bribery,  embezzlement crimes.''  [[Page H6153]]                   [From the Plain Dealer Cleveland, Dec. 5, 2023]     Sam Randazzo, Ohio's Former Top Utilities Regulator, Charged With                        Bribery, Embezzlement Crimes    (By Jeremy Pelzer, Andrew J. Tobias, and Jake Zuckerman, Zuckerman)    Columbus, OH.--A federal grand jury has indicted Sam Randazzo, the   former chair of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, on 11 counts    related to bribery and embezzlement, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Parker's                          office announced Monday.         The indictment states that Randazzo accepted a $4.3 million       bribe in exchange for helping FirstEnergy, an Akron-based       electric utility, secure its policy priorities, including       helping with House Bill 6, the 2019 energy law at the center       of a federal bribery probe. FirstEnergy admitted to bribing       Randazzo in 2021, but he wasn't charged until now.        If convicted, Randazzo could face up to 20 years in prison.        The 74-year-old Columbus resident self-surrendered on       Monday morning at U.S. District Court in Cincinnati,       according to a release. He appeared in federal court that       afternoon, cuffed at the wrists and ankles, before Chief       Magistrate Judge Karen Litkovitz at Cincinnati's federal       courthouse. He pleaded not guilty and was released on a bond       of his own recognizance.        The 11 counts against Randazzo include: one count of       conspiring to commit travel act bribery and honest services       wire fraud, two counts of travel act bribery, two counts of       honest services wire fraud, one count of wire fraud and five       counts of making illegal monetary transactions, according to       the release.        As chairman of the PUCO from April 2019 until he resigned       in November 2020, Randazzo reviewed requests from gas and       electric companies seeking to levy new costs on customers. He       accepted $4.3 million soon after meeting with then-      FirstEnergy executives Chuck Jones and Mike Dowling in       December 2018, as Randazzo was applying to become PUCO chair.        In November 2019, Randazzo pushed to cancel a 2024 rate       review case that the company believed would hurt its bottom       line by forcing it to reduce the rates it charged customers,       as well as open its books to regulators, which they saw as       problematic.        Randazzo also played a key role in getting lawmakers,       including Ohio Senate Finance Committee Chair Matt Dolan, to       include language in the 2019 state budget that loosened state       limits on FirstEnergy, and other utilities' ability to make       ``significantly excessive'' profits, according to the       indictment.        Dolan, a Chagrin Falls Republican now running for the U.S.       Senate, previously acknowledged speaking to Dowling, who       convinced him of the need to place the amendment in the state       budget. The Plain Dealer/cleveland.com reached out to Dolan       on Monday for comment.        The indictment states that Randazzo routed the bribe money       through his consulting business, Sustainability Funding       Alliance of Ohio. He also used that business to funnel to       himself at least $1 million meant for Industrial Energy       Users-Ohio, a consortium of large-scale energy buyers who he       represented in PUCO cases as an attorney.        ``Public officials--whether elected or appointed--are       tasked with upholding the highest level of integrity in their       duties and responsibilities. Such service to the public must       be selfless, not selfish,'' the U.S. Attorney said in a       statement. ``Through the indictment unsealed today, we seek       to hold Randazzo accountable for his alleged illegal       activities.''        Roger Sugarman, an attorney representing Randazzo in       criminal and civil lawsuits, declined to comment Monday.       Randazzo did not respond to questions posed by reporters.        Randazzo's arraignment on Monday advanced a stunning fall       from grace from a once respected utility lawyer and lobbyist       with notorious influence at the Statehouse. He is often       credited with pushing for what would become state laws       constricting the growth of wind, solar, and energy efficiency       programs in Ohio. State lobbying records reflect years of       lobbying work on behalf of the Ohio Gas Company, Vectren       Energy and IEU. Now-state Sen. Shane Wilkin once told       Randazzo in an email that ``we already know you run the       energy world.'' He was a mainstay at IEU's regular ``Ohio       Energy Management Conference.''        Gov. Mike DeWine, who appointed Randazzo, had dinner with       Jones and Dowling the same night as the latter pair's meeting       with Randazzo. DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney said Monday that       while the governor's office wasn't privy to the indictment       and was still reviewing it, ``the indictment alleges very       serious acts. Our office has full faith in the criminal       justice system to adjudicate these serious allegations in an       appropriate manner.''        Many of the emails and text messages referenced in the       indictment to and from the former FirstEnergy executives and       Randazzo have previously been made public. However, the       indictment's details about his embezzlement charge are new,       according to Dave DeVillers, Parker's predecessor as U.S.       attorney.        Randazzo resigned as PUCO chair in November 2020, days       after the FBI raided his Columbus townhouse. In the years       that followed, prosecutors were silent about Randazzo,       leading to questions about why they were taking so long to       decide whether to file charges.        Ashley Brown, a former PUCO commissioner, said the delay       has cost the state's electricity customers, given that the       PUCO has paused its own investigations into the HB6 scandal       at Parker's request to wait for the federal corruption       investigation to wrap up.        In the meantime, electricity customers have continued to       pay a fee contained in HB6 that subsidizes a pair of coal       plants owned by FirstEnergy and several other utilities.        ``It's hard to imagine why he wasn't indicted earlier,''       said Brown, who also questioned why no current or former       FirstEnergy officials have been charged so far.        Asked about the length of time it took for charges to be       brought, DeVillers said, ``They could have been negotiating       with the defense attorney, they could have been talking to       him and it fell apart. And then it could be they dug into       this count [the embezzlement charge], which seems to be       completely different, and needed to ferret that out to find       out what that was all about.''        Randazzo is already a defendant in a civil lawsuit filed in       2021 by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost. As part of that       case, a Franklin County judge ordered the seizure of up to $8       million worth of Randazzo's assets, though that decision is       still being appealed.        Randazzo's indictment comes several months after ex-Ohio       House Speaker Larry Householder was sentenced to 20 years in       prison for leading a $60 million bribery scheme using       FirstEnergy money to help pass House Bill 6, which included a       $1 billion-plus ratepayer bailout for two nuclear power       plants then owned by a FirstEnergy subsidiary. Former Ohio       Republican Party Chair Matt Borges received 5 years in prison       for his role in the scandal; two others connected to the       bribery scheme have pleaded guilty and are awaiting       sentencing.        FirstEnergy officials previously admitted that Randazzo       helped them to develop strategy and legal language for HB6.        After HB6 passed, emails made public last year showed       Randazzo, as PUCO chair, worked behind the scenes to hinder       attempts to fully repeal the law, and he only grudgingly       called for state regulators to take limited action--asking       FirstEnergy to investigate itself over whether it misspent       any customer money--in response to negative press.        To date, no current or former FirstEnergy officials, have       been charged in connection with the HB6 scandal or any of       Randazzo's alleged crimes.     Mr. Speaker, FirstEnergy's plot was to foist its billion- dollar-plus corporate losses on the consumers of Ohio due to its  pitiful management of its two nuclear power plants in northern Ohio.  These are crimes.   While Randazzo was being indicted, the Federal Government moved to  claim an additional $6.5 million from FirstEnergy for this crime. We  should all be deeply disturbed that inherently dangerous nuclear assets  have been in the hands of criminals.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an editorial titled: ``Finally,  11 counts against ex-PUCO chief Sam Randazzo but why still none against  then-FirstEnergy officials whose fingerprints are all over the case?''              [From The Plain Dealer Cleveland, Dec. 6, 2023]    Finally, 11 Counts Against Ex-PUCO Chief Sam Randazzo But Why Still  None Against Then-FirstEnergy Officials Whose Fingerprints Are All Over                                 the Case?                            (By Editorial Board)         Monday's unsealing of an 11-count federal conspiracy,       bribery, wire fraud and embezzlement indictment against       former Public Utilities Commission of Ohio chief Samuel       Randazzo was a welcome sign of prosecutorial progress in the       FirstEnergy/House Bill 6 corruption case--but it's like the       first footfall in a long-delayed reckoning with some of the       key officials at the heart of the asserted conspiracy.        Our editorial board had repeatedly urged the U.S. Attorney       for Southern Ohio, Ken Parker, to explain publicly why such a       long delay in a case whose first arrests--of five Statehouse       figures, including now-convicted former House Speaker Larry       Householder and former Ohio Republican Party chair Matt       Borges--came more than three years ago.        And where is the second footfall--charges against any of       the FirstEnergy Corp. executives whose roles in paying out       the bribes and soliciting the corrupt actions by Randazzo and       others have been detailed in this and prior indictments?        The Randazzo indictment refers to now-departed Executives 1       and 2 at Akron-based FirstEnergy--former CEO Chuck Jones and       former Senior Vice President for External Affairs Michael       Dowling--as those with the primary contacts with Randazzo       over the $4,333,333 bribe FirstEnergy Corp. previously       admitted paying Randazzo in a 2021 deferred prosecution       agreement.        But they're clearly not the only FirstEnergy officials       privy to the laundry list of regulatory and legislative       favors Randazzo was helping the company secure, including a       lucrative decoupling accounting provision that PUCO staff       opposed, modifications to the state's ``significantly       excessive earnings test'' (SEET) that were added to the two-      year state budget, and ``burning'' of  [[Page H6154]]       a critical PUCO audit about FirstEnergy's distribution       modernization rider (DMR).        According to the Randazzo indictment, ``On or about March       4, 2020, Executive 1 messaged another Company A executive:       ``He [Randazzo] will get it done for us but cannot just       jettison all process. Says the combination of over ruling       Staff and other Commissioners on decoupling, getting rid of       SEET and burning the DMR final report has a lot of talk going       on in the halls of PUCO about does he work there or for us?       He'll move it as fast as he can. Better come up with a short       term work around.''        An indictment to shed light on the full scope of corruption       entailed in FirstEnergy's actions is needed.        It's possible Parker's delay in indicting Randazzo over       bribes long since acknowledged by FirstEnergy and favors that       have come into clearer light in civil cases was because he       hoped to turn others into cooperating witnesses--or Randazzo       into one himself.        Then there's the unexpected embezzlement charge against       Randazzo in the indictment, accusing him of defrauding       another client, the Industrial Energy Users-Ohio, a group of       big energy customers, of $1,104,598.        David DeVillers, the former U.S. Attorney for Southern Ohio       under whose leadership the corruption case was first       investigated and prosecuted, told cleveland.com's Jeremy       Pelzer, Andrew J. Tobias and Jake Zuckerman that the       embezzlement charge might have been the whammy in the mix,       taking time to sort out. ``It could be they dug into this       count, which seems to be completely different, and needed to       ferret that out to find out what that was all about,''       DeVillers told the reporters.        Either way, it is to be hoped that the indictment of       Randazzo will finally cause Parker to lift his effective hold       on important PUCO and other state-level investigations into       how both the PUCO and its processes, and the legislative       process separately, were so distorted and corrupted, so       reforms can be made. That's especially urgent given that       unrepealed parts of fatally tainted House Bill 6 right now       require electricity customers in Ohio to subsidize--to the       tune of more than $200 million so far, according to the Ohio       Office of Consumers' Counsel--two money-losing coal plants,       one in Indiana. Shining the full disinfectant of transparent       investigations on how all this came to be is a critical first       step to reform.     Mr. Speaker, since the Davis-Besse plant came online in  1977, its corporate leadership has never understood nuclear power or  its dangers. It is only the unionized workers that have saved our  lives. The plant shares an old Babcock-and-Wilcox design with the Three  Mile Island reactor that partially melted down in 1979. Another plant  with the design, the Rancho Seco plant in Sacramento, California,  permanently closed in 1989.   Davis-Besse itself is now nearly 50 years old and has a dismal  reputation within the industry and a history of too many close calls.  In 1985, the plant suffered a loss of the main and backup supplies of  cooling water because of a series of system failures, and this should  have been a wake-up call, but it went unheeded.   In 2002, we faced the worst nuclear safety incident since Three Mile  Island when a major hole was discovered in Davis-Besse's reactor head,  endangering the lives of millions of Ohioans and the purity of Lake  Erie. The plant's unionized workers again saved us all.   The Davis-Besse nuclear power plant, with its history of safety  violations and close calls, is a clear example of how corporate culture  can influence safety culture for the worst, and the industry around our  country never held them accountable.   The fines and penalties imposed on FirstEnergy have done little to  deter misconduct. It is time for us to take bold action and provide our  region with safe, advanced, modern power in a platform akin to the  Tennessee Valley Authority.   So much more needs to be done to make our communities safe and whole  from FirstEnergy's fraud, starting with making sure that the Benton- Carroll-Salem school system where Davis-Besse is located can be made  whole. The value of property in the region has gone down 90 percent,  which means the school system is going to be nearly $6 million short on  what it needs to teach the next generation.   I urge judges in the case to take the grid under FirstEnergy's  ownership under safe public conservatorship until a reliable operator  can be stood up.   May we find the wisdom and courage to confront these nuclear  challenges head-on to usher in a new era of clean and responsible  energy for the consumers and people of northern Ohio who have been  bilked so royally over the last nearly half century.                            ____________________
