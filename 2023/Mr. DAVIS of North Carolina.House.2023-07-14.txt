 Mr. Speaker, I rise to spotlight James  Bond, a native of Halifax County and the first African American from  the North Carolina Army National Guard Aviation Branch to become a  lieutenant colonel.  [[Page H3605]]    Lieutenant Colonel Bond has held many assignments in aviation,  including two company commands, and was selected as the battalion  commander of the 130th Attack Battalion.   Lieutenant Colonel Bond is a graduate of Halifax County Community  College and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he  was commissioned through the Reserves Officers Training Corps and  Branched Aviation.   He understands the next generation of eastern North Carolinians must  get involved to achieve the American Dream, particularly through public  service.   Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Colonel Bond's service to our country and  dedication to the next generation does not go unnoticed. We salute him  for his continued loyalty and commitment to the American people.                            ____________________
