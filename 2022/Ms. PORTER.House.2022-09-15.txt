 Mr. Speaker, more than 81,000 servicemembers have been  [[Page H7846]]  designated as prisoners of war or missing in action. On September 16,  National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we recognize their heroism.   Some of these great Americans are honored at memorials like the  Northwood Gratitude and Honor Memorial in my home community of Irvine.  I have proudly voted to invest in the Defense POW/MIA Accounting  Agency, which helps fulfill our Nation's promise to leave no  servicemember behind.   This key agency is responsible for returning the remains of our  troops to their loved ones and to a grateful Nation. Supporting our  Orange County veterans and their families is how we honor their  service. We cannot and will not forget our troops' sacrifices.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue working to protect their legacy.                            ____________________
