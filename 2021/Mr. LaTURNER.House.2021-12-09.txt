 Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor, remember, and  celebrate the life of a true American hero who was the very  personification of service.   I am proud and humbled to stand in for the over 700,000 Kansans in my  district who wish they could be in the Capitol today to pay tribute to  Senator Bob Dole.   Senator Dole grew up in a small town called Russell, Kansas, at a  time when many hardworking families were being burdened by the Great  Depression and the Dust Bowl. The Doles were not immune to these  hardships, living in their basement so they could rent out the top of  their house to make ends meet.   Bob Dole attended the University of Kansas where he was a star  athlete playing under the famous Phog Allen on the Jayhawks basketball  team and began his service when he enlisted in the Army.   Like many of the Greatest Generation, Bob Dole dropped everything at  the age of 21 when he was called to Active Duty and shipped off to  Italy to fight for freedom across the world.   Toward the end of the war, Senator Dole was struck in the upper back  and right arm by shrapnel from a German shell while fighting in the  mountains of northern Italy and was paralyzed from the neck down. He  was sent to the Percy Jones Army Hospital in Battle Creek, Michigan,  where he met some fellow soldiers who would have an impact on the rest  of his life.   They ended up calling themselves the Percy Jones Alumni Caucus, which  consisted of Senator Dole; the ward's ranking officer Colonel Philip  Hart, who later became Senator Phil Hart; and a longtime friend of Bob  Dole, Daniel Inouye, who represented Hawaii in the United States  Senate.   Many doctors, like Dr. Kelikian of Chicago, and medical professionals  [[Page H7625]]  thought Senator Dole wouldn't survive his injuries, and if he did, they  thought he would never walk again. But he proved them wrong.   The hospital was turned into a Federal building and renamed the Hart- Dole-Inouye Federal Center in 2003. Senator Dole spent the rest of his  life fighting for veterans and those who served our Nation and was  instrumental in making the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C., a  reality.   After being awarded two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star for his  selfless service in World War II, Senator Dole served in the Kansas  statehouse and as county attorney before being elected to the House of  Representatives where he served for 8 years. He then moved across the  Capitol to represent all Kansans in the United States Senate for almost  three decades, serving as Republican majority leader twice and then  becoming the Republican nominee for President in 1996.   Senator Dole was a giant in Congress. He fought to preserve freedom  and democracy while also working across the aisle to champion  legislation that has impacted millions of Americans from all walks of  life.                                time  1730    Many Americans know and recognize his major legislative achievements  such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the McGovern-Dole  International Food for Education Program, but many do not realize the  impact he had on passing legislation that his name was not on at all,  and how good he was at getting things done and moving the ball down the  field for Kansas and for our Nation. Bob Dole truly embodied what it  means to be a statesman and never wavered from his passion for a better  and stronger America.   I urge my colleagues to join me in praying for his wife, Elizabeth,  his daughter, Robin, and the entire Dole family as they mourn the loss  of not just one of our Nation's greatest public servants, but also a  devoted husband and father.   I want to close on something that Senator Dole once said. He said:  It's not who you were, it's whether you made a difference. May we all  remember that every single day in this building and across this  country.   Senator Dole will be dearly missed.
