 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment,  which is included in this bloc.   My amendment strikes language in the underlying bill which would  prevent the Securities and Exchange Commission from implementing  important reforms to the rules governing shareholder proposals.   The current rules, which haven't been updated since the Eisenhower  administration, allow activists to repeatedly resubmit divisive  proposals that have been rejected by a vast majority of shareholders.  In fact, many resubmissions received only a single-digit share of the  vote the year before.   A 2018 study of almost 2,500 activist shareholder proposals over  nearly two decades found that proposals that had been submitted three  or more times made up 32 percent of all the failed proposals. This can  have a significant negative impact on public companies which continue  to decline in number. Responding to each proposal takes time, and  companies are forced to deal with multiple resubmissions of failed  proposals each year. Importantly, this diverts the limited resources  away from growth, job creation, and innovation.   Especially in today's challenging economic environment, we should  support policies that encourage opportunity. The SEC's efforts to raise  the bar for resubmissions are a step forward for workers, investors,  and the health of our economy.
