 Madam President, Democrats have shamelessly alleged  that a massive Federal takeover of elections is needed because of  questions some Republicans raised after the 2020 election, so I come to  the floor today to show that this whole argument predates the 2020  election.   (Mr. BOOKER assumed the Chair.)   This Democrat reasoning is despite the fact that their proposal  predates the 2020 election. The bill that they want us to pass is a  product of concerns that the Democrats had about the 2016 election  being stolen from Hillary Clinton--also because of the 2018 elections.  And, in fact, the Democrat proposal was designed specifically to double  down on false claims that Democrats lost certain elections in 2018 only  because of rigged elections.   I have said it before, and I want to say it again: Evidence-free  claims of voter suppression are as bad as election-free claims of voter  fraud. Both voter fraud and discrimination in voting is illegal. Any  claim of voter fraud or violation of voting rights should be resolved  in our independent court system with evidence that can stand up in the  courts.   And as I have mentioned before, the claims by some Trump supporters  that a certain brand of voting machine-switched votes was lifted  entirely from the Democrats' 2004 playbook. And you may remember that  Democrat House Members challenged the electoral vote count of whether  George W. Bush was officially and honestly reelected. And President  Trump's questioning of his loss in Georgia was simply following in the  footsteps of the losing Democrat candidate for Governor of that State  just 2 years before who lost by a much bigger margin and never admitted  that defeat.   That makes me wonder if Democrats' professed outrage comes from a  sincere concern for Democratic reforms or if they are just upset that  President Trump stole their playbook.   If Democrats really want to preserve Democratic norms, they would not  be proposing the Federal Government overturning the current electoral  process in all 50 States, on a purely partisan basis, with no attempt  to even hear out Republicans' legitimate concerns.   The bills that we are talking about this week are being called  democracy reform. Does democracy need reform? I support the American  democratic system. It does not need a fundamental rewrite. The 240-year  history of our great country under this Constitution ought to support  that. It works, and it deserves our support. We should not denigrate  American democracy for short-term political gain.   President Trump's candidacy in 2016 brought many Americans to the  polls who had not voted recently, and there was a record turnout. In  2020, turnout broke the record yet again, both for the Republican Party  and the Democratic Party, and President Biden won that election.   In the 2021 election, there were unusually high turnouts for off-year  elections to the benefit of Republicans and conservatives. You saw  that, particularly in the State of Virginia, where the Republican  candidates statewide were victorious, and you saw some surprising  turnouts of opposition to Democrats who were reelected in the State of  New Jersey.   Democrats accuse Republicans of wanting to keep people from voting.  Why would we want to keep people from voting when we have been very  successful in many large turnout elections very recently?   Plus, have you seen the polls today that show dissatisfaction with  Democrats--a Republican deficit of five or seven points last year, with  positive Republican versus Democrat polls this year.   So we ought to stop casting doubt about American elections, stop  casting aspersions on commonsense election security measures like ID,  supported by overwhelming numbers of Americans of all backgrounds. And  by ``all backgrounds,'' I mean even people whom we classify as  minorities.   Let's work together to boost the confidence of all Americans in our  elections. Let's start rejecting claims that the only way the other  party can win is by rigging elections. Let's retire the short-term  strategy of falsely claiming that one of the two parties is a threat to  democracy. That, in and of itself, is a very undemocratic position to  take. This kind of rhetoric damages civil society and erodes faith in  our democracy. For the sake of our country, please stop it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, when Democrats last had the majority and  proposed blowing up the Senate rules and the historic way that the  Senate has worked, I gave a series of speeches explaining how the  father of the Constitution, James Madison, intended for the Senate to  be a deliberative body; in other words, a break on the hot passions  that occur in the House of Representatives. I repeated my deeply held  opposition to gutting the Senate process, even when my party took  control of all three branches--and it would have been politically  expedient in the short term.   I don't know how many times President Trump brought up doing away  with what we call the filibuster or the 60-vote requirement. It was  even followed by a lot of our Republican Party grassroots wanting to  overcome Democrats' use of the cloture rule to block the Republican  agenda during those 4 years. But I spoke out strongly against it.   In 2017, over half of the current Democrat Senators signed a letter  calling for preservation of the current rules requiring the 60 votes to  stop debate for considering the legislation, despite the use of the  nuclear option for nominees.   I agree with President Biden's position in 2005. Reflecting on the  same understanding that I have of the Constitution and the role of the  Senate as envisioned by James Madison, then-Senator Biden said this:         That is the . . . reason . . . we have the . . . rule. So       when one party . . . controls all levers of Government, one       man or one woman can stand on the floor of the Senate and       resist . . . the passions of the moment.    Even Senator Schumer, the majority leader, said, at that time,  gutting the cloture rule would be a ``doomsday for democracy''-- doomsday for democracy. Now it seems like Senator Schumer invites that  doomsday.  [[Page S237]]    Senator Durbin hit the nail on the head as recently as 2018, saying  it ``would be the end of the Senate as it was originally devised and  created going back to our Founding Fathers.'' I agreed then, and I  agree now.   Now the shoe is on the other foot, and Democrats have changed their  position, many not for the first time.   Senator Durbin has now joined the crusade of his Democratic  predecessor, Stephen Douglas, of Illinois--famous for debating Abraham  Lincoln on the issues of slavery. But that Douglas from Illinois also  proposed a Senate rule change allowing a narrow majority to force a  final vote on bills.   Hypocrisy is not rare in politics on both sides of the aisle, but the  fact that Democrats switched principles on such a consequential matter  whenever Senate control changes from one party to the other is  particularly glaring.   The party of Jim Crow, which made liberal use of so-called filibuster  just over a year ago to block Republicans' agenda, are now saying,  falsely, it is a relic of Jim Crow.   I do not see how they can look the voters in the eyes with no sign of  embarrassment. I do not understand why the policemen of our  governmental system--the media--isn't roasting them for this  hypocritical power grab.   I would now like to address a misconception on the cloture motion,  the 60-vote requirement. The cloture motion requires 60 votes to bring  consideration of legislation to finality. Just because it can be used  to block legislation, does not mean that the term ``cloture'' always  equals a filibuster.   Cloture cuts off not just debate but the offering of amendments.  Voting for cloture, also, is saying that the Senate has voted on enough  amendments. Senators who have amendments important to their State that  they want to offer should be voting against cloture to preserve their  right to offer amendments, as their constituents might desire. Debate  and amendments are the hallmark of this democracy, not an obstacle to  be swept aside in pursuit of a short-term partisan agenda.   When Democrats last controlled the Senate with 60 votes and  thereafter, amendment votes became very rare. Even rank-and-file  Democrats lost opportunities to represent their States with amendments  important to that State.   Let's look at the cloture issue another way. Also, many people  confuse debate over filibuster with talking nonstop to delay. That is a  kind of ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' filibuster--the famous movie,  you know. This has nothing to do with cloture. People who talk about  returning to the so-called talking filibuster are confusing two  different Senate rules, both called filibuster.   Senators have never had to talk until they dropped from exhaustion to  preserve their right to amend bills. So the talking filibuster rhetoric  is nonsense. Democrats have convinced themselves or at least their  activist base--and done it falsely--that our democracy is in crisis.  And so it is absurd to say only one party, unilateral governance, can  save democracy. But once an exception is made--and they are talking  about that exception just for this voting rights bill, but once an  exception is made to the right of all Senators to debate and to amend  legislation, there seems to be no going back.   Democrats learned that in 2013, when they accomplished the 60-vote  requirement on district and circuit court judges, and they lived to  regret it 4 years later when Republicans did the same thing when we had  a Supreme Court Justice up. It is a slippery slope that you should not  let come about.    I yield the floor.    I will.    Yes.    Remember what I said, and I just said this. So you  obviously heard me. We warned, in 2013, when I think all Republicans  voted against reducing the 60-vote threshold for district court and  circuit court judges, so you could pack the DC Circuit Court of  Appeals, that you would regret that, and you have regretted it because  Republicans were saying in 2017: What is good for the goose is good for  the gander. And we voted to reduce it then for a Supreme Court Justice.   Now, I am sure that, from your point of view, you have a Supreme  Court that is not very favorable to what you think a Supreme Court  ought to be doing, with the three people that Trump put on there. So  that is where I am coming from.    Do you know who held the Senate during that period of  time on the issue you brought up? It was Democratic Senators from the  South. Remember when the Civil Rights Act, in 1965, was passed, that  there was a higher share--a higher percentage--of Republicans than  Democrats that voted for it. The one person that made a difference in  getting the Civil Rights Act passed was Senator Dirksen, the Republican  leader.   I am going to have to end this discussion with you, but I want to say  one thing. Why would you want to expand this precedent that is set by  Democrats into legislation and weaken bipartisanship? That is where you  have to leave it. It is a slippery slope. You may intend to do it just  for a voting rights act, but it is going to go further.
