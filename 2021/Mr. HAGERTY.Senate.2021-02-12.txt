 Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Scott of South  Carolina and myself, I would like to submit a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee submits a  question.   The question is for counsel for the former President from Senators  Hagerty and Scott of South Carolina.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         Given that more than 200 people have been charged for their       conduct at the Capitol on January 6, that our justice system       is working to hold the appropriate persons accountable, and       that President Trump is no longer in office, isn't this       simply a political show trial that is designed to discredit       President Trump and his policies and shame the 74 million       Americans who voted for him?    Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Counsel is recognized.   Mr. Counsel CASTOR. Thank you, Senators, for that question. That is  precisely what the 45th President believes this gathering is about.   We believe in law and order and trust that the Federal authorities  that are conducting investigations and prosecutions against the  criminals that invaded this building will continue their work and be as  aggressive and thorough as we know them to always be and that they will  continue to identify those that entered the inner sanctum of our  government and desecrated it.   The 45th President no longer holds office, and there is no sanction  available under the Constitution, in our view, for him to be removed  from the office that he no longer holds. The only logical conclusion is  that the purpose of this gathering is to embarrass the 45th President  of the United States and in some way try to create an opportunity for  Senators to suggest that he should not be permitted to hold office in  the future or, at the very least, publicize this throughout the land to  try to damage his ability to run for office when and if he is acquitted  and, at the same time, tell the 74 million people who voted for him  that their choice was the wrong choice.   I believe that this is a divisive way of going about handling  impeachment, and it denigrates the great solemnity that should attach  to such proceedings.   I yield the remainder of my time, Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.
