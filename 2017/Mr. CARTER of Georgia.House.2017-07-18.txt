 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Scott Waldrup who was a victim of violent crime during the Fourth of  July festivities in Savannah, Georgia.   A Cary, North Carolina, native, Mr. Waldrup came to Savannah in 2011  to join the city's booming food service industry. He tirelessly worked  in the industry until he became the general manager at one of  Savannah's most popular restaurants, The Grey.   Mr. Waldrup certainly never knew a stranger. His family and friends  described him as being adventurous and bold, yet caring and selfless.   During the violence in Savannah that night, Mr. Waldrup selflessly  helped others to safety until he was hit by the gunman's car during a  police chase to apprehend the criminal. By all accounts, Mr. Waldrup  was a hero.   I wish his family, his friends, and his coworkers the best during  this very, very difficult time. I will certainly be thinking about all  of them.   I encourage others to learn from Mr. Waldrup's example and hope his  life serves as a reminder of the tragedies involved in violent crime  and deter others from acting violently and recklessly.                            ____________________
