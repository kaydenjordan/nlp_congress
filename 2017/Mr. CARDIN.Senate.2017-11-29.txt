 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for most of my time here in the U.S.  Senate, I have been on the Senate Finance Committee, which deals with  our Tax Code. For most of my time in the House of Representatives, I  served on the House Ways and Means Committee, which dealt with our Tax  Code.   Quite frankly, I thought that there were three guiding principles in  regard to tax reform that both Democrats and Republicans felt were  essential and that, really, I thought were beyond being controversial.  That is, if we are going to have tax relief, the focus must be on the  middle class; that in today's economic circumstances, we would not want  to have tax reform add to the deficit; and that we need to use an open  process--a bipartisan process--for tax reform so that we have the  opportunity for all stakeholders to understand exactly what we are  doing so that we don't have any unintended consequences. As I look at  the bill that is being brought to the floor by the Senate Budget  Committee, it violates all three of these basic principles.    First, with regard to providing relief to middle-income taxpayers,  the Joint Committee on Taxation has looked at this bill, and that is  the objective scorekeeper. Some may not like what  [[Page S7384]]  they say, but we have to acknowledge that these are the objective  numbers that look at exactly who benefits from the tax provisions. It  is an interesting analysis that they do about those who are in the top  income tax brackets, and we are using about half a million people. In  2019 this group of half a million people will receive $34 billion in  tax relief--half a million taxpayers. In that same year, those  taxpayers who have income under $50,000, which amounts to about 90  million taxpayers in this country or about 180 times the number of  people, will receive about 30 percent of the amount of benefits, about  $14 billion in that year. That analysis does not take into  consideration who benefits from the estate tax changes in the bill that  is going to be brought before us. I must say that I doubt there are any  taxpayers under $50,000 a year who would benefit from increasing the $4  million base that we currently have in our estate tax. The Joint  Committee on Taxation did not include the impact of the repeal of the  individual mandate for health coverage, which affects the funds going  into health premium support and Medicaid which, again, goes to lower  income families. The figures I just provided are conservative figures.  It is much more skewed toward higher income than even the committee's  analysis for 2019.   Let me point out one more issue about this number. Year 2019 is the  most favorable year for middle-income taxpayers. It gets worse every  year thereafter. The bill is not targeted toward middle income. It is  targeted to the wealthy.   Look at some of the reasons. The estate tax repeal helps wealthy  people. The alternative minimum tax--those in the highest incomes who  are required to pay some taxes--is repealed. There is the fact that the  business tax relief is made permanent but the individual relief has a  sunset and terminates after 8 years.   So the Congressional Budget Office has told us exactly who will pay  more taxes. This is interesting. In 2019, those at the lowest income  tax brackets, or under $30,000, will actually pay more taxes. They are  not getting a tax cut. If you look at 2021, 2 years later, those under  $40,000 are going to pay more taxes. If you go all the way up to 2027,  for those earning under $75,000, the majority will pay more taxes. So  as to this bill, which is being advertised by my Republican colleagues  as benefitting all taxpayers, know that it doesn't benefit all  taxpayers.   In my State, it is estimated that 800,000 Marylanders will pay more  taxes under this bill in 2027. It particularly affects those in middle  income who are going to be put at a disadvantage. The people who are  protected are those at the high income level. To add one more  complication to middle-income taxpayers, there is also not even a  subtle attack on Medicaid, Medicare, and other programs that are  important for middle-income families. Job training programs dealing  with education, et cetera, are all going to be jeopardized because of  the way this bill is funded.   On the first test, is this bill aimed at middle-income taxpayers? The  answer is no. It fails.   On the second test, are we financing this tax cut by increasing the  debt, asking our children and grandchildren to pay for this tax cut?  The answer is clearly yes. By its own admission, the budget  instructions tell us that we are going to have a $1.5 trillion deficit  as a result of this tax bill, and that is not the whole picture. We  know there is at least $1.5 trillion of new debt if this bill becomes  law, but as I am sure my colleagues are aware, there are many  provisions in this bill that have sunsets--that terminate--but it is  anticipated that those sunsets will be extended. For example, in the  business expensing or the credits for family medical leave, many people  are advertising this as just a way of fitting a more expensive bill  into a $1.5 trillion deficit and not making it larger, but in reality,  when extending those extenders, we find that the deficit will be half a  trillion dollars more. We are talking about a $2 trillion hole in the  deficit. To make matters even worse, we have a trigger that is being  recommended that is in the bill itself, but that trigger will extend  more tax relief, not less. So this bill fails in the second basic test,  and that is because it creates a major hole in the deficit.   The third test is whether this is truly an open bipartisan process.  Here no one can say with a straight face that the answer is yes. The  majority, the Republicans, are using reconciliation, which is by  definition a partisan process. There is no real opportunity for open  debate or hearings or amendments. The amendments are all contrived  under the reconciliation restrictions.   Does anyone here believe that at the end of the day the majority  leader is not going to offer a new bill at the eleventh hour with no  time to debate, where we vote up or down, which will be the final  product that we are being asked to approve?   So on all three tests this bill coming out of the Budget Committee  fails. But then it goes beyond that. There was a late addition in the  Senate Finance Committee that repealed the individual mandate under the  Affordable Care Act. Now, quite frankly, one would wonder how would  that ever get put into a tax bill? Why would this be put into a tax  bill? The Congressional Budget Office tells us that it will add 13  million Americans to the uninsured rolls by 2027. These 13 million  individuals will not be able to get access to quality healthcare. If  they run into a major health episode, they are going either to have to  sell all of their assets or go into bankruptcy or be denied care. I  think we should be concerned about those 13 million. In addition, these  individuals who don't have health insurance and don't have a doctor end  up in emergency rooms for care, which is more expensive. Guess who pays  the bill? We all do. We pay for it through higher hospital rates. Those  of us who have insurance and who pay our bills are going to be paying  for those who don't pay their bills. So the fact that we are  eliminating the individual mandate doesn't just affect 13 million  people. It does affect those 13 million, and it affects all of us who  will be paying more through cost shifting.   Quite frankly, what is really aggravating is that it is in the bill  getting scored as a tax savings--as more revenue coming in. It is more  revenue coming as we spend less on healthcare subsidies, less on  Medicaid, and the bill spends that money. So we are using cuts to  middle-income families in healthcare to finance permanent tax relief  for businesses in this country. Where are our priorities? That makes no  sense whatsoever   There are individual changes that are being recommended in this bill  that are going to have very dire consequences. I will just mention one.  I spent a good deal of my life in public office at the State level, and  I believe very much in federalism. I believe that State legislators are  trying to do what is right for their taxpayers as we are trying to do  what is right for the same taxpayers. Federalism says that we respect  each level of government, but by eliminating the State and local tax  deductions, we are telling taxpayers that they have to pay taxes on  taxes, that we don't respect our State and local governments, and that  you can no longer deduct your State taxes or local property taxes.  Again, that is an insult to the Constitution and to federalism. It  also, by the way, will hurt taxpayers.   In my own State, almost 50 percent of Marylanders use the State and  local tax deductions. If the Senate bill becomes law, all of them will  lose that ability to deduct State and local taxes on their Federal  income tax returns. It will affect the ability of our States and local  governments to finance the necessary functions of government, whether  it is to keep people safe or whether it is to provide schools for our  children.   I heard from people this last weekend from different charitable  groups who told me that if the Senate bill becomes law, it will have a  dramatic impact on private giving, because under the Senate bill, only  5 percent of the taxpayers in this country will be able to get a tax  deduction from charitable contributions. Think about that for one  moment.   We pride ourselves in the services that are provided by the private  sector, services in healthcare, education, social services, and the  arts. All of that depends on the generosity of private givers. Yet we  are saying that only 5 percent of the population in this country will  have any tax incentive to give charitable gifts. That will have a major  [[Page S7385]]  negative impact on charitable contributions.   Then, there is the value of the credit that we have out there for  economic growth. I am very proud of the public-private partnerships we  have in Maryland. I am sure my colleagues are proud of those public- private partnerships in Pennsylvania and in every State in this  country, but the credits we give are going to be worth a lot less if  the Senate bill becomes law, making it much more difficult to put  together a venture that can redevelop vulnerable communities around our  Nation.   Let me just add one or two points before yielding the floor. What I  think we all want to accomplish in tax reform is to have a tax code  that is simpler and is predictable. That is not happening with the bill  that is being recommended by the Budget Committee.   So many provisions are temporary. It is a partisan process. It  doesn't simplify the Tax Code, and there certainly is not going to be  predictability on provisions that have sunset termination dates.   The final bill could even be much worse. As I said, the bill coming  out of the Budget Committee that is getting all this attention is  certainly not going to be the bill that we vote on at the end of the  day--sometime, as I have been told. It could be as early as tomorrow.  It is going to be a different bill.   It is being negotiated now in closed sessions with Republicans  meeting, trying to get their last couple of votes. We don't know what  the changes will be, but at the end of the day, we know we are going to  be presented with a different bill. But that is not going to be the  final bill because then it will go to the House and there will be  additional changes. There are measures in the House that have many of  us upset, such as this: Are we not able to deduct medical expenses if  we have an extraordinary need in the family? In the House bill you  cannot deduct those expenses. Student loan interest costs cannot be  deducted in the House bill. Are they going to end up in the final vote  we are going to be called to vote upon in the Senate?   One thing is clear. The bill is only going to get worse and get more  expensive, and it is going to cause greater damage to an already too- large deficit.   There is a better way. There is a better way, and that is true  bipartisanship. Let's come together and work together.   I am very proud of the work I have done here in my career in the  Senate and the House. In the House I worked with then-Congressman  Portman, and the two of us worked together with stakeholders to change  our retirement policies for retirement savings. We were able to get  bills not only enacted but made permanent. Even though we didn't have  the political support of our leadership, we had the support of the  American people, we had a bipartisan process, we used all of the  stakeholders, and we came to good policy changes. More people have  retirement savings as a result of those efforts. That is the type of  effort we need to put on for tax reform--Democrats and Republicans  working together so we can have a predictable tax code moving forward.   There is a better way for job growth in this country. I heard my  Republican friends say this bill will create up to a million jobs--$1.5  to $2 trillion creating 1 million jobs?   We had a bill in the last Congress that we could revise immediately  to take the repatriation funds--that is the corporate money that is  locked overseas--and bring it back here. I will submit an amendment to  the Senate Finance Committee to try to get this done. A couple hundred  billion dollars could come back into this country. We could use that  for infrastructure, which creates 4 to 5 million jobs for a fraction of  the cost. We could do much better in job creation than spending this  type of money for the type of jobs that are predicted.   I started by saying I thought one of the guiding principles is to  help middle-class families. This bill doesn't do it. Let's join  together, Democrats and Republicans, and do what is right for middle- income taxpayers in this country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize World AIDS Day.  There was a time when Congress could put bitter partisan rancor and  finger-pointing blame games aside and unite-around a cause. We did so  to fight HIV/AIDS globally. Since 2003, the President's Plan for  Emergency AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, has meant the difference between life  and death for millions of people. In fact, just last year, I met a 30- year-old man named Simon in Namibia who said he would not be alive  without the international community's HIV/AIDS assistance. With the  generous support of the American people, the U.S. Government has  committed more than $70 billion to bilateral HIV/AIDS programs; the  Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and bilateral  tuberculosis programs since the program's inception.   We cannot declare victory yet--far from it. Only one-half of the 37  million people in the world living with HIV are receiving treatment.  Globally, young women are twice as likely to acquire HIV as their male  counterparts. One million people still died from AIDS-related illnesses  worldwide in 2016. Let us not forget that people here in the United  States are not immune. In Maryland, for instance, the most recent data  indicate that, in 2016, almost 36,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS,  and the State had the fifth highest rate of new HIV infections in the  country.   For the past 15 years, Congress has shown strong commitment and moral  leadership by providing robust funding for PEPFAR and regularly  reauthorizing the program. Signals from the Trump administration,  however, indicate that this partnership may be fraying, putting lives  and epidemic control at risk.   President Trump's fiscal year 2018 budget request proposed cutting  funding for PEPFAR and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and  Malaria by more than $1 billion. These cuts, if enacted, could deny  lifesaving treatment to men, women, and children. These cuts, if  enacted, could halt our progress to achieving epidemic control. These  cuts, if enacted, will harm millions of people.   Congress must remain resolved not only to protect our investment, but  to continue building on our progress thus far.   I call on the Trump administration to join us in facing the challenge  of HIV/AIDS head-on, without politics and without posturing, as we  consider PEPFAR reauthorization. The administration's proposal to  extend the Mexico City policy, often referred to as the global gag  rule, may hamstring the very organizations providing lifesaving  prevention, detection, and treatment services.   The Trump administration's proposal to cut tuberculosis funding by  more than 25 percent, if enacted, will further frustrate efforts to  raise resources to combat this global killer; TB is the world's leading  infectious disease killer and is the primary cause of death for people  coinfected with HIV/AIDS. Instead of proposing cuts, the Trump  administration should be demonstrating continued support for the Global  Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Global Fund has saved 22  million lives since it was established. Currency fluctuations are  complicating U.S. contributions to the Global Fund and, according to  some estimates, could lead to U.S. funding being cut dear by up to $450  million in fiscal year 2019. We absolutely cannot allow such a thing to  happen.   World AIDS Day should be a day of sober commemoration; but it should  also be a day of hope. Success in the fight against HIV/AIDS is within  our grasp.   Amid today's tweetstorms and controversies, it is easy to overlook  the  [[Page S7405]]  fact that, when this body is at its best, it has the power to change  the course of history. Success is possible. Cutting funding now-- shrinking from our commitment now, instead of sustaining it--will  negate the investments and progress we have made so far. We owe it to  people like Simon, to their families, and to millions of others dealing  with the scourge of HIV/AIDS to keep working toward a world free of the  disease.                            ____________________
