 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague,  Mr. Cicilline, for the opportunity.   Madam Speaker, I am a proud ally and member of the Congressional  LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus. Why? I will share with you a brief vignette.   When I was a much younger person, I had a friend whose name was Glen.  Glen was small in stature. He never bothered anybody. He was friendly,  gregarious; very much outgoing. I didn't understand Glen, but I had  friends who thought they understood him.   My friends, Mr. Cicilline, would pick on Glen. They called him queer.  They invited him to do things that were unacceptable. I never spoke up  for Glen. I saw him and left. I had the opportunity to take a stand for  justice and against hate.   My friend, Glen, has gone on to glory, and I have allowed his memory  to haunt me because of my failure to do what I could easily have done.  I am an ally because I have seen the behavior of people who disrespect  the humanity that every person merits by virtue of just being born.  That is all.   The Constitution recognizes my rights, recognizes your rights. It  doesn't grant us a right, and we didn't recognize Glen's rights.   As a result, I will probably do many things in life to try to make up  for my failure at a time when someone needed me and I could have been  there, and I wasn't.                                time  1945    So to my friend Glen, I have introduced the LGBTQIA+ Pride Month  Resolution. It encourages the celebration of the month of June as  LGBTQIA+ Pride Month, and it tracks the accomplishments and milestones  in the fight for LGBTQIA+ equality. It has 102 original cosponsors.   I have done more than this. I have introduced H.R. 166, the Fair  Lending for All Act. This piece of legislation passed the House  recently, by the way, as part of the Financial Services Racial Equity,  Inclusion, and Economic Justice Act. This piece of legislation would  clarify and extend antidiscrimination laws to include sexual  orientation and gender identity.   I thank the Honorable Maxine Waters for helping to bring this  legislation to the floor. In fact, but for her, it would not have been  to the floor for the vote that it received.   Here is the most significant aspect of the legislation. Not only does  it indicate that you can't discriminate based upon sexual orientation  or gender identity; it makes it a crime to do so--a crime to do so.  Some things bear repeating. It can serve as a mnemonic device. It makes  it a crime to do so.  [[Page H5816]]    If the banks are defrauded, you, as a citizen, can be fined up to $1  million. Nothing comparable to this exists if a person happens to have  a gender identity or sexual orientation that is unacceptable to a loan  officer, and the loan officer concludes that you are not worthy of a  loan that you are qualified for in all other ways. If this bill passes  the Senate, not only will it be a crime, but you will do time if you  are found guilty, and you will have to pay a fine.   There are some things that we ought not tolerate in life, and that is  invidious discrimination against anyone. We ought not tolerate it  because if you tolerate it, you perpetuate it.   To my friend Glen, I want you to know that I am still in the struggle  that you caused me to realize was more than just a bunch of guys having  fun playing pranks on another person.   Finally, I am not sure where this country is going because, in the  State of Texas, the Republican platform indicates that there are but  two gender identities: You are either a biological male, or you are a  biological female. This is in the Republican platform. I don't know  where we are going, but it is not in the right direction because you  are denying, by virtue of this kind of platform, the identity of  transgender people.   Who are you to tell other people who they are? You tried it with me.  When I was born, I was a Negro. It wasn't my decision. It wasn't my  mother's decision. You denied me of my cultural integrity. You are  still up to your old tricks, demeaning others to somehow conclude that  it is better for you.   I don't know where we are going, but we are going in the wrong  direction. We ought not let the State of Texas do this without some  rebuff, some indication that we won't tolerate it because it is but a  harbinger of things to come. This is the State of Texas where a lot of  unpleasant things are born.   The State of Texas also wants to repeal the Voting Rights Act of  1965. The State of Texas wants to secede from the Union. I understand  these things, but I don't understand denying a person's identity.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Cicilline for the time. I am an ally, and  I am a friend you can count on. I will not allow myself to fail to  speak up ever again in life when it comes to injustice against anybody.  Dr. King was right: ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice  everywhere.''
