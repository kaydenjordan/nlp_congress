 Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, February 13, a  catastrophic tragedy took place in a close-knit eastern North Carolina  community.   A small plane carrying eight passengers, including four teenagers,  crashed into the Atlantic Ocean about 4 miles east of the Drum Inlet.  Tragically, all eight North Carolinians perished in the crash.   There are no words to describe the pain and devastation that our  community has felt in the weeks following this tragic accident. Yet,  through this heartbreak we have all been moved by the outpouring of  love and support from all of those across North Carolina and our great  Nation.   We cannot thank our first responders, U.S. Coast Guard, the Carteret  County Sheriff's Office, State agencies, and community members enough  for coming together in support of the families impacted by this  heartbreaking tragedy.   Members of our community have participated in many loving tributes to  honor those we lost. I am grateful to the volunteers, ministers,  students, teachers, parents, grandparents, friends, and classmates who  are helping to provide aid and support, as well as comfort to our Down  East residents. Their selflessness and commitment to others is to be  commended, and I honor their service.   We will always remember the beloved North Carolinians whom we lost:  Douglas Hunter Parks, 45, from Sea Level, North Carolina; Stephanie Ann  McInnis Fulcher, 42, from Sea Level, North Carolina; Jeffrey  Worthington Rawls, 28, from Greenville, North Carolina; Ernest ``Teen''  Rawls, pilot, 67, Greenville, North Carolina; Jonathan Kole McInnis,  15, Sea Level, North Carolina; Jacob Nolan Taylor, 16, Atlantic, North  Carolina; Noah Lee Styron, 15, Cedar Island, North Carolina; and  Michael Daily Shepard, 15, Atlantic, North Carolina.  [[Page H1285]]    Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask for a moment of silence to remember  those who perished on that fateful day.                            ____________________
