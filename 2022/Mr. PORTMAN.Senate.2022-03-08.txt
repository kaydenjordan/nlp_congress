 Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from my  colleague from Rhode Island. I would say ``all of the above'' energy,  so I do support the energy efficiency he was talking about and other  opportunities to ensure we have the ability to be energy independent.  But at a time when the price per gallon is over $4, on average, we also  need to produce more in this country.   And here we are at a time where we have an Executive order from the  President, saying we are going to freeze all leases on public lands and  waters. We have an Executive order from the President, obviously,  stopping Keystone XL Pipeline.   We have an Executive action by the President to rewrite the policies  with regard to permitting that are in the waters of the United States  that are very important to energy projects. So we have got to do it all  because, otherwise, without certainty, we are not going to get the oil  and gas production we should have here to be able to substitute what we  are getting from places like Russia.   The President did the right thing by banning the Russian oil, but we  ought to also be doing the right thing with regard to North American  production.   I stand today to support the Postal Service bill that is before us.  We are nearing the end of a long journey to help the Postal Service and  to help the Postmaster General to be able to implement needed reforms.   Last year, Senator Peters--who I see is on the floor here--and I  introduced the Senate version of the Postal Reform Act. We had 28  cosponsors, equally divided between Republicans and Democrats.   Why? Because the Postal Service is not a partisan issue. It is  something that all of us should agree on. We need to save our Postal  Service; otherwise, we are going to be in big trouble. In the next few  years, I believe it would go insolvent otherwise. I believe we would be  here talking about a big bailout. This is not a bailout. In fact, there  is no appropriation in this legislation.   The post office is really important to my constituents--young, old,  rural, urban, everybody. That is why we have seen such strong  bipartisan support when this bill passed the House of Representatives  by a vote of 342 to 92--that rarely happens in the House--and strong  bipartisan support last night when the Senate cloture vote was 74 to  17.   Saving the post office is the right thing to do. Let's face it. The  fact of the matter is, the Postal Service is delivering less and less  more profitable first-class mail to more and more places. That economic  model just does not work, and that is a recipe for ruin if we don't  adjust to this new reality and make some necessary changes.   Is it hard to make changes? Of course, it is, but it is the right  thing to do. We have talked about it for years here. Finally, we came  together, Republican and Democrat, neither of us got exactly what we  wanted, both had to make concessions, but we were actually doing the  right thing for the country here in saving the post office.   And I regularly hear about this from my constituents across Ohio; I  am sure you hear the same. You hear it from your veterans. You hear it  from some of your rural residents who depend on the post office for a  lot, including their lifesaving medications. Families rely on the post  office to deliver their rent checks on time, to pay their utility  bills, to get their Social Security checks.   In Ohio, we have got no-excuse absentee voting. That has worked  really well for over a decade now. But if you are a voter in Ohio, you  want to get your application in time, and you want to get your ballot  in, in time. That all depends on the post office. Small businesses in  Ohio reach their customers primarily through direct mail now; that is  through the post office.   So this is really important that we put the post office on a sound  financial footing. And, by the way, it can't be done just with an act  of Congress.   What we are doing is complementing what the Postmaster General and  the postal Board is doing in terms of serious reforms at the post  office. They work together. In fact, the Postmaster General said this  bill he strongly supports because it gives him the headroom he needs,  the financial breathing room he needs to make the other important  reforms to save the post office.   What do we do? First, we eliminate a very burdensome prefunding  requirement for retiree health benefits. Congress mandated this a  decade or so ago. Regardless of age, current employees have to be  prefunded. This has crippled the post office financially. By the way,  no other Federal Agency has to do this, and private sector companies  don't do this. This is prefunding. The money will be there, but it is a  matter of having to prefund it that is crippling the post office  financially.   Second, we require the post office employees who are retiring, who  have been paying into Medicare their entire careers, to enroll in  Medicare Part B and to access Part D--something, by the way, that  almost every private sector employer does. They are already in Part A.   Third, we require the Postal Service to maintain its current standard  of a 6-day-a-week delivery through an integrated delivery network of  mail and packages together so that those who rely on the Postal Service  for their medications and other important needs are properly served.  That 6-day-a-week delivery, by the way, is really important to my  constituents and to a lot of your constituents if you talk to them  about it, particularly in the rural areas.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that after all of this,  this bill will result in a savings to the taxpayer. The savings over  the next 10 years is $1.5 billion.   I would also like to note what this bill does not do because there  has been  [[Page S1046]]  some misinformation out there. One, it does not appropriate new funds  to the post office, period. Two, it does not change the accounting or  costing structure for packages and letters so it does not disadvantage  private-sector carriers. That is very important to me. This is the  status quo that we are putting in place here. It does not change the  accounting or costing structure for packages and letters.    Third, it does not allow the Postal Service to enter into new  commercial services like postal banking. That is also very important to  me.   And contrary to the claims of this bill's opponents, this bill does  not impact the solvency of the Medicare hospital trust fund. That is  the trust fund we all talk about. It is going belly-up in 2026. It does  not affect it, period. CBO has actually written us something saying  that, but it just makes sense. People are already in Part A. And this  bill does not increase the Medicare Part B and Part D premiums based on  the CBO analysis. Why? Partly because it is such a small number of  people. Only 25 percent of postal employees were not already in Part B  and Part D, so additional ones make very little difference. But part of  it is they are paying their premiums.   So let's pass this bill. We also have a budget point of order before  us that is coming up next. I want to be clear, again, CBO's estimated  $1.5 billion savings over the 10-year budget window that we have to use  around here. However, CBO has estimated that this legislation would  likely increase on budget deficits by $5 billion or more in at least  one of the four 10-year periods beginning in 2032.   I would like to make three quick points: First, none of this deficit  is related to the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund for Part A.  Again, that is the trust fund that we talk about a lot here because we  are concerned about it, and it could be exhausted as early as 2026. CBO  has said that trust fund will not be affected. Second, CBO's deficit  only addresses on-budget direct spending. It actually excludes all  future savings to the post office, which are off-budget.   Let me give you an example of that. The premiums that Postal Service  employees are going to pay, that is not part of the calculation.   Third, and finally, this budget point of order ignores that postal  workers are entitled to Medicare Part B and Part D like any other  eligible American worker. The bill simply requires future Postal  Service retirees to access these benefits; the 25 percent that don't  already do it. Private-sector employers require their retirees to do  the same thing. Of course, no one raises these budget points of orders  on them.   Right now, the post office is in trouble, folks, and if we don't do  something and do something significant, working with the post office to  make their own internal reforms, we are going to be in big trouble as I  said earlier.   Let's move forward on this bill. Let's make sure the post office is  healthy going forward for all of our constituents.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise in support of the Postal Service  bill before us. It is important reform. People know this needs to be  done. The vote in the House of Representatives was 342 to 92. It has to  be done because the Postal Service's business model just doesn't work-- having to deliver more and more packages and fewer and fewer more  profitable first-class mail pieces to more and more addresses. So we  have got to do something to reform it.   Let me tell you what this bill does do and what it doesn't do--first  of all, what it does not do. It is not an appropriation, so there is no  money here going into the Postal Service from the taxpayer. It does not  change the accounting or the cost structure for packages and letters.  That way, it does not disadvantage the private sector carriers some  were worried about. It also does not allow the Postal Service to enter  into new commercial services like postal banking that we are against.  Contrary to claims of some of the opponents, it actually does not  impact the solvency of the trust fund. So the Medicare hospital trust  fund we all worry about, predicted to expire in about 2026, this does  not affect it at all. Postal Service employees are already in Part A.  And it does not increase the Part B or the Part D premiums.   What this does do is it saves the post office, which is incredibly  important to all of our constituents--to our veterans who get their  prescription drugs through the mail, to people who are voting by mail,  and to people who are relying on the Postal Service to provide them  with what they need to be able to survive.   This is an important bill that has been worked on for 15 years. I  thank my colleague Senator Peters from Michigan for working on a  bipartisan basis on this.   Let's get it done tonight.    Madam President, I am proud to be a champion of the  Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act--or HABHRCA-- program. The program was first created in 1998 to help address harmful  algal blooms in water bodies across the country. Congress recognized  the devastating impact of harmful algal blooms, both ecologically and  economically, and the importance of providing resources to the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to advance scientific  understanding of harmful algal blooms, as well as the ability to  detect, monitor, assess, and predict bloom events.   In 2014 and again in 2018, I worked with then-Senator Bill Nelson to  reauthorize the program in a bipartisan way. And in the 2014  legislation, I worked to ensure that freshwater bodies, specifically  the Great Lakes, were a focus for the program for the first time. Since  then, I have worked to secure funding for the HABHRCA program through  the annual appropriations process.   I am pleased to report that, today, NOAA's work through the HABHRCA  program is being used by my constituents and others across the Great  Lakes basin. For example, I hear from the fishing and charter boat  industries that they rely on NOAA's biweekly forecasts to monitor the  location of the blooms so they know what areas of the lake to avoid in  order to continue operating their tourism and fishing businesses.   It also helps our drinking water systems prevent contamination in  drinking water because they are able to anticipate additional treatment  needs if the location of the bloom is near a water intake valve. This  will help prevent crises similar to the 2014 water crisis in Toledo,  OH, in which nearly half a million people lost access to safe drinking  water because a harmful algal bloom contaminated the city's water  supply.   As cochair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, I am committed to  ensuring our Great Lakes communities have the resources they need to  create jobs and protect the water quality and health of the lakes.   My colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio, has a bill that would amend  the HABHRCA program to require NOAA to conduct harmful algal bloom and  hypoxia work specifically for the South Florida ecosystem. I am  supportive of this legislation and of efforts to address harmful algal  blooms across the country, so long as it does not take away or divert  resources that are used in the Great Lakes.   To that end, I ask for unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record a letter from NOAA Administrator Spinrad committing that the  work done in South Florida, such as would be the case with passage of  Senator Rubio's legislation, S. 66, the South Florida Clean Coastal  Waters Act, would have no impact on the resources and work currently  being conducted to support the Great Lakes.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      March 3, 2022.      Hon. Robert Portman,      Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and           Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Portman: Thank you for your letter regarding       the importance of maintaining harmful algal bloom (HAB) and       hypoxia research and monitoring activities in the Great Lakes       region. I appreciate the discussion that you and I had about       this issue last week.        As you know, NOAA has monitored and forecast cyanobacteria       bloom location and concentration in Lake Erie since 2009. The       early seasonal ``rolling'' outlook beginning in May estimates       bloom severity based on measurements of phosphorous loading       from the Maumee River combined with long-range forecasts and       historical records. The Lake Erie HAB Seasonal Forecast       issued in early summer allows coastal managers, lake users,       and drinking water facility operators to make informed       decisions based on the potential severity of the bloom. In       addition, the Lake Erie HAB forecast issued twice a week       during bloom season (July-October) provides the current bloom       extent and 5-day outlooks of where the bloom will travel and       what concentrations are likely to be seen, allowing managers       to determine whether to take preventive actions.        As we discussed, NOAA is committed to continuing this       important work and to pursuing improvements to Lake Erie HAB       detection, monitoring, and forecasting to keep communities in       the Great Lakes region safe. Additional proposals to complete       HABs work in the South Florida ecosystem will not impact the       resources necessary for Great Lakes HABs work through the       Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of       1998. The President's Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request       includes an increase for NOAA's Coastal Science and       Assessment programs that, if appropriated, will support these       efforts and build capacity in other areas.        We appreciate your interest and look forward to our       continued partnership. If you have further questions, please       contact Makeda Okolo, Director of NOAA's Office of       Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs.            Sincerely,      Dr. Richard W. Spinrad,        Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and       NOAA Administrator.
