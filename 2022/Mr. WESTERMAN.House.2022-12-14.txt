 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the exemplary work  and upcoming retirement of Joe Liles, a law enforcement officer with  the Ouachita National Forest.   Joe has faithfully served Arkansas for 30 years, going above and  beyond in each mission to loyally serve the people of Arkansas.   Throughout his successful career, Joe received many awards, including  the ``Delivering Benefits to the Public'' award at the 2019 Regional  Foresters Honor Awards for his heroic efforts in locating and  recovering a lost hiker in the Caney Creek Wilderness.   Joe's humble nature and hardworking spirit made him a vital part of  the Ouachita National Forest. I speak for all Arkansans when I say  thank you for your service and wish you the best in retirement.                            ____________________
