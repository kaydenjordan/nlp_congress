 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1033) to amend titles 5 and 28, United States Code, to  require the maintenance of databases on, awards of fees and other  expenses to prevailing parties in certain administrative proceedings  and court cases to which the United States is a party, and for other  purposes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1033, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I begin by thanking Representative Doug Collins of Georgia and the  Constitution and Civil Justice Subcommittee Ranking Member Steve Cohen  of Tennessee for introducing this important government transparency  legislation.   Every year, pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, the Federal  Government, through settlement or court order, pays millions of dollars  in legal fees and costs to parties to lawsuits and administrative  adjudications that involve the Federal Government.   However, despite the large amount of taxpayer dollars paid out each  year, the Federal Government no longer comprehensively keeps track of  the amount of fees and other expenses awarded pursuant to the Equal  Access to Justice Act, nor does the government compile and report on  why these fees and expenses were paid and to whom these costs were  awarded.   This is because, in 1995, Congress repealed the Department of  Justice's reporting requirements and defunded the Administrative  Conference of the United States, the agency charged with reporting this  basic information.   The Administrative Conference was established in 2010, but the  requirements to report on fee and cost payments have not been  reenacted. Accordingly, there has been no official governmentwide  accounting of this information since fiscal year 1994, over 20 years  ago.   This lack of transparency is troubling, given that the Equal Access  to Justice Act is considered by many to be the most important Federal  fee-shifting statute. Fundamentally, the act recognizes that there is  an enormous disparity of resources between the Federal Government and  individuals and small businesses who seek to challenge Federal actions.                                time  1715    Congress enacted the Equal Access to Justice Act to provide  individuals, small businesses, and small nonprofit groups with  financial incentives to challenge the Federal Government or defend  themselves from lawsuits brought by the Federal Government. As the  Supreme Court has noted, the act was adopted with the specific purpose  of eliminating for the average person the financial disincentive to  challenge unreasonable governmental actions.   But how can we know if the act is working well toward this end if we  have no data on awards? Without the data this bill requires the  Administrative Conference to compile and report, we have nothing more  than anecdotal evidence as to whether the act is providing some measure  of relief to the financial disincentive to seeking judicial and  administrative redress against the Federal Government.   The legislation we are considering today will end this lack of  transparency and restore the reporting requirements that were repealed  in 1995. I want to, once again, thank Representatives Collins and Cohen  for introducing this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its  passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), the chief sponsor of the  bill, and a member of the Judiciary Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I do not believe I have any speakers  remaining.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.
