 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Henry  Berg-Brousseau.   Henry was a fighter. He was deeply passionate about LGBTQ issues and  dedicated to making a difference for everyone.   Henry was my intern in the Kentucky State Senate and helped to kill a  discriminatory bathroom bill. He went on to study politics at GW and  worked at HRC where he continued his fierce advocacy work.   Losing Henry is a stark reminder that extremist efforts to erase  trans people from society have real-life consequences.   More than 80 percent of transgender individuals experience suicidal  ideations, and nearly one-half have attempted suicide.   Anti-trans rhetoric must stop. No more families should experience  this pain.   We now have the 9-8-8 crisis line to call or text when experiencing a  mental health crisis. Use it.   Henry was a smart, kind, and passionate person. He made the world a  better place.   Mr. Speaker, I will close by echoing the words of Henry's mother,  Karen, who was my colleague in the Kentucky State Senate: Practice  tolerance and grace, and love your neighbor.                            ____________________
