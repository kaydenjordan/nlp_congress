 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2615,  the ``United States-Northern Triangle Enhancement Engagement Act.''   H.R. 2615 supports the people of Central America and strengthens  United States national security by addressing the root causes of  migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.   H.R. 2615 will provide reports on drivers of migration from the  Northern Triangle to the United States and will identify methods for  the United States to strengthen fragile democracies in the region.   Thousands of immigrants flee the Northern Triangle to seek asylum and  refuge in the United States of America.   The number of asylum seekers worldwide originating from the Northern  Triangle reached 110,000 in 2015, a five-fold increase from 2012.  [[Page H5786]]    Poverty, corrupt police forces, gang violence, political corruption,  and economic instability exacerbate living conditions in the Northern  Triangle.   Homicide rates are extremely high for Central American countries; El  Salvador is leading the way with a rate of 82.84 per 100,000 persons.   Salvadorans, Hondurans, and Guatemalans leave their homes in search  of physical security, democracy, freedom, and civil liberties .   They look toward the U.S. as a beacon of hope and prosperity, often  traveling miles while battling hardships and risks to pursue the  American Dream.   This bill seeks to combat corruption among political institutions in  the region to reinforce security and lead to the development of civil  society.   We must address the origins and the structural causes of migration to  address the issues that lead to mass migration to our southern borders.   Our agencies are unequipped and are incapable of meeting the demand  of sheltering and processing immigrants who arrive at our ports of  entry.   Our nation's security depends on the stability of the Northern  Triangle.   We must act to ensure that the countries in this region return to a  functioning democracy, free of corruption and violence.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2615  to assist in reestablishing a democratic and peaceful societies in the  countries of the Northern Triangle.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res.  441 which conveys the indignation and concern many of my colleagues and  I have regarding the severe delay in the conclusion of and lack of  accountability for the July 1994 AMIA Jewish Community Center attacks.   On July 18, 1994, 85 innocent people lost their lives and 300 more  were wounded in an act of terror and hate perpetrated against the  Argentine Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA).   This attack came two years after the bombing of the Embassy of Israel  in Buenos Aires which claimed the lives of an additional 29 civilians.   In both instances, there was considerable evidence that linked the  attacks to the Lebanon-based terrorist group Hezbollah, which is  supported by the Syrian Arab Republic and is sponsored by the Islamic  Republic of Iran.   In the quarter century since the bombing of the AMIA Jewish Community  Center in Buenos Aires, little has been done to bring those  responsible, including Iranian officials and their Hezbollah proxies,  to justice.   Those charged with bringing the attackers to justice have  unfortunately been made victims themselves or since been found to have  undermined and misled their investigations into the attacks.   Alberto Nisman, one of the original prosecutors that formally accused  the Government of Iran of directing the bombing, was also critical of  the Government of Argentina's response to the 1994 AMIA bombing.   Nisman alleged that there was a conspiracy among high-ranking  Argentinian government officials, including then-President Cristina  Fernandez de Kirchner, to cover up Iranian involvement.   Unfortunately, Nisman was shot in the head in his apartment the day  before he was scheduled to present new findings to the Argentinian  Congress.   Other individuals responsible for investigating the AMIA bombing,  Argentina's deadliest terrorist attack, have since been convicted by an  Argentine court for interfering with the official inquiry and diverting  the investigation away from the truth.   As a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary and on Homeland  Security, I urge my fellow colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res.  441 and in condemning what has been a systemic failure to carry out  justice for the victims of the July 18, 1994 terrorist attack on the  AMIA Jewish Community Center.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res.  432, a resolution ``Condemning the attacks on peaceful protesters and  supporting an immediate peaceful transition to a civilian-led  democratic government in Sudan.''   H. Res. 432 is a bipartisan resolution calling on the Sudanese  government to transition power to a civilian led government, to respect  democratic principles, and to end all violence against its citizens.   Since the ousting of President Al-Bashir on April 11, 2019 the  Transitional Military Council (TMC) has seized power halting the  proposed transition to a representative democracy.   On June 3, 2019 multiple peaceful protesters were killed in Sudan as  the Sudanese government continues to perpetuate violence against its  own people.   Protests in Sudan continue, however, as the Sudanese people call for  a transition from a military ruling council to true democratic  governance.   It is critical for the United States Congress to stand with the women  and men advocating and speaking up for the Sudanese people.   I applaud the efforts and sacrifices pro-democracy activists have  made and they ought to know that the United States fully supports their  desire for freedom and peace, and strongly condemns the violent and  oppressive tactics of the Transitional Military Council.   When enacted, H. Res. 432 will lay out areas where the Sudanese  government must improve if it wants to continue a productive engagement  with the United States, including political reform and a respect for  human rights.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res.  432 to confront these atrocities we have seen in Sudan which pose a  strong threat the democratic values we work to protect.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on  the Judiciary, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 345, in  commemoration of World Press Freedom Day.   This resolution recognizes widening threats to freedoms of the press  and expression around the world, affirms the centrality of a free and  independent press to the health of democracy, and holds freedom of the  press as a central principle in promoting democracy, human rights, and  good governance in commemoration of World Press Freedom Day on May 3,  2019.   In this resolution, the House of Representatives:   Expresses concern about threats to freedom of the press and free  expression around the world on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day;   commends journalists and media workers around the world, despite  threats to their safety, for their essential role in--   promoting government accountability;   defending democratic activity; and   strengthening civil society;   pays tribute to journalists who have lost their lives carrying out  their work;   calls on governments abroad to implement United Nations General  Assembly Resolution 163 (2013), by thoroughly investigating and seeking  to resolve outstanding cases of violence against journalists, including  murders and kidnappings, while ensuring the protection of witnesses.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 345 also condemns all actions around the world  which suppress freedom of the press; and recognizes the importance of a  free and independent press in supporting democracy, mitigating  conflict, and promoting good governance around the world.   Finally, the resolution calls on the President and the Secretary of  State:   To preserve and build upon the leadership of the United States on  issues relating to freedom of the press, on the basis of the  protections afforded the American people under the First Amendment to  the Constitution of the United States;   to improve the rapid identification, publication, and response by the  United States Government to threats against freedom of the press around  the world;   to urge foreign governments to transparently investigate and bring to  justice the perpetrators of attacks against journalists; and   to highlight the issue of threats against freedom of the press in the  annual country reports on human rights practices of the Department of  State and through diplomatic channels.   I stand in strong support of this resolution and I urge my colleagues  to join me in voting to pass H. Res. 345, to commemorate the importance  of World Press Freedom Day.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committees on the Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Budget, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 1649, the ``Small Business Development Center  Cyber Training Act of 2019.''   H.R. 1649 calls for the establishment of a cyber counseling  certification program, or the approval of a similar existing program,  to certify the employees of lead business development centers to  provide cyber planning assistance to small business concerns.   Cyber strategy refers to the necessary resources and tactics that  assist in planning for cybersecurity and defending against cyber risks  and cyber attacks.   Technology becomes more advanced every day, and cyber threats follow  that same trend, making them increasingly difficult to predict and  prevent.   Cyber attacks have cost companies with robust cybersecurity programs  millions of dollars, and small businesses are no exception.   Yet, small businesses often lack the resources available to larger  companies and corporations, making them especially vulnerable to such  attacks.   A recent Ponemon study found that nearly 70 percent of all small  businesses experienced a cyberattack in 2017, while nearly half  admitted to having no understanding of how to protect their company  against a cyber attack.   Additionally, another study by Hiscox found that less than 20 percent  of small businesses said they were confident in their cybersecurity  readiness, and barely half had a clearly defined cybersecurity strategy  at all.   Due to the vulnerability of small business operations, we need  extensive measures to identify, analyze, and alleviate threats of  cyberattacks.   This bill ensures that there are at least 5 or 10 percent of the  total number of employees within a small business development center  who are certified in providing cyber planning assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1649  to protect the cybersecurity networks and facilitate cybersecurity  training within our nation's small businesses.    Mr. Speaker, on this past Saturday, Houstonians  gathered together at the Living Water International Apostolic  Ministries in Houston with Pastor Stearns and about 10 other churches.  I convened the press conference in the warehouse of this church filled  with goods and necessities to respond to the most objectionable  national order that I have ever heard from any President of the United  States: to manipulate law enforcement and calling for national predawn  raids across America.   Now, no one in America wants open borders, and Democrats do not, but  we do believe in due process, the Constitution, and the justness of the  phraseology on the Statue of Liberty to bring our forlorn and worn to  this country.   We are the greatest experiment, and people in my constituency were  frightened. I came home to say we must do something about it.   And how powerful it was for the churches in our community to say: We  will open our doors to those who are frightened about the fact that  they will be separated from their children or their children separated  from them.   What a horrible image, internationally; how the United Nations has  condemned it.   And so on that day, we opened the churches of Houston for those  migrants who were frightened by these predawn raids. One even occurred  today.   I finish my remarks by saying the 16th President of the United States  really said what America is all about: ``We are not enemies, but  friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it  must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory,  stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living  heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the  chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the  better angels of our nature.''   That is Abraham Lincoln. That is who we are.   I thank Houston for opening its doors for those who are in fear.  [[Page H5817]]                                ____________________
