 Madam Speaker, I rise in memory of Kathy J. Sackman, a  pioneer in the labor movement, as well as a registered nurse and  founder of the United Nurses Association of California/Union of  Healthcare Professionals.   I had the honor of serving with Kathy when I was her political  director for a number of years, and she was a nurse's nurse. She was a  frontline nurse who worked in critical care units and saw that the  adverse treatment of nurses led to worse outcomes for patients. She  started in Pittsburgh and then moved to California, and she was a  registered nurse in Fontana.   I asked Kathy simply one day, why did you start the United Nurses  Association of California/Union of Healthcare Professionals? And she  said simply, I saw that the nurses were being treated very differently,  very differently than the doctors. We didn't even have dental, and they  did. She said, it seemed small then, but it was something big because  it represented just the fact that nurses, people that work in  healthcare, didn't even get the proper benefits that they deserved. So  they decided to organize.   That organization now is 32,000 strong, representing not only  registered nurses but also nurse midwives. It is something that she  left a living legacy that will continue for years to come.   One of the things that we tried to remind people, she told me, is  that the wins that we have achieved tend to be forgotten over the  years; that the pay for nurses; that the staffing ratio for nurses;  that the way nurses are viewed today has always been so. And she said  that that was not always the case. And that is why they fought to  organize, they fought for their patients.   But she also understood that if you don't treat the nurses well, then  the patients are not treated well. If you have 10 patients for one  nurse, well, there is no way that those patients can get the quality  care that they deserve. So she led, as well as other nurses, for the  fight for staffing ratios in California that have improved the outcomes  for patients across not only southern California, where she started the  Nurses Union, but throughout the entire State and the country.   One of the things that she was always proud of is that she always put  members first, nurses first, the community first, the hospital first  because she knew if the hospital did well, that the nurses would do  well. If the nurses do well, patients do well. So this is something  that was impressive.   Quick story: She reorganized a hospital, nurses at a particular  hospital. And when we opened up the hospital's books, they were flat  broke. Every night a creditor would swipe their bank accounts, take all  the money that was owed to them, and they would never have enough money  to put into patient care or to keep them whole.   So she made an agreement with the nurses; we are going to help save  this hospital. She worked with the parent union of this union called  AFSCME International, a Republican Member of Congress, a Democratic  Senator, to get the bridge funding necessary to help that hospital stay  afloat. It was a safety net hospital; and told them that once we get  that hospital stabilized, their finances are better, and we can get  your raise, then you will be pay more dues. At that point, they were  only paying $5 in dues. That is unheard of. But that is because she  knew that in the end you had to get that hospital to a place that was  financially stable; that was stable for the patient; and was stable for  the people that worked there.   In the end, she helped save a hospital that was in a low-income  community. It was a working-class community and the community that I  grew up in, Riverside, California.   She will always have a lasting legacy as long as we continue to fight  for patients, for nurses, and for our communities.   Madam Speaker, I just want to also mention that she is survived by  two sons, Monty and Michael, and an extended family.                            ____________________
