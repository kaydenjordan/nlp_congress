 Mr. President, as the winter season drew to a close, South  Dakota's high school and college athletes were busy. And from  basketball and wrestling to track and field, they have a lot to be  proud of. The University of South Dakota Coyotes swept the men's and  women's Summit League titles for indoor track and field for the first  time in program history. Black Hills State made a Final Four run in the  Division II men's basketball tournament. And South Dakota State  wrestler Tanner Sloan came in second at the NCAA tournament as the  Jackrabbits wrestling team notched its second highest finish as the  Division I program.   As I traveled around South Dakota this month, I was able to see many  of our student athletes compete. I saw Lower Brule take on White River  in the high school boys' basketball semifinals in Aberdeen. I caught  the girls' Class B, State B basketball tournament in Huron, where I got  to see my hometown Jones County Coyotes cap off their historic season.  And I was at the Summit League tournament in Sioux Falls as the South  Dakota State women began their run for the tournament title.   Being back in a high school gym--seeing student athletes playing hard  and working together for the good of their team--always brings back  good memories. And it makes me reflect on how sports have shaped my  life. In addition to instilling important values like teamwork,  humility, and service, playing sports taught me the importance of  staying active and made me a lifelong fitness enthusiast.   The benefits of living an active life are well-documented. Regular  physical activity is associated with greater physical well-being,  longer lifespans, and improved mental health. Staying active can help  prevent a host of chronic conditions, including type 2 diabetes,  various types of cancer, heart disease, and depression. And for those  who do develop chronic conditions, exercise can help to manage them.  For example, according to Mayo Clinic, physical activity can help  prevent heart disease from getting worse and lower your risk of dying  from the disease--or, to name another example, exercise's benefits for  managing anxiety and depression are well-known.   In fact, one study found that exercise may be more effective than  medication when it comes to managing anxiety and depression. And the  health benefits of exercise can also help individuals save money on  healthcare as they age.   One study found--and here I quote a New York Times article:         People who start to exercise before or during middle age       typically save anywhere between $824 to $1,874 annually on       healthcare costs after retirement, and the earlier they start       their workouts, the greater those savings can be.   [[Page S1012]]     That is from a study conducted by the New York Times.   Unfortunately, despite exercise's significant health and even  financial benefits, a lot of American adults and children either don't  exercise at all or don't get enough exercise. There are a number of  reasons for that, of course, but one disincentive to exercising can be  the cost of some exercise equipment and programs.    Some of the tools that can help people be more active--like a gym  membership or fitness equipment--can be too costly for some Americans.  Even registration for youth sports leagues can be expensive, making it  harder for some families to take advantage of these activities' health  benefits. That is why I recently introduced the Personal Health  Investment Today Act--it will be called the PHIT Act--with Senator  Murphy.   The PHIT Act would allow Americans to use a portion of the money in  their pretax health savings account or flexible spending account for  fitness-related expenses. It wouldn't cover things like an expensive  new putter or fees at a country club. But it would allow individuals to  use up to $1,000--or $2,000 for married couples--from their HSA or FSA  to invest in preventive health tools like exercise equipment or a gym  membership--investments that can result in meaningful long-term health  benefits as well as healthcare savings.   The PHIT Act would also allow families to use these pretax dollars  for youth sports registration fees and some of the gear that kids need  to participate in sports. The typical family pays hundreds of dollars a  year for registration and equipment for youth sports.   Many families say sports can be a strain on their budgets, something  that has only become more pronounced as inflation has gone up. And,  unsurprisingly, some families have had to reduce their kids' level of  participation in sports because of the cost.   As I said earlier, I learned a lot by playing sports while I was  growing up, and I am sure I am not alone. Youth sports are one of the  best ways to build lifelong healthy habits. They help kids build strong  friendships and learn important skills and values that they carry  throughout their lives. And the PHIT Act would help reduce some of the  cost barriers that many families face when it comes to getting their  kids involved in sports.   With more and more of our life spent with technology, we can't  overestimate the value of spending time disconnected from screens and  being active. Fortunately, no matter how well my bracket is doing,  watching March Madness always makes me eager to ``lace `em up,'' as  they say, and get on the court myself. Although, I will be honest, I  spend, these days, more time trying to keep up with my grandkids than I  do working on my jump shot.   But whether you are playing in a rec league or with your kids, going  to a gym or making a walk or a run as part of your routine, staying  active throughout your life is an important part of staying healthy.  And with the warmer weather inching closer every day, it is a great  time to get active.   The PHIT Act is a commonsense way to help encourage more Americans to  invest in tools that make fitness goals easier to attain. And I will  continue to work to pass the PHIT Act and promote healthy living for  more Americans.   I yield the floor.

The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Kentucky (Mr. McConnell).    Madam President, I want to welcome the Senator. We get to  add another plain-spoken Nebraskan to the U.S. Senate--people who bring  a commonsense, clear-eyed realism, a solutions-oriented approach to the  Senate. We are really grateful to have former Governor, now-Senator,  Pete Ricketts join the U.S. Senate, along with his colleague Senator  Deb Fischer. That is a powerful, powerful duo and will be a great  partnership for the State of Nebraska and make great contributions to  the U.S. Senate and to the betterment of our country.   And I know that, like a lot of people from their region of the world,  they understand--as he pointed out in his remarks--the importance of a  strong and secure America, an America that projects strength in the  world, not just militarily but economically, diplomatically.   And so as we work on these issues, we face lots of challenges, lots  of dangers in the world today.   I am just delighted to have another U.S. Senator who comes to us with  a record of accomplishments as a Governor. He got a lot of things done  when he was Governor of Nebraska. And, as a neighbor State, a State  that gets an opportunity to observe--and, actually, I share almost a  border with Senator Fischer, because my hometown and her home area are  literally, just as we speak, as the crow flies, in Nebraska and the  Dakotas, a few miles apart.   But we know that we are going to have two people here representing  that State whom I have been able to watch, not only from afar but now  up close, and just know how talented they are, how dedicated they are,  and, again, just how practical and realistic and commonsensical they  are about the challenges facing our country and about the solutions  that we need to put in place to meet those challenges.   So congratulations on your remarks and welcome. It is great to have  you here, and we look forward to serving with you, Senator Ricketts,  and to continue to serve with Senator Fisher.
