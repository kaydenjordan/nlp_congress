 Mr. President, I rise today to return to the topic of  antitrust. When I last spoke on this matter, the debate was already  simmering, albeit mostly on the left. In the time since, controversy in  both our markets and our politics has kept it at the fore.   Handled prudently, that can be a good thing. I say we have this  discussion. I think it is important. Heavens, I will even try to do my  part to make it a little more fun. But I do have my concerns that the  topic of antitrust policy is still more enthusiastically invoked than  deliberately considered.   I am concerned that it is still undermined by the same old easy  retreats to the right and to the left. That may be typical of issues  here in Washington, but on no issue can we afford it less. You see,  especially in antitrust policy, it is critical that the center hold. It  is critical that we secure that delicate middle ground--hard won over  the years and easily lost in a moment of fervor--whereon economic  liberty thrives.   I have come to the floor, once again, to speak and, to the growing  discussion, to contribute.   Permit me to say a few words about holding the center. When I took to  this floor last month, I argued that on the fundamental question of  economic management, America has courageously defied the historical  norm. Rather than acquiescing to the central planning, we fully  embraced free enterprise. Thus, ours is a market economy and the most  prosperous one of our times.   Markets are messy. They are chaotic and, from the individual  perspective, impossibly complex. Perhaps, most counterintuitively, they  are, in a sense, disorganized.    For all their productivity, for all the wonders they work, there is  no single actor or entity in control. The miracle arises all on its  own, through an order  [[Page S5876]]  spontaneously coordinated by price and balanced by the efforts of  millions. Little surprise then that in America's free enterprise  tradition, no less than in its larger political tradition, we deeply  distrust concentrated power. We distrust the intervention of the State,  to be sure.   Our system is largely defined by limited government but so, too, do  we cast a wary eye upon powerful private entities. We have little  tolerance for the monopolist which secures its market position  anticompetitively, and we offer no quarter to the naked cartel. In  other words, we no sooner trust concentrated private power than  concentrated public power to dictate the direction of our economy.   That, right there, is why we turn to antitrust. That is the middle  ground--between intrusive public management and corrosive private  conduct, which antitrust is charged with seizing and protecting, for we  know our markets will never fulfill their promise unless they remain  free and competitive, and we know they will not long remain free or  competitive without a sound competition policy holding that center  ground.   Now, as I mentioned earlier, events of late seem determined to keep  antitrust at the forefront of the public debate. We are witnessing  innovation and disruption at a dizzying pace. Markets are  concentrating, powerful players are staking out valuable ground, and  accusations of anticompetitive behavior--some bona fide and many not-- are mounting. Across the board, an anxiety seems to be settling in.   Therefore, I want to be very clear, especially to my friends on the  left: I see it. I understand it. That the challenges here are real,  there can be no real doubt. That an update in the doctrine may well be  necessary, there should be no dispute. Where, perhaps, I differ is that  I don't quite see the need for the panic. I think American antitrust is  up to this challenge.   The story of capitalism has always been a story of change, and if we  are doing things right, that change does not come according to anyone's  plan or script. Just when society grows comfortable in habits of law  and commerce--just as each part of the economy learns to play its  part--the ground again shifts beneath our feet. It can be a bit  disorienting but not to worry. That is where our old, trusted friend,  the consumer welfare standard, comes back in.   As I emphasized in my last address on the floor and as I will  continue to emphasize here, it is a proven way of directing us aright.  As new innovation fundamentally alters the landscape, as entrepreneurs  press beyond current frontiers and into the unknown, the consumer  welfare standard is like a compass with a bearing set toward that  critical middle ground which antitrust is charged with protecting. True  north is not what is best for market competitors, not what is most  convenient for market regulators, but what most furthers market  competition itself, the better to ward off the dangers of collectivism,  the surer to escape the stagnation of monopoly.   Now, I know--I understand--that this hardly settles things.  Identifying the principle by which we orient ourselves is the start of  the discussion, not the conclusion. The consumer welfare standard is,  like I have said, a compass; it is not a map. It guides our journey  without fixing a precise course through the changing terrain.  Adjustments are to be expected. After all, much of antitrust doctrine,  as it is received today, was built upon the familiar economic process  of resource extraction, manufacture, distribution, and retail.   That the digital age would present commercial arrangements to defy  those traditional classifications is not, altogether, surprising.  Fortunately, antitrust is a common law exercise and leaves plenty of  room for improvement. Our conventional categories of anticompetitive  conduct can be tweaked, refashioned, or even expanded in light of  technological advancement and market evolution. That process will  become all the easier as our tools for taking the measure of the land  improve.   Current analysis does well in taking account of price. It may do  better still in taking account of quality. Reams of data never before  thought obtainable and new econometric methods only recently deemed  practical entice us with a chance to plot curves, which until recently  were confined to the theoretical. Our basic and time-honored  foundational models are increasingly nudged and bounded by  contributions from the behavioral sciences, and game theory is  continuously opening new horizons in market analysis.   I am happy to have that discussion. Again, we keep our markets fresh  by keeping our doctrine current, but I would--as an old Republican  must--urge caution, especially to some of the more zealous advocates  for reform, hipster or otherwise. I will gladly sample the avocado  toast--I really will--but nobody should get the idea that we have moved  on from the meat and potatoes. It is easy, with the benefit of  hindsight, to critique past precedent formed in the familiar image of  the mass industrial process. It is far more difficult to refashion  doctrine for a new age that is still evolving in surprising ways.   As we trek into the unknown, let's take note of where we have been  and appreciate the hazards of the route. Let's recall that whatever the  changes at the surface of the market, basic economic principles persist  through the ages. Network effects in our digital infrastructure may  feel very new today, but as I emphasized in my last address, the  concept is actually very old. It structured the telephone market long  before we could even conceive of an online search market. Let's recall  also that the foresight of regulators and thus the wisdom of their  regulation is inevitably limited.   We talk a lot about platform economics today and worry about the  bottlenecks of digital traffic as if the future has finally and  permanently arrived, but with the rate of innovation these days, there  is no telling whether the essential facilities of today will prove all  that essential tomorrow. We can do little more than guess at what form  exclusive dealing or foreclosure may take in markets yet unseen. Let's  recall that markets often correct themselves. As more than a few  formally invincible corporate titans can attest, free enterprise offers  few opportunities for eternal life, and when regulators do step in,  doctrine still tends to lag behind the market. Thus, the powers we  grant government now will likely survive into a future that is not yet  defined.   Finally, before we rush to grant enforcement officials a broad  mandate with an ill-defined objective to do something, let's recall  that regulation can hurt as much as it can help. As we have seen in  some attempts at rate regulation, a regime meant to restrain the  biggest players may very well, with the passage of time, become the  preferred tool for excluding new entrants. Merger analysis sometimes  does more for rivals than for consumers, and as we have learned in  nearly every form of intervention, a medicine which creates too much  unpredictability and upsets too many investment-backed expectations may  well prove worse than the disease itself.   In the end, like I said, I think we are up to this challenge. With  compassion in hand, an open mind, and appreciation for what our journey  thus far has taught, antitrust will continue the work of securing that  middle ground whereon markets thrive. When all is said and done--after  all of the controversy and high emotion have subsided--we may just find  that all we needed was a small course adjustment. Perhaps this needn't  be a reckoning when just a little reform will do. We can set about  correcting market failures and readjusting system incentives without  going after some industry or bringing this or that firm to heel.   When I first sounded the alarm on Microsoft--years ago really--it was  not merely because it was deemed too powerful or because a new class of  high-tech barons risked undermining democratic norms; it was because of  well-founded concerns of concrete, competitive harm to developing  markets.   The question in antitrust was not then--and we must not allow it to  become today--whether any of our companies are too big or too  profitable or too dominant; the question is whether they engage in  identifiable anticompetitive conduct or if a merger is likely to  facilitate it.   The question is whether it can be shown, as far as the imperfect  tools of economics allow and an evolving doctrine can bear, that the  conduct at issue or the merger proposed does more to fortify the firm  than serve the consumers of America.  [[Page S5877]]    Of course, that kind of analysis may not make headlines, and it may  not satisfy our deep-seated yearning to identify heroes and villains,  but it is the best way to handle antitrust. If we are going to get this  right, we are going to need to keep cool heads.   Antitrust already asked some of the hardest questions, like why we  allow the market to put scarce resources to their highest uses when our  social and political valuations do not match that of prevailing prices.  Antitrust already forces some of the hardest choices, like how to trade  the losses of some industries and some actors for the gains of the  economy as a whole.   There is no need to make things harder still by turning antitrust  into a political cudgel, as the left is wont to do, or by dismissing it  as yet another example of government overreach, as the right is often  guilty.   So let us let all of us on all sides tone down the political  rhetoric. Should this debate do no more than feed our appetite for  political gamesmanship, antitrust will not be the better for having it.  Do you know what? I do not think I am alone here. My colleagues in the  Senate seem to be rising to the occasion. My friends on the other side  of the aisle introduced legislation that, however flawed in my view,  reflects the seriousness with which they take these issues.   I am happy to see there is finally movement again on the nomination  of Makan Delrahim. He is an exceptional antitrust attorney and just the  person we are going to need as we sort this thing all out. I will not  shy from discussing his qualifications here, and I would not fault my  colleagues for using his nomination as an opportunity for a wider  discussion on antitrust, but now it is time to put him to work. I am  pleased to see we are almost there.   At the same time, this debate is not going to be confined to the  floor of the Senate. At the agencies, in the courtroom, from the  lecture hall to the opinion pages, there are going to be a lot of  voices weighing in. Most, we can hope, will be helpful. All, we can  resolve, will be heard, I hope.   I want to applaud those on the left for jumping into this debate, and  I wish the best of luck to the new Open Markets Institute. I had a  little fun with the hipsters the last time around, and they took it in  good stride. I am now told some prefer the title New Brandeis School. I  think that is fitting. Justice Brandeis was a bit of a hipster in his  time. I should know, as I was basically a contemporary of his.   Further, I acknowledge the efforts of private litigants and policy  advocates pressing their cases in courts here and in Europe. They have  been working tirelessly to make a data-driven case that speaks directly  to consumer harm. They play an important role, and the doctrine is  better for their efforts, however their cases turn out.   Finally, I want to implore my fellow conservatives, continue joining  in on this debate, keep investing in antitrust, embrace it as an area  of the law in which we speak to the power of the markets by speaking to  the importance of sound regulation. Make the case that, like property  or contract or commercial law, antitrust is that rare species of  government regulation which opens doors rather than slamming them shut.   As I have been arguing for decades now, should our doctrine grow  stagnant, markets may well concentrate beyond what is politically  acceptable, calls for excessive government intervention will only  increase, and the yoke of the regulator could soon be our portion.   With that, Mr. President, I will close right where I began. As this  debate proceeds, it falls to all of us to do our part in getting this  right. The challenges presented by our evolving markets are real, but  we are not the first to break new ground, and will we be the last to  worry that the new ground broken sits far removed from the  competition's precious center? One way or another, we have made it  before. I trust we can make it again.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 1 request for committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                             COMMITTEE ON FINANCE    The Committee on Finance is authorized to meet during the session of  the Senate on Monday, September 25, 2017, at 2 p.m., in 215 Dirksen  Senate Office Building, to conduct a hearing entitled ``Graham-Cassidy- Heller-Johnson Proposal.''                            ____________________
