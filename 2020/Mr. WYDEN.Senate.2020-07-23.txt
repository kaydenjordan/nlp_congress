 Madam President, I want to thank my colleague for putting  a human face--the face of Oregonians--on this Federal invasion of our  State.   And I want to talk just for a moment and ask my colleague a question  because, yesterday, here in Washington, as our constituents were  finding this horrific invasion of their constitutional rights--the moms  and others, when they were peacefully protesting--what we saw in the  Senate Intelligence Committee, I say to Senator Merkley, was an example  of just how disconnected the Trump administration is from reality as  they try to find these figleafs to cover up for their violation of the  constitutional rights of our citizens.   We had a nominee for a top legal position in the Trump  administration--a top position, legal position, that is greatly going  to affect the constitutional rights of the people we are honored to  represent--the rights that are now being violated, as we have said  repeatedly here on the floor.   The nominee's name was Patrick Hovakimian, and I asked him a couple  of basic questions, questions that our constituents are asking.   I asked him: Do you believe that Federal forces can patrol American  cities over the objections of State and local officials and away from  Federal buildings?   That is something you and I get asked all the time by our  constituents.   Then I also asked him: Do you believe that unidentified Federal  forces in unmarked cars can drive around seizing and detaining American  citizens?   This is also something we are very familiar with. I pointed out  American troops, our soldiers who so courageously fight the terrorists,  wear their identification. Again, he just ducked and bobbed and weaved.  At one point--and then he repeated it--he said: Senator, just give my  best wishes to the people of Portland.    I asked again for a responsive answer, and he wished us best wishes  again for these people who are getting gassed, like Sharon Meieran-- whom the Senator and I talked about, a personal friend of our family,  an emergency room doctor--getting hit with a tear gas canister-- ``sending best wishes'' to the people you and I represent.   So it seems to me--and I would be interested in the Senator's  thoughts because he has spent a lot of time thinking through where this  is headed because we in Oregon were kind of the test tube. We were the  people who were going to be first. The President has said that he is  going on to other cities.   Both of us share a great interest in healthcare. I sure as hell wish  that he would attack the coronavirus with half of the intensity with  which he has attacked our cities. We are going to talk some more about  that.   Let me get the Senator's reaction to what I think is the central  question, and I really pondered this as we were listening to these  nonanswers yesterday by a top Trump official. By the way, he is in a  top position now in the Justice Department responsible for knowing  about these legal issues that reflect the violations of the  constitutional rights of our constituents, and then he gets a bigger  job, a bigger role in these issues. I thought to myself, it seems to  me, without drawing a line in the sand, America may be looking down the  barrel of martial law in the middle of a Presidential election. I would  be interested in the thoughts my colleague because I have been amazed  at the number of Senators who have come up and said: You know, Ron,  that really seems to be what it has come down to.   My colleague is a student of history and has brought so much specific  documentation, such as the cases he has been spelling out. I would be  interested in my colleague's assessment of where he thinks this is  going.    Madam President, how much additional time does my  colleague have?    Parliamentary inquiry, how much time does my colleague  have on his hour remaining?    Thank you, I will take a few, and we are very pleased that  our colleague from Illinois is here and has been a very significant  ally in this.   Senator Merkley, one of the reasons I so appreciate your taking this  time is that it reminds me a bit of what Jews faced in the 1930s.   My family fled the Nazis in the 1930s. Not all of our family got out.  My father's great-uncle Max was one of the last gassed in  Theresienstadt, and Jewish families saw that a democratically elected  government can transform into a murderous regime before the eyes of its  citizens very quickly. There isn't any bright line when it happens, no  cinematic moment where everything changes--just a moment, as we talked  about earlier, in which bureaucrats and lawyers and police begin to  follow the bidding of their leader while perverting the rules of their  Republic.   This was not a singular event. From Europe to Asia to the Americas,  democratically elected governments were undermined and replaced by  authoritarian regimes--often while retaining the trappings of a  democracy. Bureaucrats claimed they were just following rules, soldiers  and police--just following orders. Then they just wished us best  wishes.   Rarely did these leaders start with majority support, but terror,  combined with the abuse of the elections process--which we are also  very concerned about--allows them to claim power from the ballot box.   It seems to me you are laying out that it is our sacred duty to learn  from this history, to bring this history to the floor and, as I tried  to say with respect to the threat of martial law, to draw a bright line  when a government, instituted to protect liberty, is being used to  attack liberty. We shouldn't, we cannot, and we can't wait until we  have a gun at our back to raise the alarm.   The government isn't going to defend itself. The same Attorney  General that has taken an oath to defend the Constitution will sit idly  by while citizens are detained without charge and violently assaulted  by the government. The same police officer charged with defending our  citizens will commit those assaults if that is what they are directed  to do.   If the Executive and any government served by the bureaucracy will  take all the power they can unless a brave judiciary and a strong  legislature step up and, as you have outlined here on this floor, say:  ``No more.''   This Congress has been way too pliant in yielding, and it has  emboldened the executive branch, led by Donald Trump, to ignore the  constraints that have traditionally protected our liberty.   So my question is--it seems to me you are standing up for these kinds  of core values of freedoms that are what we stand for as Americans and  that this has been the beacon all around the world for over a century.  I believe what you are saying--and I think it would be helpful for you  to put it in your own words--what you are saying is that we have to be  out here working on your legislation and working on these key kinds of  measures because without this effort, there is a real danger, on our  watch, that the light of liberty will fade away? And it seems to me  what you are saying is that we are better than this.   I would like your reaction to that because I think if you look at the  march of history, which in the Wyden household is very, very personal-- to have lost family to Hitler's murderous regime. I would like to hear  your thoughts about this kind of challenge we face and how important  the work in front of us is to make sure that light of liberty doesn't  fade away.    Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Committee on Finance be discharged from  further consideration of S. 4143; that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I am going to get into the substance of my  colleague's arguments in a moment, but I just want to be clear to all  the people in America, the 30-plus million who are having problems  making rent, having problems buying groceries, who in just 2 days--2  days--come Saturday, are going to be in a position where, based on what  they tell me, they are telling their kids: Hey, you probably have to  eat a little bit less because the unemployment is ending.   The fact is, the other body passed a bill so that folks would be able  to make rent and buy groceries. On this side of the aisle, the  Democratic leader and I introduced legislation to tie the benefits to  economic conditions on the ground. One of the reasons we did is my  colleagues on the other side said that benefits ought to taper off if  unemployment goes down. That is what our bill does.   But here is the message that I think folks who are walking on an  economic tightrope this weekend need to hear. On this side of the  aisle, we have been ready to go for weeks--essentially, months--to have  bipartisan negotiations to work this issue out. As of this afternoon,  with benefits expiring in 2 days, the other side of the aisle has no  piece of legislation on offer. Let me repeat that: no piece of  legislation on offer.   Let me repeat that--no piece of legislation on offer. On this side of  the aisle, they write lots of bills to help multinational  corporations--lots of bills to help the powerful and the special  interests, but as of this afternoon, there is not a bill to help those  folks who this weekend are going to be saying: We are not going to be  able to make rent in a few days. We are not going to be able to feed  our families, not going to be able to pay for the car insurance. People  aren't spending this money on luxuries. They are spending it on  essentials. To a great extent, they kept the economy afloat for the  last few months.   The other point I want to make is that this did not have to happen.  Not only do we have legislation ready to discuss with our colleagues  that incorporates some of their ideas, we have been reaching out again  and again. Yet Mitch McConnell, who took all of July off when he could  have been getting this piece of legislation together--those big 2  weeks, and he could have been getting the legislation together-- basically, actively--didn't happen by osmosis--actively gave short  shrift to the needs of the unemployed and made no effort, none  whatever, even though we reached out continually to Republicans, saying  that this weekend--and the pain that working families have this weekend  didn't have to happen. We wanted to do everything we can, working with  our colleagues, to prevent it.   Now, for purposes of this discussion, I want to make sure people  understand what this discussion really means to working families in  this country. I was at home, at food banks and the like--lines for  blocks--people who had never needed to go to a pantry or a food program  were waiting in line because they had been hit by this economic  wrecking ball.   There are people who are worried about losing their homes and losing  their cars, being unable to fill their prescriptions. As I mentioned,  think about what it means when you have to tell your kid you ought to  eat less because they don't know whether they will have enough cash to  stock the pantry next month.   As I said, Republicans' response to this over the last few days--last  few weeks--I went to school on a basketball scholarship, and I remember  when you could basically play stall ball, go into four corners offense,  basically run down the clock. And then at the end, as my distinguished  colleague from Wyoming tried to do, say: Well, it is the fault of the  poor people. It is the fault of those poor people. I am going to touch  on what this really is all about.   When we began the negotiations--and I was the point person for the  Democrats--in the Finance room--I offered basic wage replacement as our  position for dealing with this issue. Secretary of Labor Scalia said:  It can't be done. The States can't administer it. Western civilization  is pretty much going to end if we try to do this. And then he folded  his arms, and, for days, basically refused to negotiate about  alternatives.  [[Page S4452]]    Understand that we started with the approach of basic wage  replacement. Secretary Scalia said it can't be done. States are stuck  with old technology. I didn't disagree with that. Gave a billion  dollars to the States to help them update technology too. I said: We  are not going to tell those workers, Mr. Scalia, to pound sand.   I basically said we are going to average the benefit--$600. Some  people will get a bit more than they would; some people are going to  get a bit less, but families are going to have a chance, based on what  the State employment offices told us, to actually get benefits.   I know that it hasn't worked out too well in the State of Florida-- the President of the Senate, and I am sure he will want to talk about  this in the debate--but at least millions of people in this country got  a chance to make rent, buy groceries, pay medicine because we said we  are going to take a sum of money that the States told us they can  actually, for the most part, administer.   The Finance Committee held a hearing on unemployment insurance this  summer. I particularly wanted to know how we might look at  administering these benefits in the future because I knew that we would  all want to hear if there had been reforms and what the case might be  for changes. During that hearing just a few weeks ago, the National  Association of State Workforce Agencies--the experts on this issue on  how the benefits are to be administered--said that--their words--any  reduction or change in benefits will absolutely lead to a lapse in  benefits.   You would think colleagues on the other side would say: My goodness.  We don't want that to happen. These State workforce agencies said there  would be a lapse in benefits no matter what you cut, $100, whatever the  amount was, there would be a lapse in benefits. The gap in benefits  could last a week or two, potentially, up to a month. I have been  pointing out to Senators you can't eat retroactivity. And yet,  everything I have heard that colleagues want to do now--remember, they  don't have a bill. They do not have a bill. They are taking the weekend  off. We have a bill on this side. The Democratic leader, myself-- supported by our caucus--we have a bill. We are ready to talk. They  don't have a bill to do anything for those people who are going to be  hurting this weekend.   After that hearing, you would have thought people--Republican  Senators on the other side--would say, you know, we have to figure out  what to do. We have to make sure that people aren't going to fall  between the cracks, through no fault of their own. Remember, so many of  them are at home because of government policies, the quarantine, and  the--of course, the pattern is particularly ominous now because folks  who were furloughed at the beginning, then got brought back, and now  with the spike, they are getting laid off again. There you have it-- National Association of State Workforce Agencies says that any change  can lead to a lapse in benefits.   I guess my colleagues on the other side walked out there and said: No  big deal. It is just a few weeks. Tell that to the people who aren't  going to have enough money to make rent and buy groceries next week.  Tell that to their face rather than just leave town and say: We will  talk about it another time, and we will see about 2, 3, 4 weeks and  what people are going to have to do without this lifeline, which I  believe is going to be a disaster.    The lapse that is being forced on this country right now is because  Senate Republicans would not step up. They would not step up along the  way--after the hearing, during the July break. They did not step up.  The lapse is going to lead to eviction; it is going to lead to hunger;  it is going to lead to desperation for millions of Americans. And the  only way to avoid it is by acting now, by passing the American  Workforce Rescue Act that Senator Schumer and I introduced. We just  tried to pass it.   If our bill had passed, the people who are going to be hurting this  weekend, who aren't going to be able to make rent, who aren't going to  be able to buy groceries--would have some sense of security. They would  be able to go to bed at night this weekend, had our bill passed,  knowing that there would be an opportunity to work with the other body  and get this resolved and get it resolved quickly.   Now those people know one thing, and that is that they better plan  for yet more uncertainty and more pain. As my colleagues say, maybe it  will get worked out in a few weeks--even though what they are talking  about working out--and remember, there is no bill. We have never seen a  piece of paper, but they are talking about cutting the lifeline over 50  percent. That is their proposal--cutting it more than 50 percent.   At a minimum--at a minimum, I believe, that what the Republicans are  now looking at is some kind of approach that after Secretary Scalia has  told the Senate that the States can't do full wage replacement for  individual workers; that they are not capable of doing it; the  technology is too old; it can't get the math; it can't get individually  tailored benefits out in a timely way--apparently, my colleagues are  using that model for their so-called idea that they want to talk about.   I have already mentioned the fact that they believe the argument for  this is that it could be done in a few weeks. People are going to be  hurting for those few weeks. Nobody has an answer to that. Everybody  ought to understand that I was the first one to offer full wage  replacement--I would say to the President of the Senate--and it was  Secretary Scalia who said it couldn't be administered and has never  changed his mind on that point.   My view is, the proposal that adds a whole lot of complexity to the  unemployment system is a proposal designed to fail. That, apparently,  is what Senate Republicans are talking about.   At a minimum, this delay in the Senate is going to cause a lapse in  benefits. On top of that, it has been reported the Republicans could  attempt to cut the benefit by well over 50 percent.   I just ask, how can anybody look at the State of the country and how  powerful people and special interests can be doing so well and then  decide to cut the economic lifeline for working families by well over  50 percent when the country is in the middle of a pandemic, when there  are 60- or 70,000 new COVID cases every day and climbing, when there  are 800, 900, 1,000 COVID cases every day and climbing, when the number  of new unemployment claims, which before this year had never crossed  700,000, has been 1.3 million or higher for 18 straight weeks, and, in  fact, the number of new claims went up this week for the first time  since April--a sign that the recovery is going in reverse.   As I mentioned, what I am hearing about at home are businesses that  reopened in May and June and are laying off their workers for a second  time.   One-third of Americans couldn't make their last rent payment. Parents  who lost their jobs are wondering how they are going to feed their  children. I just say to my colleagues who may be who may be following  this, this is an unthinkable level of pain and suffering and  uncertainty to needlessly inflict on 30 million Americans.   It is not just about those who have already lost work. It is about  the millions of others who are worried that their pink slip might come  in August or September or October. They need support too. In fact, the  papers are full of stories of small businesses closing and closing  permanently. I expect that all those people are worried that they  haven't been laid off yet, but a pink slip may be coming their way in  August or September or October. They may have a word or two for their  Senators who are able to find plenty of time to write bills to help  multinational corporations but can't find the time to stand up for  unemployed folks who are hurting.   Before I wrap up this afternoon, I want to touch on this argument  that Republicans have been flogging away on for months now that these  unemployment benefits are way too generous, and, somehow, they are  convinced that it makes sense to insult the American worker and say  that all these workers are sitting around lazily at home instead of  going back to work. That argument does not pass the smell test.   I am going to be very specific about why that argument trotted out  again by my friend from Wyoming is way off base.   First of all, the same Republicans who celebrated the May and June  job reports are now talking about how lazy  [[Page S4453]]  workers are by refusing to go back to their jobs. You simply cannot  have it both ways.   Second, not one of my Republican colleagues brought forward real  evidence to suggest that workers across the country are turning down  work. These anecdotes just don't hold water. According to one recent  analysis, more than two-thirds of workers who were hired in June went  back to jobs that paid less than supercharged unemployment benefits.   Third, it is an insult to American workers to say that they would  rather sit at home than to earn their pay at work.   If any one of my Republican colleagues were to go out and meet the  Oregonians I have spoken to and who have been furloughed or laid off  during the pandemic, they will hear from people who desperately want to  go back to their jobs when it is safe. These are people who believe in  the dignity of work and people who want to provide for their families.  It is an insult to call them lazy.   I want to inject a note of reality into this because my Republican  colleagues have been so fixated on this argument. I have talked to a  lot of unemployed workers. I said: Back east, the Senate Republicans  say all unemployed folks are lazy, and they don't want to work and all  the rest.   So many of the unemployed look at me incredulous, and they say: Ron,  ask them how in the world have they came up with that completely wrong  idea.   They usually say: If I am given a choice between unemployment or the  chance to have a job in the private economy, where I have a future and  where I can build upward economic mobility--they usually say: Ron, tell  those Republicans in Washington, DC, it is a no-brainer; of course, I  am going to take the job that gives me an opportunity for a future, the  chance to work in the private sector and climb the ladder of economic  mobility. I am going to take that every time, rather than unemployment,  which has been uncertain.   That is my response to the off-base kind of argument presented by  Senator Barrasso. If Republicans want to go home this weekend and  insult the work ethic of millions of Americans who believe in the  dignity of work, that is their constitutional right.   The country, obviously, is nowhere near the end of this pandemic.  Businesses are going to keep closing--some temporarily, others  permanently. We are looking at the worst unemployment crisis since the  Great Depression.   The benefits we put together initially, the supercharged unemployment  benefits--and I am especially proud that we said that as for the law,  which really hadn't been updated since the 1930s, that we would  modernize the law and allow gig workers and the self-employed and  independent contractors and part-timers to be brought into the system.  Those supercharged benefits that we negotiated in the Finance Committee  room--which, by the way, were signed off by Secretary Mnuchin. This was  not done in the dead of night with only one side going along with the  effort. These were negotiated with Secretary Mnuchin, who actually  endorsed it at a press conference. These supercharged unemployment  benefits have been the one thing that has kept millions of families-- millions of families--from being in a position where they couldn't feed  their families, couldn't make rent, and, literally, facing the kind of  despair, the kind of fear that has made the number of requests for  mental health services go through the stratosphere because people are  so worried. And this question of their economic future is just one  reason.   Supercharged unemployment benefits have helped keep the economy  afloat and have helped prevent true economic meltdowns. And even with  the lifeline, so many are barely hanging on. They fall behind on their  bills. I mentioned the threat of hunger. Senator Brown just talked  about how important it is to act on housing assistance.   It would be a historic failure, morally and economically, to slash  this lifeline that is so important to getting workers through a  pandemic. The Democratic leader, Senator Schumer, and I listened  carefully to all sides. We thought about the need, given the fact that  there are predictions of high unemployment for some time to come. We  said: Let's come up with a dependable safety net that provides some  measure of predictability with respect to how the government is going  to approach these issues in the future.   My colleagues have said that they want a system that has the benefits  taper off as unemployment goes down. Well, what the Democratic leader  and I have proposed does exactly that.   I believe that yesterday there was a story in the Washington Post  where, I think, they were talking about unemployment at 15 percent.  When unemployment reaches those kinds of levels--and we saw that story  of people waiting and waiting for hours. In fact, I don't have the  exact percentage.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the story about the  unemployment calamity in Oklahoma be printed in the Record at this  point   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [July 20, 2020]  `A Very Dark Feeling': Hundreds Camp Out in Oklahoma Unemployment Lines                              (By Annie Gowen)         Tulsa.--John Jolley never thought he'd be sleeping in his       car awaiting unemployment benefits. But there he was, the       owner of a once-successful advertising agency, taking a       sweaty nap in a Subaru wagon in a convention center parking       lot at 1:45 a.m. on a Wednesday.        The pandemic sent his business into a free fall, and now       Jolley wanted to be first in line for an unemployment claims       event beginning in five hours. He barely dozed, afraid that       if he fell into a deep sleep, he would miss the early-morning       handout of tickets for appointments with state agents.        There would be just 400 tickets handed out for that day's       event. When those ran out, there would be 400 more for       appointments the following day.        ``I just didn't want to be number 803,'' Jolley said.        In the four months since the pandemic began, nearly 50       million workers have filed unemployment claims nationwide, a       flood that's overwhelmed some states, freezing antiquated       computer systems and jamming websites and phone lines for       days. State benefit agencies in some parts of the country       have evoked memories of Great Depression bread lines.        Many have been struggling to get their regular unemployment       benefits as well as the $600-a-week federal pandemic       unemployment assistance passed in March that begins running       out for millions of Americans later this week. Congress       returned Monday to begin hammering out the details of another       massive coronavirus bill, with Republicans assembling a $1       trillion package that probably will extend but reduce the       size of that benefit. Democrats are backing a more wide-      ranging $3 trillion relief bill passed by the House in May.        In Oklahoma, one of the poorest states, unemployment--which       reached a record 14.7 percent in April--has pushed many to       the point of desperation, with savings depleted, cars       repossessed and homes sold for cash.        Even though the unemployment rate dropped to 6.6 percent in       June, the backlog has created unprecedented delays. Oklahoma       had approved 235,000 of about 590,000 filed claims by June       21--a total $2-4 billion payout, far more than in previous       years. About 6,000 state claims are pending.        The Oklahoma Employment Security Commission staff has tried       to combat the delays by holding mega-processing events at       large arenas in Oklahoma City and Tulsa this month, with       masks and social distancing required. So far, they've managed       to help 6,200 people. Jolley's unemployment claim was       approved in March but had been stalled, a problem that hadn't       been fixed after nine phone calls and hours on hold with the       OESC.        The 58-year-old single father arrived in the parking lot of       the River Spirit Expo center in Tulsa around 9 p.m. on a       sultry night with a heat index approaching 100 degrees. The       landmark 75-foot statue of the Golden Driller--a nod to       Tulsa's oil and gas hub--towered over one side of the dark       parking lot, his face painted over with a surgical mask.        Dozens more sat in the parking lot overnight with Jolley,       unable to get their questions answered through the       unemployment agency's overloaded phone system. Some said they       had been notified that their claim was denied as fraudulent.       Jolley quickly bonded with the woman in the next car over, a       manicurist named Cindy La, 60, the two swapping tips on how       they thought the event would unfold.        That afternoon, as Jolley gathered up the paperwork he'd       need for his claim, he felt a sense of sadness as profound as       anything he'd felt since the pandemic began.        ``It's a very dark feeling,'' he said. ``You just kind of       feel like you're in a boat without a rudder and you're riding       the waves. After all these years you worked hard at your       company, tried to be a good guy and be fair to your clients,       you just feel like you're losing control of your future.''                          Old computers, new careers         At 4:30 a.m., several OESC staffers emerged from the       convention center to hand out the appointment numbers. The       process quickly  [[Page S4454]]       degenerated into a free-for-all, the crowd growing restive,       pushing and shoving to get the limited supply of appointment       tickets. Jolley moved to the front of the line, trying to       protect his new friend, La, by reaching down and plucking two       tickets--No. 69 for her and No. 64 for him.        Others were not so lucky. The numbers quickly ran out, and       people were told they had to return the following day.       Eventually, staffers referred people to the three new events       added for the coming week because of the demand.        Ashley Love, 31, a former customer advocate for Enterprise       Rent-A-Car, had risen at 4 a.m. to take her 2-year-old       daughter to her mother's home before heading to the       convention center, only to be told she had to come back the       next day. She was laid off in March, when the pandemic nearly       obliterated the travel industry. Her benefits inexplicably       stopped four weeks ago, the agency website saying only she       was on a ``verification hold.''        ``It's appalling, I don't understand how they can do this       to people,'' Love said. ``One day, I called 15 times in two       hours, and they either don't answer or take your calls and       hang up on you.''        Love was getting down to the last she has, having run       through $4,000 in savings. Even before her benefits froze,       she was getting only about $137 a week, plus $600 a week from       the federal government's pandemic emergency assistance       program, due to expire around the end of the month. Her       regular monthly bills--rent, car payment, insurance--are       $2,091.        She has continued her search for a job, even contemplating       whether she should ``Find Something New''--as the White       House's new ad campaign suggests--researching how she could       get certification to start a career in teaching.        Shelley Zumwalt, the interim director of Oklahoma's       unemployment agency, said the state's system uses a mainframe       computer from 1978 that was quickly overwhelmed by the volume       of claims. ``My first day, I sat down with one of the claims       agents and said, `Show me what you do,' and a green screen       popped up and she pushed F9,'' Zumwalt said. ``That was the       clearest thing to me that I was dealing with a technology       that was older than I am.''        She launched the series of more than a dozen mega-events       July 1 after several days in June when desperate people began       showing up to the OESC office in Oklahoma City and waiting in       line with coolers, camp chairs and tents.        ``I'm not okay with people having to camp out to get their       claims processed,'' Zumwalt said.        Some who showed up at the event had received notes from the       OESC that they had been approved for unemployment benefits       when they hadn't yet applied, convinced they had been victims       of fraud. Zumwalt said that about 90,000 claims have been       flagged as fraudulent.        Last month, the U.S. Labor Department's Office of Inspector       General, working with the OESC, said it had stopped payment       on 3,800 unemployment insurance claims, including 1,300 filed       from IP addresses in London, saving the state nearly $16       million.        Many real Oklahomans in need of assistance are suffering       through the complicated unemployment process, too. The state       has rejected more than half of the unemployment claims filed       through June 21, some for gig or self-employed workers who       must be denied regular unemployment insurance before they can       qualify for the federal government's Pandemic Unemployment       Assistance, Zumwalt said.        Many who showed up at the Tulsa convention center were       navigating government assistance for the first time, such as       Sarah Miller, 29, a single mother of three who was told not       to come back to her job as a nursing home aide after she       experienced symptoms consistent with covid-19 in March. Her       unemployment claim has been pending since April 12.        ``I need this. I need it,'' she said. ``I've never been one       to do unemployment, but with all that's going on, I don't       really have any other option. I have to be home with my kids;       I can't afford to pay a babysitter or do day care. Got to do       what I got to do.''                             `We're all glitches'         Jolley had time to go home before his 6:30 a.m.       appointment, shower and change into cargo shorts and a shirt       printed with tiny steaks and barbecues. He was among the       first into the cavernous Expo center, where claims seekers       sat down in folding chairs six feet apart.        Staffers handed out bottles of water, Kind granola bars and       a flier that advertised drive-up distribution at the local       food pantry, ``Soup's On at the Community Kitchen.'' Jolley       tucked the flier along with other documents in a blue folder       he labeled ``Unemployment.''        As he waited for his name and number to be called, Jolley       looked around at the others sitting in their socially       distanced chairs and was reminded of the animated Disney       movie ``Wreck-It Ralph,'' which he watches with his 7-year-      old, Pearl. In it, Ralph is a lumbering video game villain       who hopes to restart his life by helping a video game       princess stuck in a computer glitch.        In a way, everyone in this room is a glitch, he said, just       like Princess Vanellope in the movie.        ``People that are here, we're all glitches,'' he said. ``We       fell through the cracks. The computer system didn't work for       us.''        Jolley has a degree in petroleum engineering but started       Big Guys Inc. advertising in 1995 as a hedge against the ups       and downs of the oil market. For a long time, the company       provided a good living, even during the 2008 recession. He       sells ad space for mom-and-pop businesses--tree trimmers, DUI       lawyers--posted in bathrooms in airports, restaurants and       concert venues.        ``It's a captive audience with disposable income,'' he       quipped, that old joke. ``Or it was before this.''        He had always thought he would do this until he retired,       especially after life dealt him the surprise of Pearl and he       became a single dad at 50. Now, he was just hoping his       misfortune would be temporary, that business would revive as       things normalized, with concerts and other events supposed to       restart in Oklahoma in August.        When his name was called, he went behind black curtains       where claims agents were working on their ancient computer       program. He gave a written summary of his many contacts with       the agency to Ashley Testerman, an agent in a black cotton       mask.        ``I brought a cheat sheet,'' he said.        ``You have no payments; let's see if you are in the       system,'' she said.        In the end, after all that--the numerous phone calls, the       hours wasted on hold, the evening spent sleeping in his car--      all he needed was a working PIN number, and Jolley was able       to file claims for all the weeks he had missed since April.        ``I feel so relieved,'' he said afterward, joking that he       might do a Jed Clampett-like jig in the parking lot on his       way out the door. But the joy would be temporary. His last       sobering exchange with the claims agent stuck in his mind.        ``We don't know what the future holds,'' he had said.       ``What happens if everything shuts down again?''        What then?     I close by way of saying that I came to the floor some  time ago to ask unanimous consent to make sure that this weekend, when  millions of people are hurting--remember, the suffering starts in 2  days. It starts on Saturday--2 days in Florida, in Oregon, in Wyoming,  and all over the country. Mitch McConnell's response was: Let's take a  break; we can take off. He didn't seem to see those hurting people in  Kentucky. Maybe they will have something to say to him this weekend.   I will tell you, I think it is a big mistake for Senate Republicans  to have frittered away weeks on end, when we could have had a dialogue  and we could have talked about ideas.   The Presiding Officer has talked to me a number of times since he has  been here about healthcare. I enjoy talking to my colleagues and  working on ideas to try to find a way to address concerns and solve  problems. There wasn't one single effort--not one--to pick up on any of  the ideas that I have been discussing here. In fact, I tried to reach  out to colleagues on the other side and told them that I heard them say  repeatedly that benefits should taper down as the unemployment rate  goes down. Well, that is the heart of our bill on this side.   The hurt and pain that working families are going to face this  Saturday and Sunday--2 days from now--did not have to happen. It didn't  have to happen. Our side has a bill to work on. The other side, I  gather, has some ideas. We have not seen a single piece of paper, but I  know that all those people who are hurting can't eat retroactively.  They can't eat all the Republican theories about delay and haggling.   I believe these working families deserve a whole lot better. They  deserve some predictability and certainty that when they are hurting-- through no fault of their own--their government isn't going to turn its  back on them and say: We don't care if your kids can't eat and you  don't have a roof over your head. Our country has always been better  than that.   I yield the floor.
