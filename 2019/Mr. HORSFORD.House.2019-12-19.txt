 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   I appreciate the opportunity to rise and speak in support of the  Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act, which includes my  bill, the Support American Teachers Act of 2019, which will  substantially increase the current educators' deduction expense for  teachers.   On average, teachers in Clark County School District, the fifth  largest district in the country, which I represent, spend about $750  out of pocket on school supplies for their classrooms. The starting  year salary for those teachers is $40,000.   Kaitlyn Cline, a kindergarten teacher at Kay Carl Elementary School,  also in Las Vegas, spends even more. Every year, Kaitlyn spends about  $1,000 out of her own pocket to give her class the educational  experience they deserve.   As Ms. Cline says:         As a teacher, I have to work extra hard on the side to help       pay my bills and have extra money for work expenses. Any       extra financial relief that can be utilized, can make a huge       difference.    Today, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. Let's give  the teachers the support they need and provide them the deduction for  the expenses that they incur.
