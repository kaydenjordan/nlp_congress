 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, Justice Anthony Kennedy  announced his retirement, creating a vacancy on the Supreme Court.  After Kennedy's departure, the Supreme Court will be evenly divided  between Justices appointed by Republican Presidents and Justices  appointed by Democratic Presidents. Whoever fills Justice Kennedy's  seat on the Court will have an opportunity to impact the  [[Page S4691]]  laws of the United States and the rights of its citizens for a  generation.   Because Justice Kennedy was frequently independently minded and was a  deciding vote on important issues like marriage equality and a woman's  right to choose, a more ideological successor could upend decades of  precedent and drag America backward to a time before Americans with  preexisting conditions could affordably access healthcare, to a time  before women could not be prosecuted as criminals for exercising their  reproductive rights, to a time before gay and lesbian Americans could  marry whom they love. An ideological Justice more extreme in his views  than Kennedy could eviscerate the rights of workers to organize and  bargain collectively for a fair wage and stretch the bounds of  Executive power for a President who has demonstrated little respect for  them.   Of course, if Republicans were consistent, they would wait to  consider Justice Kennedy's successor until after the midterm elections.  Time and again, Leader McConnell justified his unjustifiable blockade  of Merrick Garland by claiming the American people should have a voice  in deciding the next Supreme Court Justice. That was in February of an  election year. It is now almost July.   If the Senate's constitutional duty to advise and consent is just as  important as the President's right to nominate, which the Constitution  says it is, why should a midterm election be any less important than a  Presidential election? Leader McConnell is simply engaging in  hypocrisy.    Whomever the President picks, it is all too likely they are going to  overturn healthcare protections and Roe v. Wade. We don't need to  guess. President Trump has said time and again he would appoint judges  who would do those two things--overturn Roe v. Wade and overturn  healthcare protections. On November 11, 2016, then President-Elect  Trump said: ``I am pro-life; the judges will be pro-life.'' In a debate  against Secretary Clinton, then-Candidate Trump said: ``Because I am  pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that  that will go back to the individual states.'' It is impossible to  conclude that President Trump will appoint a Justice whom we can have  faith will leave Roe v. Wade as settled law. President Trump said, in  his own words, that he wants to appoint a Justice to give the Court a  majority that will overturn Roe v. Wade, so count on it.   President Trump will, in all likelihood, nominate a Justice willing  to send Roe ``back to the states''--again, those are President Trump's  own words--where several are preparing, if not already prepared, to  roll back a woman's right to choose. In fact, according to the  Guttmacher Institute, there are at least 18 States where abortion would  be wholly or partially illegal almost immediately. That is against what  America wants. It is because the President and his hard-right  ideological judicial acolytes are way far away from where the American  people are and are trying to create a Court that will turn the clock  backward in so many ways, with Roe at the top of the list.   We also know President Trump will likely nominate a Justice willing  to reinterpret the Court's ruling that our current healthcare law is  constitutional. Again, listen to President Trump's own words. On  January 1, 2016, Candidate Trump said that ``Justice Roberts turned out  to be an absolute disaster because he gave us ObamaCare.'' Later, he  said: ``I don't think I'll have any catastrophic appointment like  Justice Roberts.''   Even Justice Roberts was too far to the middle for the President on  healthcare. President Trump made it crystal clear that he is going to  nominate somebody hostile to the Court's ruling on healthcare. There is  no other way to interpret President Trump's words, so count on it. He  will appoint a nominee who will roll back healthcare protections for  tens of millions of Americans. America doesn't want that, but, again,  the hard-right acolytes whom President Trump listens to want to use the  Court to roll back America's rights and privileges.   We can be sure the next nominee, of course, will obfuscate, deny, and  hide behind the shop-worn judicial dodge: ``I will follow settled  law.'' As we saw this week in the Janus decision, settled law is only  settled until the Supreme Court Justices on the Court decide it isn't.  Yesterday, they reversed 40 years of precedent in a ruling that  stretched the meaning of the First Amendment to meet their ideological  predispositions--their anti-union bias.   Already there is a case wending its way through the courts that  questions the constitutionality of the healthcare law. By repealing the  coverage requirement, Republicans have removed the foundation upon  which the Chief Justice based his ruling to uphold the law. If the  change in the law changes Justice Roberts' mind, which is very likely,  and the new jurist is as biased against our healthcare system as  President Trump said he or she will be, millions of Americans could see  their preexisting condition protections wiped out.   I say to America, 80 percent to 90 percent of you believe we should  have preexisting condition protections. The nominee of the President is  likely to undo them and leave tens of millions of American families  helpless. Stand up now, America, before this happens.   The Trump administration decided the Federal Government will not  defend the law protecting preexisting conditions in the Court. The next  Supreme Court Justice may indeed be faced with casting a deciding vote  on the fate of our healthcare, and we already know, unfortunately, the  kind of vote President Trump wants.   Now, my friend Leader McConnell warned the Senate to not get into  personal attacks on the President's nominee. Of course, he doesn't seem  to mind the President who makes personal attacks his daily MO, but be  that as it may, I can assure my friend the Republican leader that there  is no desire and no need to get into personal attacks.   There are so many weighty issues hanging over the vacant seat: a  woman's right to choose, the fate of our healthcare law, the right of  workers to organize, the pernicious influence of dark money in  politics, the right of Americans to marry whom they love, the right to  vote. We will discuss these issues on the merits and consider a nominee  in light of these issues, but discussing a preordained list of  candidates who meet the hard right's ideological litmus tests? That is  certainly legitimate, and we are going to continue to bring that up. We  will evaluate the President's nominees on the issues, but every  American should have his or her eyes wide open to the fact that  President Trump is not picking the best legal mind. He has sworn to  nominate a Justice culled from a preordained list, vetted by the  Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society--organizations whose  mission has been to repeal Roe v. Wade and strike at the heart of our  healthcare law. Does anyone believe a nominee on that prevetted list  doesn't want to challenge Roe? How do you think they got to be on that  list, with the Federalist Society, led by Leonard Leo, whose goal is to  repeal Roe v. Wade, putting it together, and Trump rubberstamping it?  Given what the President has said, it is virtually certain that members  of the list of 25 would vote to overturn Roe.   So let this be a call to action for Americans from all corners of the  country to rise up and speak out. Don't let this new Court--this new  nominee, whomever he or she may be--turn back the clock on issue after  issue because President Trump has embraced a hard-right group who has a  veto power over nominees. Don't let us turn back the clock, America.  Stand up. Speak out. Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives-- all should want a much fairer process.   America, tell your Senators that if you do not want a Supreme Court  Justice who will overturn Roe v. Wade, those Senators should not vote  for a candidate from the list.                                 Immigration    Mr. President, a word on immigration. Yesterday, the House Republican  majority tried and failed to pass two distinct immigration proposals.  They cannot find agreement, even within their own caucus, on how to  handle the situation at the border or broader reforms to our  immigration system. It is as clear an indication to date that President  Trump must fix this situation on his own. He has the power to  immediately and administratively reverse his family separation policy  at  [[Page S4692]]  the border, which remains intact. He has the power to appoint a family  reunification czar, to marshal and organize the various Federal  agencies in charge of reunifying families. President Trump should  exercise that power to start cleaning up the mess he made with his  slapdash family separation policy.                                    Russia    Mr. President, this morning, the President tweeted that ``Russia  continues to say they had nothing to do with meddling in our election''  before trying to turn the focus back on the FBI. Why does President  Trump take the word of bullies like Mr. Putin at face value, while  constantly questioning the credibility of our own intelligence  agencies? It's outrageous. We don't ask the bank robber if they robbed  a bank.   Seventeen intelligence agencies have concluded, definitively, that  Russia has meddled in our election. There is no reason to question  their findings. The President just continues to deliberately spread  falsehoods for the sake of his personal political interests.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
