 Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on  the Judiciary and on Homeland Security, and the Congressional Black  Caucus, and as a cosponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5053, the  ``Justice for Juveniles Act,'' introduced by Congresswoman Scanlon  which I am proud to cosponsor.   I want to thank Chairman Nadler for his tremendous leadership during  this Congress and the past several months of hardship, stress, and  disruption not only of the regular normalized operations of this  Committee but of the Congress and more importantly, the lives of the  American people.   It has been said of Americans that we do the difficult immediately,  and the impossible takes a little longer.   The legislative session today is a testament to the determination of  this Committee that despite the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed  the life of over 200,000 Americans, that legislation to improve the  lives of the people we represent and the communities we serve will not  be halted.   The problems facing ordinary Americans due to flaws and inequities in  the criminal justice system, the immigration system, the health care  system, the economy, the trademark system and others do not take a  time-out because of the pandemic and neither does this Congress, and  for that I commend Speaker Pelosi, the House Democratic leadership, and  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   The bipartisan H.R. 5053, the Justice for Juveniles Act protects  young people from abuse in institutions by exempting them from the  administrative grievance provision of the Prison Litigation Reform Act  (PLRA) by enabling them to file a lawsuit concerning physical injury,  sexual assault or mental abuse without first having to file an  administrative grievance.   The proposed legislation is supported by a bipartisan coalition of  groups including cut5o, Campaign for Youth Justice, Juvenile Law  Center, National Legal Aid & Defender Association, and R Street  Institute.   The administrative grievance procedure, established by the Prison  Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), requires inmates at federal, state, and  local facilities to file administrative complaints through the prison  in which they are detained.   Under the Justice For Juveniles Act, youth could initiate legal  action to address prison conditions without first filing administrative  complaints.   The PLRA was designed to address the problem of the large numbers of  pro se prisoner lawsuits that were being filed and inundating the  federal courts.   Before the enactment of the PLRA, the overwhelming majority of  prisoner cases were civil rights cases filed by state prisoners in  federal district courts and were filed prose.   The vast majority of the pre-PLRA pro se cases were filed under 42  U.S.C. Sec. 1983; incarcerated juveniles filed very few lawsuits.   Generally, to establish a claim under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983, a  plaintiff must show that a person acting under color of state law  deprived him of a right secured by the Constitution or the laws of the  United States.   Pursuant to the changes brought on by the PLRA, before an  incarcerated individual can file a lawsuit, he or she must take the  complaint through all levels of a correctional facility's grievance  system.   If a person fails to comply with these requirements, including  missing a filing deadline that can be as short as a few days, he or she  may no longer be able to bring a lawsuit.   This administrative remedy requirement is a high burden for a  juvenile to meet, as it requires a sophisticated understanding of how  to navigate technical procedures.   Held to an adult standard, minors are unduly prevented from  litigating their abuses and thus deprived of a critical tool for  improving their conditions of incarceration.   Moreover, the problem is made worse because grievance procedures tend  to rely on written communication and juveniles in the justice system  typically have serious education deficits.   Cases from around the country make clear that juveniles facing  serious harm are deprived of legal protections because of the PLRA  exhaustion requirements.   For example, in Hunter v. Corr. Corp., a 17-year-old was sexually  assaulted in an adult facility but the case was dismissed because the  court ruled he should have exhausted his administrative remedies first.   In another case, from Kentucky, a juvenile filed a lawsuit alleging  that staff had hit him, shocked him with a stun gun, and then led him  down the hall by his testicles to an isolation cell.   Although the juvenile's lawyer had discussed the incident with the  jail administrator, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State  Police, and the Kentucky Department of Juvenile Justice, the court  ruled that this did not satisfy the PLRA and the suit was dismissed for  failure to exhaust administrative remedies.   Mr. Speaker, exempting youth from administrative grievances  acknowledges that children do not know how to protect themselves from  practices or conduct that is unconstitutional.   The Justice For Children Act makes it easier for juveniles who are  physically assaulted or abused to seek immediate redress in federal  court.   In addition, simplifying the legal process and making it more readily  available to these juveniles is also in keeping with the Supreme  Court's conclusions regarding the developmental needs of adolescents.   I strongly support this legislation and urge all Members to join me  in voting for its passage.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 1321) to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit  interference with voting systems under the Computer Fraud and Abuse  Act.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1321         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Defending the Integrity of       Voting Systems Act''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON INTERFERENCE WITH VOTING SYSTEMS.         Section 1030(e) of title 18, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (2)--        (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``or'' at the end;        (B) in subparagraph (B), by adding ``or'' at the end; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(C) that--        ``(i) is part of a voting system; and        ``(ii)(I) is used for the management, support, or       administration of a Federal election; or        ``(II) has moved in or otherwise affects interstate or       foreign commerce;'';        (2) in paragraph (11), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (3) in paragraph (12), by striking the period and inserting       a semicolon; and        (4) by adding at the end the following:        ``(13) the term `Federal election' means any election (as       defined in section 301(1) of the Federal Election Campaign       Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30101(1))) for Federal office (as       defined in section 301(3) of the Federal Election Campaign       Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30101(3))); and        ``(14) the term `voting system' has the meaning given the       term in section 301(b) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002       (52 U.S.C. 21081(b)).''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1321, the Defending the  Integrity of Voting Systems Act.   We are on the verge of a significant, historic, and, really, life-or- death Presidential Federal election. This is an important legislative  initiative. This important and timely legislation would strengthen  Federal criminal laws related to interference with voting systems used  in a Federal election.   All of us want a fair and just election system. Voting is an  essential part of our democracy. We must ensure that our citizens have  confidence in our electoral systems.   As we know too well from the last Presidential election and from  evidence that we continue to learn, our adversaries, Russians and  others, are conducting cyber operations to interfere with our  elections. We are well aware of the Russian bots that interfered with  the elections in 2016. We need to do all that we can to protect voting  machines and the related infrastructure as we head to November.   The integrity and legitimacy of our elections is at stake. That is  why this bill was developed: to ensure that our law concerning the  unauthorized accessing of computer systems can also be used to  prosecute those who hack into computer voting systems.   Led by Senator Blumenthal and by our former colleague Mr. Ratcliffe  in the House, this bipartisan legislation responds to a concerning  report by the Justice Department's Cyber-Digital Task Force in 2018.  The report concluded that current law is inadequate, given all the  potential threats to our Nation's election security and voting systems.  Specifically, the report identified a gap in current Federal criminal  law relating to hacking of voting machines, especially when the  machines are offline.   The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is a key tool for the prosecution of  computer crimes and the protection of property rights and computers,  but the law is generally limited to certain devices connected to the  internet. However, researchers have repeatedly demonstrated that ballot  recording machines and other voting systems are susceptible to  tampering based on physical or close access.   In order to reduce the risk of attack, more jurisdictions are  adopting important and recommended measures to  [[Page H4582]]  keep these voting systems off the internet. Therefore, S. 1321, this  Senate bill, would expand the definition of the term ``protected  computer'' under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to include computers,  even if offline, that are a part of any voting system used in a Federal  election.   It is so crucial that the American people know that we have taken  this action today to protect them and to ensure the sanctity of the  process of voting and democracy. By expanding the definition of  computers that are protected under current law, we will enhance the  ability of law enforcement and prosecutors to bring appropriate charges  in instances in which computer voting systems are hacked.   The Senate passed this legislation with unanimous support, and it is  now our turn to join our colleagues to adopt this important bill so  that it may become law as quickly as possible. Therefore, Mr. Speaker,  I ask all of my colleagues today to join me in this bipartisan, crucial  legislation which upholds democracy and assures the sanctity of one  vote, one person.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from the Judiciary Committee and  on the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security Subcommittee for his  leadership, and I thank the sponsors for their leadership. I thank our  chairman and ranking member for the bipartisanship of this legislation.    Again, Mr. Speaker, let me remind my colleagues how important this  change is. It doesn't speak to mistakes or innocent mistakes, but what  it does is it makes sure that a computer that is offline is subject to  the laws of hacking that may occur when a computer is online or active.   We know how creative those who want to undermine and distract from a  fair, just election are. They may not just have an inclination to hack  an active computer. So under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, this is  to include computers, even if they are offline, that are part of a  voting system used in a Federal election.   Again, we understand how many people are engaged in making sure we  have a secure and just election, and we know that this legislation  focuses on the bad actors, and that is what we want to do.   The integrity, Mr. Speaker, of the upcoming elections is essential to  the foundation of our democracy. The right to vote is the most  fundamental right of citizenship in our democracy, and this issue  touches every voter in every community across America.   We know that people are now voting as we stand here on the floor of  the House. We know that mail balloting will continue or start in many  jurisdictions. Some have already started. We know many States are  engaged in early voting, where millions of people will be voting. This  is an important initiative that needs to be signed immediately into  law.   We need to do all that we can to address current threats and to  ensure public confidence in our elections. This legislation will help  advance that goal. That is why I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  supporting passage of S. 1321 today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 1380) to amend the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to  remind prosecutors of their obligations under Supreme Court case law.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1380         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Due Process Protections       Act''.       SEC. 2. REMINDER OF PROSECUTORIAL OBLIGATIONS.         Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure is       amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (f) as subsection (g); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following:        ``(f) Reminder of Prosecutorial Obligation.--        ``(1) In general.--In all criminal proceedings, on the       first scheduled court date when both prosecutor and defense       counsel are present, the judge shall issue an oral and       written order to prosecution and defense counsel that       confirms the disclosure obligation of the prosecutor under       Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and its progeny, and       the possible consequences of violating such order under       applicable law.        ``(2) Formation of order.--Each judicial council in which a       district court is located shall promulgate a model order for       the purpose of paragraph (1) that the court may use as it       determines is appropriate.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   S. 1380, the Due Process Protection Act, introduced by Senators Dan  Sullivan and Dick Durbin and passed by unanimous consent in the Senate  this past May, is a narrowly tailored, bipartisan bill that would  reinforce the government's already existing constitutional obligation  to disclose exculpatory evidence. Sometimes, of course, that evidence  can be the difference between innocence and conviction and fairness to  both the government and the defendant.   The Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution requires  that prosecutors disclose to the accused all favorable evidence that is  material. Unfortunately, at this time, there are inadequate safeguards  in Federal law to ensure that this practice is followed across the  country.   According to the National Registry of Exonerations, from 1989 to  2017, prosecutors concealed exculpatory evidence at trial in half of  all murder exonerations. Although this statistic includes State  prosecutions, we know that exculpatory evidence is concealed in Federal  cases as well.   Mr. Speaker, I have been involved in criminal justice reform for a  very long time, and I have seen the damage that  [[Page H4583]]  not exposing or disclosing exculpatory evidence can do and how it is an  imbalance as it relates to defendants who happen to be Brown or Black.  That is unfair, and I know the America that I have come to know and  love understands that justice should be equal for all.   Again, one prominent example of the failure to disclose exculpatory  evidence was in the 2008 trial of then-Senator Ted Stevens. When it was  later revealed that the Justice Department had committed misconduct by  failing to turn over exculpatory evidence, the judge in that case  concluded that he could not sanction the prosecutors because he had not  issued a direct written court order requiring them to abide by their  ethical and constitutional obligations to disclose favorable evidence.   Many of us who knew that case, who knew Senator Stevens, knew, of  course, that he had experienced an injustice.   Following the Stevens case, in June 2018, the District Court for the  District of Columbia, where the case was tried, amended its local rules  to require prosecutors to comply with their disclosure obligations.  Other Federal districts had already and have since issued specific  local rules or standing orders that govern these obligations.   A 2011 survey by the Federal Judicial Center indicated that 38 of the  94 Federal districts had a local rule or standing order confirming the  government's obligation to disclose exculpatory and/or questioning the  credibility of witnesses, which is known as impeachment, material.                                time  1445    To address this issue, the Due Process Protections Act would do three  things, three very vital things to the scales of justice: One, amend  the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to require that a judge issue  an order to prosecution and defense counsel that confirms the  disclosure obligation of the prosecutors in every criminal case;   Two, require each judicial council in which a district court is  located to issue a model order that its courts can use at their  discretion; and,   Three, leave it to the courts in each district to detail the  parameters of their order.   Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity to meet with our Federal  judges in our jurisdiction over the years, and I know that our  discussions always fall on how we can enhance justice and be fair to  all parties in the courthouse.   Criminal justice winds up with the defendant, if convicted, to lose  their due process rights. Clearly, this is an important and significant  legislation that protects all parties, but particularly when someone is  subject to losing their due process rights or their freedom.   And so I support this legislation because, significantly, the bill  would not impose any new requirements on prosecutors. It would simply  require them to follow the Constitution or risk being sanctioned by the  court.   It is a breath of fresh air to see the Constitution being raised over  and over again for the good aspects of what American democracy is all  about. The pillars upon which it is built are clearly that of justice  and equality and fairness in our judicial system.   Accordingly, this is a straightforward and bipartisan measure that  would help our criminal justice system operate in a more effective and  fair manner.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank my friend and colleague from North Dakota for his leadership.   I thank, again, the chairman and ranking member of the full committee  and our subcommittee chairpersons and ranking members.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say that, as I indicated, it is with an  enormous sense of pride and recognition and a breath of fresh air when  we talk about the Constitution in this hallowed place, because this  House and the other body are grounded in our appreciation and adherence  to the Constitution.   That is what this bill is: due process protections and dealing with  the Bill of Rights, and the right to due process that we find in the  14th Amendment and the Fifth Amendment. So I am delighted that the Due  Process Protections Act is now recognized, and it is a commonsense,  bipartisan measure.   How much better we will be when all of the judicial districts require  exculpatory evidence to be presented, because then you know that you  have given all parties their fair chance, and someone who might lose  their liberty, you give them a fair chance by putting forward all of  the evidence that may be exculpatory.   So it is narrowly tailored to ensure that Federal prosecutors simply  follow the law, as they already should, in every case.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this breath of fresh air in  the recounting of the Constitution, a document that continues to live  in 2020 so that it will become law and order.   Again, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5602) to authorize dedicated domestic terrorism offices  within the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice,  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to analyze and monitor domestic  terrorist activity and require the Federal Government to take steps to  prevent domestic terrorism, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5602         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Terrorism       Prevention Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Recent reports have demonstrated that White       supremacists and other far-right-wing extremists are the most       significant domestic terrorism threat facing the United       States, including--        (A) a February 22, 2019, New York Times op-ed, by a Trump       Administration United States Department of Justice official,       who wrote that ``white supremacy and far-right extremism are       among the greatest domestic-security threats facing the       United States. Regrettably, over the past 25 years, law       enforcement, at both the Federal and State levels, has been       slow to respond. . . . Killings committed by individuals and       groups associated with far-right extremist groups have risen       significantly.'';        (B) an April 2017 Government Accountability Office report       on the significant, lethal threat posed by domestic violent       extremists, which--        (i) explained that ``[s]ince September 12, 2001, the number       of fatalities caused by domestic violent extremists has       ranged from 1 to 49 in a given year.''; and        (ii) noted that ``[F]atalities resulting from attacks by       far right wing violent extremists have exceeded those caused       by radical Islamist violent extremists in 10 of the 15 years,       and were the same in 3 of the years since September 12, 2001.       Of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death  [[Page H4584]]       since September 12, 2001, far right wing violent extremist       groups were responsible for 62 (73 percent) while radical       Islamist violent extremists were responsible for 23 (27       percent).''; and        (C) an unclassified May 2017 joint intelligence bulletin       from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department       of Homeland Security, which found that ``white supremacist       extremism poses [a] persistent threat of lethal violence,''       and that White supremacists ``were responsible for 49       homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any       other domestic extremist movement''.        (2) Recent domestic terrorist attacks include--        (A) the August 5, 2012, mass shooting at a Sikh gurdwara in       Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in which a White supremacist shot and       killed 6 members of the gurdwara;        (B) the April 13, 2014, mass shooting at a Jewish community       center and a Jewish assisted living facility in Overland       Park, Kansas, in which a neo-Nazi shot and killed 3       civilians, including a 14-year-old teenager;        (C) the June 8, 2014, ambush in Las Vegas, Nevada, in which       2 supporters of the far-right-wing ``patriot'' movement shot       and killed 2 police officers and a civilian;        (D) the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at the Emanuel AME       Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in which a White       supremacist shot and killed 9 members of the church;        (E) the November 27, 2015, mass shooting at a Planned       Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in which an       anti-abortion extremist shot and killed a police officer and       2 civilians;        (F) the March 20, 2017, murder of an African-American man       in New York City, allegedly committed by a White supremacist       who reportedly traveled to New York ``for the purpose of       killing black men'';        (G) the May 26, 2017, attack in Portland, Oregon, in which       a White supremacist allegedly murdered 2 men and injured a       third after the men defended 2 young women whom the       individual had targeted with anti-Muslim hate speech;        (H) the August 12, 2017, attacks in Charlottesville,       Virginia, in which--        (i) a White supremacist killed one and injured nineteen       after driving his car through a crowd of individuals       protesting a neo-Nazi rally, and of which former Attorney       General Jeff Sessions said, ``It does meet the definition of       domestic terrorism in our statute.''; and        (ii) a group of 6 men linked to militia or White       supremacist groups assaulted an African-American man who had       been protesting the neo-Nazi rally in a downtown parking       garage;        (I) the July 2018 murder of an African-American woman from       Kansas City, Missouri, allegedly committed by a White       supremacist who reportedly bragged about being a member of       the Ku Klux Klan;        (J) the October 24, 2018, shooting in Jeffersontown,       Kentucky, in which a White man allegedly murdered 2 African       Americans at a grocery store after first attempting to enter       a church with a predominantly African-American congregation       during a service;        (K) the October 27, 2018, mass shooting at the Tree of Life       Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in which a White       nationalist allegedly shot and killed 11 members of the       congregation;        (L) the April 27, 2019, shooting at the Chabad of Poway       synagogue in California, in which a man yelling anti-Semitic       slurs allegedly killed a member of the congregation and       wounded 3 others;        (M) the August 3, 2019, mass shooting at a Walmart in El       Paso, Texas, in which a White supremacist with anti-immigrant       views killed 22 people and injured 26 others;        (N) the December 10, 2019, shooting at a Kosher supermarket       in Jersey City, New Jersey, in which 2 men with anti-Semitic       views killed 3 people in the store and a law enforcement       officer in an earlier encounter; and        (O) the December 28, 2019, machete attack at a Hanukkah       celebration in Monsey, New York, in which a man who had       expressed anti-Semitic views stabbed 5 individuals.        (3) In November 2019, the Federal Bureau of Investigation       released its annual hate crime incident report, which found       that in 2018, violent hate crimes reached a 16-year high.       Though the overall number of hate crimes decreased slightly       after three consecutive years of increases, the report found       a 4-percent increase in aggravated assaults, a 15-percent       increase in simple assaults, and a 13-percent increase in       intimidation. There was also a nearly 6-percent increase in       hate crimes directed at LGBTQ individuals and a 14-percent       increase in hate crimes directed at Hispanic and Latino       individuals. Nearly 60 percent of the religion-based hate       crimes reported targeted American Jews and Jewish       institutions. The previous year's report found that in 2017,       hate crimes increased by approximately 17 percent, including       a 23-percent increase in religion-based hate crimes, an 18-      percent increase in race-based crimes, and a 5-percent       increase in crimes directed against LGBTQ individuals. The       report analyzing 2016 data found that hate crimes increased       by almost 5 percent that year, including a 19-percent rise in       hate crimes against American Muslims. Similarly, the report       analyzing 2015 data found that hate crimes increased by 6       percent that year. Much of the 2015 increase came from a 66-      percent rise in attacks on American Muslims and a 9-percent       rise in attacks on American Jews. In all 4 reports, race-      based crimes were most numerous, and those crimes most often       targeted African Americans.        (4) On March 15, 2019, a White nationalist was arrested and       charged with murder after allegedly killing 50 Muslim       worshippers and injuring more than 40 in a massacre at the Al       Noor Mosque and Linwood Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand.       The alleged shooter posted a hate-filled, xenophobic       manifesto that detailed his White nationalist ideology before       the massacre. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern labeled the       massacre a terrorist attack.        (5) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist who had       expressed anti-Muslim views was charged with murder for       allegedly killing 6 people and injuring 19 in a shooting       rampage at a mosque in Quebec City, Canada. It was the first-      ever mass shooting at a mosque in North America, and Prime       Minister Trudeau labeled it a terrorist attack.        (6) On February 15, 2019, Federal authorities arrested U.S.       Coast Guard Lieutenant Christopher Paul Hasson, who was       allegedly planning to kill a number of prominent journalists,       professors, judges, and ``leftists in general''. In court       filings, prosecutors described Lieutenant Hasson as a       ``domestic terrorist'' who in an email ``identified himself       as a White Nationalist for over 30 years and advocated for       `focused violence' in order to establish a white homeland.''.        (7) On November 3rd, 2019 a 24 year old man who authorities       say was among masked Antifa supporters attacking       conservatives at a June Demonstration in Portland, Oregon,       was sentenced Friday to nearly six years in prison in       connection with brutal assault. Gage Halupowski pleaded       guilty to second-degree assault after authorities accused him       of using a weapon against a conservative demonstrator who       suffered blows to the head that the victim claims left him       with a concussion and cuts that required 25 staples to close.        (8) On December 12, 2019, an assailant involved in the       prolonged firefight in Jersey City, NJ, that left six people       dead, including one police officer, was linked on Wednesday       to the Black Hebrew Israelite movement, and had public anti-      Semitic posts online, a law enforcement official said.        (9) On February 8, 2020, A gunman stormed a NYPD precinct       after firing at police van, wounding 2. The police       commissioner called the Bronx rampage an ``assassination       attempt,'' on law enforcement.        (10) In August 2020, a juvenile armed with a semi-automatic       rifle heeded the online call posted by a self-proclaimed       militia group on Facebook to confront protestors in Kenosha,       Wisconsin. He allegedly shot and killed two protestors and       wounded a third. After the shootings, local police officers       waved the alleged murderer through their lines, even after       bystanders identified him as the shooter. The armed juvenile       then traveled across State lines to his home.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department       of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the       Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of       Defense such sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First, I certainly want to thank all of the sponsors of this bill,  and I thank Mr. Schneider for all of the important work that has been  done on this legislation.   With the consideration of H.R. 5602, the Domestic Terrorism  Prevention Act, the House takes affirmative steps in this time to  address the rising menace of domestic terrorism and white supremacy.   This bill creates three offices, one each within the Department of  Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of  Investigation to monitor, investigate, and prosecute cases of domestic  terrorism.   These newly created offices would focus their resources based on data  collected on the most significant threats with specific emphasis on  white supremacist terrorism. Additionally, pursuant to this bill, DOJ  and DHS would issue joint biennial reports to Congress assessing the  state of domestic terrorism threats.   Let me say, Mr. Speaker, that this legislation is not based on a  whim. It is not based on someone's taste or distaste; likes or  dislikes. This is based on facts. And as we continue to view the  modeling of domestic terrorism, we will begin to continue to respond to  it legislatively. But now we have a solid base of information dealing  with the issues of growing white supremacy.   The creation of these offices and congressional reporting are much- needed measures to refocus the Federal Government's domestic terrorism  efforts on the greatest threat to the American people: white supremacy  and white nationalism.   In April of last year, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing titled:  ``Hate Crimes and the Rise of White Nationalism.'' Sadly, since then  there have been countless domestic terrorism attacks.   The shooting spree at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in August of 2019  was the deadliest attack in modern times against the Latino community  in the United States and the third deadliest act of violence by  domestic terrorism extremists in more than 50 years.   I joined my colleagues who represented that area, and the pain that  they experienced was without comparison. I went to a funeral. I went to  the memorial. I went to where the place was that had been set up as a  temporary place of honor. The pain was unceasing in that community. And  just a few months ago, they had to commemorate the bitterness of 1  year.   I also went to the hospital and visited individuals who had put  themselves in the line of fire to protect others. I think since that  time one person, in particular, has passed away.   This was a painful experience, and I can imagine that it will be  painful for a very long time.   In the last decade, places of worship, a Sikh temple in Milwaukee,  the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Mother Emanuel, where  the victims who remained alive actually forgave the perpetrator who  came and sat down and prayed; sat among people who were praying, who  welcomed him. They lost a distinguished pastor and people who were so  kind. People could not understand why they lost their lives. Thousands  came to the memorial, and, of course, our President at that time,  President Obama. That is how painful it was for this Nation.   Then, of course, Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue. I visited  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and met individuals who had been impacted by  this horrific tragedy. In the midst of Rosh Hashanah, to our friends  who are in the midst of their holiday, it is more than fitting that we  acknowledge how domestic terrorism can divide so many communities, so  many innocent communities, whether they happen to be of a particular  faith, a particular ethnicity, or a particular status.   We have seen all of this become tragic symbols of deadly threats a  white supremacist poses even to the faith community.   Just last Thursday in a committee that I participated in, FBI  Director Christopher Wray--the Homeland Security Committee--once again  stated that white supremacists constitute the largest portion of  racially motivated violent extremists.   In the same vein, before the House Homeland Security Committee,  Director Wray testified that antigovernment and antiauthority groups  have been responsible for the most lethal attacks this year. We know  that. So we want to be sure that we are protecting the American people.    None of us adhere to extremism or violence. We understand peaceful  protests, but we stand for the principles of democracy of this Nation  that has kept us a democracy for all of these many years.   Just a few weeks ago our Nation was reminded how dangerous violent  extremism can be. A rightwing militia boasting 3,000 members promoted  an event on Facebook calling for patriots willing to take up arms and  travel to Kenosha, Wisconsin, to confront protesters.   Tragically, hours later, a 17-year-old youth heeded the call,  traveled across State lines, and is alleged to have murdered two  protesters and injured a third. He has yet to be brought to justice  because he is still waiting on an extradition procedure.   Yet, local police allowed this young man to safely pass through their  lines and go home, despite the fact that bystanders had identified him  as the shooter. That was one incident.   We have seen law enforcement take up the issues of protecting our  neighbors across the Nation and in those instances, of course, we  recognize good policing and we thank them for it.  [[Page H4587]]    The tragic events in Kenosha are yet another example of how rightwing  militia groups continue to pose a present threat. Indeed, over the last  decade, rightwing extremists have been responsible for 76 percent of  all domestic extremist-related murders. The time for Congress to act is  now.   The key elements of the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act seek to  address fundamental deficiencies highlighted at the April 2019  Judiciary Committee hearing in the Federal Government's response to  domestic terrorism and specifically white supremacy.   Let me be very clear. We want a comprehensive response to terrorism.  We want to rely upon our intelligence communities as it relates to  international terrorism.                                time  1500    We have done so because I have been on the Homeland Security  Committee for a very long time and, as well, have seen the work of the  Judiciary Committee. But we must be comprehensive in looking at  terrorism; we must be responsive; and we must secure and make sure the  American people are safe.   Currently, the Federal Government has a number of statutory  authorities to bring charges against domestic terrorists, including  those who are white supremacists. Yet, it is clear that the Department  of Justice has not initiated a sufficient number of these prosecutions.  H.R. 5602 creates offices within the DOJ and DHS aimed at pooling the  resources from all parts of each respective Department to focus them on  the greatest threat of white supremacy.   The reporting elements of this bill aim to keep Congress better  informed of the domestic terrorism threats presented so that Congress  can more readily assess what resources and authorities are necessary to  protect the country against domestic terrorist activities.   I am well aware of the work that was done in the last administration  of trying to neutralize the idea of radicalizing individuals who were  dealing with ISIS, al-Qaida, and others. Unfortunately, even that has  been taken away from the work that we have been doing. This may be a  time that that work begins to rise up as it relates to white supremacy  and white nationalism.   This legislation is a necessary and measured response to the real  threats this country faces.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, just one point that I want to make as I  yield to the author and leader on this bill is that we are continuously  fighting a known, recognized domestic terrorism. This vital bill will  provide the reporting for a roadmap to do the right thing. That is what  the Federal Government is challenged and charged to do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider). Congressman Schneider is a member of the  Judiciary Committee and is the author of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, would you share the time remaining,  please.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank my good friend from Ohio for bringing to  our attention something that I think is very important. Then, it allows  me to say that I don't know one single person in this body who condones  violent protests. I have not run into anyone in the Judiciary  Committee, and I have not seen anyone on the floor on either side of  the aisle. That is why this legislation is so crucial because it  generated bipartisan support on the work that the Congress should do.   What is it that the Congress should do? Find a way for our agencies  to work together.   In the Judiciary Committee, we had a hearing with the Attorney  General on the question of domestic terrorism. In the Homeland Security  Committee, we had a hearing on the question of domestic terrorism. I  think we found some, if you will, collegiality in recognizing that  white supremacy and white nationalism were the greatest threat to  domestic security.   I remember in this legislation the generosity of Mr. Schneider and my  commitment when the committee added Mr. Steube's--a Republican's-- amendment at markup that included findings that addressed  antigovernment actors and violence against police. We passed that in a  bipartisan way. I want to remind my colleagues that the legislation  itself was passed in a bipartisan manner.   We have seen what happens when we undermine coordination. We see what  happens when the pandemic office was dismissed out of the White House  that was coordinating with agencies on COVID-19 or other pandemics. We  see the confusion that we have.   This legislation is simply trying to make sure that our very fine  public servants who are fighting domestic terrorism are fighting it  with the best informational tools they can get.   How do they do that? With this very fine legislation that allows us  to be able to get the right kind of data.   I want to just indicate a lot of things have been happening. I have  watched peaceful protesters be subjected to violence. My heart goes  out. Those are someone's children; they are young people; and they have  a right to be protesting. They have a right, as our dear beloved  colleague has always said, to speak up. John Robert Lewis always said  to speak up and get into good trouble to make this Nation better.   I have not heard any Member of this body not condemn, in the  strongest terms, the shooting of Los Angeles deputies and are pleased  to hear that they are recovering.    I would just indicate that we need to adhere to what is right. This  legislation is laying us on a pathway of getting facts and information  so that we can do what is right to secure the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank the gentleman for his commentary, but I am going to rise and  ask my colleagues to support this legislation in a bipartisan manner.   As indicated--I would correct my friend's interpretation--Mr.  Steube's amendment was added in the markup and the findings at that  time addressed antigovernment actors and violence against police. We  made it very clear, and it was bipartisan, that we condemn violence of  any kind.   But what I would say as well is that the simple addition as it  relates to Kenosha was in sharp contrast to the visual, the video, of a  direct skin contact shooting of an individual whose back was turned,  and then the call across the Nation for white supremacists and white  nationalists to come and defend.   Defend what?   There was law enforcement there. I think the governor had even asked  for the Wisconsin National Guard to safeguard everyone.   But here was someone that came--a teenager. I am grateful that he  remained alive; grateful. But he walked with guns, and is alleged to  have killed, harmed, three people at least, never was confronted by  officers, of course, to our knowledge, and got home to sleep in his  bed.   On the other hand, Jacob Blake, whose father I met, wound up in ICU,  wound up paralyzed, a victim in the Kenosha shootings.   And so it is crucial that we get the facts of what this legislation  wants to  [[Page H4589]]  do, and that we don't get a young man from Illinois versus another  young man from Ohio, who was 12 years old--Tamir Rice--who didn't get  to go home. We want to make sure that we have fairness.   Mr. Speaker, as I said, I am very concerned about the shootings of  these individuals, the Los Angeles deputies. We don't know the motives  of the assailants. It remains unknown. But we continue to seek justice  for them, and we want to make sure that the threat of white  supremacists and domestic terrorism is known.   Mr. Speaker, this bill directs that directly and I think it will  provide for a very important tool for our law enforcement--unbiased-- without any effort to try and stigmatize anyone.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, domestic terrorism is a serious threat to  our country. We must take real action to address the rise of hate  crimes and white supremacy. This legislation would address the rising  tide of white supremacy without impinging on constitutional rights.   It reflects a careful balance between empowering the investigatory  agencies of the Federal Government to curb hateful and dangerous  incidents of domestic terrorism and protecting the rights of free  speech and assembly.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Brad Schneider for his leadership  and his diligent work on this important legislation during this  Congress. We will be better for the passage of this legislation. The  Nation will be better. It is critical that we adopt this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, passed out of the Committee on the Judiciary in a  bipartisan vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 6100) to amend title 18, United States Code, to clarify  the criminalization of female genital mutilation, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6100         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening the Opposition       to Female Genital Mutilation Act of 2020'' or the ``STOP FGM       Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) Female genital mutilation is recognized internationally       as a human rights violation and a form of child abuse, gender       discrimination, and violence against women and girls. Female       genital mutilation is a global problem whose eradication       requires international cooperation and enforcement at the       national level. The United States should demonstrate its       commitment to the rights of women and girls by leading the       way in the international community in banning this abhorrent       practice.        (2) Congress has previously prohibited the commission of       female genital mutilation on minors. Female genital       mutilation is a heinous practice that often inflicts       excruciating pain on its victims and causes them to suffer       grave physical and psychological harm.        (3) Congress has the power under article I, section 8 of       the Constitution to make all laws which shall be necessary       and proper for carrying into execution treaties entered into       by the United States.        (4) Congress also has the power under the Commerce Clause       to prohibit female genital mutilation. An international       market for the practice exists, and persons who perform       female genital mutilation in other countries typically earn a       living from doing so.        (5) Those who perform this conduct often rely on a       connection to interstate or foreign commerce, such as       interstate or foreign travel, the transmission or receipt of       communications in interstate or foreign commerce, the use of       instruments traded in interstate or foreign commerce, or       payments of any kind in furtherance of this conduct.        (6) Amending the statute to specify a link to interstate or       foreign commerce would confirm that Congress has the       affirmative power to prohibit this conduct.       SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO CURRENT LAW ON FEMALE GENITAL                     MUTILATION.         Section 116 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:        ``(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), whoever, in any       circumstance described in subsection (d), knowingly--        ``(1) performs, attempts to perform, or conspires to       perform female genital mutilation on another person who has       not attained the age of 18 years;        ``(2) being the parent, guardian, or caretaker of a person       who has not attained the age of 18 years facilitates or       consents to the female genital mutilation of such person; or        ``(3) transports a person who has not attained the age of       18 years for the purpose of the performance of female genital       mutilation on such person,      shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10       years, or both.'';        (2) by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:        ``(c) It shall not be a defense to a prosecution under this       section that female genital mutilation is required as a       matter of religion, custom, tradition, ritual, or standard       practice.'';        (3) by striking subsection (d); and        (4) by adding at the end the following:        ``(d) For the purposes of subsection (a), the circumstances       described in this subsection are that--        ``(1) the defendant or victim traveled in interstate or       foreign commerce, or traveled using a means, channel,       facility, or instrumentality of interstate or foreign       commerce, in furtherance of or in connection with the conduct       described in subsection (a);        ``(2) the defendant used a means, channel, facility, or       instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce in       furtherance of or in connection with the conduct described in       subsection (a);        ``(3) any payment of any kind was made, directly or       indirectly, in furtherance of or in connection with the       conduct described in subsection (a) using any means, channel,       facility, or instrumentality of interstate or foreign       commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce;        ``(4) the defendant transmitted in interstate or foreign       commerce any communication relating to or in furtherance of       the conduct described in subsection (a) using any means,       channel, facility, or instrumentality of interstate or       foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign       commerce by any means or in manner, including by computer,       mail, wire, or electromagnetic transmission;        ``(5) any instrument, item, substance, or other object that       has traveled in interstate or foreign commerce was used to       perform the conduct described in subsection (a);        ``(6) the conduct described in subsection (a) occurred       within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of       the United States, or any territory or possession of the       United States; or        ``(7) the conduct described in subsection (a) otherwise       occurred in or affected interstate or foreign commerce.        ``(e) For purposes of this section, the term `female       genital mutilation' means any procedure performed for non-      medical reasons that involves partial or total removal of, or       other injury to, the external female genitalia, and       includes--        ``(1) a clitoridectomy or the partial or total removal of       the clitoris or the prepuce or clitoral hood;        ``(2) excision or the partial or total removal (with or       without excision of the clitoris) of the labia minora or the       labia majora, or both;        ``(3) infibulation or the narrowing of the vaginal opening       (with or without excision of the clitoris); or        ``(4) other procedures that are harmful to the external       female genitalia, including pricking, incising, scraping, or       cauterizing the genital area.''.       SEC. 4. REPORT.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, and annually thereafter, the Attorney General, in       consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the       Secretary of State, the Secretary of Health and Human       Services, and the Secretary of Education, shall submit to       Congress a report that includes--        (1) an estimate of the number of women and girls in the       United States at risk of or who have been subjected to female       genital mutilation;        (2) the protections available and actions taken, if any, by       Federal, State, and local agencies to protect such women and       girls; and        (3) the actions taken by Federal agencies to educate and       assist communities and key stakeholders about female genital       mutilation.       SEC. 5. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.         It is the sense of the Congress that the United States       District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan erred in       invalidating the prior version of such section 116 (See       United States v. Nagarwala, 350 F. Supp. 3d 613, 631 (E.D.       Mich. 2018)). The commercial nature of female genital       mutilation (hereinafter in this section referred to as       ``FGM'') is ``self-evident,'' meaning that the ``absence of  [[Page H4590]]       particularized findings'' about the commercial nature of FGM       in the predecessor statute did not ``call into question       Congress's authority to legislate'' (Gonzales v. Raich, 545       U.S. 1, 21 (2005)). Nevertheless, the Congress has elected to       amend the FGM statute to clarify the commercial nature of the       conduct that this statute regulates. But, by doing so,       Congress does not hereby ratify the district court's       erroneous interpretation in Nagarwala.       SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a long time in coming. And I extend a  general thank you for all of the legislative bills on the Committee of  the Judiciary that have come before us today, and the staff, and the  excellent work they have done. And let me particularly thank the  Subcommittee on Crime for the great work they have done on this  legislation, strengthening the opposition to Female Genital Mutilation  Act, or STOP FGM Act, to amend current law to ensure that the horrific  practice of female genital mutilation is Federally prohibited  consistent with constitutional restraints.   Let me indicate that we have been asked to engage. It is always good  to know that the Congress can do things to fix a skewed system that  harms individuals every single day, and in this instance, it is many  young people.   Mr. Speaker, the bill would ensure that it is a Federal crime to  knowingly:   One, perform, attempt to perform, or conspire to perform female  genital mutilation or FGM on a minor;   Two, while being a parent, guardian, or caretaker of a minor,  facilitate or consent to the female genital mutilation of the minor; or   Three, transport a minor for the purpose of the performance of female  genital mutilation on the minor.   The bill would also increase the statutory maximum term of  imprisonment for a violation of the statute from 5 years to 10 years,  though these are not mandatory minimums.   The bill is necessary because a district court in Michigan recently  dismissed the first Federal prosecution under the existing FGM statute,  finding that the acts prohibited did not have a significant nexus to  interstate commerce. We had to engage in fixing this issue.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6100 addresses this issue by explicitly requiring  that one or more of the following circumstances must exist. The  defendant or victim's travel in interstate or foreign commerce, the  defendant's use of a means of interstate or foreign commerce, payment  of any kind made using any means, channel, facility or instrumentality  of interstate or foreign commerce, and the defendant's use of a means  of communication affecting interstate or foreign commerce. We are  therefore confident that this updated prohibition will pass  constitutional muster and it is critical that we take these steps to  update this statute.   Mr. Speaker, the one thing I will say is, we cannot let what is a  technical, legal act by the court to continue to provide no protection  for young, innocent victims. In the United States, approximately  500,000 women and girls were at risk for FGM or its consequences, and  more than 3 million girls are estimated to be at risk for FGM annually,  worldwide.   The U.S. Government has acknowledged the international implications  of FGM. For instance, in 2018 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  initiated Operation Limelight USA, an outreach program designed by  ICE's Homeland Security Investigations Human Rights Violators and War  Crimes Unit, and I thank them for their work to educate travelers on  the dangers and consequences of FGM.   Yes, it is being done here in the United States, in pockets around  the Nation, where these women are mutilated for life. These girls, at a  very young age, are mutilated for life in the United States, where we  have been discussing on this floor your due process, the sanctity of  your own body, your privacy rights under the Ninth Amendment.   In addition, both the FBI and the Human Rights and Special  Prosecutions Section of the Criminal Division of the Department of  Justice work domestically to prosecute and investigate cases involving  FGM. We want to give them the tools that they can use to get it right.   Federal law enforcement agencies acknowledge that FGM is a global  issue and they work with international partners to eliminate this  horrific practice. FGM, therefore, is considered to have a substantial  effect on interstate commerce because, although illegal, there is an  established interstate and international market for the practice.   I include in the Record an article about female genital mutilation.                      [From CNN Health, May 11, 2017]         3 US Women Share the Horrors of Female Genital Mutilation                              (By Sonia Moghe)         East Lansing, Michigan (CNN)--Rahel Musa Aron was just 7       days old when the elders of her community in the African       nation of Eritrea performed a centuries-old ritual on her       tiny body, cutting off her clitoris and burying it.        Nearly six decades later, the Christian church leader and       mother of three daughters sits at home in this Midwestern       city and wonders.        What would the small sliver of skin have meant for her       life? Would childbirth have been different? Has she been       missing out on a deeper level of intimacy with her husband of       40 years?        ``I'm sure that it has affected my feeling,'' Aron, 58,       told CNN. ``If it was not cut, maybe I would have enjoyed       whatever I would have enjoyed. It's a very sensitive area. So       if that's cut, imagine--imagine what I miss.''        Often discussed in whispers, the issue of female genital       mutilation grabbed headlines last month when, for the first       time, US prosecutors used a decades-old law that bans the       practice to charge two Detroit-area doctors and a medical       office manager in a case involving two 7-year-old girls. Now,       several women in the United States who endured the procedure       when they were young are sharing their stories--all with       elements that mirror the Michigan case--in hopes of ending it       for good.        When her own daughters were born, Aron decided the custom       endured by her mother and her grandmother would die with her.        ``What I believe is, if (the clitoris) wasn't necessary,       God wouldn't have put it there,'' said Aron, a deaconess at       St. Luke Lutheran in Lansing, Michigan. ``If it was not       important, it would have not been there. It's part of our       body. It is there for a reason.''        Aron's scars aren't as severe as those borne by many of the       200 million women and girls around the globe--nearly a       quarter of them younger than 15--who have undergone the       practice, dubbed FGM or, to some survivors who dislike that       phrase, female ritual cutting.        The procedure, in which genital organs are altered or       injured for non-medical reasons to suppress sexuality, long       has been deemed a human rights violation. It's practiced at       all educational levels and social classes and among people of       many faiths, including Muslims and Christians, though no       religious text calls for it.        Though often undertaken as a cleansing custom, experts       roundly agree it has no medical benefits--and carries myriad       health risks, from childbirth and menstrual complications to       severe infections, post-traumatic stress, even death.        Still, the practice persists, mostly in African and Middle       Eastern nations--and in the United States, where the       estimated number of girls and women who have undergone it or       are at risk has tripled since 1990 to more than 500,000. The       increase reflects rapid growth in immigration from countries       where FGM is common.        While anti-cutting advocates hail efforts to hold offenders       accountable, this case also raises questions about whether       the accused--all members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect of Shia       Islam--are being targeted because of their faith. Meanwhile,       some worry that high-profile prosecutions could drive the       practice deeper underground, further endangering the very       girls and women the law aims to protect.        As the issue has gained attention, Immigration and Customs       Enforcement and the FBI opened national tip lines where       anyone  [[Page H4591]]       can report their experience or suspicions. But as several       advocates told CNN, the most important conversations may be       happening in homes and places of worship, as survivors share       their stories and work to end FGM.        ``This thing,'' Aron said, ``needs to be talked about.''                            `Special girls' trip'         The FBI started looking into the Detroit-area case in       October, when investigators learned that female genital       mutilation was being performed at the Burhani Medical Clinic.       Investigators in February learned that two 7-year-old girls       from Minnesota went to the clinic with their mothers for a       ``special girls' trip'' that they weren't to tell anyone       about, documents show. One girl told the FBI their mothers       took them to the clinic because ``our tummies hurt'' and a       doctor would ``get the germs out.''        There were three people in the office, ``one to clean up       and two to hold (the child's) hands,'' the girl later told       investigators. The FBI says they were local emergency room       physician Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, clinic director Dr.       Fakhruddin Attar and his wife, Farida Attar, who managed the       office in Livonia, Michigan, court records show.        The girl said she took off her pants and underwear and laid       on an exam table with her knees near her chest and legs       spread apart, documents show.        Nagarwala then gave her a ``little pinch'' in the area       ``where we go pee.'' She said the doctor told her and her       friend ``no bikes and no splits for three days,'' and the day       after the procedure, the area ``hurted a lot.''        The girl said she and her friend got cake afterward because       ``they were doing good,'' documents show. An exam found the       girl's labia minora removed or altered, her clitoral hood       looking abnormal, plus scar tissue and small healing cuts,       court records show.        The Attars and Nagarwala each face two counts of female       genital mutilation, one count of conspiracy to commit female       genital mutilation, and one count of conspiracy to obstruct       an official proceeding. The physicians could face life in       prison if convicted.        ``This brutal practice is conducted on girls for one       reason: to control them as women,'' Daniel Lemisch, acting US       Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said in a       statement. ``FGM will not be tolerated in the United       States.''        But attorneys for the accused say their clients are being       persecuted for practicing their religion. Nagarwala has       pleaded not guilty on all counts; the Attars have not entered       pleas, but their attorneys argue they are not guilty of all       the charges.                  Cleansing ritual not illegal, lawyer says         Nagarwala acknowledges performing a procedure on both       girls, her lawyer, Shannon Smith, said. But it wasn't female       genital mutilation, she said, according to court documents;       it was a non-invasive, religious cleansing ritual in the       Dawoodi Bohra tradition, rooted in India.        Nagarwala, who has been terminated from her job at Henry       Ford Health System in light of this case, claims she used a       long scraper-like tool to wipe a small portion of mucus       membrane from the girls' clitorises, then put the membrane       onto gauze for their parents to bury, Smith said, adding that       her client denies removing tissue and says there was no       blood, documents show.        The political environment surrounding the federal       prosecution concerns Dina Francesca Haynes, a human rights       attorney who has worked on hundreds of FGM cases.        ``During a time when vigilantism and xenophobia (are) high,       the likelihood that doctors of particular national origins       would be targeted seems to also be an additional risk,''       Haynes told CNN. ``It makes me uncomfortable that the first       prosecution here looks like it's focusing on a particular       community of people.''        Haynes doesn't like when ``my human rights issues are used       for a bigger agenda,'' she said.        Leaders of the Dawoodi Bohra mosque in Michigan, one of       several hubs of the sect in the United States, said in a       statement that they offered to help investigators.        ``Any violation of US law is counter to instructions to our       community members,'' they said. ``It is an important rule of       the Dawoodi Bohras that we respect the laws of the land,       wherever we live. This is precisely what we have done for       several generations in America. We remind our members       regularly of their obligations.''        CNN's calls to mosques attended by the girls' parents and       the defendants were not returned.                            `Never talk about it'         This case has caught the attention of FGM survivors across       the country, who share a common story: They were cut at a       young age and told not to speak of it.        In 1947, Renee Bergstrom was 3, living with her white,       fundamentalist Christian family in rural Minnesota. When her       mother saw her toddler touching herself, she worried.        ``So, she took me to a doctor who said, `I can fix that,'       and removed my clitoris,'' Bergstrom told CNN.        Bergstrom remembers seeing her mother at the end of the       table. She remembers the pain. And she remembers feeling       betrayed.        ``Later the day it happened, . . . she carried me around       until I quit crying,'' Bergstrom said. ``Even when I was very       little, she told me it was a mistake, but I was to never talk       about it.''        Now, nearly 70 years later, Bergstrom said the procedure       affected her entire life. Severe scarring fused part of her       labia; the skin wouldn't stretch when it came time to deliver       her three children.        Now Bergstrom has teamed up with another survivor in       Minnesota, a Somali woman, to spread awareness in the area's       large Somali community. They give pamphlets to expectant       mothers who survived the procedure so they can help their       doctors understand birthing options.        As she works to help immigrants from a country where FGM is       almost universal and where Islam is the law, Bergstrom said       she is concerned about Muslims being targeted in the United       States over the practice.        ``This was done (to me) in white America by a       fundamentalist Christian doctor who practiced his religion       with a scalpel,'' she said. ``I am disturbed by the anti-      Muslim sentiment throughout the United States. I didn't want       this to be another form of discrimination against Muslims.''                        `Complicated form of violence'         The father of one girl in the federal case told       investigators, ``If they knew what would come of it, this       would never have happened,'' documents show.        None of the parents in this case faces charges--and it's       possible they never will.        ``The reality is, if you want children to report this . . .       some people would argue that it would deter young girls and       young women from seeking health care,'' Haynes said.       ``Children tend to rally around their parents and other       adults in their life that they trust and wouldn't think to       report any kind of abuse until later.''        For many survivors, coming to terms with their mothers'       decisions to promote the practice is complex.        Mariya Taher was 7 when she went on vacation to Mumbai,       India, with her parents. She remembers walking into an       apartment with her mother. The atmosphere felt relaxed, with       older aunties there, too. She even laughed. She was the only       little girl there.        ``Then, I remember, I was on the floor and my dress was       pushed in,'' Taher recalled. ``I remember feeling something       sharp and crying afterwards. One of the older women gave me a       soda. That's all I remember of it.''        Taher, now 34, said it wasn't until she was a teenager that       she read about FGM in Africa and realized what had happened       to her. Her scarring was minimal. All the same, she said, it       was a violation.        ``I honestly had a great childhood, so it's really hard for       me to talk about this,'' she said. ``I feel that people paint       me as the picture of a victim, and I hate that. Yes, that was       a violent thing that was done to me, but it's also such a       complicated form of violence.''        Taher, whose mother and grandmother also endured cutting,       lives in Massachusetts and co-founded Sahiyo, an organization       that works to end the practice in the Dawoodi Bohra       community. She helps women tell their stories--of being cut,       of deciding not to cut, of pretending to have been cut in       order to fit in--through social media.        Years later, she also has realized perhaps the most       personal achievement of her work: She convinced her mother to       oppose FGM.        ``We've had continual conversations,'' Taher said. ``I've       never blamed her.''    Congress has the power under the Commerce Clause to  prohibit FGM, and that is why I was very glad to be the author and  sponsor of this legislation by introducing this--what the cosponsors  and I believe--is an important bipartisan bill.   My former colleague, Congressman Crowley of New York, worked with me  on this for many, many years. Our goal is to protect all women and  girls from the practice of FGM and to provide the Justice Department  with an effective means of prosecuting those who commit this terrible  act. That is why I support this legislation and authored this  legislation at the same time.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary  and on Homeland Security, and the Congressional Black Caucus, and as  the bill sponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6100, the  ``Strengthening the Opposition to Female Genital Mutilation Act of  2020,'' which I introduced with the Congressman Bacon of Nebraska, the  lead cosponsor.   I want thank Chairman Nadler for his tremendous leadership during  this Congress and the past several months of hardship, stress, and  disruption not only of the regular normalized operations of this  Committee but of the Congress and more importantly, the lives of the  American people.   It has been said of Americans that we do the difficult immediately,  and the impossible takes a little longer.   The legislative session today is a testament to the determination of  this Committee that despite the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed  the life of over 200,000 Americans, that legislation to improve the  lives of the people we represent and the communities we serve will not  be halted.   The problems facing ordinary Americans due to flaws and inequities in  the criminal justice system, the immigration system, the health care  system, the economy, the trademark system and others do not take a  time-out because of the pandemic and neither does  [[Page H4592]]  this Congress, and for that I commend Speaker Pelosi, the House  Democratic leadership, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, female genital mutilation (FGM) is an abhorrent practice  and a recognizable international human rights violation.   H.R. 6100, the STOP FGM Act is necessary remedial legislative  modifying current law to aid women in several important respects.   Specifically, the legislation would:   1. Amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 116 by setting forth three groups of persons  who can be prosecuted under the statute: (1) anyone who performs,  attempts to perform, or conspires to perform, female genital mutilation  on a minor; (2) a parent, guardian, or caretaker of a minor who  facilitates or consents to the female genital mutilation of the minor;  and (3) anyone who transports a minor for the purpose of performance of  female genital mutilation on the minor;   2. Increase the statutory maximum for a violation of the statute,  from 5 years to 10 years;   3. Prohibit a defendant charged with this offense from using as a  defense the argument that they were compelled to commit the offense  because of religion, custom, tradition, ritual, or standard practice;  and   4. Amend the existing statute to more explicitly define what types of  procedures constitute female genital mutilation.   Most significantly, the STOP FGM Act enables us to better address FGM  more comprehensively in the United States by requiring the Attorney  General, in consultation with other federal agencies, to submit an  annual report to Congress, to include the number of women and girls in  the United States at risk of FGM; the protections available and actions  taken; and the education and assistance provided to communities about  FGM.   Mr. Speaker, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) there  are no positive health benefits from practice of FGM and the procedure  can have severe long-term impacts on the physical, psychological,  sexual, and reproductive health of girls and women.   Earlier this year, on Sunday, March 8, we celebrated International  Women's Day, which is designed to help nations worldwide eliminate  discrimination against women.   International Women's Day focuses on helping women gain full and  equal participation in global development.   The practice of FGM violates girls' and women's rights to sexual and  reproductive health, security and physical integrity, their right to be  free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and their  right to life when the procedure results in death.   In order for little girls to live their best lives as strong,  empowered women, we must protect them now as girls, to give them a  fighting chance.   The bipartisan STOP FGM Act takes a big and positive step in that  direction.   Mr. Speaker, in 2017, Dr. Nagarwala, a Michigan doctor performed this  brutal act on several minors.   The U.S. Department of Justice then prosecuted her and others for  violating the law.   It was the first federal case of its kind brought under the existing  statute.   Nagarwala challenged the law, and the district court agreed and found  that the statute was unconstitutional and that FGM is a `purely local  crime.'   However, according to the World Health Organization, it is estimated  that more than 200 million girls and women alive today have undergone  female genital mutilation.   Further, there are an estimated 3 million girls at risk of undergoing  female genital mutilation every year.   Because of the manner in which female genital mutilation is being  practiced in the United States, it affects interstate and foreign  commerce, the regulation of which the Constitution entrusts to the  Congress in Article I, section 8, clause 3.   Therefore, Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause, as  well as Necessary and Proper Clause contained in Article I, section 8,  clause 17, to regulate, restrict, and even prohibit the practice of  FG Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I emphasize that the practice of FGM violates girls' and  women's rights to sexual and reproductive health, security, and  physical integrity, their right to be free from torture and cruel or  inhumane or degrading treatment, and their right to life when the  procedure results in death.   Let me be very clear: This is international, but it is happening in  the United States, and I think it is important for this Nation to stand  up to this dastardly act.   According to the World Health Organization, it is estimated that more  than 200 million girls and women alive today have undergone female  genital mutilation. Further, there are an estimated 3 million girls at  risk of undergoing female genital mutilation every year.   And because of the manner in which female genital mutilation is being  practiced in the United States, it affects interstate and foreign  commerce, the regulation which the Constitution entrusts in the  Constitution in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3.   Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful to the Committee on the Judiciary's  staff for working together with me and my office, making this  legislation a real fix. Therefore, Congress has the authority under the  Commerce Clause, as well as the necessary and proper clause contained  in Article I, Section 8, to fix this, and that is what we have done.   Again, let me thank the chairman and ranking member of the full  committee and of the subcommittees, and all of the Members, for  supporting this legislation.   The STOP FGM Act is a critical measure to protect the health and  safety of girls in our communities and to ensure that those who would  engage in this horrific practice do not go unpunished.   This is bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me  in supporting this legislation and voting to stop these dastardly acts.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5309) to prohibit discrimination based on an  individual's texture or style of hair, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5309         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Creating a Respectful and       Open World for Natural Hair Act of 2020'' or the ``CROWN Act       of 2020''.  [[Page H4593]]            SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Throughout United States history, society has used (in       conjunction with skin color) hair texture and hairstyle to       classify individuals on the basis of race.        (2) Like one's skin color, one's hair has served as a basis       of race and national origin discrimination.        (3) Racial and national origin discrimination can and do       occur because of longstanding racial and national origin       biases and stereotypes associated with hair texture and       style.        (4) For example, routinely, people of African descent are       deprived of educational and employment opportunities because       they are adorned with natural or protective hairstyles in       which hair is tightly coiled or tightly curled, or worn in       locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, or Afros.        (5) Racial and national origin discrimination is reflected       in school and workplace policies and practices that bar       natural or protective hairstyles commonly worn by people of       African descent.        (6) For example, as recently as 2018, the United States       Armed Forces had grooming policies that barred natural or       protective hairstyles that servicewomen of African descent       commonly wear and that described these hairstyles as       ``unkempt''.        (7) In 2018, the United States Armed Forces rescinded these       policies and recognized that this description perpetuated       derogatory racial stereotypes.        (8) The United States Armed Forces also recognized that       prohibitions against natural or protective hairstyles that       African-American servicewomen are commonly adorned with are       racially discriminatory and bear no relationship to African-      American servicewomen's occupational qualifications and their       ability to serve and protect the Nation.        (9) As a type of racial or national origin discrimination,       discrimination on the basis of natural or protective       hairstyles that people of African descent are commonly       adorned with violates existing Federal law, including       provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e       et seq.), section 1977 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C.       1981), and the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.).       However, some Federal courts have misinterpreted Federal       civil rights law by narrowly interpreting the meaning of race       or national origin, and thereby permitting, for example,       employers to discriminate against people of African descent       who wear natural or protective hairstyles even though the       employment policies involved are not related to workers'       ability to perform their jobs.        (10) Applying this narrow interpretation of race or       national origin has resulted in a lack of Federal civil       rights protection for individuals who are discriminated       against on the basis of characteristics that are commonly       associated with race and national origin.        (11) In 2019 and 2020, State legislatures and municipal       bodies throughout the United States have introduced and       passed legislation that rejects certain Federal courts'       restrictive interpretation of race and national origin, and       expressly classifies race and national origin discrimination       as inclusive of discrimination on the basis of natural or       protective hairstyles commonly associated with race and       national origin.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Federal Government should acknowledge that       individuals who have hair texture or wear a hairstyle that is       historically and contemporarily associated with African       Americans or persons of African descent systematically suffer       harmful discrimination in schools, workplaces, and other       contexts based upon longstanding race and national origin       stereotypes and biases;        (2) a clear and comprehensive law should address the       systematic deprivation of educational, employment, and other       opportunities on the basis of hair texture and hairstyle that       are commonly associated with race or national origin;        (3) clear, consistent, and enforceable legal standards must       be provided to redress the widespread incidences of race and       national origin discrimination based upon hair texture and       hairstyle in schools, workplaces, housing, federally funded       institutions, and other contexts;        (4) it is necessary to prevent educational, employment, and       other decisions, practices, and policies generated by or       reflecting negative biases and stereotypes related to race or       national origin;        (5) the Federal Government must play a key role in       enforcing Federal civil rights laws in a way that secures       equal educational, employment, and other opportunities for       all individuals regardless of their race or national origin;        (6) the Federal Government must play a central role in       enforcing the standards established under this Act on behalf       of individuals who suffer race or national origin       discrimination based upon hair texture and hairstyle;        (7) it is necessary to prohibit and provide remedies for       the harms suffered as a result of race or national origin       discrimination on the basis of hair texture and hairstyle;       and        (8) it is necessary to mandate that school, workplace, and       other applicable standards be applied in a nondiscriminatory       manner and to explicitly prohibit the adoption or       implementation of grooming requirements that       disproportionately impact people of African descent.        (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to institute       definitions of race and national origin for Federal civil       rights laws that effectuate the comprehensive scope of       protection Congress intended to be afforded by such laws and       Congress' objective to eliminate race and national origin       discrimination in the United States.

SEC. 9. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5309, the Creating a  Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair Act of 2020, or CROWN Act of  2020.   This important bill explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis  of hair texture and hairstyles commonly associated with a particular  race or national origin in employment, housing, federally funded  programs, public accommodations, and the making and enforcement of  contracts.   I rise to thank the sponsor of this bill, Congressman Cedric Richmond  of Louisiana, for his leadership and his vision and, really, gathering  all of the proponents with all of their efforts to be able to get this  bill to move as quickly as it has done.   To be clear, it is my view that existing civil rights statutes that  prohibit discrimination on the basis of race or natural origin may  already make such kinds of hair-based discrimination unlawful, but it  is crucial that we are absolutely sure.   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission agrees, having issued  guidance interpreting title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to  prohibit discrimination based on hairstyle or texture as a form of race  discrimination in certain instances. Unfortunately, several Federal  courts have erroneously rejected this interpretation, which is why we  must pass H.R. 5309.   Personally, coming from the State of Texas, I am aware of a heinous,  devastating impact on a young man who had dreadlocks. Apparently, the  school district could not find title VII, did not understand the law,  and he did not experience the benefit of the law, being suspended and  not being able to graduate. That was a dastardly action, and we are all  sufferers for that happening to that young man who didn't deserve it.   This legislation will leave no ambiguity that, in key areas where  Federal law prohibits race and national origin discrimination,  discrimination based on an individual's hair texture or hairstyle, if  they are commonly associated with a particular race or national origin,  is unlawful.   The history of discrimination based on race and national origin in  this country is, sadly, older than the country itself, and we are still  living with the consequences today.   Congress took a pivotal step in the fight against racism and  discrimination when it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibiting  discrimination on the basis of race and national origin, as well as  other characteristics in key areas of life.   This law did not eliminate discrimination entirely. One cannot  legislate away hate. But it provided critical recourse for those who  face discrimination, and it made clear that the government has a  compelling interest in fighting discrimination.   Even Dr. Martin Luther King said that he might not be able to change  hearts, but he could change laws. This is what we are doing today.   We cannot fool ourselves into thinking that discrimination is no  longer alive and well; however, the recent protests over police  brutality, systemic racism, and institutional racism have forced many  who would rather look the other way to confront the continuing and  pervasive legacy of racism in our country.   While racism and discrimination still take many blatantly obvious  forms, they also manifest themselves in more subtle ways. One form is  discrimination based on natural hairstyles and hair textures associated  with people of African descent.   I think you can take a national survey, go across the country in all  50 States and find someone who is of African descent, and they will  tell you about the response to either their beards and hairstyles, as  relates to men, and to women and their hairstyles.   According to a 2019 study of Black and non-Black women conducted by  the JOY Collective, Black people are disproportionately burdened by  policies and practices in public places, including the workplace, that  target, profile, or single them out for natural hairstyles and other  hairstyles traditionally associated with their race, like braids, locs,  and twists.   Often, those hairstyles are protective hairstyles--hairstyles that  tuck the ends of one's hair away and minimize manipulation and exposure  to the weather--and can play an important role in helping to keep one's  hair healthy. They can be utilitarian, and we are denied that right to  have a hairstyle that is utilitarian. That may be dreadlocks and braids  and various other styles that are neatly placed on one's head, the  crown.   These findings are bolstered by numerous reports of incidents in  recent years showing that this form of discrimination is common. For  example, in 2017, a Banana Republic employee was told by a manager that  she had violated the company's dress code because her box braids were  too urban and unkempt.   A year later, a New Jersey high school student was forced by a White  referee to either have his dreadlocks cut or forfeit a wrestling match,  ultimately leading to a league official humiliatingly cutting the  student's hair in public immediately before the match.   Let me just pause for a moment. Any of us who raised children, a son  or a daughter, has that image in our heart, in our DNA. That picture  has gone viral. It is still there. That young man can be 30 or 40 or  50, and you will see his commitment to wrestling on behalf of his  school and his team. And in the public eye, he is having one of the  most sacred parts of anyone's experience--your hair--being cut publicly  for the world to view. I just feel a pain right now seeing that young  man do that. His parents were not there, or had no ability to respond,  but he had the courage to get it done so that he could compete with his  teammates.   In that same year, an 11-year-old Black girl was asked to leave class  at a school near New Orleans because her braided hair extensions  violated the school's policy.    Unfortunately, research shows that such discrimination is pervasive.  The JOY Collective study found that Black women are more likely than  non-Black women to have received formal grooming policies in the  workplace and that Black women's hairstyles were consistently rated to  be lower or ``less ready'' for job performance than non-Black  hairstyles by substantial margins.   In view of these disturbing facts, seven States--California, New  York, New Jersey, Virginia, Colorado, Washington, and Maryland--have  enacted State versions of the CROWN Act, in every case with bipartisan  support, sometimes even with unanimous support of both parties. I know  my State is finally going to attempt to do so in the next legislative  session in the State house.   While I applaud these States for taking this necessary step, this is  a matter of basic justice that deals with Federal law, civil rights,  title VII, that demands a national solution by this Congress. I am glad  that we are where we are today.   Additionally, the United States military has recognized the racially  disparate impact of seemingly neutral  [[Page H4595]]  grooming policies on persons of African ancestry, particularly Black  women. For this reason, in 2017, the Army repealed a grooming  regulation prohibiting women servicemembers from wearing their hair in  dreadlocks, and, in 2015, the Marine Corps issued regulations to permit  loc and twist hairstyles. None of that impacts your service to this  Nation.   I thank the gentleman from Louisiana again, Representative Cedric  Richmond, for introducing and championing this important bill and for  his leadership on this issue.   I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 5309, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me indicate that I want to thank the previous  speaker for raising his concerns.   I think what I would like to offer to him is that people have been  suffering these indignities for decades. Natural hair is coming back.  We called it Afros. And anyone who wore an Afro in a certain era knows  how they were confronted and looked at. There were vast numbers of  people wearing Afros, whether males or females, individuals of African  descent. I am a living witness, and we are living witnesses to that.   So I do want to make the point that it is not redundant. I will make  this point again. But in 2016, the Eleventh Circuit rejected the EEOC's  argument that existing law prohibits hair discrimination as a proxy for  race discrimination.   What I did say, as we worked together, Mr. Armstrong--I appreciate  his commentary and his leadership--is that we are here to fix things,  and here we have that the Eleventh Circuit would not accept that.   So I thank the gentleman for raising the concern, and I think  Chairman Nadler looked at this carefully and subcommittee chairpersons  looked at this carefully and knew that we had to proceed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lee), who is a distinguished senior member on the Appropriations  Committee but, more importantly, has, I think, had her own life  experience and has fought throughout her life for civil rights, civil  justice, and ensuring that the most vulnerable will have a voice.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my good friend from North  Dakota, and even my good friend from Ohio. But as I close, let me,  first of all, indicate this couldn't be a more important bill. I heard  on the floor someone talk about this being redundant.   Whenever we can have civil rights, equal rights, and equality as  being redundant, then America is doing the right thing. Whenever we can  clarify the 11th Circuit that rejected the EEOC's argument that  existing law prohibits hair discrimination as a proxy for race  discrimination, whenever we can clarify that--whenever we can save the  dignity, the hurt, and sometimes the ruination of people who simply  because of the color of their skin and the kind of hair that they have,  ruins their life or disallows them from graduating or have a public  shedding of their hair for the world to see so that they can support  their team.   Whenever we are able to fix that on the floor of the House, I think  we should do it.   And I take issue with my good friend from Ohio, we have the  legislative Record. We have condemned any violence against law  enforcement officers, and we mourn and ensure that the world knows that  we are praying for and have indicated our condemnation of the shooting  of the two officers in California and wish for their speedy recovery.  And, as well, I want to make sure that all those who are shown to have  done this are quickly brought to justice. That is in the legislative  history.   We also recognize that the issues dealing with Kenosha are unique  and, therefore, we are sorry that Tamir Rice did not get the  opportunity as a young boy, just as this 17-year-old, who was clearly  engaged with white supremacy and white nationalism, came to this place  to do harm, which he did. Tamir Rice was just a 12-year-old boy in a  park.   So I don't think you can equate the two, and I don't think you can  suggest that we are not supposed to respond to domestic terrorism.   So let me indicate, Mr. Speaker, that I do want to thank Mr.  Richmond, Ms. Fudge, Ms. Pressley, and as my colleague mentioned, the  late John Robert Lewis, who was always looking for good trouble and to  do what is right as a cosponsor of this legislation.   H.R. 5309 is an important piece of legislation that will help further  ensure that hairstyles and hair extremes commonly associated with a  particular race or national origin cannot be used as proxies for race  or national origin discrimination.   Such discrimination should already be prohibited by Federal civil  rights statutes, but unfortunately some Federal courts have interpreted  these statutes so narrowly as to effectively permit using hair  discrimination as a proxy for race or national origin discrimination.  H.R. 5309 corrects this erroneous interpretation and further extends  justice and equality for all.  [[Page H4597]]    Mr. Speaker, I just want to put into the Record the plight of two  students in the Barbers Hill Independent School District in my State  where these two outstanding students, athletes, good academic students,  were humiliated because their tradition was to wear dreadlocks, and  they were suspended. And one or maybe two of them were not able to walk  with their class. Humiliation. Discrimination that never got corrected.  So today, for them we correct it. DeAndre Arnold, we correct it. We  acknowledge that you deserve your civil rights.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to pass H.R. 5309, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.
