 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of H.R. 1699. I  spent 40 years of my career developing land and actually buying  manufactured housing, which makes it possible for families who cannot  afford a stick-built home, in many cases, to be able to buy a  manufactured house. I have seen firsthand the critical role that  manufactured housing plays in the development of local communities and  the ability for a family to buy their first home.   As we have seen far too often, regulatory overreach by the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau has impeded and stopped, in many cases, the  ability for consumers to receive financing for manufactured housing,  and has placed unnecessary requirements on retailers. This legislation  addresses this overreach by making commonsense reforms to increase the  availability and financing for manufactured housing, while maintaining  important protections for consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
