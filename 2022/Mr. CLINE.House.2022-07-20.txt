 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an incredible  achievement in youth sports. The Amherst All Star Darlings, a girls'  youth softball team of 7- and 8-year-olds, just finished their season  undefeated.   After winning both the district and State championships, they have  set their eyes on Cochran-Bleckley, Georgia, where the girls' softball  world series will be played later this month.   These young ladies worked hard and enjoyed the competition, and their  determination to win throughout the length of their season has been  unmatched.   Now, they are planning and working toward making their trip to  Georgia possible to get the chance to make this Cinderella story a  reality.   Their efforts are a story of camaraderie, hard work, and laying the  foundation for a bright future not only in sports but in all of their  future endeavors.   Amherst has been a special part of the Sixth District for decades,  and it has been an honor to represent the people of Amherst, first in  Richmond and now in Washington. The Sixth District, along with the  entire Commonwealth of Virginia, will be cheering them on when they  compete on July 31 in the Dixie youth softball league world series.   Congratulations to the Amherst All Star Darlings for representing  friends and family, the Amherst community, and the entire Commonwealth  of Virginia so well.                            ____________________
