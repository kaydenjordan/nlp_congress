 Mr. Speaker, last week, 44 attorneys general  filed a lawsuit in Federal court against 20 generic drugmakers,  alleging market manipulation and price-fixing.   The American people's tax dollars are invested in unprofitable basic  research that is essential to bringing highly profitable drugs to  market. The United States Government is also a huge purchaser of these  generic drugs.   In some cases, it is alleged that one company sets the price of a  drug and the others follow, without the cost-cutting influence of  competition. All of this resulted in billions of dollars in harm to  patients and the U.S. economy.   Congress must stop this price-fixing scheme and will vote this week  to approve legislation to end this price-fixing and market manipulation  perpetuated by these generic drugmakers.                            ____________________
