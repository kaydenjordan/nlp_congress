 Madam Speaker, as an avid basketball player, it gives me  great pleasure to recognize the exceptional achievements of the high  school basketball players in Northwest Indiana this past year, who  safely showed up and put in the effort during the challenges of this  health pandemic.   I also want to recognize the following programs who represented our  region during the semi-State and beyond this past season.   First, congratulations to the Lady Bulldogs of Crown Point High  School women's basketball team, who won the Indiana High School  Athletic Association's 4A State Championship.   Congratulations also to the Gary West Side High School men's  basketball team who won their regional championship game to advance to  Indiana's Class 4A Semi-State.   And congratulations to the Kouts High School men's basketball team  for winning their Semi-State Championship for the first time in the  school's history.   Madam Speaker, please join me in recognizing these outstanding young  athletes for their skill, tremendous hard work, and dedication to the  game. They make all of Northwest Indiana and their schools, families,  and communities so very proud.                            ____________________
