 Mr. Chairman, I thank our Republican lead  on the Energy and Commerce Committee for yielding. I appreciate the  gentleman's leadership on this important issue.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to voice my support for true bipartisan  efforts to reduce prescription drug costs. Seniors, patients, and  families in my district and all across America are counting on us so  that they can afford their medication and have the certainty that they  need.   On the Energy and Commerce Committee, we have led. Republicans and  Democrats on our committee have been working together on provisions to  bring generic drugs to the market faster by incentivizing more  competition among generic manufacturers.   We recently passed three drug-pricing bills with overwhelming,  bipartisan support. These are three solutions that President Trump  stands ready to sign, and we should send them to his desk.   This is an opportunity to build on the bipartisan work from the last  Congress to lower drug costs and keep our promises to the American  people. Remember, just last fall, President Trump signed our bipartisan  bill to ban the gag clauses so patients can save on prescriptions and  trust they are getting the best price.   Again, we should build on that work. That is what the people elected  us to do; that is what they expect; and that is what they deserve.                                time  1330    So, what has changed, and where are we today?   The new majority--at the expense of patients, seniors, and families-- is playing politics with lowering the costs of prescription drugs.   H.R. 987 includes our bipartisan bills, but my colleagues across the  aisle have packaged them with very partisan bills to bail out  ObamaCare.   These partisan proposals would restrict access to healthcare coverage  and stop the administration's work to reduce wasteful spending on  programs that aren't working.   The Washington Post called these poison bills a political pothole. We  don't need any more political potholes. We need real reforms that the  President will sign. This is a ploy, and it is just the latest.   The Energy and Commerce Committee has historically been the most  bipartisan committee in the House, putting more bipartisan legislation  on the President's desk than any other.   I am disappointed that we have found ourselves here.
