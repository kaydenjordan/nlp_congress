 Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.    Madam President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceedings.    Madam President, January 6 was only a few months ago.  The memory is still fresh for all of us who experienced it firsthand.   A violent mob stormed the citadel of democracy, assaulted our Capitol  police, and tried to halt the peaceful transfer of power. One hundred  forty officers were injured. Five people would eventually lose their  lives in connection to the attack.   I was within 20 feet of these hooligans.   It was one of the darkest moments in American democracy--the first  time the Capitol was breached since the War of 1812, over 200 years  ago. And yet, not 5 months later, many on the Republican side are  trying to whitewash what happened.   Here is what one Senate Republican said about the attack last night:  ``By and large, it was peaceful protests . . . except for a few  agitators,'' he said. ``Even calling this an insurrection'' was wrong.   If there was ever a justification for creating a bipartisan  Commission to study and report on the truth behind the attack of  January 6, the comments of that Senator provide it.   Republicans in both Chambers are trying to rewrite history in fealty  to or in fear of the former President, Donald Trump. Republicans in  both Chambers are trying to erase the memory of January 6 and  perpetuate the Big Lie. They are now likening the mob on January 6 to a  group of ``normal tourists.'' Anyone who has seen the pictures of them  breaking through the Capitol barriers knows that these weren't normal  tourists.   They are calling the mob, not the police, the victims of the attack.  We have dead and injured police officers, and they are calling the mob  the victims?   Only a week ago, the House Republicans fired Congresswoman Cheney for  the crime of merely repeating the truth about the election. It  certainly wasn't about policy. Congresswoman Cheney voted with  President Trump far more than the Member who replaced her. She was  fired because she stood up to the Big Lie. It was a Thomas More moment  here in 2020, and all of the shameful comments by Republicans  [[Page S3174]]  reveal that a bipartisan Commission is even more necessary than it once  was.   We always needed to look into it, but the fact that there is such  denial, there is such lying, and there is such obeisance to Donald  Trump's Big Lie and to his fundamentally dishonest personality, makes  the need for the truth, for a Commission greater than it ever has been.  For the sake of our democracy, it is crucial to end the poison of the  Big Lie, to establish an independent and trusted record of what  transpired, and to make sure an event like January 6 never, never  happens again.   Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed legislation  establishing just such a Commission with a strong bipartisan vote.  Thirty-five Republicans joined Democrats in approving the measure,  defying their leadership, who turned tail at the eleventh hour in an  act of utter spinelessness.   Last night and now--just now--I began the rule XIV process that would  make this legislation available for consideration on the floor of the  Senate. I just moved to place the legislation for a Commission on the  floor under rule XIV. It is my intention to bring the bipartisan  legislation for the January 6 Commission up for a vote.   My Senate Republican colleagues must now ask themselves: Are they  going to join us in pursuing the truth or are they going to cover for  Donald Trump and his Big Lie? I understand the Republican leader has  decided to oppose the bill. The Republican leader, who called the  January 6 attack a ``disgrace,'' who said he believed there was ``no  question'' Donald Trump was ``morally responsible'' for the attacks,  now finds this whole endeavor unnecessary.   Of course, that wasn't always the case. In the aftermath of the  Capitol attack, the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, said we  needed a ``serious and thorough review'' of the attacks, but very  quickly the goalposts started to move. A few weeks after the attack,  Republicans started complaining that the Democratic proposals for  establishing a Commission were too partisan. When Democrats accepted  all the changes--all the changes--requested by House Republicans, the  Senate Republican leader said that his conference was undecided but  ``willing to listen.'' But now, once again, the goalposts have shifted.  Now the Republican leader believes we don't need a bipartisan  Commission at all.   Let me be very clear to my Republican colleagues: There is no good  justification for opposing the Commission. The Commission is not  partisan. It will have a 50-50 split of Democrats and Republicans with  subpoena powers requiring cooperation from both sides. It was  negotiated on a bipartisan basis by both the chairman and the ranking  member of the House Homeland Security Committee. It won the support of  35 Republicans on the House floor.   The Commission is not duplicative. The scope of the investigations  into January 6 by our Senate committees is very focused. We need a  dedicated bipartisan Commission to look at the whole picture. The fact  that our committees can investigate didn't stop Congress from  establishing a 9/11 Commission. A January 6 Commission is necessary for  the same reasons that the 9/11 Commission was necessary.   The real reason it seems Republican leaders are suddenly opposed to  this bipartisan Commission is they don't want to talk about the Big Lie  at all. They don't even want to investigate how former President Trump  instigated an attack on our democracy because he was angry about losing  the 2020 election and lied to the American people about the results.   Even now, 5 months to the day after he left office, the Republican  Party is still so terrified of Donald Trump that they are apparently  willing to abandon the truth and the safety of our democracy on into  the future.   Maybe, despite the opposition of the Republican leader--the  unfortunate and sad opposition of the Republican leader--enough of my  Republican colleagues will step up and join with Democrats to establish  the Commission. They will get a chance to do so very soon                            ____________________     On another matter, the Senate continues to make great  progress on the modified Endless Frontier Act, now called the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act. Yesterday, we considered two amendments  and added one of them to the bill, a bipartisan amendment led by  Senators Hirono and Tillis. Today, we will consider another two  amendments.   As my colleagues know, the bill itself is the product of at least six  Senate committees and already includes input of nearly every Member of  the Senate. And, as promised, we are working in a bipartisan way, in a  much more open way than the Senate used to act, to allow amendments and  have debate.   This is an issue where our two parties are working together with a  great deal of cooperation. Down to a Member, I believe we all want to  see the United States maintain its position as the global economic  leader in the 21st century. We all want to see America stay No. 1 in  science and technology. It is so important for jobs, for our economic  security, for our national security.   We have an extraordinary opportunity to set our country on a path to  outinnovate, outproduce, and outcompete the world in the industries of  the future. Let's keep working and deliver a strong bipartisan result  by the end of next week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 117.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 124.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, May 20, be  waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S3197]]                                       S. 1747         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fluke Fairness Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Summer flounder is an important economic fish stock for       commercial and recreational fishermen across the Northeast       and Mid-Atlantic United States.        (2) The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and       Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) was reauthorized in       2006 and instituted annual catch limits and accountability       measures for important fish stocks.        (3) That reauthorization prompted fishery managers to look       at alternate management schemes to rebuild depleted stocks       like summer flounder.        (4) Summer flounder occur in both State and Federal waters       and are managed through a joint fishery management plan       between the Council and the Commission.        (5) The Council and the Commission decided that each       State's recreational and commercial harvest limits for summer       flounder would be based upon landings in previous years.        (6) These historical landings were based on flawed data       sets that no longer provide fairness or flexibility for       fisheries managers to allocate resources based on the best       science.        (7) This allocation mechanism resulted in an uneven split       among the States along the East Coast which is problematic.        (8) The fishery management plan for summer flounder does       not account for regional changes in the location of the fluke       stock even though the stock has moved further to the north       and changes in effort by anglers along the East Coast.        (9) The States have been locked in a management system       based on data collected from 1981 to 1989, thus, the summer       flounder stock is not being managed using the best available       science and modern fishery management techniques.        (10) It is in the interest of the Federal Government to       establish a new fishery management plan for summer flounder       that is based on current geographic, scientific, and economic       realities.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Atlantic       States Marine Fisheries Commission.        (2) Council.--The term ``Council'' means the Mid-Atlantic       Fishery Management Council established under section 302(a)       of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management       Act (16 U.S.C. 1852(a)).        (3) National standards.--The term ``National Standards''       means the national standards for fishery conservation and       management set out in section 301(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens       Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1851(a)).        (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of Commerce.        (5) Summer flounder.--The term ``summer flounder'' means       the species Paralichthys dentatus.       SEC. 4. SUMMER FLOUNDER MANAGEMENT REFORM.         (a) Fishery Management Plan Modification.--Not later than 1       year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Council       shall submit to the Secretary, and the Secretary may approve,       a modified fishery management plan for the commercial       management of summer flounder under title III of the       Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16       U.S.C. 1851 et seq.) or an amendment to such plan that--        (1) shall be based on the best scientific information       available;        (2) establishes commercial quotas in direct proportion to       the distribution, abundance, and location of summer flounder       as reflected by fishery independent surveys conducted by the       National Marine Fisheries Service and State agencies;        (3) considers regional, coastwide, or other management       measures for summer flounder that comply with the National       Standards; and        (4) prohibits the establishment of commercial catch quotas       for summer flounder on a State-by-State basis using       historical landings data that does not reflect the status of       the summer flounder stock, based on the most recent       scientific information.        (b) Consultation With the Commission.--In preparing the       modified fishery management plan or an amendment to such a       plan as described in subsection (a), the Council shall       consult with the Commission to ensure consistent management       throughout the range of the summer flounder.        (c) Failure To Submit Plan.--If the Council fails to submit       a modified fishery management plan or an amendment to such a       plan as described in subsection (a) that may be approved by       the Secretary, the Secretary shall prepare and consider such       a modified plan or amendment.       SEC. 5. REPORT.         Not later than 1 year after the date of the approval under       section 4 of a modified fishery management plan for the       commercial management of summer flounder or an amendment to       such plan, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       submit to Congress a report on the implementation of such       modified plan or amendment that includes an assessment of       whether such implementation complies with the National       Standards.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Padilla):   S. 1769. A bill to adjust the boundary of the Santa Monica Mountains  National Recreation Area to include the Rim of the Valley Corridor, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
