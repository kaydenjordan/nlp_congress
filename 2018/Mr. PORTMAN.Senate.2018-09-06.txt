 Mr. President, first, I would like to comment briefly on  the last two speeches. The first was from Senator Leahy. He talked  about the appropriations process. I commend him, as I did on the floor  today in person, for the work he has done with Senator Shelby and  others to actually move these appropriations bills, these spending  bills, through the process. For the first time in a couple of decades,  we have the opportunity to actually get our work done. It is incredibly  important for all the right reasons, including having proper oversight  of the Federal agencies and departments. He deserves credit for that.   My colleague from Oregon just talked for a moment about the Kavanaugh  hearings. He talked about the fact that he believes there is not enough  information out about Brett Kavanaugh. Let me just say this. There has  never been more information about any nominee to the Supreme Court,  ever, in the history of our country. In fact, there are more pages of  documents that have been provided on Brett Kavanaugh than for the past  five Supreme Court confirmations combined--over 450,000 pages.   Maybe my colleagues who raised these concerns decided a long time ago  they were going to vote no and said they are and that is fine, but I  don't think you can blame it on the fact that there isn't enough  documentation.   I know what they went, and I understand why they would want it. What  they want is the documents that went through his office when he was  Staff Secretary, which is a job at the White House where you are kind  of like the traffic cop, where everything that goes into the Oval  Office and everything that comes out is coordinated and disseminated  properly. But those weren't his documents. Yes, it is not appropriate  to see all of those documents. That would be, by the way, millions of  additional pages--millions. But the 488,000 pages that have been  provided--including all of the documents from his legal positions where  he was a judge, where he was an associate counsel in the White House-- those have all been provided. That is good, and we should look at them  and look at them carefully.    It is not about the documents. It is about some fundamental  differences about philosophy. I like his philosophy. He says that you  shouldn't legislate from the bench and that you should be independent  as a judge and be fair.   He is totally qualified. The American Bar Association is sometimes  criticized by Republicans as being too far to the left. It just said  that he is ``eminently qualified.'' In fact, they gave him their  highest rating, and they gave it unanimously. This just happened last  Friday. Not everybody knows this. This person is not just qualified. I  believe he is as qualified as anybody in the country to be on the U.S.  Supreme Court. I am looking forward to having the opportunity to have  this vote here on the floor. I hope it can be bipartisan, as it has  been for the nominees that President Obama brought forward, including  then-Solicitor General Kagan and Judge Sotomayor. They were big  bipartisan votes. Let's get back to that when somebody is as qualified  as this candidate clearly is.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to speak about this issue of  opioids and the crisis our country faces.   Just in the last couple of weeks we have gotten reports from the  Centers for Disease Control from last year's data on overdoses and  deaths: 72,000 Americans lost their lives to overdoses last year from  drugs. Most of those were from opioids. This is heroin, prescription  drugs, and, now, these synthetic opioids--72,000 Americans.   In the wake of that, it is encouraging to me to hear the Senate  talking about the possibility of bringing a package of legislation to  the floor that will help to push back against this crisis and begin to  turn the tide. We have to do it--not just talk about it. We have to act  because this crisis is upon us and is very real.   These new efforts that we should move forward on would build on what  this Senate has already done with regard to the Comprehensive Addiction  and Recovery Act, or the CARA legislation, which is now being  implemented in my State of Ohio and around the country. There is also  the Cures legislation, or the 21st Century Cures Act. It has some  additional provisions that allow States to take funding and use it to  fight this opioid addiction. That is smart. There are smart ways for us  to fight this opioid epidemic. We know that, and we are beginning to do  that.   At the Federal level we can play a role in this, among other things,  by taking better practices from around the country and ensuring they  are being used back home in our States. I have seen this firsthand  because I have been around the State of Ohio a lot since this  legislation actually passed. I have actually visited more than a dozen  grant recipients of CARA and Cures grants to see what they are doing  and then spreading that around to other communities--maybe communities  that haven't been able to get the grants but want to see something  innovative to be able to push back.   Last Friday I visited Hope Village Recovery Center in Portage County,  OH. They received more than $500,000 in CARA funding to expand a badly  needed medication-assisted treatment program. They decided to look at  this in a very comprehensive way, and it is working. They are getting  people who normally wouldn't step up for treatment to come for  treatment, and their success rate for getting people through treatment  and not relapsing is relatively high. That is so important right now,  because if you don't get people into treatment with an addiction, which  is a disease, you are not going to be able to solve this problem.   The comprehensive approach includes treatment, counseling, outpatient  treatment, aftercare services, peer support--and these are coaches who  are in recovery themselves, and that is very effective--and  transportation services to get people back and forth. This holistic  approach is what we need to help people begin to heal, get over their  addiction, get back to their families, back to work, and back to  achieving their God-given purpose in life, which is not to be an addict  using these drugs.   Last week I also visited CommQuest Recovery Services in Stark County,  OH, to see their new program, an innovative program called the ``mom  and me program.'' These are moms who want to help to get over their  addiction. They are struggling. This program allows them to come on  board to this facility that I got to see, to be able to have some of  the loving support and care from people around them, but also to have  their kids come with them. This is very unusual. Very few treatment  centers in the country allow children to come into the treatment  program. We have found through evidence-based programs looking at this  that, in fact, if you allow the kids in there and there is proper  supervision, it helps. It helps the mothers heal. It helps the kids to  be able to heal.   So this is an innovative program that I think is going to end up with  great results. They are just getting started on it, but it is going to  foster the kind of success that we want to see.   Programs like these are working. Yet the epidemic seems to be getting  [[Page S6049]]  worse. Why is that? Well, because we need to do more of this evidence- based stuff. We need to be sure that every community has the  opportunity to provide treatment because a lot of people still can't  get treatment. We need to encourage people not to go down this funnel  of addiction by much more effective and stronger prevention and  education programs. There are things we have to do.   CARA 2.0, or the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act 2.0, is how  it was introduced. That legislation that I have introduced will ensure  that those programs that are working get additional help so that the  States can do even more by leveraging some of these Federal dollars to  be able to do more with the private sector and with the States to be  able to turn this tide of addiction.   I talked about the 72,000 lives lost last year. That was a record  number. Here is a map of the States. This is a map of the changes in  overdose deaths from last year. If it is a purple or blue State, that  means they are doing a little better. Look at this map. Almost every  State, unfortunately, is not purple or blue. These States that are tan  and brown, like my home State of Ohio, indicate an actual increase in  opioid deaths last year.    Why is this? I think one of the main reasons for this is because  there is a new danger afoot. There is a new surge in drugs. It is very  powerful. It is 50 times more powerful than heroin. It is very  inexpensive. It is coming primarily from China and coming primarily  through our U.S. Postal Service, if you can believe it. It is called  synthetic opioids. Fentanyl is the name that most of it is called. Some  of it is called Carfentanil and other derivatives, but this fentanyl-- this synthetic opioid--is now the biggest problem we have in our  States. This is the growing crisis.   Here is a chart that shows what has happened just since 2015 until  now. It shows that, in fact, methamphetamines, other opioids, heroin,  cocaine are all relatively flat. But look at this big increase. The big  increase is with synthetic opioids. When you look at those 72,000  deaths from last year, the majority of them were from opioids. Again,  increasingly, it is from these synthetic opioids.   What I hear on the frontlines in Ohio--whether it was at this Hope  Village Recovery Center that I talked about or the CommQuest facility-- is that unless we combat that influx of fentanyl, we are not going to  be able to turn the tide, because despite some of the good programs and  the good work that is being done with these programs, we are being  overrun with fentanyl.   Over the past week alone, in the Columbus, OH, area, the Franklin  County coroner has handled 18 overdose deaths, and 5 were within 24  hours. There were 18 deaths, and 5 were within 24 hours. Imagine that.  The cause, the coroner suspects, is fentanyl. If you look at some of  these deaths that we talked about, the 72,000--or even deaths that  occurred to people who thought they were taking cocaine or  methamphetamine or something else--often it is because the fentanyl has  been sprinkled into these drugs and the fentanyl is what is causing the  overdoses and the deaths. It is 50 times more powerful, as I said, and  that is the new scourge of the opioid epidemic.   From 2013 to 2017, fentanyl overdose deaths have increased nationally  by 850 percent.   As coroners' reports for 2017 continue to come in throughout my home  State of Ohio, fentanyl now appears to be involved in two-thirds of the  deaths in Ohio. So those are record numbers, and two-thirds are from  fentanyl. That is consistent with what I am hearing on the frontlines.   Unbelievably, we know where it is coming from, and we are not doing  enough to stop it. It is being made in laboratories in China,  primarily, and in other countries and shipped into the United States  through our own U.S. Postal Service, a government agency. We conducted  an 18-month investigation into this issue in the subcommittee that I  chair called the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. We did a  thorough study. We had undercover people working with us. We went on  the websites to find out what is happening. We found out how easy it is  to purchase fentanyl online and have it shipped to the United States.   Based on our undercover investigation, these drugs can be found  through a simple Google search, and overseas sellers we accessed  through an undercover investigator essentially told us they will  guarantee the delivery if this poison is sent through the U.S. Postal  Service. They will not guarantee it if it goes through a private  carrier like UPS, FedEx, or DHL.   Why is that? It is because the private carriers are required to  provide law enforcement with big data, or electronic data, in advance  as to what the packages are, where they are coming from, where they are  going, and what is in them. Law enforcement can then use big data, use  their algorithms, figure out which packages are suspect, and get them  off the line. I have seen it. I have been in those facilities. I have  seen big packages being taken off and, therefore, lives being saved. At  a minimum, this will increase the cost on the street.   What is the ultimate answer to this? It is prevention, education, a  change in our hearts and in our families, better treatment so that  people who have this disease can get the treatment just like another  illness they might have, and dealing with this issue of longer term  recovery, which leads to more success in treatment.   Those are all essential, but right now we have to put a tourniquet on  this, folks. We have to stop the fentanyl from flooding into our  country. Look at what it is doing. There is an 850-percent increase.   The information tells law enforcement what they need to be able to  pull these packages off if it is provided. Yet, unbelievably, all of  the private carriers are required to do it and have been since 9/11.    The post office has been spared. The thought was that the post office  should study the issue. Well, I am waiting for the report.   Meanwhile, because of pressure from the Congress, the U.S. Postal  Service is starting to look at some of these packages. Last year, they  now testified before us in the subcommittee, they did receive data on  about 36 percent of the international packages--not 100 percent as  these other carriers have to do, but 36 percent. But that means that  more than 318 million packages--318 million packages--are coming in  with little or no screening at all and without this data.   Even when the post office conducted a pilot program to screen for  these drugs, by the way, 80 percent of the time, they testified, these  packages that were targeted by Customs and Border Protection were able  to be pulled off, but 20 percent of the time they did not get the  information to law enforcement. Also, in many cases, the information  provided was not useful to law enforcement.   So we need to ensure it is 100 percent of these packages. We need to  ensure that all of this information is getting to law enforcement, and  we need to be sure that the information is useful and legible.   The bipartisan STOP Act is actually an answer to this. The STOP Act  is very simple. My coauthor of the STOP Act is Senator Amy Klobuchar  from Minnesota. As we have both said, this is a simple, commonsense,  and, quite frankly, long overdue reform. It simply says: Let's hold the  post office to the same standard to which we hold these private  carriers. Let's say they have to provide this data to law enforcement  so that we can begin to address this issue and push back to keep this  poison out of our communities.   This bill has been approved for a floor vote on the Republican side.  I think it is very close to being approved for a floor vote on the  Democratic side. We are very close to a consent agreement to get this  broader opioids package I talked about to the floor as well.   I am very pleased that we are taking up that package this month. We  need to ensure that whatever concerns people have, they are very frank  about it. We have to get the politics out of this, folks. We have to be  sure that we are moving forward, as we have been able to do on the CARA  legislation and the CURES legislation, not just on a bipartisan basis  but on a nonpartisan basis, because this scourge is affecting all of  our constituents and it is one that we have to address here at the  Federal level to help our States, to help our communities, and to help  our families to be able to respond.   The broader opioid package we talked about would include the STOP  [[Page S6050]]  Act, but it also would include some other important legislation. It  will include a number of provisions from CARA 2.0, such as national  recovery housing standards and recovery support programs for high  school and college students struggling with addiction, which have  worked really well in Ohio. It will include $60 million for a plan of  safe care for babies who are born dependent on substances. These babies  are born with what is called neonatal abstinence syndrome. These are  innocent, small babies who are often born premature.   I have been in neonatal units around our hospitals in Ohio, and I  have seen these babies. It is so sad. They have to be taken through  withdrawal as tiny babies. We need to ensure that we do a better job of  preventing this by working with the moms as they become pregnant and by  ensuring that these kids get the help they need.   It also includes the CRIB Act, bipartisan legislation that would help  newborns suffering from addiction recover in the best care setting and  provide support for their families.   Again, this has been bipartisan. I have worked with Members on both  sides of the aisle on the CRIB Act. It helps to ensure that these  babies, when they are born with this neonatal abstinence syndrome, can  get the care they need. It is working for these organizations that are  doing it, but they need help--specifically, Medicaid reimbursement that  they cannot get currently.   The bill also reauthorizes a number of other important programs that  have a proven record of success, like the Office of National Drug  Control Policy, drug courts, drug-free communities prevention grants,  and the high-intensity drug trafficking areas grants, where law  enforcement is focusing on drug interdiction in some of the worst areas  of our country for drug use and drug addiction.   The STOP Act must be part of that Senate bill, as well, because,  again, anything we offer to help deal with this issue of opioids has to  include stopping the fentanyl from coming in.   It is time for Congress to move. This should be noncontroversial. It  is common sense. We know where these drugs are coming from, we know  they are devastating our communities, and we know how we can stop this  deadly trend. Let's pass the STOP Act. Let's pass this broader opioid  package as soon as possible.    Let's give Americans who are fighting addiction a chance  to live up to their God-given potential.                            ____________________
