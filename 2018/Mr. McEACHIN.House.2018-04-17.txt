 Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned by the  administration's continued assault on essential regulations that  protect our health and our environment.   All Americans need, deserve, and have a right to breathe clean air.  Historically, we have upheld that right to reasonable, science-based  limits on pollution, but that tradition is under assault.   Last week, the administration directed the EPA to weaken the  standards for ambient air pollution.   By allowing for emissions trading, this directive will magnify  existing environmental injustices, enabling increased pollution in  communities that already live with dangerously high concentrations.   The order also softens public health mandates under the Clean Air  Act. It restricts what kind of scientific data regulators can use, and  it increases their workloads without providing new resources.   Mr. Speaker, if we ignore the best available science or if we starve  agencies of the resources they need to actually uphold commonsense  limits, then we are not protecting the American people.   Last week's directive was dangerous and a needless mistake. Like the  rest of this administration's dirty energy agenda, it needs to be  reversed.                            ____________________
