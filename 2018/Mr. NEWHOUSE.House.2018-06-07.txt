 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen as well as  Chairman Simpson for their hard work on this package of bills.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 5895, which includes the  fiscal year 2019 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill.   Of all the funding bills I work on with my colleagues on the  Appropriations Committee, the Energy and Water legislation is one of  the most important for my district of central Washington.   From supporting the continued cleanup efforts at the Hanford nuclear  site to boosting the groundbreaking scientific research conducted at  the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, to aiding the vitally  important water projects managed and developed by both the Army Corps  of Engineers as well as the Bureau of Reclamation, this bill is  composed of important resources for central Washington.   Regarding Hanford, I am proud this bill restores more than $200  million from the President's request for the Richland office to  continue providing for continued safe and effective cleanup operations  onsite.   I am also pleased with the restoration of more than $40 million to  the Office of River Protection to continue important work on the 56  million gallons of radioactive nuclear waste that is stored at the  site.   I remain steadfast in my commitment to holding the Federal Government  accountable to its moral and legal obligation to the cleanup of the  Hanford site, and this bill does precisely that, so thank you.   I am also encouraged by this legislation's demonstrated commitment to  [[Page H4904]]  moving forward with Yucca Mountain as the lead geological repository  for legacy waste and spent nuclear fuel, as well as the continued  commitment to support science, including robust funding for Basic  Energy Sciences, cybersecurity, and the National Nuclear Security  Administration. These programs are important for the groundbreaking  work conducted at PNNL to tackle some of the most challenging problems  in energy, the environment, and in national security.   Finally, this legislation includes a provision that I authored to  stop the dangerous, antiscience forced spill order currently in effect  on the eight lower Snake and lower Columbia River dams, which began in  early April of this year.   Just a week ago, Mr. Chairman, we received news from the Army Corps  that fish managers are having to take measures to manage the effects of  this reckless spill order. High flow rates from the forced spill are  causing fish to stall in their migration upstream, with only 300 to 400  spring chinook passing through Little Goose Dam in late May. However,  after the Corps reduced the spill rate by just 20 percent a week ago,  the daily passage rose to 2,689 fish. This demonstrates the strain the  spill order is placing on our endangered species.   Some of my colleagues refuse to acknowledge this unambiguous  scientific data and claim to support endangered fish species with their  words.    Mr. Chair, they claim to support the endangered species  with their words but not with their actions.   I am proud to have advocated for the inclusion of this language to  stop this misguided spill to help save our fish and save our dams.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 5895.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague's support for the  DOE's efforts to take action on the defense-related uranium mines that  are a  [[Page H4946]]  legacy of the Cold War. The amendment does not change funding levels  within the bill, and I do not oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arizona.   Mr. Chairman, although I am supportive of the stated goals of the  National Ocean Policy, such as more interagency coordination and  decisionmaking, there are many troubling aspects here.   This amendment seeks to strip underlying language that prevents  Federal agencies from using ambiguous authorities in the National Ocean  Policy to encroach on a wide variety of ocean and inland activities.   I have heard from farmers and irrigators from throughout the Pacific  Northwest concerned that ill-defined terms such as ``ecosystem-based  management'' give broad authority to Federal agencies to adversely  impact terrestrial agriculture that is hundreds of miles from the  Pacific Coast in the name of ocean management.   Before imposing these burdens on farmers who feed our Nation, it is  necessary for Congress to evaluate such a policy to ensure that all  affected stakeholders have a seat at the table. I urge my colleagues to  oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment on a  critical matter for the Bonneville Power Administration and our  Nation's other power marketing administrations, or PMAs, including the  Southwestern Power Administration and the Western Area Power  Administration, as well as the Tennessee Valley Authority, or the TVA.   The President's fiscal year 2019 budget request, released earlier  this year, included a misguided proposal to sell the transmission  assets of these entities. It is unfortunate this proposal was offered  once again, as the matter was met with resounding rejection by Congress  last year when it was offered in the fiscal year 2018 budget request.   The sale of these assets would result in the Federal Government  abandoning a successful and efficient solution for providing affordable  power to rural, urban, and tribal communities across the country.   This one-time Federal debt reduction proposal would create energy  production and delivery issues for my constituents, as costs would  inevitably rise.   Mr. Chairman, this ill-advised proposal is once again a Federal  attempt to fix something that is not broken.   I fully support efforts to improve energy infrastructure across the  Nation. However, I do not believe that this goal should come at the  expense of existing infrastructure--infrastructure that successfully  fills a need where market-based pricing would not be sustainable.   My constituents, especially in rural communities, depend on the  Bonneville Power Administration to provide stable and affordable  electricity service. Divesting BPA's assets would create needless  uncertainty for regional energy markets and ratepayers in central  Washington.   In a climate where BPA continues to face unnecessary challenges,  whether from the imprudent Federal proposal to move to market-based  rates or the incessant use of litigation brought forward by radical  environmentalists for the past three decades, I offer this amendment  which simply prohibits any funds from being used to sell the  transmission assets of the three PMAs and the TVA.                                time  2000    Mr. Chairman, I come before the House today as a champion for the  Bonneville Power Administration, an advocate for public power, and a  steadfast representative for ratepayers across central Washington  State, the greater Pacific Northwest, and the entire Nation. I  encourage the administration to listen to this resounding bipartisan  message that I bring along with my colleagues today: we reject this  proposal and prohibit the divestment of these assets.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Tennessee  (Mrs. Blackburn).    Mr. Chairman, I am proud my amendment is cosponsored by  at least 18 bipartisan colleagues, and I would humbly urge the rest of  my colleagues to support and vote ``yes'' on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
