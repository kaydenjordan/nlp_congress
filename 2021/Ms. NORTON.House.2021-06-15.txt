 Madam Speaker, the D.C. statehood bill will receive a  hearing in the Senate, and I expect the date to be announced today. I  appreciate that our D.C. statehood bill has already passed the House,  and I thank the House.   Our hearings and House passage have alerted Americans that the  residents of their own Nation's Capital do not have the same rights as  other Americans. As a result, a detailed poll now shows that 54 percent  of the American people support D.C. statehood for the District of  Columbia.   As Americans who pay the highest Federal taxes per capita in the  United States, D.C. residents say it is about time--indeed, well past  time--for Congress to grant statehood to the residents of the District  of Columbia.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 610) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to  establish a grant program to support the restoration of San Francisco  Bay, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 610         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 610, as amended.  [[Page H2757]]     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I will include in the Record a letter from Chairman    John Yarmuth of the House Committee on Budget agreeing to waive  consideration of H.R. 610, as amended, as well as Chair DeFazio's  response to Mr. Yarmuth expressing appreciation for his willingness to  work cooperatively on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from Midpeninsula  Regional Open Space District in support of H.R. 610.                                               Midpeninsula Regional                                             Open Space District,                                       Los Altos, CA, June 10, 2021.      Re H.R. 610--San Francisco Bay Restoration Act--SUPPORT.       Hon. Jackie Speier,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Speier: On behalf of the Board of       Directors of the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District       (Midpen), I write to express our support for your       legislation, H.R. 610, the San Francisco Bay Restoration Act.       Comprised of over 65,000 acres of acquired and protected open       space on the San Francisco Peninsula, Midpen is one of the       largest regional open space districts in California. Our       braided mission is to acquire and preserve in perpetuity open       space and agricultural land of regional significance, to       protect and restore the natural environment, to preserve       rural character and encourage viable agricultural use of land       resources, and to provide opportunities for ecologically       sensitive public enjoyment and education.        As you know, the legislation would prioritize funding for       the San Francisco Bay, a vital resource to our District, the       regional community, and the entire state of California. The       $250 million authorized in the bill would provide critical       federal investment to restoring the Bay's wetlands and       estuaries, assist in the recovery of endangered species, and       help to alleviate the impacts of climate change. We greatly       appreciate the legislation's establishment of this federal       partnership to improve the Bay Area and protect our coastal       community and economy.        For these reasons, the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space       District greatly supports the San Francisco Bay Restoration       Act (H.R. 610). Thank you for your leadership and continued       work on improving the Bay Area. If you have any questions or       would like to further discuss our support, please do not       hesitate to contact us.            Sincerely,                                                       Ana M. Ruiz,                                                   General Manager.     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 610. This  legislation would create a stand-alone program for the San Francisco  Bay within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in essence  elevating restoration efforts of a water body that has been part of the  national estuary program since 1993.   This legislation responds to an August 2018 Government Accountability  Office report that found a centralized program would improve the  existing efforts to restore and protect the San Francisco Bay.   This legislation would authorize $25 million annually for fiscal year  2022 through 2026, with a cap on Federal funding for eligible projects  and a cap on administrative expenses. H.R. 610 is supported by the  delegation representing the bay and surrounding area, including our  committee colleagues Jared Huffman, Mark DeSaulnier, and   John  Garamendi.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 610, and I reserve the balance  of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                      Washington, DC, June 2, 2021.      Hon. John Yarmuth:      Chair, Committee on the Budget, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Yarmuth: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R       610, the San Francisco Bay Restoration Act. I appreciate your       decision to waive formal consideration of the bill.        I agree that the Committee on the Budget has valid       jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this important       legislation, and I further agree that by forgoing formal       consideration of the bill, the Committee on the Budget is not       waiving any jurisdiction over any relevant subject matter.       Additionally, if requested I will support the appointment of       conferees from the Committee on the Budget should a House-      Senate conference be convened on this legislation. Finally,       this exchange of letters will be included in the       Congressional Record when the bill is considered on the       floor.        Thank you again, and I look forward to continuing to work       collaboratively with the Committee on the Budget on this       important issue.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,                                                             Chair.                                          ____                                          House of Representatives,                                         Committee on the Budget,                                       Washington, DC, May 27, 2021.      Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Chair, Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chair DeFazio: I write to confirm our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 610, the San Francisco Bay       Restoration Act. H.R. 610 contains provisions that fall       within the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Budget. However, the committee agrees to waive formal       consideration of the bill.        The Committee on the Budget takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment to any House-Senate conference       convened on this legislation or similar legislation and       requests your support if such a request is made.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I ask that a copy of our       exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I look forward to continuing to work with you as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                      John Yarmuth,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi).    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1703) to amend title 40, United States Code, to require the  Administrator of General Services to enter into a cooperative agreement  with the National Children's Museum to provide the National Children's  Museum rental space without charge in the Ronald Reagan Building and  International Trade Center, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1703         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Children's Museum       Act''.       SEC. 2. NATIONAL CHILDREN'S MUSEUM.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1703, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1703, the National  Children's Museum Act, which I have sponsored. Last Congress, the House  passed this bill by voice vote.  [[Page H2759]]    This bipartisan, bicameral bill, which I introduced with Republican  Rodney Davis of Illinois and which has been introduced in the Senate by  Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Republican Shelley Moore  Capito of West Virginia would require the General Services  Administration to enter into a cooperative agreement with the National  Children's Museum, a congressionally designated museum, to allow the  museum to remain in the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade  Center, a Federally owned building in the Nation's capital without  charge for the duration of its existing lease.   The National Building Museum operates under such an agreement. The  National Children's Museum is the only congressionally designated  museum required to pay rent in a Federal building.   Originally named the Capital Children's Museum, the museum was a  staple in D.C. for decades. The museum opened in 1974 in a former  convent on H Street Northeast. In 2003, Congress recognized the immense  value of having a children's museum in the Nation's capital and  officially designated the museum as the National Children's Museum.   After being closed for several years, the museum reopened last year  in the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in  downtown D.C. where it immediately attracted visitors from throughout  the Nation's capital and the entire Nation. However, only 18 days  later, the coronavirus pandemic forced the museum to close its physical  space.   Still, the museum continued to offer valuable online resources to our  children as they navigated new, challenging learning circumstances,  including over 75 at-home experiment and project video programs and  monthly podcasts. The museum has served teachers in 45 States and the  District through its virtual field trips since the pandemic began.  However, due to revenue losses during the pandemic and other costs, the  museum has said it will close permanently without enactment of this  bill.   This bill would allow the National Children's Museum to continue to  benefit the millions who visit and live in the Nation's capital and the  national capital region.   Madam Speaker, I support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of my good  friend, Mr. Davis, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, like my friend, I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 587) to modify permitting requirements with respect to the  discharge of any pollutant from the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment  Plant in certain circumstances, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 587         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 587.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the city of San  Diego in support of H.R. 587.                                          The City of San Diego,                                       San Diego, CA, June 14, 2021.      Hon. Scott Peters,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Peters: On behalf of the City of San       Diego, I am writing to you in support of the Ocean Pollution       Reduction Act II (OPRA II) H.R. 587.        OPRA II is the product of a decades-long regional       collaboration and will deploy advanced technology to purify       recycled water. Additionally, this legislation is critical to       implementing the comprehensive Pure Water San Diego program,       which will provide a reliable, sustainable source of drinking       water while simultaneously reducing treated discharge to the       ocean by nearly 50 percent. This bill delivers certainty and       provides a more streamlined process to comply with       regulations, provided the City meets stringent water       recycling milestones.        Under OPRA II, the City of San Diego must demonstrate that       its Pure Water program is able to produce 83 million gallons       of water a day, nearly one-half of the City's water supply       demand by 2036. Over the same period, the program is expected       to reduce treated discharge from the Point Loma Wastewater       Treatment Plant, which will be continuously monitored and       subjected to ongoing research efforts by academic, local,       state, and national entities.        The City of San Diego is grateful for your leadership on       this important legislative effort.            Sincerely,                                                    Todd Gloria,                                                              Mayor,                                                 City of San Diego.     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 587. The  legislation, introduced by Representative Scott Peters, clarifies that  the city of San Diego, California, can utilize the standard Clean Water  Act National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit process to  continue operation of the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant with  alternative standards.   The legislation, which provides regulatory accountability and  consistency to the city, has the support of surrounding localities,  local public works departments and water districts, as well as local  nongovernmental and environmental organizations.   Currently, the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant applies for and  receives a waiver under the Clean Water Act to discharge wastewater  with less than full secondary treatment, the baseline requirement of  the Clean Water Act. The facility qualifies for the waiver by meeting  certain criteria and must renew its application every 5 years.   As part of a long-term effort, the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment  Plant is working to reduce its discharges to coastal waters. This  effort involves water recycling and will redirect a portion of the  facility's discharge. However, the facility's discharges to coastal  waters will never be eliminated.   To be clear, this legislation is not a waiver of all the requirements  of the Clean Water Act, and the facility will need to comply with the  other requirements of the act.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 587, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Peters).    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H2761]]     Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1144) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to  provide assistance for programs and activities to protect the water  quality of the Puget Sound, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1144         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1144, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1144. The bill establishes a  new regional program within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to  address water pollution concerns in the Puget Sound and authorizes $50  million annually for fiscal years 2022 through 2026.   The Puget Sound has seen significant degradation of water quality and  habitat as a result of human development. This legislation builds on  the successes Puget Sound has seen while part of the National Estuary  Program and incorporates the recommendations of a July 2018 report of  the U.S. Government Accountability Office on the Federal and State  efforts to restore the Sound.   This legislation is vitally important to ensure long-term health of a  watershed that helps provide food, water, and other ecosystem services  for 4.5 million people and contributes to the State's economy.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1144, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Strickland).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the Puget Sound watershed has long provided food,  clean water, and other ecosystem benefits for 4.5 million people and a  wide variety of species as well. The region is essential to the State's  economy. Human development and other actions have degraded the water  quality and habitat of the Sound, including that of critical species  like salmon and orca whales.   The Puget Sound was deemed an Estuary of National Significance in  1988, and in 2018, GAO determined that further investment and a program  with clear leadership and coordination of objectives is crucial to  achieving the long-term restoration and protection goals of this  diverse and dynamic ecosystem.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2008) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to  reauthorize certain programs relating to nonpoint source management,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2008         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Local Water Protection       Act''.       SEC. 2. NONPOINT SOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.         Section 319(j) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act       (33 U.S.C. 1329(j)) is amended by striking ``subsections (h)       and (i) not to exceed'' and all that follows through ``fiscal       year 1991'' and inserting ``subsections (h) and (i)       $200,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2008.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2008. H.R. 2008 is a  bipartisan bill to reauthorize appropriations for the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency's Nonpoint Source Management grants  program. I would like to thank my colleagues, Ms. Craig from Minnesota  and Mr. Mast from Florida, for introducing this bill.   Nonpoint sources of water pollution come from many diffuse sources,  including runoff from farms, managed forests, and urban areas. This  runoff can carry pollutants, such as fertilizers and sediment from  fields and lawns, toxins from abandoned mines, and oils and heavy  metals from roads into lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water.  Nationally, some 55 percent of assessed rivers and streams currently do  not meet State water quality standards.   The Clean Water Act was enacted in 1972 to restore and maintain the  chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters. In  1987, the Clean Water Act was amended to add section 319 to create a  non-regulatory program through which EPA administers annual grants to  help States develop and implement their own programs for managing  nonpoint sources of water pollution.   Under EPA's 319 program, States retain the primary role for  addressing nonpoint source water pollution, which they do largely  through voluntary means and financial incentives. However, according to  the General Accounting Office, the extent of the available incentives  has declined in recent years, as grants to States under the section 319  program have declined by more than 30 percent from a high of about $240  million annually in fiscal year 2004.   The section 319 program was initially authorized at $70 million  annually in fiscal year 1988, and its authorization level steadily  increased to $130 million in fiscal year 1991, the last year of  authorization for this program.   Since that time, the section 319 program has continued to receive  funds through the annual appropriation for EPA. In fiscal year 2021,  the section 319 program received a Federal appropriation of $177  million, and the President's fiscal year 2022 budget request proposes  an increase in funding for the program to $180 million.   H.R. 2008 would authorize $200 million annually for the section 319  program through 2026. This would be a modest increase of the current  appropriated level for this popular program, but less than the historic  peak appropriation for this program in the early 2000s.   Again, I thank Ms. Craig and Mr. Mast for leading this bipartisan  bill. This legislation passed out of committee with bipartisan support  and is a good bill for a valuable program.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Craig).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1921) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to  reauthorize the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1921         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN BASIN RESTORATION PROGRAM                     REAUTHORIZATION.         (a) Review of Comprehensive Management Plan.--Section 121       of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1273)       is amended--        (1) in subsection (c)--        (A) in paragraph (5), by striking ``; and'' and inserting a       semicolon;        (B) in paragraph (6), by striking the period and inserting       ``; and''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(7) ensure that the comprehensive conservation and       management plan approved for the Basin under section 320 is       reviewed and revised in accordance with section 320 not less       often than once every 5 years, beginning on the date of       enactment of this paragraph.''; and        (2) in subsection (d), by striking ``recommended by a       management conference convened for the Basin under section       320'' and inserting ``identified in the comprehensive       conservation and management plan approved for the Basin under       section 320''.        (b) Definitions.--Section 121(e)(1) of the Federal Water       Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1273(e)(1)) is amended by       striking ``, a 5,000 square mile''.        (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 121(f) of the       Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1273(f)) is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``2001 through 2012 and       the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2009 for each of       fiscal years 2013 through 2017'' and inserting ``2022 through       2026''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) Administrative expenses.--The Administrator may use       for administrative expenses not more than 5 percent of the       amounts appropriated to carry out this section.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1921.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1921. This legislation  reauthorizes the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program for 5  years at $20 million annually and provides for regular reporting on the  progress of the program.   Some 2.1 million people live in the area surrounding Lake  Pontchartrain, which is threatened by pollution related to urban and  agricultural runoff, sewage overflows, and nonpoint source pollution.  The Basin Restoration Program helps address these environmental  challenges in a nonregulatory fashion and has made some progress. With  continued funding and reauthorization, the program can continue  implementing projects related to restoration.   During a Water Resources Subcommittee hearing last Congress, some  implementation issues related to this program were identified. Ranking  Member Graves and Chair DeFazio requested that the U.S. Government  Accountability Office study the program implementation; however, those  issues should not prevent us from acting on this bill today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1921, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 539) to amend the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 to  require the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to  waive certain debts owed to the United States related to covered  assistance provided to an individual or household, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 539         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing Disaster       Revictimization Act''.       SEC. 2. FLEXIBILITY.         Section 1216(a) of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018       (42 U.S.C. 5174a(a)) is amended--        (1) by amending paragraph (2)(A) to read as follows:        ``(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), shall--        ``(i) waive a debt owed to the United States related to       covered assistance provided to an individual or household if       the covered assistance was distributed based on an error by       the Agency and such debt shall be construed as a hardship;       and        ``(ii) waive a debt owed to the United States related to       covered assistance provided to an individual or household if       such assistance is subject to a claim or legal action,       including in accordance with section 317 of the Robert T.       Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42       U.S.C. 5160); and''; and        (2) in paragraph (3)(B)--        (A) by striking ``Removal of'' and inserting ``Report on'';       and        (B) in clause (ii) by striking ``the authority of the       Administrator to waive debt under paragraph (2) shall no       longer be effective'' and inserting ``the Administrator shall       report to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure       of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate actions that       the Administrator will take to reduce the error rate''.       SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS.         The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management       Agency shall submit to the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of       the Senate a report containing a description of the internal       processes used to make decisions regarding the distribution       of covered assistance under section 1216 of the Disaster       Recovery and Reform Act of 2018 (42 U.S.C. 5174a) and any       changes made to such processes.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 539.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 539, the Preventing Disaster  Revictimization Act, introduced by Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee Ranking Member Graves from Missouri and Representatives  Carbajal, Garamendi, Huffman, Thompson, and LaMalfa of California.   This legislation is designed to ensure disaster survivors are not  revictimized by recoupment--or clawbacks--of Federal disaster  assistance they have received from the Federal Emergency Management  Agency.   Unfortunately, FEMA has repeatedly instructed disaster survivors to  register for individual assistance for which they were ultimately not  eligible, or granted qualified survivors more assistance than they  should have received.   However, once FEMA identifies an error, it forces these survivors  into a bureaucratic nightmare to appeal the debt that they now owe as a  result of the agency's error. I am not surprised that this still goes  on, but I am disappointed that--given the technology and data we have  at our fingertips--we have not been able to improve this system for  survivors, especially considering that this program is just a small  piece of the Federal disaster recovery apparatus.   H.R. 539 would waive survivors' debt owed to the Federal Government  in instances where FEMA erroneously distributed assistance. This bill  would also provide a similar waiver to disaster survivors who may be  involved in a legal action against a party deemed responsible for a  disaster event. While this scenario is less common, it played out in  California last year and jeopardized disaster relief for tens of  thousands of families displaced by the unprecedented wildfires of the  last few years.   Survivors have already been traumatized by a disaster--the Federal  Government should not force them to endure a convoluted process to  correct FEMA's mistakes or decision to pursue legal action years after  an event against a liable party.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 468) to amend title 49, United States Code, to permit the  use of incentive payments to expedite certain federally financed  airport development projects.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 468         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Expedited Delivery of       Airport Infrastructure Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. ALLOWABLE COST STANDARDS FOR AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT                     PROJECTS.         (a) In General.--Section 47110(b)(1) of title 49, United       States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking ``(1) if the cost necessarily'' and       inserting ``(1)(A) if the cost necessarily'';        (2) by striking the semicolon at the end and inserting ``;       or''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(B) if the cost is an incentive payment incurred in       carrying out the project described in subparagraph (A) that       is to be provided to a contractor upon early completion of a       project, if--        ``(i) such payment does not exceed the lesser of 5 percent       of the initial construction contract amount or $1,000,000;        ``(ii) the level of contractor's control of, or access to,       the worksite necessary to shorten the duration of the project       does not negatively impact the operation of the airport;        ``(iii) the contract specifies application of the incentive       structure in the event of unforeseeable, non-weather delays       beyond the control of the contractor;        ``(iv) nothing in any agreement with the contractor       prevents the airport operator from retaining responsibility       for the safety, efficiency, and capacity of the airport       during the execution of the grant agreement; and        ``(v) the Secretary determines that the use of an incentive       payment is likely to increase airport capacity or efficiency       or result in cost savings as a result of shortening the       project's duration;''.        (b) Technical Correction.--Section 47110(e)(7) of title 49,       United States Code, is amended in the heading by striking       ``Partnership Program Airports'' and inserting ``Partnership       program airports''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 468.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 468, the Expedited Delivery of Airport  Infrastructure Act of 2021. Introduced by the committee's ranking  member, Sam Graves, the bill incentivizes the early completion of  airport projects funded by the Federal Aviation Administration's  Airport Improvement Program.   As the global pandemic begins to subside and the number of vaccinated  Americans has steadily grown, the number of passengers traveling by air  has dramatically increased. In fact, last month, the Transportation  Security Administration recorded the highest number of daily passengers  screened at U.S. airports since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,  forcing airports to find ways to keep up with the growing passenger  demand.   This legislation will help address this need by allowing airports to  use their Airport Improvement Program funding to offer incentive  payments to contractors for early completion of airport development  projects.   Importantly, H.R. 468 includes conditions that ensure projects  completed early do not have a negative impact on airport safety,  efficiency, or capacity.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2016) to amend the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 to  develop a study regarding streamlining and consolidating information  collection and preliminary damage assessments, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2016         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Study to streamline and consolidate information collection                and preliminary damage assessments.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2016.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 2016, the Federal Disaster Assistance  Coordination Act, introduced by Representatives Gonzalez-Colon and  Peters. This legislation amends the Disaster Recovery Reform Act to  help Federal agencies streamline and consolidate information collection  and preliminary damage assessments following disasters.   When a major disaster occurs, Americans don't have time to wait for  bureaucracy. Today, however, too many barriers stand between emergency  response and Americans in crisis due to disaster.   Federal recovery assistance following major disasters is currently  hampered by inefficient information collection and assessments  conducted by multiple agencies.   This bill will remove information collection barriers that currently  impede disaster aid. It creates a working group to identify duplicative  assessments and propose their elimination.   Further, it would streamline Federal disaster recovery efforts by  concluding that a single agency is sufficient to conduct damage  assessments to account for the needs of disaster victims in 2021.   It is 2021, and we can and should be doing this smarter. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2770]]    Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First of all, I rise in support of this bill, H.R. 2016, the Federal  Disaster Assistance Coordination Act.   First, I want to thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves for  bringing this bill to the floor, as well as Chairwoman Norton. But I  would also like to thank Representative Scott Peters from California  for cosponsoring this legislation.   In the last Congress, I joined with former colleague, Mark Meadows,  in proposing this bill, and it was with great satisfaction that I see  it come to the floor.   This is a simple bill that will establish a process to identify ways  to streamline and consolidate the collection of certain disaster  information in order to start the recovery process for individuals,  families, and government devastated by natural disasters.   While FEMA is the lead Federal agency on disasters, there are  multiple Federal agencies involved in every disaster response and  recovery. This often leads to duplicative assessments and causes  serious delays for the recovery process to begin.   In the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and the seismic  activity in Puerto Rico, we discovered how Federal agency after Federal  agency, from FEMA, to HUD, to SBA, would require the same information  from applicants, location, nature of damage, ownership, value of  damage, estimated repair costs, among many others, in each of their  preliminary assessments.   There was no process to share this information between the Federal  agencies, which ultimately caused significant delays during both  immediate relief and long-term recovery. At one point, these  represented more than 70,000 assessments of individual worksites that  each needed to be completed by FEMA. Many of these assessments will be  small parts of a larger project; sites costing under $126,000, with  responsibilities divided among municipalities and State agencies. Many  of these were each, itself, a part of a larger process.   For example, repairs to individual pipes, storage tanks or pumps of  an aqueduct system; and having to evaluate each site individually will  slow down the whole project.   After many complaints from us and the local governments, FEMA,  finally, in 2020, decided to begin consolidating these assessments for  Puerto Rico to speed up the project delivery process across multiple  Federal agencies.    I think it is critically important that Federal response agencies  work together to minimize overlaps in their assessments and take  advantage of the newest technologies.   Specifically, this bill will establish a Federal working group led by  FEMA that will work with the Council of the Inspectors General on  Integrity and Efficiency, and in consultation with HUD, SBA, HHS, EDA,  the Department of Labor, and OMB to identify ways to reduce duplication  and modernize the Federal damage assessments process.   This is a good government bill that will help expedite all forms of  disaster recovery across the Nation. As we have learned in Puerto Rico,  it is not a matter of if there is a next disaster; it is about when it  is going to happen, at least in our case.   So we must be ready to respond in a way that takes care of the  immediate needs of those facing a disaster and of rebuilding with  resiliency. That response needs to be efficient and effective, and with  this legislation, we are going to help bring this about.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), my friend and the  ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Guest).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Speaker, I just want to say, in closing, that H.R. 2016 is a  good-government, bipartisan piece of legislation that will help  streamline and improve disaster recovery efforts.   It is not just Puerto Rico. It is not just the Caribbean. From the  western part of the United States to even the territories, we are all  affected by natural disasters.   I want to thank, again, Representative Scott Peters from California  for co-leading this legislation, as well as Chairman DeFazio and  Ranking Member Graves for recognizing the merits of this bill.   I urge support of H.R. 2016, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1262) to establish a task force on improvements for certain  notices to airmen, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1262         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Notice to Airmen Improvement       Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FAA TASK FORCE ON NOTAM IMPROVEMENT.         (a) Establishment.--Not later than 180 days after the date       of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal       Aviation Administration shall establish a task force to be       known as the FAA Task Force on NOTAM Improvement (in this       section referred to as the ``Task Force'').

(g) Authority.--The Administrator shall have the authority       to carry out the recommendations of the Task Force detailed       in the report required under subsection (d).        (h) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) FAA.--The term ``FAA'' means the Federal Aviation       Administration.        (2) NOTAM.--The term ``NOTAM'' means notices to airmen       required by international or domestic regulation or law, as       described in the order issued by the FAA on December 11,       2018, titled ``Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1262, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 1262, the Notice to Airmen  Improvement Act, introduced by Mr. Stauber and Mr. DeSaulnier.   H.R. 1262 will create a task force to review existing methods for  presenting notices to airmen. Notices to airmen provide pilots with  essential and real-time information regarding abnormalities or issues  in the National Airspace System. For example, notices to airmen alert  pilots to potential hazards in the airspace or at an airport, such as a  closed runway or taxiway. While pilots are required to review all  notices to airmen before flight, there has been concern about the  lengthiness and completeness of the critical information contained in  notices to airmen and how the information is displayed to, and  organized for, pilots.   Under H.R. 1262, the task force will determine best practices for  organizing and presenting flight operations information to pilots in  the most optimal manner and make recommendations to improve the  presentation of notices to airmen while ensuring their accuracy and  completeness.   Recommendations from the task force could help prevent future  aviation accidents and near-accidents. We saw, in July 2017, an Air  Canada A320 almost land on top of five jetliners, with more than a  thousand people on board, awaiting takeoff at San Francisco  International Airport, before executing a go-around. The aircraft came  as close as 60 feet above one of the planes on the ground.   Thankfully, there were no injuries, but this could have been  catastrophic. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the  probable cause of the incident was the pilots' misidentification of the  taxiway for a runway, based in part on their ineffective review of  notices to airmen before flight.   Notices to airmen and airwomen can and must be better for pilots. I  expect the task force established under H.R. 1262 will lead to  recommendations that will improve aviation safety.
