 Mr. President, I rise to recognize an outstanding  member of my staff who is moving on to pursue other opportunities, my  long-time communications director, Bridgett Frey.   Bridgett joined my office at the start of 2009, when President Barack  Obama was first inaugurated and I was serving in the House of  Representatives. Things were so busy then that her interview took place  in a hallway in the Capitol. She may have recognized that as a sign of  things to come, but I am grateful she took the job anyway.   Through the decade that has followed, Bridgett has been a dedicated  staffer and trusted adviser. Regardless of the issue of the day--from  local issues like Federal grant funding and helping struggling auto  dealers, to national issues like healthcare reform and economic policy,  to international issues like Russian election interference and North  Korean sanctions--she helped ensure that my office communicates clearly  and effectively about our work in Congress. She has worked tirelessly  to inform the public about the policy changes we have achieved and  those we still hope to accomplish.   Whenever I took on a new challenge, Bridgett was there to help. She  led communications in my personal office, as well as working with  Speaker  [[Page S123]]  Pelosi's team to help freshman communications directors learn the ropes  of Capitol Hill when I was assistant to the Speaker. She then took on a  new challenge and dual role when I became ranking member of the House  Budget Committee. From budget battles to the not-so-Super Committee,  she was always up to the task. She took a leave of absence to help in  my 2016 campaign for the Senate and then moved across the Capitol to  run the communications operation in my Senate office. She has  approached all of it with intelligence, sharp instincts, sound  judgment, and a sense of humor.   Bridgett has built a reputation for being hard-charging and  forthright, and reporters respect her responsiveness and honesty. She  has coordinated closely with all aspects of my team, helping to drive  both policy work and State outreach efforts, as well as with countless  offices in both the House and the Senate. She has always provided me  with honest and thoughtful advice and counsel. She has an uncanny  instinct for getting to the heart of any issue.   As Bridgett seeks new challenges outside our office, I know she will  continue to grow in her professional career. It stems from a love of  politics that she got from her father and an ethos of hard work from  her mother. I deeply appreciate her many years of dedicated service to  the people of Maryland and the Congress. Our entire team will miss her,  but we all extend our warmest wishes as she takes on new adventures.                            ____________________
