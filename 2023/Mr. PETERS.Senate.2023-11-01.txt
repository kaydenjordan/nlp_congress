 Madam President, this amendment would prevent Federal  Agencies from effectively serving the American people. It would weaken  the government's ability to enact key health and safety standards. It  would endanger a range of public protections for the environment,  American workers, and people with disabilities. It would stifle  innovation for emerging technologies, such as self-driving cars,  artificial intelligence, and other tools that will help carry our  country forward.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1121
