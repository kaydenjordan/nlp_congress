 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair for  yielding and for his leadership in advancing this incredibly important  issue.   America is the land of the free and the home of the brave, but we  cannot truly be a free country unless women have the freedom to make  their own healthcare decisions. The radical right's effort to take away  that freedom, all across country, is unacceptable, unthinkable,  untenable, unconscionable, and un-American. We are going to make it  unlawful.   We are going to pass the Women's Healthcare Protection Act, and we  are going to protect and respect a woman's freedom to make her own  healthcare decisions.                                time  0930
