 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a local business in  my congressional district and congratulate them as they celebrate their  125th anniversary this year.   To my constituents in the 11th District, when they hear the words  ``New Holland,'' they often think of a great borough with about 6,000  residents located in Eastern Lancaster County. But when others across  the globe hear the words ``New Holland,'' it often means to them high  quality, agricultural machinery.   New Holland Agriculture, which is a brand of CNH Industrial, was  founded 125 years ago in New Holland, Pennsylvania, by a gentleman  named Abe Zimmerman. What Mr. Zimmerman began as a small machine shop  in 1895 would eventually grow to become a global leader in agricultural  equipment, from tractors to harvesting.   The company became known for technological innovations, particularly  [[Page H7227]]  the development of the first automatic hay baler nearly 80 years ago.  The company's hay tools plant still operates in New Holland,  Pennsylvania, where they produce approximately 30 models of balers,  which are exported to 45 countries around the world. New Holland  Agriculture has 800 dealerships in North America and nearly 5,000 more  across the globe.   Madam Speaker, I am particularly thankful for and proud of the hard  work by the company's nearly 1,000 full-time employees in New Holland,  Pennsylvania. Many of them I know personally and are some of my closest  friends.   I particularly want to mention my father-in-law, Jim Greiner, who  spent his entire career at New Holland. He retired after 45 years as a  project engineer and had a great career there.   I am thankful for how New Holland has given back to the community,  particularly working to support STEM education in my congressional  district. The organization recently hosted an externship program for  local educators to provide a hands-on learning experience for teachers  to see how New Holland's employees use STEM every day at the workplace.   Madam Speaker, I offer my congratulations to New Holland North  America on their 125th anniversary. I am certain that Mr. Abe  Zimmerman, who founded the company so long ago, could not have  envisioned how the business would grow to support agriculture across  the globe but would be very, very proud of what his company has  accomplished. I wish them continued success as they navigate the next  125 years in business and thank them for having a positive impact on  the community that I represent.               In Honor of Frontline Workers and Servicemembers     Madam Speaker, I also rise today to honor the brave men  and women in my district and across America who have been working hard  to combat COVID-19.   Since the beginning of the pandemic, doctors, nurses, and medical  professionals in hospitals, long-term care facilities, and community  health centers have committed long hours away from their families to  put the needs of others before their own. They have worked without  pause to keep our community healthy and to care for those in need.   Throughout this pandemic, farmers, producers, truck drivers, and  manufacturers have also worked without pause to provide for us all. The  farmers and agriculture producers in my district adjusted to changes in  supply chain operations to keep our Nation fed. Truck drivers and  logistics professionals ensured deliveries of essential goods and  personal protective equipment were delivered, and delivered on time.   Educators have also faced significant challenges this year, but they  have continued to provide students with the best education possible in  these circumstances. Adapting to the challenges of remote instruction,  educators in school districts had to adjust quickly to make sure  students are still receiving that quality education. America's teachers  always rise to the occasion, and they have done so once again.   Madam Speaker, we also honor the brave servicemembers in the United  States Armed Forces who are away from their families for this upcoming  holiday season, and we pray for their continued safety. We must also  hold their families in our hearts as they, too, serve our Nation with  bravery while their loved ones are abroad.   Madam Speaker, lastly, I thank everyone here in the Capitol working  hard to put safety measures in place so we can be here in Washington to  serve and work for the American people. I know that brighter days lie  ahead for our neighbors and nations. Therapeutics and vaccines are  going to help us turn the corner on this virus.   Please keep your loved ones and neighbors in mind. Wear a mask, wash  your hands, and practice social distancing this holiday season.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
