 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, let us remember that the United States Senate in 2013,  with 14 Republicans and the balance of Democrats, well over 60 people,  voted for comprehensive immigration reform, as I recall, and, perhaps  the chairman can correct me, I believe $47 billion for security. Maybe  the staff can shake their head if that was the right number. It was a  very substantial number; it might not be the exact number.   On this side of the aisle, we pleaded with the majority to bring a  comprehensive immigration bill to the floor. They were in charge. They  could have brought whatever security that they wanted. They could have  brought comprehensive immigration reform to the floor.   The bills that were brought to the floor bore no relationship, with  all due respect, to the Senate-passed bipartisan bill, so we did not  achieve comprehensive immigration reform. There was no conference;  there was no back-and-forth; and there was no response to that  bipartisan bill.   So, I tell my friend from Texas, yes, there is a problem. There is a  problem in trafficking, and we need to deal with it.   But I also tell this House that what it ought to know is that the  immigration system is broken. I wait for somebody to arise and say: No,  it is fine.   Nobody believes it is fine, Mr. Speaker. These bills are not  comprehensive immigration reform, but they are supported by the  American people because they know that Dreamers, TPS, and DED are  adding to this country's value.    Mr. Speaker, for 135 years, America's bright beacon to the world has  been that statue that stands in New York Harbor. It lifts her lamp  beside the golden door for those who are yearning to breathe free.   My father came through that door. He was 32 years of age in 1934. He  came from Denmark. He came for the reason most come, not fleeing,  however, from a dangerous land, as some are now doing, but looking for  opportunity and a better life. They have come throughout our history  from every corner of the world, braving hardship and seeking  opportunity, arriving here to build businesses, raise families, and  contribute to strengthening communities.   Dreamers have done that. They did not come at their insistence. They  came at their parents' insistence or somebody else's insistence, but  they are here, and they know America as their home.   Immigrants are a reason why America became the world's most powerful  and most prosperous country. For years now, however, our immigration  and visa system has been terribly broken, so much so that millions in  this country live in fear, holding their breath every day that they  could be deported to faraway lands that are not their homes because  America is their home.                                time  1300    For Dreamers, it has been their home since their earliest days. And,  today, this House is going to take action, as we did last Congress, to  help them breathe easier.   The minority leader and I were meeting at the White House some years  ago, and then-President Trump said: If you send me a Dreamers bill, I  will sign it.   Well, we never sent it. The minority leader and I negotiated, along  with others--the administration and Senator Durbin, the minority  leader, and Senator Cornyn. We didn't get there, sadly.   This bill will correct a wrong that has brought fear and uncertainty  to so many Americans. Yes, Americans. America is their home and their  country. We are talking about patriotic and law-abiding residents, many  of whom have been here for decades and are working to build a strong  community and serving on the front lines of this pandemic as healthcare  professionals, first responders, and essential workers.   We owe them the chance to live without fear of deportation and family  separation. There are other problems we ought to talk about and we have  talked about. But, certainly, these Dreamers and those with TPS who  have been here for a long period of time, and DED, this bill is just  for them.   When I say ``just,'' I don't mean solely. I mean justice.   We passed the American Dream and Promise Act last Congress with  bipartisan support, and I hope we can do the same today.  [[Page H1516]]    I want to thank Representative Roybal-Allard for her leadership on  H.R. 6, and all of those in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and  yourself, Mr. Speaker, for the extraordinary work you have done.   We are also voting, of course, today on another immigration bill this  week, H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act. I rise in  support of that as well.   This legislation, offered by Chairwoman Lofgren, provides a pathway  to permanent legal residency to undocumented agricultural workers and  their families who are living here and filling a critical economic need  from which we benefit, every one of us, every day; and that is the food  on our table.   Without that change, workers and their employers will continue to  operate under a cloud of uncertainty and instability. These reforms are  long overdue, and I want to thank Chairwoman Lofgren for her work to  bring them to the floor.   I hope, as part of broader immigration reform efforts, that we can  address the status of seasonal non-agricultural workers on H-2B, who  contribute so much to our economy and communities working in  landscaping, hospitality, and, in my own State of Maryland, the crab  industry.   After the House passes this legislation and H.R. 6, I hope the Senate  will move quickly to send them to President Biden for his signature.   The Dream and Promise Act, some 75 percent of Americans are for that.  We have been passing legislation that an overwhelming majority of  Americans are for, and somehow, the Senate didn't get it or didn't  care. Hopefully, this year they will.   If enacted, these two bills would provide a pathway to permanent  legal status for some 3 million to 4 million people. They are here.  They are among us. They help us. They work with us. They pay taxes.  Let's bring them out from under the cloud of being kicked out.   This legislation today is a major achievement and will hasten the  moment when 3 million to 4 million immigrants and their families can  breathe a little easier, a little freer, knowing they are welcomed and  valued here in America, that they are truly a part of this country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support both of these pieces of  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  rise to join her in recognizing and thanking Latrice Powell for the  extraordinary service that she has given to this institution.   Members from both sides of the aisle have come to know and respect  Latrice for her deep knowledge of floor procedure, her acumen, and her  experience helping to manage the floor during very difficult votes and  debate.   Not only has she served the Speaker as her deputy floor director,  Latrice previously helped run the Democratic Cloakroom, as was pointed  out, and before that was director of operations for Member services for  the Congressional Black Caucus as well as a staff member for the  gentleman from Mississippi, our Speaker pro tempore, Mr. Bennie  Thompson. That is a very distinguished record of service to this House  and to our country.   Now, I would be remiss if I did not observe that Latrice Powell is a  graduate of the University of Maryland, and is a proud Terp. What a  wonderful and distinguished academic institution she has graduated  from. She also holds a master's degree in counseling and psychology  from Bowie State University.   What is significant about the University of Maryland and Bowie State  University? They are in my district, so, Mr. Speaker, you know what  extraordinary institutions they are.   Today, Latrice lives in Upper Marlboro. Whose district do you think  that is, Mr. Speaker? Just take a wild guess. The Fifth Congressional  District of Maryland that I have had the proud privilege of serving for  the last four decades.  [[Page H1569]]    Sadly, Latrice will shortly be leaving the House. You have heard me  say this about other of our staff: The American people have no idea how  talented our staff is and how hardworking, how patriotic, and how  committed they are to this country and to this institution.   I would hope that all of us would, on a regular basis, tell them.   Latrice is an extraordinary person, but she is representative of  those who work with us. That is the great truth and great privilege  that we have as Members of this House serving with such extraordinary  people who serve this institution. They serve us, and they serve this  country so well.   I know that feeling all too well, having just said good-bye to my  floor director, Shuwanza Goff. All of you know Shuwanza. She is now  serving the President of the United States of America. She, too, was a  historic first on this floor.   I hope that all the Members will join me on both sides of the aisle.  For the most part, this staff is serving this House and this  institution, not a party and not a philosophy, but serving an  institution that we have so proudly call the people's House.   Bill Natcher from Kentucky was the chairman of the Appropriations  Committee on which Nancy  and I both served. He used to say, when he  brought his bill to the floor: This is the people's bill in the  people's House.   How proud we are that nobody can appoint us to this institution; we  have to be elected to the House of Representatives.   Latrice, you have served all of us so very, very well. We love you,  and we wish you the very best in the days ahead. God bless you, and  Godspeed. We love you.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
