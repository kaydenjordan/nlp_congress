 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  862, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind screens  and back in the classroom.    Mr. Speaker, I fear that H.R. 842 is going to have  serious long-term consequences for entrepreneurialism here in America.   Mr. Speaker, I started a company 30 years ago out of my college dorm  room at Caltech, and I grew it the way that most small businesses are  grown in America. I grew it organically. That means that when I had a  little bit more business than I, myself, could do, I contracted that  business out to other people who could do that business for me.   Mr. Speaker, under this bill, that practice will be illegal because  it violates the so-called B pillar of the bill that prohibits any  contracting that is related to the core business that a company  engages.   Mr. Speaker, if H.R. 842 had been the law of the land, I would not  have been able to start my company, and the hundreds of jobs that we  have created would not have been created here. But they will be created  elsewhere, in other countries, with more sane and less restrictive  laws.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 842.                            ____________________
