 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentlewoman  from Utah, the Honorable Celeste Maloy, be permitted to take the oath  of office today.   Her certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to her election.    Mr. Speaker, as the dean of the Utah delegation, I have  the distinct honor to rise today to introduce the newest Member of the  House of Representatives, Celeste Maloy. Celeste was born in southern  Utah, raised in rural Nevada, and then, as an adult, chose Utah as her  home. Celeste earned an agricultural degree from Southern Utah  University in Cedar City which she now calls home.   She began her career in public service as a soil conservationist at  the USDA in Beaver, Utah, also located within her district, where she  worked for 10 years.   She left Beaver to go to law school at BYU, where she got her law  degree, in my hometown, and she was a law student there, in fact, while  I was her mayor.   Since beginning her late career, she has worked as a deputy county  attorney, a public lands attorney for the Utah Association of Counties  and, most recently, as the chief legal counsel to former Congressman  Chris Stewart.   In a special election, Celeste assembled a coalition of both rural  and urban voters. She was unafraid to stand for conservative  principles, calling for debate in each of her 13 counties. In her  district, she is known to be a hard worker, levelheaded, and  consistently conservative.   We were all a little surprised that she won the election since the  last thing she won was her 7th grade spelling bee, but the secret to  her heart is simple: offer her a Dr. Pepper and her number one food  staple, cottage cheese. Better yet, ask her about her 90-year-old  grandmother, who is her biggest political fan and best critic, or her  other grandmother who was her roommate when she was in high school and  they worked at the same truck stop.   She is the fourth of six kids--this is how we do families in Utah-- which means that most of her life she has been in a bunk bed.   Finally, my colleagues will remember her predecessor, Chris Stewart.  He was known for having several speed records around the world in his  plane. Celeste does not have a flight speed record, but I hear,  unbeknownst to the Utah Highway Patrol, she has several speed records  on I-15 in her district.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield to my fellow Utahn, Celeste Maloy.                                time  1915
