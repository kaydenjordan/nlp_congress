 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill, S. 2661, the National  Suicide Hotline Designation Act by Senators Gardner, Baldwin, Moran,  and Reed. It is the Senate companion of legislation I introduced with  Representatives Stewart, Moulton, and Eddie Bernice Johnson.   It designates ``988'' as the universal telephone number for the  National Suicide Prevention Lifeline system. This means no matter where  you are in the country, just like when you call 911, when you call 988,  you will be connected to mental health resources.   This legislation also authorizes States to collect a fee limited to  supporting local crisis call centers that are affiliated with the  national network or enhancement of such services. It also sets a 1-year  deadline to complete technical upgrades to enable the number.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad we have been able to work together on this  measure and others to improve the network of services that make up the  suicide prevention lifeline and to educate Americans about suicide  prevention. These bills are badly needed by a Nation working to emerge  from an unprecedented health and economic crisis, and it is badly  needed in Montana where, tragically, we have one of the highest rates  of suicide in the country.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to come together here today to  advance these bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Stewart).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah for his leadership. I  urge adoption of this, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5918, the Emergency  Reporting Act, which was introduced by Representatives Matsui, Eshoo,  Thompson, and Huffman.   Today's legislation will allow 911 centers across the country to have  access to confidential information on potential 911 outages, subject to  appropriate safeguards.   In times of disaster, 911 public safety answering points do not  always know that 911 calls may not be going through. The FCC currently  collects information on the status of communications infrastructure and  communications network outage information. They make that information  available to the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate overall  emergency response efforts within a State between State and local first  responders.   Given the sensitive nature of this data to both national security and  commercial competitiveness, this information is confidential. However,  as first responders work to ensure the 911 system can seamlessly get  back online and route calls to neighboring call centers, access to this  confidential information is important.    This bill would help make timely outage information available to help  first responders on the ground restore service as quickly as possible.  The bill also requires the FCC to hold a field hearing in areas in  which the Commission's Disaster Information Reporting System was  activated for 7 or more days and to provide an initial and final report  on the status of communications networks.   The FCC only activates the DIRS system for significant natural  disasters, such as Hurricane Sally or the wildfires out West. The bill  limits these types of reports to only areas where damage was  significant and sustained.   This is an important bill to the resiliency of our public safety  networks, and I urge my colleagues to support the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reiterate my support for this bill. I urge adoption,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5567, the MEDIA  Diversity Act, introduced by my friend from Missouri, Representative  Long.   This legislation represents another step forward to uplift minority  voices and promote media diversity. I understand how important it is to  serve communities with local programming that accurately reflects a  community's population.   I have also seen the media industry make great strides to promote  diversity and create new content to appeal  [[Page H4614]]  to communities that they serve. Many programs and initiatives have been  established to promote opportunities for women, minorities, veterans,  and other socially disadvantaged individuals to participate in the  media marketplace.   Of course, the media industry is only one small part of the vast  communications marketplace that also includes mobile wireless  providers, online video distributors, fixed broadband providers, and so  on.   There are also new entrants in the tech industry who are providing  additional opportunities for minorities, women, veterans, and  underrepresented groups that make their voices heard. There is still  work to do to make sure these voices and underserved communities are  represented in traditional media and all other areas of the large  communications marketplace, and this legislation will help.   I am glad to support this piece of bipartisan legislation that will  allow the FCC to evaluate the market barriers socially disadvantaged  individuals face in the communications marketplace.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation to make sure all voices are heard, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 451, the Don't Break Up  the T-Band Act, as amended by the Energy and Commerce Committee to  include provisions from Republican Leader Walden's FIRST RESPONDER Act.   Today's legislation will allow first responders to retain access to a  critical band of spectrum as they continue to make plans to transition  mission-critical voice functions to the FirstNet Network.   The bill also takes a strong stand against States that divert vital  resources away from maintaining and upgrading their 911 systems by  creating strong safeguards to help prevent diversion of fees collected  for 911 operations.   Currently, States charge American consumers a monthly fee on their  phone bills to support 911 services. Yet, some States do not use the  money collected from this fee to support 911. Rather, they use it for  other State priorities unrelated to providing critical 911 services or  dispatching first responders during an emergency. In some cases, States  siphon these funds directly into their general fund, and in  [[Page H4616]]  other cases States use these fees for other public safety-type expenses  that do not directly support 911 services. Those States are currently  classified by the FCC as 911 fee diverters.   To clarify what is considered a diversion, and what is considered to  support 911 services, the bill directs the FCC to clarify its rules of  what obligations or expenditures are acceptable. These rules would be  crafted with input from States to ensure that appropriate 911 uses are  included.   Additionally, if a State has expenditures that don't fit squarely  within the eligible uses determined by the Commission, but can provide  documentation and receipts to show how those expenditures support  public safety answering point functions and operations or the ability  to dispatch emergency responders, then the States ought to have an  opportunity to challenge the acceptable nature of those expenses, and  this bill provides for that as well.   For the States that are truly bad actors, I think we can all agree  that those States should be held accountable for their shameful  practice of diverting 911 fees for programs completely unrelated to 911  services. Misleading the public on something this important to public  safety is unacceptable.   To that end, this bill sets up a strike force of State law  enforcement officers, public safety officials, and others to consider  potential criminal penalties to end fee diversion at its source. This  strike force would also study jurisdictional, budgetary, and other  barriers to ending diversion.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Engel and Chairman Pallone for  working with us to add this important language to the bill. I would  also like to thank FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly, for his work on  the issue. He has been a steadfast champion on trying to address this  issue and hold States accountable to the fullest extent of the law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation by my colleagues, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4866, the National  Centers of Excellence and Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Act  introduced by Chairman Pallone and Representative Guthrie.   This legislation would direct the FDA to designate higher education  institutions as national centers of excellence, allowing the FDA to  work with the centers and industry to create a national framework for  implementation of continuous manufacturing technology.   Last October, the Committee on Energy and Commerce held a hearing on  safeguarding the pharmaceutical supply chain. At this hearing, Dr.  Janet Woodcock, Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research  at the FDA, spoke at length about the advantages of advanced  manufacturing technology, such as continuous manufacturing.   This included the potential to reduce our dependence on foreign  sources of active pharmaceutical ingredients, increase our  manufacturing resiliency, and reduce quality issues that often trigger  drug shortages. Increased adoption of these technologies could open the  door to a revived U.S. manufacturing base and lower production costs,  resulting in lower drug prices and a more stable drug supply.   Given the potential this technology holds, I am pleased we are moving  forward with this bipartisan legislation to further advance this  development. I  [[Page H4618]]  urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie).    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7574, the Strengthening  America's Strategic National Stockpile Act, which was introduced by  Representatives Slotkin and Brooks.   The legislation that I cosponsored along with a long bipartisan list  of others is a combination of bills to improve the Strategic National  Stockpile, or SNS.   This includes allowing the SNS to sell off products in the stockpile  before their expiration so that they could be used.   It directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to examine user  fee agreements, improve maintenance of the stockpile, and allowing for  agreements with domestic producers of supplies to improve the supply  chain to refresh and replenish existing stocks.   It also directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the  Centers for Disease Control to report on distributions from the  stockpile, as well as requests for supplies from State, local, Tribal,  and territorial agencies. It would authorize a pilot program for  establishing State stockpiles and increase the Strategic National  Stockpile funding authorization to $705 million.   We need to ensure our country is prepared to deal with whatever  health crisis it faces, no matter if it is disease, disaster, or  terrorism.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation to refill  and improve the Strategic National Stockpile.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this important legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2271, Scarlett's  Sunshine on Sudden Unexpected Death Act, which was introduced by  Representatives Moore, Cole, Herrera Beutler, and others.   The mother of Scarlett Pauley, the namesake for this bill, told her  heartbreaking story to our committee back in January on the third  anniversary of her daughter's death.   No parent should have to find their child dead, and especially of  unknown causes.   This legislation would create grant programs at the Centers for  Disease Control to State and local agencies and nonprofits to address  sudden unexpected infant and childhood deaths.   These grants would support efforts to standardize investigations into  these deaths to better understand the medical causes that trigger these  tragic deaths.   With permission of the families, these grants would also support  genetic testing to research the causes of death.   Finally, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human  Services to help States and local governments review 100 percent of all  infant and child deaths and enter such reviews into a national  reporting system to help health researchers combat these tragedies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this important legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4995, the Maternal  Health Quality Improvement Act, which was introduced by Representatives  Engel, Bucshon, Torres Small, Latta, Adams, and Stivers.   The legislation authorizes grants for developing and sharing maternal  health best practices and training health professionals.   It also supports the Health Resources and Services Administration's  establishment of rural health networks to reduce maternal and child  mortality rates and reduce inequities in health outcomes amongst  different populations.   It also ensures obstetric care is an eligible service for telehealth  grants.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the American Hospital Association, the  March of Dimes, the American Medical Association, and others for their  support of this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Bucshon).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate Dr. Bucshon's leadership  on this bill. I am excited to see this pass the House.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3935, the Protecting  Patients Transportation to Care Act, introduced by Representatives  Carter and Cardenas, and Representatives Graves and Bishop of Georgia.   This legislation would require Medicaid to cover nonemergency medical  transportation, or NEMT. This can help rural Medicaid patients get to  dialysis, preventive care, and substance abuse treatment.   Covering this transport can ensure these patients get the care they  need, improving outcomes and reducing the need for expensive emergency  room visits and hospitalizations.   In my home State of Montana, it can take 2 hours or more to get to a  specialist. This important legislation will help ensure rural patients  have the ability to get to their providers.   H.R. 3935 would also require States to ensure that NEMT providers are  not on the excluded providers list; that each individual driver has a  valid driver's license; and that providers report and address  violations of State law, including traffic violations.   It would require the Comptroller General to conduct a study on  coverages of NEMT by State Medicaid programs, including the policies  and program integrity measures in place to prevent waste, fraud, and  abuse.   Finally, the bill would require the Secretary to analyze any NEMT  data and report to Congress on his or her findings within one year of  the date of enactment.   The legislation also requires State Medicaid programs to develop a  utilization management process for the benefit.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this important legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1646, the Helping  Emergency Responders Overcome, or HERO Act, which was introduced by  Representative Bera.   This legislation would create a database at the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention to capture public safety officer suicide  incidents and study successful interventions.   It would also authorize a grant program for peer support and wellness  programs within fire and emergency medical service agencies, as well as  for frontline healthcare workers. It also directs the Secretary of  Health and Human Services to develop best practices and share resources  for addressing post-traumatic stress in public safety officers.   This legislation is incredibly timely. Emergency workers and doctors  and nurses are under incredible strain, and many are unable to be with  their families due to their efforts to prevent the spread.   Losing those who keep us safe will only make the crisis worse. My  home State of Montana, unfortunately, has one of the highest suicide  rates in the country.   I do want to recognize all those who supported the Yellowstone Valley  Out of the Darkness suicide awareness event over this past weekend in  Billings, Montana. I appreciate you making sure others realize they are  not alone.   We must ensure that all these heroes across America on the front  lines of healthcare and law enforcement and public safety have the  support they need to continue working to keep us safe.   Madam Speaker, this is an importantly critical piece of legislation.  I  [[Page H4630]]  urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4564, the Suicide  Prevention Lifeline Improvement Act, introduced by Representatives  Katko, Cardenas, and Representatives Graves and Bishop from Georgia.   This legislation will increase the authorization of the National  Suicide Prevention Lifeline program to $50 million each year through  fiscal year 2022.   This bill ensures funding is available for the continued operation of  the suicide hotline. When an individual in crisis calls the suicide  hotline, they can't get a busy signal. This is crucial, again, in this  time of economic distress and social isolation.   I know we will also consider several other pieces of legislation,  including designating 988 as the extension for the national suicide  hotline.   With more individuals in crisis, more calls will come. We must  increase awareness of this critical resource and make it easier to  remember the number.   We must make sure the national suicide hotline is prepared to deal  with those in crisis. This issue has been one of my top priorities in  Congress, and I am glad we have been able to work together to get this  done.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1830     Madam Speaker, in closing, this is a critical issue in  Montana. We have one of the highest suicide rates in the country, and  making these services available is critical.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4585, the Campaign to  Prevent Suicide Act introduced by Representative Beyer and me. I want  to thank my friend,  Don Beyer, for leading the effort on the bill.   Our bill directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as  well as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,  to conduct a national suicide prevention education campaign. This  includes advertising the new 988 number for the National Suicide  Prevention Lifeline.   The measure also encourages individuals to engage people showing  signs of suicidal behavior to provide them with the support that they  need.   We introduced this legislation to complement the efforts of both the  legislation to designate 988 as the suicide hotline and Mr. Katko's  legislation to ensure funding to implement the designation. These bills  are badly needed by a nation working to emerge from an unprecedented  health and economic crisis.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to come together here today and  advance these bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, in closing, I just want to thank my  friend,  Don Beyer, again for his partnership on this and his real  leadership.   This is an important piece of legislation, Madam Speaker. I urge my  colleagues to adopt it today, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5619, the Suicide  Prevention Act, by Representatives Stewart and Matsui.   This legislation establishes two grant programs to prevent self-harm  and suicide. One would be to help train emergency room personnel in  suicide prevention strategies and screening. The bill also establishes  a grant program to enhance data collection and sharing to help save  lives.   My home State of Montana, unfortunately, has one of the highest  suicide rates in the country. I thank my colleagues for bringing  forward this important legislation.   Madam Speaker, this is an important piece of legislation. I urge my  colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5663, the Safeguarding  Therapeutics Act, introduced by Representatives Guthrie and Engel. This  legislation would extend FDA's administrative destruction authority to  counterfeit and other illegal medical devices.   Under current law, the FDA is authorized to destroy certain imported  drugs that may pose a threat to public health; however, this authority  does not extend to medical devices.   The passage of this legislation during the coronavirus pandemic is  especially timely, as we have seen a surge in counterfeit COVID-19 test  kits imported to the United States.   But it is not only counterfeit COVID-19 test kits entering our  borders and posing risks to U.S. consumers. International mail  facilities have also intercepted shipments of illegal contact lenses  and combination products in recent years.   This additional authority will prevent shippers from trying to send  illegal products back to the United States and may deter future illegal  shipments of medical devices.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Representatives Guthrie and  Engel, for working together in a bipartisan manner to advance this  legislation to provide the FDA with the additional tool to protect  American consumers against potentially dangerous medical products.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Guthrie for his leadership on this and  taking the initiative to get out and understand the issue on the ground  and crafting bipartisan legislation to solve this problem and protect  American consumers.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
