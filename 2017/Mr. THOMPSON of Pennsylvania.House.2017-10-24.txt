 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Bat Week, which is an annual, week-long event highlighting the  important ecological and economic benefits of bats.   With more than 1,300 different species worldwide, bats are both  diverse in appearance and how they keep ecosystems balanced. Bats play  an essential role with insect control, pollination, and seed dispersal.  One bat can eat 2,000 to 6,000 insects each night, including moths,  beetles, flies, mosquitoes, and more.   Because of their incredible appetites, farmers can use fewer  pesticides to control insects. This helps our Nation's farmers and  saves billions of dollars each year.   Mr. Speaker, bats also play other roles outside of our ecosystems,  including in medical research. Scientists studying vampire bats have  created anticlotting medication to help stroke victims.   These are just a small portion of the ways bats positively impact our  daily lives, and I am pleased to see these wonderful creatures  recognized during Bat Week.   I appreciate the great work being performed by private conservation  organizations, Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, U.S.  Geological Survey, and many other State partners, such as the  Pennsylvania Game Commission on Bat Week 2017.                            ____________________
