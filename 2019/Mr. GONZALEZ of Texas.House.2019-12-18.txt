 Madam Speaker, I rise on a sad day for  America, a sad day for Texas, and a very sad day for the people I  represent. I am not gleeful for today.   I came to Congress to lower the costs of prescription drugs, fight  for a debt-free education, and improve the care of special-needs  children, our seniors, and our veterans.   I did not come to Congress to impeach a sitting President, but we  have been given no choice. He has eroded the foundations of our  democracy and used the office of the Presidency for personal and  political gain.   Our Founding Fathers feared that one day the power of the Presidency  would stretch beyond its limits; thus, they enshrined in the  Constitution a system of checks and balances.   We cannot and will not lower the ethical standards of our Presidency.  We cannot afford to wither like a cheap flower in bad weather, watching  our democracy crumble and rot from within.   That is not the America the world knows and loves, and it is  certainly not the America we would be proud to have our future  generations inherit. And that is why, today, I must vote to impeach the  President of the United States and fulfill my oath to the Constitution.
