 Mr. Speaker, this is a bittersweet moment.   I am grateful to have the opportunity to stand on the floor of the  U.S. House of Representatives, an institution shaped by years of  Speaker Kevin McCarthy's faithful leadership. I thank and honor him for  his service to the people of our State and to our  [[Page H6968]]  country. I am also sad to be saying farewell.   I have known Speaker McCarthy as a staffer, State legislator,  Congressman, whip, majority leader, and Speaker of the House. Like many  of us, he supported me and built me up to where I am today. I am most  proud to know him as a mentor and friend.   One of his greatest strengths is that he listens. He gets to know his  Members and plays to each of their individual strengths to create a  winning team. His work for our home State and for our country has been  invaluable.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful beyond words to have been a member of his  majority and to have fought with him to better the lives of  Californians and all of our fellow Americans.   You will always be my friend. Thank you for everything you have done  for me and for the country.
