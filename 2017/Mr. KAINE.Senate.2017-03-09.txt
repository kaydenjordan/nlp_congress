 Mr. Presidents, a skilled workforce is essential to  addressing the growing cyber security challenges in the United States.  The Department of Defense, DOD, Cyber Strategy, issued in April 2015,  cites building the cyber workforce among its objective's for achieving  the essential strategic goal of maintaining ready forces and  capabilities to conduct cyberspace operations. In Virginia, it is  estimated that 36,000 cybersecurity jobs remain unfilled.   Beginning in 2001, DOD funded the Information Assurance Scholarship  Program, IASP, vhich boosts the Nation's cyber workforce through  scholarship and capacity-building grants to colleges and universities  designated by the National Security Agency and the Department of  Homeland Security as Centers of Academic Excellence, CAE. Scholarship  recipients are required to fulfill a service obligation by working in a  cyber security position at DOD upon graduation.   According to a DOD report from February 2015, the IASP Program had  employed 593 students and awarded 180 capacity-building grants to CAEs.  However, due to budget constraints, DOD reduced funding for the IASP  beginning in 2013 and stopped recruiting new students. The IASP  received its peak funding level of $7.5 million in 2005--for fiscal  year 2017, it received $500,000.   Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleague Senator Rounds,  the DOD Cyber Scholarship Program Act of 2017. The DOD Cyber  Scholarship Program Act of 2017 would reinvigorate the IASP to boost  our Nation's cyber workforce. The bill would rename the IASP as the DOD  Cyber Scholarship Program and express the Sense of Congress that the  program is an important tool for boosting our cyber defense workforce.   The DOD Cyber Scholarship Program Act would also modify the program  by expanding scholarships to students pursuing Associate's Degrees.  There are currently 46 two-year institutions designated as CAEs, which  would be eligible to apply for grants. Associate's degree programs  could provide a valuable source of technical personnel, at a lower  cost, to DOD. The bill would require that at least 5 percent of  scholarship funds go to 2-year program students.   The DOD Cyber Scholarship Program Act would authorize the DOD Cyber  Scholarship Program to receive $10 million in fiscal year 2018. At its  peak in 2005, the IASP received $7.5 million. Since then, the cost of  tuition has increased considerably and the need for skilled cyber  professionals has never been greater. Ten million dollars is an  appropriate funding level to reinvigorate the program, expand it to  associate's degree recipients, and allow for manageable program  execution from DOD and the National Security Agency.   The DOD Cyber Scholarship Program is a commonsense, bipartisan bill  that would help students succeed in today's economy and strengthen our  national security. There are good-paying jobs in Virginia and across  the country in the cyber field that are going unfilled, and it is clear  we must make it easier for students to access the programs that prepare  them for these roles. Expanding scholarship funds so they're available  to community college students will help put more of our nation's  students on a path to success and support our national security needs.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Cruz, and Mr. Leahy):   S. 594. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to  work with cybersecurity consortia for training, and for other purposes;  to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
