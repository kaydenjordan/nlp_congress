 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good friend,  Mayor Keith Riddle of Burkesville, Kentucky, on his retirement from  public service after 22 years.   His years as a city council member, in addition to his years spent as  mayor, have had a profound impact on his fellow citizens. By dedicating  his time to taking on countless projects to improve the city and well- being of community members, Mayor Riddle has made great strides for the  citizens of Burkesville.   Most notably, during Mayor Riddle's tenure, he was instrumental in  the construction of a new water treatment plant, which produces 2  million gallons per day of clean water for the city and surrounding  area.   Another massive waterline improvement project was completed under the  watchful eye of Mayor Riddle. This project replaced nearly 100-year-old  lines and addressed wastewater overflow to provide improved protection  of property, rivers, and streams in the community.   Mayor Riddle has truly dedicated his time and talents to helping  Burkesville grow and improve. His continuous work with the water  department, fire and police departments, and various businesses in the  area has helped set the stage for continued success in Burkesville.   On behalf of the First District of Kentucky, I thank Mayor Keith  Riddle for his decades of public service and wish him continued success  in his retirement.                                time  1100                  Recognizing Philanthropy of Darren Cleary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend Darren  Cleary of Tompkinsville, Kentucky, for all the great philanthropy he  has given to my home county of Monroe.   Darren is the epitome of a successful businessperson who truly gives  back to his community. Darren sponsors many activities and events  throughout the year in Tompkinsville, including our annual July Fourth  fireworks event at City Park.   He has donated countless dollars to the Monroe County School system  for, among other things, a new practice football field for the varsity  football team, and along with his wife, Dawn, he is the reason Monroe  County now has a swim team.   Darren's main companies, Cleary Construction and Precision  Engineering, together are two of the biggest private employers in  Monroe County. Tompkinsville, Kentucky, is very fortunate to have  Darren Cleary as its citizen.    Congratulating Monroe County Magistrate Karen Gordon on Her Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Monroe County  Magistrate Karen Gordon of my hometown of Tompkinsville in the First  District of Kentucky on her retirement from public service.   Since taking office in a 2011 special election to fill the unexpired  term of her late husband, Karen has steadfastly served her fellow  Monroe Countians over the years and has continually sought  opportunities to improve the lives of those around her. Her service as  Monroe County's Fourth District magistrate, and a crucial member of the  Heart of Tompkinsville board, has spurred economic opportunity and  instilled a stronger sense of community pride in her fellow residents.   I join with her daughters, Ann Marie and Amber Lee, as well as her  extended family, friends, and all those who have benefited from her  efforts, to recognize her distinguished record of public service and  dedication to serving others.                      Recognizing Service of Alonzo Ford     Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize my friend Alonzo  Ford from my hometown in Monroe County, Kentucky, specifically  Gamaliel, Kentucky.   For nearly three decades, Alonzo's fellow citizens have reelected him  to serve as the First District magistrate in Monroe County. This  district includes Gamaliel and Fountain Run. He is widely respected as  a public servant, and his leadership on several boards, including the  farmers market board and the wellness center board, are a testament to  his outstanding record of  [[Page H10112]]  diligent public service in all facets of life.   I am deeply thankful for his friendship, and I admire his tireless,  lifelong devotion to working for the benefit of others. I join with his  family and friends, as well as those he has impacted during his career,  to express our dedication and gratitude for his contributions to our  hometown.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it has been a long road of debate to reach an  agreement on the 2018 farm bill. This bill benefits all of rural  America, our farmers, producers, and consumers. The agreement we have  reached on this year's bill includes many important provisions that  will help farm country during tough economic times, fully protecting  crop insurance and providing certainty to farmers.   I am particularly glad to see industrial hemp de-scheduled from the  controlled substances list, a key provision I worked with Leader  McConnell on to ensure unnecessary government restrictions are lifted  from this valuable agricultural commodity.   I thank Leader McConnell for his collaboration and attention to  legalizing industrial hemp, and I appreciate all of my colleagues who  supported this issue and helped bring it to the table.   I was proud to represent the interests of Kentucky farmers during  this process, and I look forward to a new year of growth and prosperity  for farmers and producers across rural America.
