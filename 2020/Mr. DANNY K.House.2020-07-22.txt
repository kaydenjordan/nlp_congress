 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker,       To every man there is a way, a ways, and a way,      And the high souls take the high way,      And the low souls take the low.      While all the rest on the misty flats drift to and fro.      But to every man there is a way, a ways, and a way,      And each man decideth which way his soul shall go.    John Lewis always took the high road, always giving of himself in  such a way that you knew that he was gracious and kind.   John had faith.   Like John, I grew up in rural America, went to a one-room school,  never had a new schoolbook. But John had the faith of a mustard seed  and said: If you want to move a mountain, just say to the mountain be  moved. And if it wouldn't, then you get you some dynamite,  nitroglycerin, TNT, and blow that sucker down.   That was John Lewis. May he rest in peace.
