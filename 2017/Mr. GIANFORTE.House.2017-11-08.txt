 Mr. Chair, I rise to join my colleagues in supporting  the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act.   Nearly one-third of the electricity generated in Montana comes from  hydropower. The Libby, Hungry Horse, and Noxon Rapids projects each  have the generating capacity of more than 400 megawatts. There are  dozens more smaller hydropower facilities in Montana, from Thompson  Falls to those around Great Falls, to Tiber and Fort Peck and  Yellowtail.   This legislation will ensure that existing projects will have timely  relicensing and enhance consultation between Federal, State, local  agencies, and our Indian Tribes. It will also help provide certainty  for new projects.   I know, in my home State, there are proposals to electrify existing  flood control and irrigation dams, like the Gibson Dam, that face  ongoing licensing issues. I have introduced legislation to address that  particular one.   This bill is a step in the right direction for hydropower nationwide,  and I am happy to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a special  place: Montana.   From our snowcapped mountains to our nearly endless prairies, Montana  is an awe-inspiring place of tremendous beauty. We call it Big Sky  Country, the Treasure State, the Last Best Place, and we call it home.   When Montana first became a territory in 1864, it was the Wild West.  Prospectors, cattle ranchers, and settlers overcame scorching sun and  blistering cold to establish our Nation's 41st State.   But there is something even more special than the beauty of an  eastern Montana sunset or being knee-deep in a crystal-clear mountain  stream. It is the people of Montana. Montanans are kind, warm,  generous, and hardworking people.   On November 8, 1889, our special place became part of something even  more special, the land of the free and the home of the brave. Today,  Montanans celebrate the 128th anniversary of our statehood.                            ____________________
