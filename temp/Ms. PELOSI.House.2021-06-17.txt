 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his leadership in bringing this important and overdue legislation to  the floor.   Congratulations to you, Mr. Chairman, for being the chair of the  committee and, as your ranking member has said, striving to act in a  very bipartisan way. That doesn't hold for today necessarily; but,  nonetheless, where there is a will, there is a way.   Madam Speaker, nearly 20 years have passed since the Congress passed  the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force, and 10 years have  passed since the formal end of U.S. military operations: Operation  Iraqi Freedom.   Yet, today, 10 years later, our Nation is still operating under an  outdated Authorization for Use of Military Force, which risks being  used, and in some cases has been used, as a blank check to conduct  unrelated military operations.   Let me be clear. Repealing the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military  Force in no way precludes us, our country, from defending our military  and diplomatic personnel in Iraq. Article II of the Constitution, the  2001 AUMF, and the bilateral agreements with Iraq permit this.   But it will prevent a situation in which U.S. military personnel are  deployed or military operations are conducted, without the approval of  Congress or the country, for purposes that are unconnected to the  AUMF's original purpose.   We are here because of the courage of Congresswoman Barbara Lee. No  one has been fiercer or more relentless or more principled on this  issue. I thank Congresswoman Barbara Lee and others who have worked  with her over the years.   I thank also our Foreign Affairs chair,   Gregory Meeks, who has  moved this bipartisan priority with both urgency and unity through the  committee.                                time  1000    We are pleased that this legislation, which has previously passed the  House twice, has over 130 cosponsors. Thank you, also, to Senator Tim  Kaine, a longtime leader on AUMF repeal and reform in the Senate, who  has introduced a companion bill in the Senate.   Repealing the 2002 AUMF will defend Congress' constitutional  authorities and our American democracy's system of separation of  powers.   Under the Constitution, it is the Congress that has the sole duty to  declare war. We must reassert that authority to decide if and when our  country goes to war.   This repeal is also possible because of the leadership of President  Joe Biden, who understands and has respect for Congress' constitutional  authorities. He understands the need for this action to keep our troops  and the American people safe. Again, that is our first responsibility:  to protect and defend.  [[Page H2905]]    The Congress stands in agreement with the Biden-Harris  administration, which has stated that ``the President is committed to  working with the Congress to ensure that outdated authorizations for  the use of military force are replaced with a narrow and specific  framework appropriate to ensure that we can continue to protect  Americans from terrorist threats.''   Why has that been elusive, for us to come up with a better, more  focused plan?   Madam Speaker, just for public information, when we have tried to  come up with a newer, fresher, more appropriate AUMF, we have three  challenges.   What is the scope? What is the Authorization for Use of Military  Force for? Is it for boots on the ground? Is it for air? What is it  for? What is the scope that we are giving the authority to the  executive branch to use?   What is the geography? How far does that extend? Is this global? Is  it specific to a region?   These are important decisions because some of the threats are, shall  we say, unpredictable. But that doesn't mean what we do here should be  unpredictable.   The third is the timing. How long does it last? What is it for? How  far in geography does it extend? And how long does that authority last?   Over time, as we have tried to replace this outdated Authorization  for Use of Military Force, we have run into those disagreements  internally as well as with the White House. But the more the public  knows about our commitment to honoring our constitutional  responsibility--and we will work with a President who is not here to  undermine that--hopefully, we will have that authorization, as  necessary, as we go forward.   As Members of Congress, the first duty we have is to keep the  American people safe. That includes our courageous men and women in  uniform, who sacrifice every day for our freedoms.   To do this, we must pursue a National Security Strategy and a defense  policy that are smart, strong, and strategic. And we look forward to  working with the administration on this vital mission.   With that, I again salute our distinguished colleague from  California, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, for her persistence and her  leadership; our distinguished chairman, Mr.   Gregory Meeks.   Again, I am grateful for the courteous consideration of this  legislation today, although we may not be in complete agreement.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong vote for H.R. 256, to repeal the 2002  Authorization for Use of Military Force, and hope that we will have a  strong bipartisan vote.
