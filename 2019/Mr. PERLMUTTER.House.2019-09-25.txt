(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--        (1) the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public Law       115-334) legalized hemp by removing it from the definition of       ``marihuana'' under the Controlled Substances Act;        (2) despite the legalization of hemp, some hemp businesses       (including producers, manufacturers, and retailers) continue       to have difficulty gaining access to banking products and       services; and        (3) businesses involved in the sale of hemp-derived       cannabidiol (``CBD'') products are particularly affected, due       to confusion about their legal status.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 1595.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud we are here today to pass this bill about  public safety, accountability, and respecting States' rights. Forty- seven States, four U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia have  spoken and legalized some form of recreational or medical marijuana,  including cannabidiol. 318.2 million people live in those 47 States.  That is 97.7 percent of the population.   However, because marijuana remains illegal under Federal law,  businesses in these States are forced to deal in cash. These  businesses, their employees, and ancillary businesses cannot access the  banking system.   The fact is, the people in States and localities across the country  are voting to approve some level of marijuana use, and we need these  marijuana businesses and employees to have access to checking accounts,  lines of credit, payroll accounts, and more.   This will improve transparency and accountability and help law  enforcement root out illegal transactions to prevent tax evasion, money  laundering, and other white-collar crime.   Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, this will also reduce the risk of  violent crime in our communities. These businesses and their employees  become targets for murder, robbery, assault, and more by dealing in all  cash, and this  [[Page H7965]]  puts the employees and store owners at risk. Congressman Heck will  speak directly to this point.   The SAFE Banking Act will create a safe harbor for financial  institutions and their employees who choose to do business with a  marijuana company.   Section 3 of the bill is particularly important to not only marijuana  businesses but everyone who might do business with a marijuana-related  company. This section would protect ancillary businesses like real  estate owners, accountants, electricians, and vendors by clarifying  that the proceeds from legitimate cannabis businesses are not illegal  under Federal laws. This proceeds section is the key provision,  allowing all cannabis-related businesses and their service providers to  access the banking system without fear of reprisal.   We have worked with our Republican colleagues on a few changes to  improve the bill since it was marked up in March.   As Mr. Barr will discuss, the bill now includes protections for  financial institutions to provide financial services to hemp and CBD  businesses since we have learned the provisions from the farm bill last  year did not provide sufficient clarity for banks and credit unions to  provide these services.   At Mr. Stivers' urging, we expanded the protections in the bill for  various insurance products, such as workers compensation.   Additionally, we have added language from Mr. Luetkemeyer's Financial  Institution Customer Protection Act, which passed the House 395-2 last  Congress. This language would prohibit bank regulators from directing a  bank to close an account for reputational reasons.   In summary, if someone wants to oppose the legalization of marijuana,  that is their prerogative. But American voters have spoken and continue  to speak. The fact is that you can't put the genie back in the bottle.  Prohibition is over.   Our bill is focused solely on taking cash off the streets and making  our communities safer. Only Congress can take these steps to provide  this certainty for businesses, employees, and financial institutions  across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Heck for his partnership through  the years on this bill. I also thank Representative Stivers and  Representative Davidson for their support and cosponsorship of the SAFE  Banking Act. Subcommittee Chairman  Greg Meeks and Representative Katie  Porter have been very helpful in the process.   Finally, I thank Chairwoman Maxine Waters for shepherding this bill  through the Financial Services Committee and making this a priority.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes,'' and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to my friend for the kind words about  working across the aisle. This has been a partnership in many respects,  lots of interchange.   I would also say to my friend, the Financial Services Committee has  certain jurisdiction. We couldn't take up all of the different things  that the gentleman has suggested, Mr. Speaker, but we were able to take  up this marijuana bill. It is the first time this Congress has done it,  certainly in my terms here, and the reason we did that was because the  chairwoman was a driving force to get this matter in front of the  Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Waters), chairwoman of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, to my friend from Michigan, I guess I  have more confidence in the Federal employees that they can get  something done in the next 180 days.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Heck) who has been working on this subject with me for the last 6  years.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lee), who is a co-chair of the Congressional  Cannabis Caucus and a sponsor of the Marijuana Justice Act which we  hope to see marked up and brought to the floor.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a list of  supporters for the SAFE Banking Act from a broad coalition, including  the National Association of Attorneys General, including 38 State  attorneys general, 20 State Governors, and 18 State banking  supervisors, the United Food and Commercial Workers, the Credit Union  National Association, the Independent Community Bankers Association,  the American Bankers Association, the Mid-size Bank Coalition of  America, the National Bankers Association, Law Enforcement Action  Partnership, the Minority Cannabis Business Association, the Mayors  Coalition for Marijuana Reform, eight insurance trade associations, the  International Council of Shopping Centers, the National Cannabis  Industry Association, the National Cannabis Roundtable, the Cannabis  Trade Federation, the California Cannabis Industry, the Florida  Agriculture Commissioner, the Safe and Responsible Banking Alliance,  the Electronic Transaction Association, the Real Estate Roundtable, the  National Association of Realtors, Brinks, Inc., the National Armored  Car Association, the American Financial Services Association, and  ScottsMiracle-Gro.

Additionally, the Mayors Coalition to Push for Marijuana       Reform, 38 State Attorneys General, 20 Governors, 18 State       Banking Supervisors, and the Florida Agriculture Commissioner       have endorsed the legislation.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), who has been the quarterback of a lot of  this cannabis legislation.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time each side  has remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Meeks), the chair of the Subcommittee on Consumer  Protections and Financial Institutions.    Madam Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Correa).    Madam Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman  from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Madam Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  McHenry). As I said at the top of this debate, this bill is about  public safety, accountability, and respecting States' rights.   Our bill is narrowly tailored to get cash off the streets and improve  public safety in communities across the country.   I thank my cosponsors. They have heard from me. They have been  working with me for years, and I really appreciate that. Especially, I  thank the staff of the Committee on Financial Services, the staff of my  cosponsors, and my own staff for the work they have done to put this  bill and coalition together.   There are many marijuana issues that remain, but this one gets the  cash off the streets. This is about public safety.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the SAFE  Banking Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.
