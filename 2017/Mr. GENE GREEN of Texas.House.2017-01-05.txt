 Section 3:   ``The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators  from each State, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote.   ``Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the  first election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three  classes.''    Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act works,  but the majority of Republicans want to make America sick again.  Republicans have voted more than 60 times to roll back the historic  progress that has been made to expand health care to 20 million-plus  Americans and to improve coverage for those who already have it. At  every turn, they have undermined the law at the expense of American  families and now are setting the path for full repeal.   2.6 million Texans stand to lose healthcare coverage, including  20,000 in our district. Fifty thousand of my constituents would gain  coverage if Texas would have expanded Medicaid along with more than 1  million Texans. Texas stands to lose $62 billion in Federal funding for  Medicaid, CHIP, and financial assistance for marketplace coverage if  the new President and Congress repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Making America sick again is not the solution. Let's don't have a  repeal until we have a replacement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House  Resolution 11.   I'd like to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for  bringing this resolution to the Floor.   Your continued bipartisan support for our friend and ally, Israel,  sets the right tone for any discussion this body has regarding this  vital relationship.   Almost 70 years ago, on May 14, 1948, with the support of fiercely  Democratic president, Harry Truman, the nation of Israel was born.   Created in the aftermath of World War II, the special relationship  that our two countries now enjoy was founded. For 70 years, our  government has supported Israeli interest because they represent  American interest.   Throughout the decades, from Dwight Eisenhower to Barack Obama, from  the great Texan, and Speaker Sam Rayburn to Speaker Ryan, our  government has worked across party lines and across branches of  government to ensure the one, true democracy in the Middle East is able  to grow and prosper without hindrance.   Recently, we have reaffirmed our support for Israel by signing a new  Memorandum of Understanding and resoundingly telling the world that we  support our ally in the Middle East. UNSCR 2334 does not align with  this affirmation.   It should be the policy of the United States to support a viable two- state solution, where Palestinians and Israelis live in prosperity and  security. This does not mean negotiating out of fear or forced  necessity.   I want to, again, express my gratitude and appreciation for this body  and our friends on the Foreign Affairs Committee for leading by  example.   U.S.-Israeli relations have always been bipartisan and should remain  that way. It is my hope the new Administration will build on the  foundation created by the Presidents and elected officials that came  before us and support Israel in a bipartisan fashion.   I ask my colleagues to support House Resolution 11.
