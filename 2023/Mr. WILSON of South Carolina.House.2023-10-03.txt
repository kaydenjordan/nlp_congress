 Madam Speaker, America is sadly in a  conflict of dictators with rule of gun opposing democracies with rule  of law.   This conflict, we did not choose, was begun by war criminal Putin on  February 24, 2022, invading Ukraine, in the murderous tradition of  Hitler invading Poland on September 1, 1939, and Stalin invading Poland  2 weeks later on September 17. In 5 weeks, over 70,000 Poles were  killed in 1939 by the Nazis and Communists, and now thousands of  Ukrainians have been killed by Putin.   I am grateful to have read the book by Senator Barry Goldwater in May  1963, ``Why Not Victory?'', proposing the ultimate achievement of  democracy over Communism.   The Goldwater Presidential campaign led to the hallmark speech, ``A  Time for Choosing,'' by Ronald Reagan in 1964. This led to the Reagan  Presidency and hundreds of millions of people being liberated from  totalitarian communism. More countries today live in freedom and  democracy than in the history of the world due to American military  strength defeating Communism.   The Russian Embassy in Berlin, Germany, which I visited outside on  May 1 this year, clearly reveals Putin's murderous goal of recreating  the evil Soviet empire. The hammer and sickle communist symbol is  maintained over the massive building, revealing that the Russian people  are still being oppressed by a despotic dictator.   With the invasion of Ukraine, Putin now has troops in Moldova and  Georgia with direct threats to Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, and even  Poland to realign international boundaries. The murderous conquest of  Ukraine would be a green light for more conquests putting American  families at risk of attack.   It is reassuring that NATO has never been stronger with Finland and  Sweden joining the alliance. Finland has an 830-mile border with  Russia, and Sweden has given up 200 years of neutrality to stop  dictators.   The European Union has doubled the aid correctly provided by America,  according to analyst Luke Coffey of the Hudson Institute. Additionally,  more than 160 officials across Federal oversight agencies monitor the  U.S. aid to Ukraine.   Democracies must continue to stand together to support the brave  Ukrainians to restore peace through strength. Goldwater was correct in  his book, ``The only alternative to victory is--obviously defeat.''  Putin can end this war today by living up to the agreements that Russia  has already signed for Ukrainian territorial integrity.   The Chinese Communist Party is watching as it plans world domination  by 2049, with the largest peacetime military build-up in world history.  The regime in Tehran continues its chants of death to Israel, death to  America with drones to Putin to murder Ukrainians.   The axis of evil is clear: you have dictator Putin, dictator Xi,  dictator Raisi. They must be stopped now, or every American family will  be threatened by murderers, which I have seen when I saw the murders  that were conducted in Bucha, Ukraine, where innocent civilians, with  their hands tied behind their backs, were brutally executed and buried  by the Putin troops.   As a teenage Republican supporter myself of Barry Goldwater, who  attended the National Draft Goldwater Rally in Washington on July 4,  1963, I will always be grateful for his vision for freedom.

Border security is national security for America.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, yesterday, Arthur Laffer  and Stephen Moore of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, revealed that  Biden was accelerating poverty.   The recent Census Bureau report on income and poverty in 2022 was  god-awful. The supplemental poverty rate rose in 1 year by nearly a  record amount. The child poverty rate doubled. Almost every income  group--old people, young people, males, females, and residents of our  region of the country--lost ground.   Meanwhile, median income fell by 2.2 percent. The average family is  roughly $2,000 poorer than when Biden entered office, following more  than a $6,000 raise in the middle-class incomes under Trump.   Instead of the JFK aspiration of the rising tide lifting all boats,  we now have a falling tide that is capsizing all boats. Biden's  failures are a useful reminder that putting equity over prosperity  leads inevitably to equal misery.   I am very grateful for the leadership of Speaker Kevin McCarthy  promoting border security as national security.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with Biden open borders.                            ____________________
