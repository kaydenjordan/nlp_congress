 Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment.   This amendment, as we know, would require the Department of  Transportation to conduct a highway cost allocation study--the first  one since 1997.   Vehicles are different than they were in 1997, and roadway use has  increased significantly. This study will help us to analyze the direct  cost of highway use by different types of users, and then compare that  to user fee revenue contributions to the Highway Trust Fund.   This is about gathering roadway use information to inform decisions  to address the Highway Trust Fund shortfalls. I encourage my colleagues  to vote yes on the Lummis-Kelly-Cornyn amendment.   Thank you.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 2 minutes.    Madam President, I have great respect for my colleague  from Utah, but I am in firm opposition to his amendment.   It would completely undo months of hard work, bipartisan hard work.  The two major bipartisan infrastructure bills that Chairman Carper and  I and the EPW Committee passed unanimously would be totally undone  here. The bipartisan gang spent months carefully and considerably  negotiating this agreement with the White House. All of these  meaningful investments that I talked about yesterday would be gone: the  new bridge program--gone; supplemental funding for the Appalachian  Development Highway System--gone; broadband funding needed to help  close the digital divide--gone.   We have come too far to throw all of this bipartisan work away on  this substitute. Time is of the essence. Let's give our States the  certainty that they need.   By the way, there is permitting reform in this bill, right here, as  we look at it. Let's get this across the finish line. So I would urge  my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.   Thank you    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute on this amendment.    Mr. President, I rise in support of this bipartisan  amendment in the spirit in which it has been offered.   The amendment will designate five different States--Texas, Louisiana,  Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia--as the future Interstate 14  corridor. The sponsors state that this would really be integral for  economic development support, to support tourism and also provide an  important link to our military facilities.   I encourage my colleagues to vote yes on the Cruz-Warnock amendment.    Madam President, I want to thank the sponsors of the Van  Hollen-Rounds amendment, and I am in full support of this bipartisan  amendment. As the chairman explained that public-private partnerships  under TIFIA would be backed by the surety bond, which would mean that,  in the event of a contractor default, the projects could still be  completed, subcontractors and workers paid, and taxpayer investments  protected. It sounds like a good commonsense amendment, and I am fully  in support.   I would also like to say that the progress we had today is more than  encouraging. We are all, I think, very excited about the prospects of  what the improvements that this bill will make to our transportation  and energy sectors and just the guts of our country in terms of the  physical infrastructure.   With that, I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2354
