 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, tomorrow will mark 3 weeks since the  devastating school shooting in Uvalde, TX.   Over those last 3 weeks, Senator Murphy from Connecticut, Senator  Sinema from Arizona, Senator Tillis from North Carolina, and others  have been working to identify steps that Congress should take to  prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.   This is not an easy debate. It is emotional. It can be divisive, but  it is also very important that we act.   Most often, you hear people say: Do something. Well, they don't give  you a lot of guidance on what that something looks like. And when you  begin to dig down into the details, you find out that there is not a  lot of consensus about what that something should look like.   The good news is, as a result of the work we have been doing these  last 3 weeks, working with our colleagues, I believe we are making good  progress.   Over the weekend, there was an agreement reached between 20  Senators--10 Republicans and 10 Democrats--on a framework, or  principles, for bipartisan legislation to keep our kids and our  communities safe.   Before I go through some of the details of this agreed framework, I  want to explain what it does and what it does not include.   From the beginning, I promised my constituents that when I took an  oath to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States, I did  not take that oath with the intention of violating it. And so I said at  the outset I would not support any additional restrictions on the  rights of law-abiding gun owners.   There are hundreds of millions of guns in America today, and the vast  majority--almost all of those gun owners--are responsible. They are not  a threat to public safety. And so this being a constitutional right to  keep and bear arms, there is no basis to restrict the rights of law- abiding gun owners or to restrict the constitutional rights of many of  our citizens.   I made clear this is a redline of mine from the outset. And this  bipartisan agreement on principles makes good on that commitment.   The gun-related provisions in this proposal will only impact  criminals and those adjudicated mentally ill. Law-abiding gun owners  will not be subject to any new restrictions, period.   Our agreement also strengthens the existing background check system,  something we have had strong bipartisan support for and where we have  had some notable successes in the past, for example, the Fix NICS bill  that passed after this tragic Sutherland Springs shooting, where an  individual, who should not have been able to get a firearm because of  his record of felonies and domestic violence and mental health  commitments, was able to do so because the Air Force had not uploaded  that information into the background check system.   I am proud of the fact that, on a bipartisan basis, we passed that  legislation which compelled Federal Agencies to post this derogatory  information, which disqualifies people under current law, into the  National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Since 2018, when  that bill was signed into law, there have been 11\1/2\ million new  records uploaded into the background check system.   As I said, our agreement on the background check system in this  particular legislation is an attempt to try to make sure that existing  law works the way Congress intended. I am very proud of the bipartisan  work that led to this framework, and I am eager to share more with my  Republican colleagues this week.   The various portions of this proposal can be grouped into three broad  categories.   One is mental health support. To prevent violence, we need to improve  the  [[Page S2905]]  availability and accessibility of mental health services across the  country. If you look at the profile of these young, male shooters-- whether it is in Sandy Hook or it is in Uvalde, TX--they fit a familiar  profile: alienated from their peers, suffering increasingly  deteriorating mental health, not getting any treatment. It is like  circling down the drain. Unless they get some help, they are likely to  do what, unfortunately, too many of our young people do, and that is  commit suicide. In the case of Adam Lanza in Sandy Hook and Salvador  Ramos in Uvalde, they not only commit suicide--because they know they  are not coming out of this alive--but they take innocent lives with  them. So access to mental health support is absolutely critical.   So, too, is the investment in our schools. This includes everything  from physically hardening school buildings to training personnel, to  more effective violence prevention efforts. We know at Uvalde the door  had a lock on it but it didn't work, allowing the shooter easy access  to this elementary school.   All of our students--all--deserve to feel safe in their schools, and  no parent should send their child to school worried that they may not  come home. They deserve to know their child will be safe at school and  the peace of mind that goes along with that. That is why I think these  resources for additional school hardening of that soft target is very  important.   The final portion provides targeted reforms to keep guns out of the  hands of individuals who already, by law, should not have guns to begin  with. Our proposal includes resources for States to implement crisis  intervention orders.   Now, some have talked about red flag laws, but that is actually a  broader category than red flag laws that exist in 16 States. As I said,  some of this assistance for crisis intervention orders will help  administer existing red flag laws, but my hope is that others will  qualify for these resources for other important measures to help  provide support for our communities to aid in crisis intervention,  things like assisted outpatient treatment centers. As I said, 16 States  have red flag laws. Texas does not, and they certainly shouldn't miss  out on access to those resources for crisis intervention.   But one of the things you hear people concerned with most when it  comes to these red flag laws where people who are found, after an  adjudication, to be a danger to themselves and others and can lose  access to their firearms on a temporary basis--it is absolutely  critical that each and every one of those includes protection that  comes from due process of law and particularly when it comes to the  rights of law-abiding gun owners.   Our framework also includes protections for victims of domestic  violence. It shouldn't matter whether the victim is married to their  abuser; if the abuser is convicted of domestic violence, they should  not be able to purchase a firearm.   Our proposal also cracks down on illegal sellers and manufacturers of  firearms, like the man who sold a gun to the shooter who killed 7  people and injured 25 others in Midland and Odessa out in West Texas.  The shooter knew he couldn't pass a traditional background test, so he  traveled to Lubbock, TX, and purchased a firearm from somebody who made  knockoff AR-15s out of parts that he purchased over the internet. And,  of course, no background check was done, and tragedy ensued.   Our provisions also include a review of juvenile records for buyers  under the age of 21. In Uvalde, Salvador Ramos was able to pass a  background check only because no one had any insight--official  insight--into his tortured background. I have said before he was a  ticking time bomb: somebody who mutilated himself; threatened assaults,  including sexual assaults, against his fellow students; somebody who  posted pictures online of the weapons that he had bought and threatened  online to go shoot up a school.   We need to know before somebody walks in and buys a firearm when they  turn 18 what their mental health and criminal record history looks  like, to the extent feasible. Then we need to incentivize more States,  like the States of South Carolina and Virginia that currently upload  mental health adjudications even for juveniles.    To be clear, we agreed on a press statement, a set of principles.  That was very important and hard-fought. But now comes the even more  difficult task of trying to agree on legislative text to actually  implement those principles, and that is what we are working on this  week. My hope is that we can complete that job in the next few days-- hopefully by the end of the week--so that the bill will be available  for all Senators--indeed, all the world--to read, and then Senator  Schumer will have that available, should he choose to do so, to put it  on the floor of the Senate next week.   There has been a lot of talk and speculation in the press about what  was included in the bill, and I am pleased to say that I believe the  principles we came up with will save lives. To me, that is the ultimate  goal, just like the legislation we passed in 2018 to fix the background  check system after Sutherland Springs.   I believe the principles we have articulated, if carried out in  legislative text, which I expect them to be, will save lives. That is  our goal. But we also understand that we are operating here in the  Senate with a 60-vote threshold, that 59 votes won't get it and any  lesser number will not allow us to vote to close off debate and then to  pass a bill. So I want to just talk about ideas that were left out of  this deal because we knew they would jeopardize our ability to get to  60 votes.   There was a lot of desire on both sides to include additional things,  but they were excluded in large part because of our necessity of  getting to 60 votes in order to get a bill--for example, proposals on  universal background checks, assault weapon bans for 18- to 21-year- olds, mandatory waiting periods, a 21-day waiting period for purchases  of all firearms for 18- to 21-year-olds, high-capacity magazine bans,  unconstitutional mandatory safe storage requirements of all firearms in  homes, licensing requirements for purchasing an assault weapon,  criminal penalties for negligent storage of firearms in a home, and low  mens rea--that is a criminal state of mind--standard for straw  purchasing and trafficking firearms.   All of these had been proposed by either President Biden or many of  our Democratic colleagues and were not included in the statement of  principles that was agreed to by 10 Republicans and 10 Democrats. We  knew including any of these components would jeopardize our ability to  get a deal. So anytime our Democratic colleagues tried to push the  envelope as far as they could, we had to remind them of that  requirement and push back.   Again, my view, my redline, my starting point, my premise in all of  this is law-abiding gun owners are not the problem. Law-abiding gun  owners who have passed a background check have a Second Amendment right  to purchase a firearm, and no limitation on their rights is going to  prevent shootings like Uvalde or Sandy Hook or Sutherland Springs. So  focusing on the problem, which is keeping criminals and people with  mental health problems from purchasing firearms under existing law, I  believe, is the right formula to build consensus and get a bill on the  President's desk.   We are still working, as I said, through a lot of the details, but I  am encouraged about where things stand right now. As I said, my goal  all along is the art of the possible. That is what politics is; it is  the art of the possible. It is not everything I want and nothing you  want or everything you want and nothing I want. That is how not to get  a deal. That is how not to accomplish anything.   I am hoping that 10 Republicans supporting the bill is not a ceiling  but is the floor, and we intend to continue to work with our colleagues  to help them understand these principles that we have agreed to, the 20  of us, and to write legislative text that can earn broad bipartisan  support, maybe supermajority support, here in the U.S. Senate.   I want to personally thank our colleagues Senator Murphy, Senator  Sinema, and Senator Tillis for working in good faith to get us to this  point, as well as a number of other Senators who contributed to this  bipartisan proposal.   We still have a lot of work ahead of us. I think in many ways this is  the beginning--not the middle or the end--of our work because now we  need to put  [[Page S2906]]  these principles into legislative text, and then we need to get it on  the Senate floor, get it passed, get it passed in the House, and then  get it to President Biden's desk.   I will be sharing further updates with my colleagues in the  Republican conference this week, and I hope, working together with  Senator Tillis and others, to build additional support on our side of  the aisle.                              U.S. Supreme Court    Madam President, I just want to close on one final note. The  bipartisan work that we have done here in the Senate on this school  safety, mental health, and gun safety bill is a sharp contrast from  what is happening on the other side of the Capitol. House Democrats,  unfortunately, have a history of prioritizing politics over policy, but  now, their games have reached a dangerous low. I am talking about the  safety and security of the members of the U.S. Supreme Court and their  families.   It has been more than a month since the Senate passed bipartisan  legislation to protect them from threats of violence. The legislation  Mr. Coons, a Senator from Delaware, and I introduced--a bipartisan  bill--passed the Senate unanimously. Do you think that happens every  day? Not by a long shot. To get all 100 Senators to support a piece of  legislation means it is really not controversial. But, unfortunately,  once it went to the House, it sat there and languished for a month.   Even as members of the Supreme Court and their families are being  threatened, the House hasn't allowed a vote on that bipartisan bill.  The reason given by our Democratic colleagues in the House is, well,  they want to extend further protection to Court employees and their  families. That could include around-the-clock security details for  everyone from clerks to IT staff and their spouses, children, siblings,  and parents. That makes a mockery of what Senator Coons and I tried to  do.   All we wanted to do is give the police at the Supreme Court the very  same authority that the Capitol Police have to provide protective  details to Members of Congress. In fact, the leadership in both Houses  have permanent details assigned to them, but if a Member of Congress  receives a credible threat, Capitol Police will provide a protective  detail for them. That is all we want to do for the members of the  Supreme Court and their families.    Last week, we received a terrifying reminder of the failure to act  and what the consequences of that might be. U.S. marshals arrested a  man outside of Justice Kavanaugh's home who had traveled all the way  from California to assassinate a sitting Justice on the U.S. Supreme  Court. When he was arrested, he had a Glock 17 semiautomatic pistol. He  had ammunition, a knife, a crowbar, and some zip ties. He told  authorities his plan was to break into Justice Kavanaugh's house, kill  Justice Kavanaugh, and then commit suicide. That was his plan. Thank  goodness law enforcement authorities were able to stop him.   But this close call immediately set off calls for the House to pass  the bipartisan legislation that I was discussing a moment ago--again,  that passed unanimously in the Senate a month ago--but unfortunately,  House Democrats have still refused to do that. They still claim that  the law clerks and other Supreme Court staff who were virtually  anonymous to the public are in dire need of protection too. I think  this is pretty transparently a stalling tactic. It is a pretty lame  excuse for not providing the Supreme Court Justices and their families  with the very same protection that Capitol Police provide Members of  Congress.   The bill that the Democratic House Members say they want to pass  instead was introduced on May 10, almost 5 weeks ago, but they haven't  even voted on that bill yet. Again, this is a transparent attempt to  stall legislation that passed 100 to 0. If House Democrats actually  believed in the snake oil they are trying to sell, they would have  passed their own bill a month ago, but they didn't, and they haven't.  They wasted precious time and left Justices' families vulnerable to  grave danger.   If House Democrats want to vote on a bill that extends protection to  other people, including the leaker of the Supreme Court opinion, they  are welcome to try to do so, but first, they need to pass the  bipartisan bill Senator Coons and I introduced.   The line between legitimate public discourse and acts of violence has  been crossed, and House Democrats cannot continue to turn a blind eye.  We don't have time to spare when it comes to protecting the members of  the Court and their families. If, Heaven forbid, something were to  happen because of a lack of authority that would be conferred by the  Supreme Court Police Parity Act, shame on Members of the House of  Representatives. It would be on them for their failure to act on this  commonsense, bipartisan bill.   Madam President, the House needs to pass the Supreme Court Police  Parity Act today and, if not today, tomorrow.   I yield the floor.
