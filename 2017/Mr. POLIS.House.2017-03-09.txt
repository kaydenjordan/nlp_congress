 Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise before  this body to recognize Mr. Stan Zemler of Vail, Colorado, who is  leaving local government service after a career of over 30 years in our  great State of Colorado.   Mr. Zemler served as the town of Vail's manager for the past 13  years. Before that, as the city of Boulder's acting and deputy city  manager, as the Boulder Urban Renewal Authority's executive director,  and as the CEO of the Boulder Chamber of Commerce, where I met Stan  almost 20 years ago. What a terrific career with positive impacts on  both Boulder County and Eagle County, two very important counties in my  district.   Stan's leadership is about community partnering and consensus  building. He really worked hard with various agencies, including  Federal, State, local government, with the U.S. Forest Service, and the  Department of Transportation to enhance Vail's local community,  international guest services and amenities, and strengthened its  economic position as a sustainable international resort.   He has been active in working with others in the I-70 Coalition and  Colorado Association of Ski Towns. He has won numerous awards for his  service. He will be missed in Eagle County for his service. We remember  him fondly in Boulder County.   Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise to pay tribute to  Stan Zemler on behalf of the residents of the Second Congressional  District and myself personally. His distinguished service to the town  of Vail and municipal government is an important legacy for many years  to come.  [[Page H1962]]                                ____________________
