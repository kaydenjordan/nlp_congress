 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would ensure that the  administration takes into account the problems caused by water  shortages and droughts when addressing climate change.   Climate change is no longer a threat to the future. We are  experiencing the damaging consequences now globally and regionally in  the United States.   According to the Government Accountability Office, climate change has  already cost taxpayers over $350 billion over the last decade.   Water scarcity and drought conditions as a result of climate change  have direct economic, legal, and national security implications for our  society and for our systems of governance.   In my home State of Nevada, the water supply at Lake Mead is already  dangerously low and could face emergency levels as soon as next year.  As our water supply continues to diminish, water prices will continue  to rise for families across southern Nevada, the United States, and the  world.   Under Article 8 of the Paris Agreement, parties must recognize the  importance of addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse  effects of climate change, including drought and increased water  scarcity. And since the United States cannot leave the Paris climate  accord until November 4, 2020, we are still obligated to maintain  certain commitments, and that includes recognizing the fact that rising  temperatures pose an imminent threat to our water supply, especially in  already arid regions.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, almost 2 months ago, I spoke on this  very floor to congratulate the robotics teams at Nate Mack Elementary  and Greenspun Junior High School for advancing to the global robotics  competition.   Today, I am proud to report back that Nate Mack Elementary robotics  team is now the 2019 VEX IQ STEM Research Award World Champions.  Greenspun Junior High also put up a tough fight and made it to the  world finals.   I have closely followed the journey of both these robotic teams this  year and even visited them. They are big sources of pride for Nevada's  Third District, and we could not be more honored to have been  represented by them.   So, today, I want to congratulate Nate Mack Elementary robotics team  and their coach, Casey Juliano, for their well-deserved win and once  again recognize Greenspun Junior High and their coach, Matt Christian,  for making it to the world championships.   On behalf of Nevada's Third Congressional District, congratulations.  We are proud.                            ____________________
