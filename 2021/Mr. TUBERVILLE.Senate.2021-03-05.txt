 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 1386 and  ask that it be reported by number.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2  minutes, evenly divided, to debate this amendment.    Madam President, I started my career coaching high  school football and girls and boys basketball 45 years ago, just a few  years after title IX was enacted. It ensured young women had the same  opportunities as young men and the same access to funding, facilities,  and athletic scholarships.   Title IX has given young women the long-denied platform that had  always been afforded to men, and today America's female athletes are  routinely the best performing on the world stage.   My amendment, cosponsored by Senators Graham and Marshall, recognizes  title IX's role in protecting women in education and in sports.   Under this amendment, educational institutions would be prohibited  from receiving funding if biological males are allowed to compete in  women's athletics. This amendment safeguards fairness and equality for  women. This amendment will ensure that education funding in the bill is  properly directed to schools that are focused on COVID response and  recovery rather than pushing a liberal agenda.   I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act, I move to waive and ask for the yeas and  nays.
