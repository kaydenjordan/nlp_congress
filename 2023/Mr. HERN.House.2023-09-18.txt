 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my  constituent and World War II veteran, William Norman Parker, who passed  away on September 11 as an American hero.   Mr. Parker was one of the first soldiers to arrive on Omaha Beach on  D-day in 1944.   Mr. Parker and his fellow soldiers displayed incredible heroism on  that fatal day and the terrible days that followed. Their courage and  patriotism represent the very best of the American spirit. In July of  this year, Mr. Parker returned to Omaha Beach for the first time since  that day 78 years ago. I can only imagine how he felt standing on that  calm beach then with the traumatic memories from that summer when he  was just 19 years old, risking life and limb for the future of this  country.   My prayer is that he found peace on that beach and returned home  feeling the pride and gratitude of the Nation he fought for. Whether it  be on Omaha Beach or at Ground Zero, America has always stood for  freedom, and we will continue to make that stand.   My thoughts and prayers are with Bill's friends, his family, and  beloved veteran community as he is laid to rest today in Oklahoma. May  this hero rest in peace for always and forever.                            ____________________
