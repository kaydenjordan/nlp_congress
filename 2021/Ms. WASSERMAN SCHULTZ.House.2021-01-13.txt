 Madam Speaker, I rise to support the  impeachment of President Donald J. Trump for seditious acts against  America.   To overturn the 2020 Presidential election, Trump incited a violent  assault on Congress--a treasonous betrayal of our Nation. This criminal  incitement left us with five dead, including a police officer; a  desecrated Capitol; and a second constitutional crisis.   His acts show contempt for the rule of law, the Constitution, and the  foundation of any democracy: a peaceful transition of power.   President Trump is a clear and present danger to American lives and  democracy, and he leaves us no choice but to immediately remove him  from office.
