 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here today to advance the  Justice for Juveniles Act. I thank Chairman Nadler, Leader Hoyer, and  my colleague, Congressman Armstrong, for their support and  partnership on this effort.    The Prison Litigation Reform Act, or PLRA, was passed in 1996 in an  effort to decrease so-called frivolous lawsuits brought by prisoners.  Chief among the PLRA's mandates was a requirement that before seeking  relief for civil rights violations in court, a detained person must  exhaust administrative remedies.   Whatever the merits of that underlying legislation, we now have broad  bipartisan agreement that the language is overbroad in its application  to juveniles.   Studies have consistently shown that juveniles are both more likely  to be abused while in detention and less likely to navigate the  administrative remedies that bar them from seeking relief.   For those of us who have kids or who have worked with children, it is  easy to imagine the difficulty a young person in detention might have  navigating complex legal systems necessary to raise a complaint.   Young people in the criminal or juvenile justice system are more  likely than not to be functionally illiterate, and science has shown  that the brain is not fully developed until a person is in their mid- twenties. It is one of the many reasons our justice system makes a  distinction between juvenile and adult offenses.   That is what we hope to acknowledge with the Justice for Juveniles  Act by exempting juveniles from the requirements of the PLRA.   In addition, the PLRA also limits the kind of relief that juveniles  might seek for civil rights violations while in detention. They cannot  seek relief now for emotional injuries without physical ones as well,  but studies show that youth are especially prone to psychological  injury and abuse, which they often face in detention.   Finally, the PLRA limits the recovery of attorney's fees in such  cases. Again, juveniles are less likely to have  [[Page H2960]]  independent resources to fund an attorney, so that makes it harder for  young people to find an attorney to vindicate their rights.   To those who might question whether we need to correct the PLRA, I  offer the story of the Glen Mills Schools, which inspired this bill.   For almost 200 years, youth from across the United States were sent  to Glen Mills when they ran afoul of the law. But the school's bucolic  campus and renowned athletic teams masked serious daily violence  inflicted upon children placed there.   An explosive 2019 report by The Philadelphia Inquirer revealed years  of sexual, physical, and psychological abuse of the young residents,  including broken bones, threats of retaliation, and sustained physical  assaults at the hands of staff members. Although the stories from Glen  Mills are heartbreaking, they are not unique.                                time  1615    Reports show that mistreatment of young people in juvenile facilities  happens all the time across the country.   Just this past March, despite the recent example of Glen Mills,  children were removed from yet another juvenile detention facility,  just a few miles away, after horrifying new allegations of abuse.   This commonsense, bipartisan legislation passed unanimously on the  House floor last Congress and has the support of over 60 organizations.   I, again, thank Chairman Nadler and the committee members and staff  who helped advance this bill, and I thank the dedicated leadership team  who brought the bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation again.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to share a letter to the  editor from a constituent published this morning. Here is what he said:    I worked the polls for 10 years, which included 20 elections and over  25 hours of training. As the years passed, technology improved,  training got more efficient, and communications were state of the art.  I am so proud to be an American and contributing to our system of  democracy.        At my poll, five of us work together. There are also two       watchers from each party. The results are posted on the door       of the polling place immediately for residents to see. Votes       are checked against duplications and death certificates. We       have a paper ballot that can be matched to a voter machine.       The machines are not hooked up to the internet, preventing       interference and hacking.        My heart breaks with every utterance of voter fraud. Please       don't let the GOP erode voting rights.        Signed: Former Republican.    I share this constituent's frustration. We are both fed up with  people repeating lies about the security of our elections in order to  justify voter suppression.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague,  Representative Cicilline, for organizing this Special Order hour and  for his leadership in introducing and passing the Equality Act, and I  look forward to it being signed into law.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Pride Month and to  celebrate the rich history of LGBTQ activism in the greater  Philadelphia area.   In 1965, years before the Stonewall uprising, protestors borrowed  from the tactics of the civil rights movement and staged a sit-in at  Dewey's lunch counter in Philadelphia in opposition to its policy of  refusing service to ``homosexuals,'' ``masculine women,'' ``feminine  men,'' and ``persons wearing non-conforming clothing.'' Can you imagine  what they would think today?   Philadelphia is home to this--the first and oldest LGBTQ bookstore in  the United States--Giovanni's Room,  [[Page H3002]]  as well as Philadelphia Gay News, the oldest LGBTQ publication in the  United States. As early as 1981, activists were meeting with the local  Department of Public Health to discuss the virus that would eventually  become known as AIDS and put pressure on them to address this growing  crisis.   In more recent history, Amber Hikes, in the City's Office of LGBT  Affairs introduced a more inclusive Pride flag in 2017, adding black  and brown stripes to represent LGBTQ people of color.   Today, activism within Philadelphia's LGBTQ community continues  through groups like the William Way Community Center, and people like  my friend, Kendall Stephens, who is pushing for Pennsylvania to update  its hate crime statute to finally include LGBTQ people as a protected  class.   From early protests to the continued advocacy of today, the  Philadelphia region has plenty to be proud of during Pride Month.                                time  2130
