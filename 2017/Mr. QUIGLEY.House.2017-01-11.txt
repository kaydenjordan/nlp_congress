 Mr. Speaker, a strong, safe, reliable, and efficient  infrastructure system is vital for robust and sustained economic  growth. Comprehensive infrastructure reform is all-inclusive and  requires an ongoing investment by the Federal Government in not just  our roads and bridges but in all of the vital systems that support our  way of life.   Currently, the United States needs around $3.6 trillion in  infrastructure investment by 2020, just to keep our country in a state  of good repair. By contrast, China, perhaps our greatest international  rival, spends nearly four times of its GDP on infrastructure than we do  and announced nearly a trillion dollars more infrastructure spending  just last year.   Put simply, our national infrastructure system is an embarrassment,  earning a D-plus grade from the American Society of Civil Engineers. It  is a threat to our economy, to American jobs, to our national security,  and to our environment.   We need a public transportation system that gets people where they  need to be, keeps our roads clear, and makes our cities better places  to live. We need a freight system that moves products and raw materials  quickly, safely, and efficiently. We need airways that reliably move  people and cargo around the country and the world in a timely manner.  We need river locks and ports that allow American farmers to ship their  products to market, no matter where that is. We need water pipes and  sewers that transport safe, clean water to every American. And we need  to close the broadband gap so that every American can take advantage of  the opportunities the Internet provides.   Investing in America's infrastructure is good politics, good  economics, and the right thing to do. Each year, Americans take around  11 billion trips on public transportation systems like buses, commuter  rail, and light rail, contributing to the $58 billion industry that  employs nearly half a million people. And yet, almost half of our  Nation's buses and a quarter of our rail assets are in marginal or poor  condition.   My city of Chicago is the crossroads for the Nation's freight system,  and each day more than 54 million tons of freight is moved across the  U.S., and nearly a quarter of it passes through the Chicago city  limits--at times, very slowly.   We stand to lose $1 trillion a year in lost sales in 2020, if we fail  to build out our freight infrastructure to keep pace with future  growth.   Congestion is also an issue at our Nation's airports. Ground delays  are becoming a greater challenge as more and more people fly regularly.  These delays can have a very serious consequence, resulting in  passengers being late to their destinations, lost productivity from  cargo sitting on runways, and increased pollution due to needlessly  burning jet fuel.   In addition to air and ground, we must also talk about our waterways.  Each year millions of tons of material traverse inland waterways like  the Mississippi River and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. But, according to  the Army Corps of Engineers, there is a billion dollar maintenance  backlog that threatens to keep our waterways from maintaining adequate  levels of performance.   There are problems in our water and sewer systems, too. The 240,000  water main breaks that occur in this country each year cost us more  than $2.6 billion; not to mention the lost productivity caused by  closed roads, lost water, and other indirect impacts. Nearly all of the  U.S. underground water pipes will reach or surpass their useful  lifespans in the next decade. The longer we wait, the higher the price  tag will become.   Finally, we can use our infrastructure system to promote economic  growth and economic equality, and one great way to do that is to close  the broadband gap and increase access to high-speed Internet. As many  as 50 million Americans live in areas without the ability to get high- quality and useful Internet access. Extending the ability to get online  benefits businesses, employees, students, and everyone else without  this vital utility, all while spurring economic activities that ripple  throughout the economy.  [[Page H304]]    The benefits of smart investment and infrastructure are massive.  Every billion spent in infrastructure creates 13,000 jobs, in addition  to improving the efficiency of the system. And every dollar invested  generates almost $3 in economic activity.   Conversely, the consequences of failing to act are dire. Each  American household stands to lose $3,400 per year in disposable income  thanks to infrastructure deficiencies. That is money taken directly  from our constituents' pockets, money they would use to support  themselves and their families, not to mention the economy as a whole,  which could lose more than $4 trillion in GDP and more than 2.5 million  jobs by 2025.   We owe it to each other and every one of our constituents to act. I  urge the 115th Congress to prioritize infrastructure spending and pass  a comprehensive package that addresses all aspects of the connected  infrastructure system.                            ____________________
