 Mr. Speaker, last week's general assembly meeting  of the Organization of American States, the OAS, in Cancun, was  intended to get greater support from the region to hold Nicolas Maduro  and his regime accountable for their horrific actions against the  Venezuelan people.   However, we fell short of the 23 votes needed to fully enforce a  resolution condemning Maduro for convening a fake constituent assembly  with the  [[Page H5184]]  purpose of undermining the democratically elected national assembly.   I commend the 20 nations. Thank you to the 20 nations that stood up  to the Venezuelan tyrant; especially I want to single out Barbados, the  Bahamas, St. Lucia, Jamaica, Guyana, and Belize.   To our allies in the Caribbean who voted with the people of Venezuela  and not with the regime, I say: Thank you.   And to those who voted against the people of Venezuela and with the  regime, my message to you is: Wake up.   The Maduro regime is a sinking ship and, as that economy continues to  implode, it will take some of the Caribbean nations along with it.   It is in the best interest of the Caribbean nations to work with the  United States, with Canada, with Mexico, and other regional allies to  put an end to the abusive tactics of the Maduro regime once and for  all.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, countries like Nicaragua, whose leader  Ortega is a kindred spirit of Maduro, spoke out to oppose the meeting  and criticized the OAS for what it called interference in Venezuelans'  domestic issues.   Ortega condemned the OAS for taking its rightful action to apply the  Inter-American Democratic Charter for Venezuela, yet Ortega wants us to  believe that he is in favor of negotiating in good faith with the OAS  to improve the electoral, the political, and the human rights situation  in Nicaragua. What a farce.   Ortega has been doing Maduro's bidding at the OAS since day one, and  we see right through him. Ortega has illustrated time and time again  that he is not interested in any reforms, nor is he interested in  restoring any democratic values back to the people of Nicaragua.   But Ortega was not the only one who abandoned the people of  Venezuela. No. El Salvador is another nation that has not once voted  alongside the U.S. on issues related to Venezuela, even though we  continue to provide funds for the Central American Alliance for  Prosperity plan. They like our money. They just don't want to look at  things our way at all.   Last week, I signed onto a letter led by my dear friend Albio Sires  from New Jersey. He wrote this letter to the Department of the  Treasury, urging it to designate the El Salvadorian Foreign Deputy  Minister Jose Luis Merino as a foreign narcotics kingpin for his ties  to illicit activities to drug trafficking, to money laundering, for the  FARC--the FARC that is a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist  organization.   It is pathetic that the Venezuelan regime continues to use certain  countries at the OAS as its puppets to shield itself from regional  criticism.   In the last 2 months, Mr. Speaker, more than 70 people have been  killed by Maduro's regime in Venezuela. Hundreds have been arrested.  Hundreds have been injured by the violence, including a 17-year-old  protester who was shot in pointblank range by pro-Maduro police thugs.   It is unacceptable for us to stand idly by as this cruelty continues  to happen. It is a disgrace that the region could not come together in  a united front to call out the Maduro regime for the violent thugs that  they are, a disgrace to our democratic principles and values, and a  disgrace to the Inter-American Democratic Charter for which the OAS  stands.   The deteriorating situation in Venezuela is an important matter for  the region, for our own interests, Mr. Speaker. Our message must be to  those countries that continue to vote against the people of Venezuela:  Stop being cowards. Be courageous. Stand up to those corrupt bullies in  Venezuela. Do it for the people of Venezuela. How many more have to  give their lives in Venezuela for you to wake up? And if you don't stop  to reassess your support for the thug Maduro, and your willingness to  turn a blind eye toward the suffering of the Venezuelan people, perhaps  America will start to reassess its relationship with you.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank our esteemed chairman as well  as the ranking member.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Speaker Ryan's measure which  reaffirms America's commitment to NATO, article 5 and the principle of  collective defense.   Like my colleagues, I believe that NATO has been indispensable in  deterring another world war and in protecting our values and ideals. It  is our commitment to each other and to those ideals that have made our  alliance so strong, so effective. It is that commitment to each other  that has enhanced the territorial security and stability of each one of  us.   Let us not forget that it was following the terrorist attacks of 9/11  that NATO invoked article 5 for the only time in its history, coming to  the defense of us, the United States. This was a signal of unity, of  strength, and that is what makes article 5 so special.   I also appreciate the pledges of our alliance members to share the  burden of the cost of our mutual defense by aiming to spend at least 2  percent of their GDP on defense by the year 2024. That is so important,  Mr. Speaker, because NATO's role over the years has evolved. We are no  longer facing just the threat of communist aggression; we are facing a  multitude of threats against our mutual national security interests  around the globe, and we need to be prepared for whatever comes our  way.   I am pleased to reiterate my support for Speaker Ryan's resolution. I  thank the chairman and the ranking member for their commitment to NATO  and to the principle of collective defense. It is ever so important in  these dangerous times.    Mr. Speaker, I thank, as always, our esteemed  chairman, Mr. Royce from California, as well as Mr. Engel from New  York, who really run our committee in the most fair, bipartisan way  possible.   I think that our committee is an example for the rest of the House.  But I am so grateful to have worked alongside my chairman and ranking  member, and all of the colleagues in the House Foreign Affairs  Committee in a bipartisan manner; particularly, Mr. Issa, Mr.  Cicilline, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Lowenthal, in introducing and bringing to  the floor this important resolution, H. Res. 351, Condemning the  Violence and Persecution in Chechnya.   Since early April, there have been credible reports that gay or  perceived-to-be-gay men in the Russian republic of Chechnya have been  rounded up, have been detained, have been put into prison camps by the  authorities of Chechnya. And according to international human rights  groups and activists on the ground, the situation has rapidly  escalated. Despite the international attention and the rage, the  beatings and torture did not stop. Men continued to be tortured on a  daily basis, and, allegedly, at least 20 men have been killed.   The latest reports indicate that lesbians are also being targeted  now. This government campaign targeting LGBT individuals is also  inciting ``honor killings.'' Families are being threatened and act out  of fear of also being persecuted. This is appalling.   Putin has given free rein to the Chechen leader and has significant  influence over what goes on in Chechnya. Let's not forget Russia's  deplorable human rights record of silencing religious minorities, of  prohibiting freedom of expression, of restricting free association of  LGBT individuals. This is Russia's record. It is Chechnya's as well.   Nothing has been done. No perpetrators have been brought to justice.  This is why it is up to us in the United States to not sit idly by  while this state-sponsored persecution is ongoing. This bipartisan  resolution, Mr. Speaker, does not only shed light on this dreadful  human rights disaster, but it also calls on the officials of Chechnya  to immediately put an end to the abduction and violence of individuals  based on their real or perceived sexual orientation.   It calls on Putin to uphold the international commitments and protect  the human rights of all people upon which Russia has entered. They have  signed these commitments, yet they don't fulfill them. It holds  accountable those individuals in the attacks who will also be  sanctioned under two existing U.S. sanctions laws that we have passed:  Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act and the Global  Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.   Today, this body has the ability to once again be that strong voice  for human rights of all individuals and to send a clear message to any  oppressor that the United States will not turn a blind eye against  violence, harassment,  [[Page H5216]]  and discrimination, no matter where it happens.   As a country, we have the responsibility to promote our deeply  cherished American values and reaffirm our commitment to fundamental  freedom, especially for those who live under the shadow of oppression  and tyranny. We stand in solidarity with the persecuted, with the  religious minorities, with the ethnic groups, with the suppressed  women, and, in this case, with the LGBT community, because the respect  of human rights of all people remains a U.S. foreign policy priority.   I thank my colleagues for their overwhelming support from both sides  of the aisle who have supported this important resolution, which sends  a unified message that the United States is committed to promoting  human rights and that this crisis must end now because this matter is  not just an LGBT issue--as important as it is--it is a human life  matter and it deserves support from all of us.    Everyone deserves dignity. Everyone deserves respect in the place  they call home, no matter where that is around the world. It is time to  put an end to Chechnya's barbaric LGBT purge.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time and I thank the  ranking member as well.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the National  Air Traffic Controllers Association, also known as NATCA, on its 30th  anniversary.   Since its foundation, NATCA has worked to guide aviation policies and  improve working conditions for its members with one goal in mind: to  ensure that passengers arrive safely to our destinations.   I would also like to recognize three remarkable individuals--Billy,  Jim, and Mitch--whom I have met through NATCA's advocacy efforts. These  men are committed to public service, first through their service in our  Armed Forces, and then later as air traffic controllers ensuring that  Miami's skies remain safe for all. Though Mitch has now retired, I know  that his contributions to our Nation have not stopped.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating NATCA  and its members on 30 years of outstanding public service.                            ____________________
