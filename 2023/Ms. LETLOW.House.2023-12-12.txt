 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the retirement of  a dear friend and respected member of the Ruston, Louisiana, community,  the president of Louisiana Tech University, Dr. Les Guice.   President Guice has tirelessly served Louisiana Tech in multiple  capacities over the course of 45 years and recently completed his 10th  year as the university's president.   He graduated from Louisiana Tech in 1976 with a bachelor of arts in  architecture, earning a master's degree in civil engineering in 1978,  and served as an assistant professor in the Department of Civil  Engineering. He was promoted to associate professor in 1981. After  obtaining his Ph.D. in civil engineering from Texas A&M in 1988, he  earned a full professorship and became the permanent department head of  civil engineering.   President Guice impacted countless students in the classroom before  serving as the dean of the College of Engineering and Science in the  late 1990s. His extensive and impressive list of accomplishments at  Louisiana Tech  [[Page H6826]]  speaks to President Guice's dedication to students and faculty, as well  as his unwavering commitment to excellence and higher education.    His leadership facilitated ground- breaking faculty and student research, multiple national and global  rankings, historic enrollments and graduations, notable philanthropic  campaigns, and the innovative expansion of the school's campus.   President Guice kindled public and private partnerships, bridging the  gap between government resources and private-sector efficiency. He  truly understood the concept of ``town and gown'' by working diligently  with Ruston local officials to make sure it always felt like that  special college town where students could enjoy both the campus as well  as the beautiful amenities the city of Ruston has to offer.   He consistently inspired both students and faculty to seize their  potential, ultimately enabling the university to achieve higher goals  year after year. He promoted diverse perspectives among his teams and  encouraged each person around him to pursue their passions, and then he  would give them the runway to fly.   I remember attending an event where President Guice was giving a  campus update to the community. He asked all of his faculty and staff  to stand up. He gave all the credit for every success that Louisiana  had under his presidency to them. That is the kind of man President  Guice is: always working behind the scenes, giving credit to others,  and delighting in their successes.   There is a reason people call Louisiana Tech a family. You can't help  but feel it when you are on their campus. That kind of culture comes  from the top down.   Kristi Stake, a professor at Louisiana Tech, said it best when I  asked her about him. She said that Dr. Guice never wanted the focus to  be on him. He always put the spotlight on the people around him,  especially the students. He accomplished a lot that people will  probably never know.   President Guice continuously put students' success as his top  priority as he created a thriving environment where students felt  welcome. He supported the development of strong academic programs, a  robust school culture, and a place where students could be successful.   We know that beside every strong man is often an equally strong  woman. Kathy Guice has served selflessly by his side as the first lady  of Louisiana Tech. They have opened their home to countless students,  faculty, and staff, helping to cultivate that warm family environment.                                time  1100    Also not lost on me are the sacrifices a person makes when they are  in public service, especially the toll it takes on your family life.  Nevertheless, Kathy was always up for the challenge, making everyone  feel welcome. She is the ultimate steel magnolia, and I thank her for  her service.   Today, I echo thousands of Louisianians in celebrating President  Guice's retirement from his influential career at Louisiana Tech  University and his extensive legacy that will continue to grow and  thrive because of programs, innovation, and partnerships that he helped  to form during his tenure. He will be fondly remembered by friends,  faculty, and students, and his work will continue to benefit the  community. He may be retiring, but we know he will always be there  cheering on the Bulldogs.   I thank Dr. Guice. He transformed an entire region, and for that we  will be forever grateful.                            ____________________
