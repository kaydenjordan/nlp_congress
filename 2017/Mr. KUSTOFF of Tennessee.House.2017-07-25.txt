 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.J. Res. 111, which uses the Congressional Review Act to disapprove  and nullify the rule issued by the CFPB on July 10, 2017.   Time and time again, we have seen the CFPB abuse their power and  authority to unilaterally issue rules without seeking any input from  Congress.   Since its establishment, the CFPB has displayed complete disregard  for due process, as it has issued enforcement actions against companies  that are unjustly accused of wrongdoing.   Frankly, the CFPB's recent antiarbitration rule is no different. This  rule would change the ability for consumers to resolve disputes with  financial services companies through arbitration, which has  consistently provided consumers with expedient, efficient, and less  costly resolutions.   In short, making consumers pay more for less is the exact opposite of  consumer protection, and is the reason we need to reject this harmful  rule.   I applaud the work of Chairman Hensarling and the other members of  this committee on this work to hold the CFPB accountable.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis), the ranking member of the  Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee.
