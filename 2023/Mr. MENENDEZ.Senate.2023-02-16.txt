 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

Policy Justification    The Netherlands--Ml42 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)         The Government of the Netherlands has requested to buy       twenty (20) M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System       (HIMARS) launchers; thirty-nine (39) M30A2 Guided Multiple       Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) Missile       Pods with Insensitive Munitions Propulsion System (IMPS);       thirty-eight (38) M31A2 GMLRS Unitary (GMLRS-U) High       Explosive (HE) Missile Pods with IMPS; eighty (80) M57 Army       Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Missile Pods; and seventeen       (17) M1152A1 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles       (HMMWVs). Also included are M28A2 Reduced Range Practice       Rocket (RRPR) pods; radios with similar ``SINCGARS''       capability, including vehicular dual long-range radio systems       w/GPS; single radio, long range vehicular system w/GPS; High       Frequency/VHF radios; M1084A2 cargo trucks, Family of Medium       Tactical Vehicles (FMTVs) Resupply Vehicles (RSVs); M1089A2       wrecker truck, FMTVs; M1095 5-ton trailer FMTVs; Simple Key       Loaders (SKLs), AN/PYQ-1O; Defense Advanced Global       Positioning System Receivers (DAGRs); machine gun mounts;       battle management systems, Vehicle Integration Kits,       ruggedized laptops, and training equipment publications for       HIMARS and munitions; camouflage screen and support systems;       support equipment; communications equipment; spare and repair       parts; test sets; training and training equipment;       publications; systems integration support; technical data;       Stockpile Reliability, Quality Assurance and Technical       Assistance teams; U.S. Government and contractor technical,       engineering, and logistics support services; and other       related elements of logistical and program support. The total       estimated cost is $670 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the security of a NATO ally that is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in       Europe.        The proposed sale will improve the Netherlands' military       goals of updating capability while further enhancing       interoperability with the United States and other allies. The       Netherlands intends to use these defense articles and       services to modernize its armed forces and expand its       capability to strengthen its homeland defense and deter       regional threats. The Netherlands will have no difficulty       absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin, Grand       Prairie, TX. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require U.S.       Government or contractor representatives to travel to the       Netherlands for program management reviews to support the       program. Travel is expected to occur approximately twice per       year as needed to support equipment fielding and training.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-08       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as           amended        (vii) Sensitivity of Technology        1. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)       is a C-130 transportable wheeled launcher mounted on a 5-ton       Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles truck chassis. HIMARS is       the modem Army-fielded version of the Multiple Launch Rocket       System (MLRS) M270 launcher and can fire all of the MLRS       Family of Munitions (FOM) including Guided Multiple Launch       Rocket System (GMLRS) variants and the Army Tactical Missile       System (ATACMS). Utilizing the MLRS FOM, the HIMARS can       engage targets between 15 and 300 kilometers with GPS-aided       precision accuracy.        2. The Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) M31A2       Unitary is the Army's primary munition for units fielding the       M142 HIMARS and M270A1 Multiple Launcher Rocket System (MLRS)       Launchers. The M31 Unitary is a solid propellant artillery       rocket that uses Global Positioning System/Precise       Positioning Service (GPS/PPS)-aided inertial guidance to       accurately and quickly deliver a single high-explosive blast       fragmentation warhead to targets at ranges from 15-70       kilometers. The rockets are fired from a launch pod container       that also serves as the storage and transportation container       for the rockets. Each rocket pod holds six (6) total rockets.        3. The M30A2 GMLRS Alternative Warhead shares a greater       than 90% commonality with the M31A1 Unitary. The primary       difference between the GMLRS-U and GMLRS-AW is the       replacement of the Unitary's high explosive warhead with a       200-pound fragmentation warhead of pre-formed tungsten       penetrators which is optimized for effectiveness against       large area and imprecisely located targets. The munitions       otherwise share a common motor, GPS/PPS-aided inertial       guidance and control system, fuzing mechanism, multi-option       height of burst capability, and effective range of 15-70km.        4. The M57 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS)--Unitary       is a conventional, semi-ballistic missile that utilizes a       500-pound high explosive warhead. It has an effective range       of between 70 and 300 kilometers and has increased lethality       and accuracy over previous versions of the ATACMS due to a       GPS/Precise Position System (PPS) aided navigation system.        5. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.  [[Page S455]]             6. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that the Netherlands can       provide substantially the same degree of protection for the       sensitive technology being released as the U.S. Government.       This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of the Netherlands.                            ____________________
