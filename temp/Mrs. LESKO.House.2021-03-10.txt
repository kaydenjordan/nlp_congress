 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Mr. Jordan, for  yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.   H.R. 8 is an assault on our Second Amendment right to keep and bear  arms. The bill turns law-abiding citizens into criminals by subjecting  them to criminal penalties for simply lending a friend or a neighbor a  gun on a temporary basis.   Additionally, the bill would inevitably lead to a national gun  registry because, without a registry, the government has no way to  implement this legislation. This bill is certainly a slippery slope.   Most alarmingly, this bill does nothing, absolutely nothing, to stop  criminals from obtaining firearms. According to the Department of  Justice, less than 1 percent of criminals in prison who possessed a  firearm during their offense obtained the firearm from a licensed  dealer, meaning criminals would still have access to firearms under  this law.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is just the first of many steps to take away  our Second Amendment rights. I urge my colleagues to vote against this  bill.
