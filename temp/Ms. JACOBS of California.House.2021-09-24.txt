 Mr. Speaker, the United States should not  provide support to foreign military units that repeatedly commit human  rights violations. That should be clear.   Yet, in Burkina Faso, Guinea, and the Democratic Republic of the  Congo, military units backed by the United States did just that;  terrorizing civilians in the name of security.   Backing these units is supposed to be against U.S. law, but for  decades there has been one big loophole, and it is called section 127E,  one specific DOD authority that authorizes support for these units  without any human rights vetting.   This loophole means that we have no assurances that our operatives  aren't working with partners who are in direct conflict with our  values. And if we are truly focused on countering violent extremism, we  have to acknowledge that abuses by security forces often propel victims  into violent extremist groups.   That is why I brought forward an amendment to the NDAA to close this  loophole, and I am proud to say it was adopted with bipartisan support.   My amendment ensures that we aren't contributing to the very same  problems we aim to solve, and it sends a clear message. When it comes  to human rights, there cannot be loopholes, exemptions, or exceptions.                            ____________________
