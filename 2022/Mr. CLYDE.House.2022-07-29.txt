 Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1808, which is just  the latest gun-grabbing bill Democrats are dangerously ramming through  in their unconstitutional crusade to disarm America.   The ink is barely dry on the anti-gun bill from last month, and here  they are pushing another anti-gun bill that proclaims to make us safer  but does the exact opposite. It puts citizens at greater risk by taking  away the rights of the law-abiding.   This legislation takes aim at our Constitution by banning what the  Democrats call assault weapons, which is a vague political term used as  a catchphrase to make the public think we are banning guns that assault  people. But the truth is that the bill would ban the most popular  semiautomatic rifle in America, the AR-15 and what the industry calls a  modern sporting rifle.   The Democrats have consistently called them weapons of war and are  trying to ban them from being purchased by law-abiding citizens.   But whom does this bill exempt?   The Federal Government. Federal Government agencies like the  Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education,  the Department of Labor, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, and down the line.   So if they are weapons of war, as the Democrats call them, what do  these departments need with weapons of war?   Is the Department of Education going to use them against the moms and  dads who protest against woke local school board policies?   Is the Department of Housing and Urban Development going to use them  against the occupants in their housing developments?   You cannot have it both ways. If it is a weapon of war, then ban  these Federal agencies, too.   The truth is they are simply semiautomatic rifles the Democrats want  to demonize so they can ban more guns and take more of our citizens'  unalienable constitutional rights away.   Democrat ignorance and malice do not justify banning nearly 25  million firearms that Americans, including myself, proudly own and  responsibly use.                                time  1645    Now I know the author of this legislation would prefer that I spare  him  [[Page H7520]]  both the prefatory clause and the supremacy clause of the Second  Amendment. But it is quite clear: ``A well regulated Militia, being  necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to  keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.''   Shall not be infringed, period, is the supremacy clause. And banning  an entire class of firearms, the most popular firearm in common use  today, is clearly infringement.   An armed America is a safe and free America. I urge all of my  colleagues to stand firm in the fight to protect and preserve the  Second Amendment by voting ``no'' on this unconstitutional and,  therefore, illegal piece of legislation.
