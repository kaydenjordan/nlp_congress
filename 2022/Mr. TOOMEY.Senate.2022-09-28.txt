 Mr. President, as a proud member of the American Sikh  Congressional Caucus, I would like to join my Sikh friends in  Pennsylvania's Sikh community and Sikhs around the world in recognizing  the 38th anniversary of the November 1984 anti-Sikh violence in India.   For those of you who are not familiar, Sikhism traces its nearly 600- year history to the Punjab region of India. With nearly 30 million  followers globally and 700,000 here in the U.S., Sikhism is one of the  world's major religions.   Historically, Sikhs have showcased a commitment to serving  individuals from all religious, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds-- demonstrating their generosity and deep sense of community. During the  COVID-19 pandemic, Sikh communities across Pennsylvania and the United  States came together to deliver groceries, masks, and other supplies to  tens of thousands of families in need no matter their race, gender,  religion, or creed. In my many years serving the Commonwealth, I have  personally witnessed the spirit of Sikhs and have come to better  understand the Sikh tradition that is founded on equality, respect, and  peace. It is clear that the presence and contributions of Sikh  communities have thoroughly enriched their neighborhoods across the  country.   1984 marks one of the darkest years in modern Indian history. The  world watched as several violent incidents broke out among ethnic  groups in India, with several notably targeting the Sikh community.  Today we are here to remember the tragedy that commenced on November 1,  1984, following decades of ethnic tension between Sikhs in the Punjab  province and the central Indian Government. As so often in such cases,  the official estimates likely do not tell the whole story, but it is  estimated that over 30,000 Sikh men, women, and children were  deliberately targeted, raped, slaughtered, and displaced by mobs across  India.   To prevent future human rights abuses, we must recognize their past  forms. We must remember the atrocities committed against Sikhs so that  those responsible may be held accountable and that this type of tragedy  is not repeated against the Sikh community or other communities across  the globe.                            ____________________
