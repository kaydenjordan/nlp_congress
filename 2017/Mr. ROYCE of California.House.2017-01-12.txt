 Mr. Chairman, this has been an issue in  Europe. It has been an issue in the United States. I would like to make  the point that, with respect to looking at economic analysis and making  certain that it is bipartisan, I think there is a way to make certain  it is objective.   As I look at the underlying text and then look at the amendment that  we are accepting, we should reflect on this. We are going to have the  SEC here look at both the protection of investors and the effects to  ensure competition and efficiency. So I would explain to the Members  that adding that into what I already thought was pretty exacting rules  here in terms of an objective analysis should really succeed in our  attempt here.   And what is the attempt in this Regulatory Accountability Act?   It is to make sure that the U.S. capital markets are unmatched in  terms of their size, their depth, their resiliency, and transparency.  And this Regulatory Accountability Act gives the Commission the  opportunity to ensure that its rules and regulations, past and present,  each of those are worth pursuing when measured against their economic  costs.   Growing access to capital, protecting investors, preserving the  world's strongest capital markets are not mutually exclusive objectives  here.    And here is what I would like to point out.  The European Union clearly recognizes this conundrum right now. They  are launching a call for evidence to investigate the unintended  consequences created by their regulatory framework because they are  searching for balance in this, too, to make sure that they have  retrospective examination.   It is prudent. Frankly, as the effectiveness of regulation is  measured by outcomes rather than volume in a situation like this, it  drives us toward efficiency in the market.
