 Madam Speaker, is she declaring a conflict of  interest on this legislation? Tongue-in-cheek. Excuse me.   We are all excited, awaiting the good news in terms of her family,  and I think it is appropriate that we have this legislation on the  floor today to help families all across the country.   The complexity that we found out in terms of the infant formula  supply leaves us all scratching our heads in terms of all these  elements.   I appreciate Congresswoman DelBene early zeroing in on this,  mobilizing support, helping refine legislation, and enabling us to act  very quickly.   This is an area that I hope that we will be able to have further  conversations because I think there are issues in terms of healthcare  supply chain and industrial policy.   It isn't, I think, quite so easy to snap our fingers and make sure  that we are protecting this because it is a complicated matter. I know  that at times, there are differences in terms of how much we should be  interfering with the private sector and what they do.   I think this might be an area that we can work together to figure out  ways that we can hit the appropriate balance, meet the need, not be too  intrusive, but make sure we are not behind the curve.   The administration and Congress has made significant progress in this  crisis, invoking the Defense Production Act, increasing the flexibility  of WIC as was referenced, easing restrictions on imports to supply  chain shortages, and enacting our Formula Act to temporarily suspend  tariffs on infant formula.   We are expanding that work today to include formula base powder  imports. Like finish formula, infant formula base powder imports face a  substantial tariff when imported at a time when families need all the  help they can get.   I don't want to take undue time, but I just want to commend our team  working together, sending the appropriate signal, and hope it provides  a foundation for other areas where we might be able to look for ways to  thread that needle to be able to have partnerships with the private  sector and with government to be able to make sure that we deal with  these fragile supply chains.   One of the things the pandemic has demonstrated is how fragile our  supply chains are. The notion, with so many industries dealing with  just in time, puts them in a situation where the supply chain is so  brittle that it produces results that horrify us all, like dumping milk  on the ground because we couldn't get it to producers.   So I hope it leads to a broader conversation about things we can do  to ease the pressures on supply chains and that this is an area where  we can continue to work together and make a difference.                                time  1345
