 Madam President, as ranking member of the Committee on  Environment and Public Works, I rise to oppose the nomination of Dr.  Chris Frey due to the consistent lack of responsiveness from the EPA on  our critical oversight matters.   The Republican leader, Senator McConnell, just talked about Dr.  Frey's research on gas grills and grilling out, but over the past 16  months, my objections are that the Biden EPA has repeatedly slow-walked  responses to reasonable oversight requests for Agency briefings and  documents related to implementation of policies with huge, huge  implications for our economy and our constituents' lives.   We cannot adequately oversee the Agency's programs--including  historic levels of drinking water infrastructure funding made possible  by the bipartisan IIJA--without this transparency. Until the EPA heeds  congressional oversight requests, I urge my colleagues to join me in  opposing Dr. Frey's nomination.
