 Mr. Speaker, I rise in staunch opposition to H.R. 6800,  the largest spending package ever considered and crafted without any  input from Republicans in Congress.   COVID-19 is impacting all Americans, and overcoming the crisis  requires input from all their representatives. However, the Speaker and  Democratic Party are clearly not focused on confronting the pandemic.  Instead, they are exploiting the crisis to accomplish political goals  rather than protect the American people.   In this bill, Democrats include nearly a trillion dollars to bail out  blue States and cities for years of irresponsible spending. It prevents  States from requiring voter ID's and requires same-day voter  registration. And nowhere in this 1,800-page bill do they find room for  basic pro-life protections included in appropriations bills since Roe  v. Wade. This is all on top of potentially freeing murderers and  rapists.   This bill steals money from the many to further the priorities of the  few and then seeks to change election laws so they can do it all over  again.   For these reasons, I vehemently oppose the bill.
