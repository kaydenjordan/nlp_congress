 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Kustoff  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, most of us run away from danger, but our law  enforcement, they run toward it.   Last Monday, Tennessee State Trooper Matthew Gatti was killed in the  line of duty responding to a car fire on I-40.   I had the privilege of knowing this young trooper. Our families were  dear friends.   This young man was just 24 years old, but he lived a life of  exemplary service to us all.   Matthew's father said that he died doing what he lived for: serving  God and serving others.   We honor those who pay the ultimate sacrifice for freedom. We honor  this young man for his commitment to our safety. We honor his family  for raising a young man who would serve us all in such a way.                            ____________________
