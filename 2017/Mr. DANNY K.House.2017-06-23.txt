 DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity  to commend the life and the legacy of an outstanding resident of my  community who served in World War II, which is a long time ago, but he  also became an outstanding citizen, steeped in the Lutheran church,  provided resources to the community where he lived and worked, so I  commend Mr. Luke Newman, and I just simply say that we have enjoyed  knowing him.                            ____________________     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I strongly support H.R. 2842, the Accelerating Individuals into the  Workforce Act, which is better known as TANF.   This important bill modernizes the TANF Contingency Fund to promote  effective job training programs, such as subsidized jobs, career  pathways, and apprenticeship programs. Research is clear. Subsidized  employment, career pathways, and apprenticeship programs successfully  engage people in employment, especially those who have been  unsuccessful in finding paid employment through their efforts.   Further research on past TANF subsidized employment programs document  that these initiatives increase employment and earnings both while  individuals worked in a subsidized job as well as after the program  ended. Also, studies show that States operated these programs that  provided tremendous benefit at very reasonable cost.   Many States used the TANF Emergency Funds to establish effective  subsidized employment programs. Using these TANF Emergency Funds in  Illinois, former Governor Pat Quinn implemented the very successful Put  Illinois to Work program that directly created over 26,000 jobs,  helping close to 5,000 employees in Illinois. Nationally, the TANF  Emergency Funds created 260,000 jobs.   Good subsidized employment programs have three characteristics that  make them an attractive part of TANF: they are able to increase  employment quickly; they help some of the individuals who face the  greatest challenges enter the workforce and stay there; and, when  funded on a large scale, they can help boost local economies. For these  reasons, Democrats have proposed subsidized employment within TANF for  years.   My friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Gwen Moore, initially  proposed allowing subsidized employment in TANF via her RISE Act many  years ago. I embraced her idea in my Responsible Fatherhood bill, and I  am pleased to join with Representative Curbelo on this effort.   If we are truly committed to helping families work their way out of  poverty, we will need to do much more to strengthen TANF. We will need  to ensure that States actually spend TANF money on TANF recipients. We  need to improve access to education and training, critical changes that  both Republican and Democratic witnesses have emphasized over and over  again. We need to improve childcare so parents can actually go to work.   This bill is a good bill. It makes a small, positive step forward on  our path to more comprehensive improvements to TANF. I strongly support  it.   I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), who has worked on these issues  for many, many terms and many years.    DAVIS of Illinois. I yield the gentleman an additional 2  minutes.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), a fierce advocate for low- income people.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   I want to, first of all, commend Mr. Curbelo for his leadership on  this issue, and I certainly agree with him that we have found enough  common ground to be here this morning with a bill that we can pass, but  I also agree with my friend from Texas (Mr. Doggett), that there are  many shortcomings to helping individuals actually realize the potential  that they have to move beyond poverty to sustainable employment so that  they can have a level of living and a level of expectation which gives  them the energy that they need to keep moving forward.   There are some improvements that we certainly need to make. We can  allow greater education and training. Every time witnesses come before  us, they always tell us that, no matter whether they are billed as  Republican or Democrat, or with no political stripe. We should improve  TANF for kinship caregivers. We should remove the lifetime ban on  felony drug convictions. Just imagine, that these individuals will  never ever have the opportunity to experience the benefits of this  program, or of this effort.   We should remove the 60-month time limit during recessions, and we  should remove the ban to assist unwed teen parents and other youth who  are displaced.   So clearly, we do have agreement this morning, and I am delighted to  be a part of it, but I certainly hope that my colleagues will look at  those unmet needs that the legislation does not cover.   I urge its support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would  further strengthen the protections against displacement of current  employees. I think it is a goal that we all share to make sure that  this bill expands employment, rather than just changing who is  employed.   I plan to support the gentlewoman's amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would  require States to collect and report information on whether  participants were receiving income-related assistance like health  insurance; child care assistance; school lunch; or the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits; rental subsidies; or  perhaps even the earned income tax credit.   The information the amendment requests is not relevant to what we are  trying to learn from these demonstration projects, which is whether  different approaches improve earnings and employment. Asking for it is  an invasion of the privacy of the individuals, with no research  benefit.   Collecting this information also seems burdensome for States, and  would likely require them to ask participating employers to ask their  employees inappropriate personal questions that they would not ask of  any other employee.   Most importantly, I am concerned that requiring States to collect  information on these important work supports would make some States  think that they are supposed to discourage participants from accessing  these supports.   Both research and common sense clearly tell us that access to  supports like child care assistance, healthcare, and wage supplements  that pay for transportation and other work expenses make it more likely  that individuals will succeed in work. We should do nothing that might  discourage States from providing these supports to help workers  succeed. We should do nothing that might cause individuals to not make  use of what is available to them.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
