 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, before we discuss the bill before us today, I want to  address the horrible school shooting in Florida yesterday.   We mourn the deaths of those shot and killed, and we support those  who were injured and the families of the victims. But we must also do  more to prevent future shootings in our schools and on our streets.   There have been 18 school shootings in this country so far this year,  and it is only February. According to a Washington Post analysis, over  the last 19 years, more than 150,000 students attending at least 170  primary and secondary schools have experienced a shooting on campus.  That does not include violence outside of the classroom.   We cannot allow this to continue. It is long past due for the House  to consider legislation on this floor to help prevent gun violence. Our  calls for hearings and for action on gun violence prevention  legislation have been met  [[Page H1184]]  with silence. Congress did nothing after Columbine 20 years ago, and  nothing after Sandy Hook 5 years ago. Inaction is unacceptable. Moments  of silence are completely inadequate. Our citizens demand that we act  without delay.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 620, the so-called ADA Education and Reform Act of  2017, would undermine the civil rights of Americans with disabilities  by significantly weakening the key enforcement tool of the ADA Act of  1990, which is the filing of private lawsuits by discrimination  victims.   Congress passed the ADA 28 years ago with the goals of fully  integrating persons with disabilities into the mainstream of American  life and counteracting discriminatory social attitudes toward the  disabled. By making it harder for persons facing such discrimination to  vindicate their rights in court, this bill ultimately undermines those  goals.   H.R. 620 would, among other things, institute a pre-suit notice and  cure regime under the title III of the ADA, which prohibits  discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations,  like hotels, restaurants, private schools, and healthcare providers.   Specifically, the bill would prohibit a disability discrimination  victim from filing a lawsuit to enforce his or her rights under title  III unless the victim first notifies a business of a title III  violation. The victim must then wait up to 180 days to allow the  business either to comply with the law or simply to make some undefined  level of substantial progress--whatever that means--toward complying  with the law.    No Federal civil rights statute imposes such onerous requirements on  discrimination victims before they can have the opportunity to enforce  their rights in court. Both individually and cumulatively, this bill's  notice and cure provisions will have the effect of inappropriately  shifting the burden of compliance with the Federal civil rights statute  from the alleged wrongdoer onto the discrimination victim and  perversely incentivizing businesses not to comply voluntarily with the  ADA.   Moreover, because H.R. 620 does not define the term ``substantial  progress,'' the bill leaves it entirely to a businessowner's discretion  as to whether he has made such progress.   At a minimum, this raises the prospect of expensive and protracted  litigation over the question of whether the business has made  sufficiently substantial progress should a lawsuit be filed. Such a  prospect, along with the need to wait 180 days before filing a lawsuit,  may be enough to deter discrimination victims with meritorious claims  from even sending a notice of violation, much less filing suit to  enforce their rights.   In addition, the bill's notice requirement is overly burdensome and  excessive. Rather than simply requiring an aggrieved person to notify a  business of the existence of an access barrier, H.R. 620 essentially  requires the person to plead a legal case in his or her initial notice.   For instance, a victim must cite the specific provision of the ADA  that has been violated, describe whether the victim made a request to  the business about removing an access barrier, and explain whether an  access barrier was temporary or permanent. Such specific information  may be very difficult or impossible for a discrimination victim to  provide at the notice stage, particularly without legal counsel.   Finally, H.R. 620 does not even address the purported problem  identified by his proponents who claim that a pre-suit notification is  needed to stop lawyers from filing numerous similar lawsuits alleging  both Federal ADA claims and State law claims against numerous  businesses in order to force quick settlements.   That is because many States allow for damages under their State  disability rights laws. But this ignores the fact that title III of the  Federal ADA only permits recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees and  costs, no recovery of money damages. In other words, it is State law,  not the Federal ADA, which provides the financial incentive for  pursuing numerous lawsuits.   Additionally, the filing of multiple suits alleging violations of the  ADA or State disability laws says nothing about the underlying merits  of those suits or the intent of the parties involved.   To the extent that lawyers actually engage in misconduct, courts  already have the tools to address such misconduct, including imposing  sanctions, refusing to award attorneys' fees, or dismissing cases that  have no legal or factual basis.   A pre-suit notification requirement, together with a lack of any  requirement to actually comply with the law, is a virtual get-out-of- jail-free card for every public accommodation in America.   H.R. 620 substantially diminishes the primary incentive for voluntary  compliance with title III, which is the credible risk of being sued and  having to pay reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.   H.R. 620's notice and cure requirements, by starkly diminishing the  risk of litigation, would send a clear and devastating message to every  public accommodation in America that there is no need to comply  voluntarily with the ADA. Instead, the bill tells businesses that they  should simply wait and see if they ever receive a notice of a violation  and to forget about the rights and needs of people with disabilities  until then.   As the former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge wrote recently in  The Hill in opposing H.R. 620: ``. . . it is unacceptable to roll back  the civil rights of people with disabilities. We should ensure access,  not progress. We should expect businesses to know and comply with their  obligations, not require our neighbors and colleagues with disabilities  to shoulder the burden of informing and educating businesses about  those obligations. We should not turn the business of everyday life  into a complex and legal ordeal for people with disabilities.''   For the foregoing reasons, I oppose H.R. 620 and I urge the House to  reject this deeply flawed bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).                                time  1000     Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the minority whip and one of the  original authors of the ADA in 1990.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, 28 years after the ADA's passage, too many businesses  remain inaccessible to persons with disabilities. The last thing  Congress should be doing is undermining the civil rights of a discrete  and insular minority group by making it virtually impossible to enforce  their rights in court.   That is why more than 230 disability rights groups, civil rights  groups, labor unions, and veterans organizations strongly oppose H.R.  620, including the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the  AARP, the NAACP, Human Rights Campaign, the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, the  Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the Paralyzed Veterans of  America, the United Spinal Association, the National Federation of the  Blind, and the National Disability Rights Network. I urge the House to  abide by these groups' concerns with H.R. 620 and reject this deeply  problematic legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the Langevin-Harper amendment. This  bipartisan amendment removes from the bill its onerous and unjustified  notice and cure provisions while leaving in place its potentially  helpful educational and mediation-related provisions.   As I discussed extensively during general debate, the notice and cure  provisions would have the effect of drastically weakening the ability  of discrimination victims enforcing their rights in court.   Any law, including the ADA, is only effective to the extent that it  is enforceable, and civil rights statutes, particularly, depend  primarily on private rights of action for their enforcement. By  weakening enforcement, H.R. 620's notice and cure provisions ultimately  undermine the ADA's goal of integrating people with disabilities into  the mainstream of American life.   For these reasons, I urge the House to adopt the Langevin-Harper  amendment which cures most of the problems with this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment does not appear to make any  substantive change to H.R. 620. Whether or not the amendment is  adopted, it still would be the case under the bill that a businessowner  who fails to make substantial progress in removing an access barrier  would be subject to a lawsuit.   The amendment, however, does not address the fundamental concerns  with H.R. 620's notice and cure provisions that I expressed in general  debate, including the fact that the bill does not require a business to  comply with the ADA, only to make ``substantial progress'' toward  compliance within the bill's 180-day cure period.   While the amendment does not make the bill worse, it also does not  make the bill better. Regrettably, therefore, I must oppose the  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the intent behind this amendment  to make the notice provision of H.R. 620 slightly less onerous, and I  acknowledge that it does so by eliminating the requirement that an  aggrieved person cite in his or her initial notice to a business the  specific ADA provision being violated.   The amendment, however, still leaves in place the basic problem with  the  [[Page H1198]]  bill, the basic problem with the notice and cure provision, and that is  the notice and cure provision. Therefore, it does not alleviate any of  the real concerns with the underlying bill.   Again, the basic notice and cure provisions of the bill turn on its  head the normal practice of any civil rights statute in which the  burden of compliance is on the actor, not on the victim. Here, we put  the burden of compliance on the victim.   The debate has been as if people have not had 28 years to come into  compliance, only to find out they are not in compliance when someone  complains about it, some victim is victimized. That is just wrong. This  goes in exactly the wrong direction.   Although this amendment would slightly alleviate the provision, it is  putting lipstick on a pig. For this reason and in deference to the  disability rights community, which opposes this amendment and the pre- suit notice and cure requirements, I must oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
