 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 450) to award posthumously the Congressional Gold Medal to  Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 450         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Emmett Till and Mamie Till-      Mobley Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The brutal lynching of Emmett Till and the subsequent       bravery and boldness of his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, became       a catalyst for the civil rights movement.        (2) On August 28, 1955, 14-year-old Emmett Till was       kidnapped, beaten, and shot in Money, Mississippi, where he       had traveled from Chicago to stay with his great uncle, Moses       Wright.        (3) The corpse of Emmett Till was discovered 3 days later       in the Tallahatchie River and his murderers were acquitted       despite Moses Wright providing an eyewitness testimony that       the men on trial kidnapped Emmett Till.        (4) Mamie Till-Mobley, the mother of Emmett Till,       demonstrated her love for her son and her courage and       strength in suffering in the days that followed as she       brought the body of Emmett Till back to Chicago for burial       and demanded an open casket funeral, which drew more than       50,000 attendees.        (5) Mamie Till-Mobley further allowed a photograph to be       taken of Emmett Till in his casket, which was shown       throughout the world.        (6) The original casket of Emmett Till stands on display at       the National Museum of African American History and Culture       as an enduring reminder of the racial violence that is a part       of the history of the United States that the people of the       United States must confront.        (7) The heroic actions of Mamie Till-Mobley in the midst of       evil, injustice, and grief became a catalyst for the civil       rights movement and continued in the years to come as she       worked for justice and honored the legacy of Emmett Till.        (8) Mamie Till-Mobley went on to create the Emmett Till       Players, which was a significant national cultural       contribution as teenagers traveled throughout the country       presenting Martin Luther King Jr. speeches in the name of       Emmett Till.        (9) Mamie Till-Mobley also served as chair and co-founder       of the Emmett Till Justice Campaign, which had the dual       mission of reopening the murder of Emmett Till for a       reinvestigation and a passage into law of Federal legislation       to ensure that other racially motivated murders during the       civil rights era were investigated and, when possible,       prosecuted.        (10) The efforts of the Emmett Till Justice Campaign led to       the successful joint investigation by the State of       Mississippi, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the       Department of Justice in 2004, the passage of the Emmett Till       Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-344;       122 Stat. 3934), signed into law by President George W. Bush,       and the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes       Reauthorization Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-325; 130 Stat.       1965), signed into law by President Barack Obama.        (11) The people of the United States honor the legacy of       Emmett Till and the incredible suffering and equally       incredible courage, resilience, and efforts of Mamie Till-      Mobley that led to the civil rights movement that began in       the 1950s.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the posthumous       presentation, on behalf of Congress, of a gold medal of       appropriate design in commemoration of Emmett Till and Mamie       Till-Mobley.        (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation       referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a       gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions,       to be determined by the Secretary. The design shall bear an       image of, and inscriptions of the name of, ``Emmett Till''       and ``Mamie Till-Mobley''.        (c) Award of Medal.--        (1) In general.--After the award of the gold medal referred       to in subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given to the       National Museum of African American History and Culture,       where it shall be displayed as appropriate.        (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the National Museum of African American History and Culture       should make the gold medal received under paragraph (1)       available for display elsewhere, particularly at other       locations and events associated with Emmett Till and Mamie       Till- Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of S. 450, the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley  Congressional Gold Medal Act, which is a companion to a House bill  sponsored by Representative Rush.   This bill will provide for a Congressional Gold Medal in  commemoration of two very important figures in our American history and  heroes of the civil rights movement, Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley.   It was not long ago that Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American  child from Chicago, visited his family in Money, Mississippi. Shortly  after his arrival, he was kidnapped, beaten, mutilated, and shot in the  head. His murderers then sunk his body in a river with a cotton gin fan  tied around his neck with barbed wire.   Mamie Till-Mobley, Emmett Till's mother, expressed both love and  heroism in the face of the unthinkable, ensuring that her son's body  was brought home to Chicago and insisting that his funeral be open  casket.   She ensured that Emmett was dressed in his Sunday best and that  nothing else about his body was touched, so that people could see the  violence that had been perpetrated upon him and bear witness to the  horrors of lynching.   Mamie issued an open invitation to her young son's funeral. 50,000  people heeded the call and were moved by the devastating effects that  racism, prejudice, and hate had on Emmett's body and very life.   She allowed Jet Magazine to photograph Emmett in his casket, ensuring  that all of America would have an image of her son to galvanize a  nation against the horrors of lynching and illuminate the need for the  civil rights of all.   Representative Rush was 8 years old when Till was lynched and  murdered; and he has said that one of the sharpest memories of his  childhood is the image of Mamie Till-Mobley looking at her son's body  in Jet Magazine.   Mamie Till-Mobley's bravery was a fomenting force for the civil  rights movement, paving the way for subsequent advocacy to increase  racial equality, including the Montgomery boycott. While we still have  a long way to go to ensure racial equity, we owe a great deal of  progress to the bravery and sacrifice of Mamie Till-Mobley and the way  that she honored her son's life.   Representative Rush represents Illinois' First District, where Emmett  Till and Mamie Till-Mobley resided. While Representative Rush has been  in office, their house has become a national landmark.   Representative Rush is also the sponsor of H.R. 55, the Emmett Till  Antilynching Act, which was signed into law earlier this year, and  makes lynching a Federal hate crime, punishable by up to 30 years in  prison. Due to the absence of this and other Federal and legal  protections, Emmett Till's murderers served no time in prison for their  crimes.   I am so appreciative of Representative Rush's dedication to Emmett  Till and Mamie Till-Mobley and his work to ensure that lynching is  recognized as a Federal crime, and that the Tills are honored for their  bravery and legacy.   I am pleased to be able to vote ``yes'' for this bill before  Representative Rush's retirement at the end of this term, and I  congratulate him on this accomplishment. I urge my colleagues to  support this very important Congressional Gold Medal bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   I appreciate Representative Rush's dedication to ensuring that Emmett  Till and Mamie Till-Mobley's legacy and bravery are remembered and  honored with this bill.   This Congressional Gold Medal bill will allow the American people to  pay tribute to these brave individuals who catalyzed the civil rights  movement and stood up against racial injustice in the face of immense  hardship and without whom we would not be where we are today as a  country that continues to work toward racial equality for all.   I thank Representative Rush for championing this important bill.   I would add that, yes, I remember when it took place. I was 16 years  old at the time. The parents and leaders of our community made sure  that all the children in our communities, in our schools, and in our  churches knew what had happened. They made sure that we understood what  was going on in this country at that time.   We are never to forget what happened to Emmett Till and what happened  to so many others when lynching was a way of life.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that Mr. Rush has championed this  important bill. I urge all of my colleagues to support it, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
