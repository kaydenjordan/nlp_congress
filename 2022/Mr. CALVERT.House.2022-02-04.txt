Tris rose to become president of Hunt-Wesson, Frozen and Refrigerated  Foods, and later president of Dalgety Limited's U.S. food division. In  1987, he retired as president and CEO of Tenneco West and, after  retiring, Tris earned a law degree in 1990 and was admitted to the  California bar.   Tris was an active member of his community. He was past board  president and CEO of the South Coast Medical Center in Laguna Beach and  was a director of many nonprofit organizations.
