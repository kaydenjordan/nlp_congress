 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 273, which  reaffirms the United States commitment to Taiwan and to the  implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act, or TRA.   As a longtime friend of the people of Taiwan, a founding co-chair of  the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, and a cosponsor of this resolution, I  want to thank Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul for their work  to support our critical bilateral relationship with Taiwan.                                time  1615    This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act,  which together with President Reagan's Six Assurances, serve as the  foundation for the relationship between our two countries, and I mean  countries.   Since the TRA was signed in 1979, Taiwan has become a vibrant,  consolidated democracy, one of our most important trading partners and  a model in so many areas for the rest of Asia and the whole world,  really.   Going forward, we must continue to implement the TRA and do better at  fully appreciating the policy commitments it contains. With that in  mind, I urge the President to immediately finalize an arms sales  package with Taiwan as well as begin negotiations for a free trade  agreement.   As China's influence grows, our commitment to Taiwan will be the  bellwether of our commitment to democracy in Asia. We do not owe China  a vote in how we treat Taiwan. If we are equivocal in our support for  Taiwan in the face of Chinese pressure, how can we credibly support  democracy and democratic values when they are threatened elsewhere?   I also want to voice my support for H.R. 2002, Ranking Member  McCaul's Taiwan Assurance Act. This legislation takes important steps  to advance our bilateral relationship, including support for arms sales  and for Taiwan's participation in international organizations. It would  also require a review of the State Department's, I believe,  unreasonable guidelines for Taiwan's diplomatic staff here in the U.S.   And I would be remiss if I didn't mention that I wish the legislation  did not refer to the misguided U.S. One-China policy, but I understand  that it was included as part of negotiations with the Senate.   Finally, the Taiwan Assurance Act requires a report on implementation  of the Taiwan Travel Act, legislation that I introduced last Congress  to increase high-level visits between U.S. and Taiwanese officials.  Since the bill became law a little over a year ago, we have seen not  enough action, and I believe that it is past time for full  implementation of this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, as we mark the TRA's 40th anniversary, H. Res. 273 and  H.R. 2002 are critical to strengthening our enduring relationship with  Taiwan as we look forward to the next 40 years, so I would urge my  colleagues to support both of them.
