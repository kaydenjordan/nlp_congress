 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5094, the Enhancing Suspicious  Activity Reporting Initiative Act.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5094 would require the Department of Homeland  Security to develop a strategy to improve the training, outreach, and  information it provides on Suspicious Activity Reporting to prevent  acts of terrorism.   Since the September 11 attacks, we have seen that sharing information  regarding suspicious activity can help local, State, and Federal law  enforcement connect the dots about threats in the communities that they  serve.   While it is important that ordinary citizens say something when they  see something that could be a threat to their community, we must  recognize that there have been instances where there have been abuses.  On occasion, we have seen allegations of suspicious activity made  against individuals solely based on biases regarding race, ethnicity,  or religion.   H.R. 5094 seeks to prevent such discriminatory reporting by directing  DHS to disseminate examples of reporting that meet the guidelines for  action. Further, it instructs DHS to outline the types of suspicious  activity reporting, including reporting based on race, religion, and  nationality, that is prohibited. More broadly, H.R. 5094 seeks to build  numerous safeguards for privacy, civil liberties, and civil rights into  the suspicious activity reporting regime.   It requires the establishment of an outside working group to provide  advice to the DHS Secretary on matters such as outreach, information  sharing, protecting personally identifiable information, protecting  privacy and civil rights, and training for emergency response providers  and the private sector.   Additionally, H.R. 5094 enhances congressional oversight of privacy,  civil rights, and civil liberties by requiring the department to  furnish Congress with copies of the materials it disseminates to  stakeholders.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this security measure.   Mr. Speaker, as the terrorist threats evolve, so too must our  counterterrorism efforts.  [[Page H5625]]    Since the September 11 attacks, we have seen that raising public  awareness about reporting suspicious activity can be effective at  detecting, deterring, and combating terrorism in the homeland.   I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 5094 to ensure that DHS  strategically engages stakeholders to improve suspicious activity  reporting.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5081, the Surface  Transportation Security and Technology Accountability Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, every day, millions of Americans engage with surface  transportation across various modes, including passenger and freight  trains, commuter rail, mass transit, and buses.   These systems, which so many of us rely on, are often viewed as soft  targets, so it is more important than ever that we intensify efforts to  secure these critical systems.    H.R. 5081 is a step in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleague from New York (Mr. Katko)  for his hard work and dedication in putting this bill together and  seeing that it gets to the floor this evening.   This bill authorizes the Transportation Security Administration to  form a Surface Transportation Security Advisory Committee to advise on  surface transportation security matters, including the development and  implementation of policies and security directives. This committee will  include stakeholders from each mode of surface transportation,  including pipelines, as well as representatives from labor  organizations, law enforcement, and the first responder community.   Importantly, H.R. 5081 requires TSA to consult with the advisory  committee in the development of its technology investment plan to  ensure that TSA develops new and effective security technologies for  surface transportation and that we are investing in the right  technology at the right time, at the right place.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan piece of  legislation. Again, I commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko)  for his hard work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to, again, also echo the words of my  colleague from New York in that there is great bipartisanship on the  Homeland Security Committee. I have often said that if there is one  place we are going to find bipartisanship, it is when it comes to  protecting the homeland, protecting our national security, and  certainly it has been evidenced by this particular bill and the several  bills that we will have before us this evening.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5081 will enhance the security of mass transit and  other critical surface transportation modes. This legislation is sorely  needed, and I thank the chairman of the Transportation and Protective  Security Subcommittee, Mr. Katko, for his efforts.   I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 5081, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5730, the Transportation  Security Technology Innovation Reform Act of 2018. H.R. 5730 authorizes  TSA's Transportation Security Administration Systems Integration  Facility, or TSIF.   Threats against the transportation system are constantly evolving.  They demand the TSA be proactive in developing new and innovative  technologies. By authorizing the TSIF, H.R. 5730 directs TSA to  evaluate, test, collaborate on and, ultimately, deliver advance  screening technologies.   H.R. 5730 also includes language to ensure that TSA has the necessary  staff and resources to develop the best  [[Page H5629]]  and most cutting-edge technology. Importantly, the bill includes  language authored by the Ranking Member, Mr. Thompson, to enhance the  level of support TSA provides to small businesses throughout TSA's  technology testing and procurement process.   Greater participation of small businesses, really, where innovation  happens, in the security marketplace, will not only help ensure that  promising technologies are pursued; it will also help TSA move away  from its reliance on a handful of large technology manufacturers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to support this  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   H.R. 5730 is focused on closing security capability gaps and  streamlining the technology acquisitions process at TSA.   When everything is said and done, TSA's ultimate mission is to ensure  the safety and security of the traveling public, and H.R. 5730 would do  just that.   I commend the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) for his work on  this legislation. I think it is going to make an appreciable difference  in keeping the traveling public safe.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5730, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 5766, the Securing Public Areas of  Transportation Facilities Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5766 was introduced to address the growing risk of  terrorist attacks in the public areas of transportation facilities.   In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation that public  areas of airports and transportation facilities, where crowds tend to  gather, have become soft targets for terrorists. We have seen that  internationally and domestically, as there have been violent incidents  in public airport areas in Brussels, Los Angeles, New Orleans and Fort  Lauderdale. Last year, there was an attempted attack on New York City's  transit system as well.   H.R. 5766 seeks to bolster protection for the public-facing sides of  transportation systems. It does so, in part, by authorizing a working  group to streamline communication and collaboration between the  Department of Homeland Security and key stakeholders. Additionally, it  directs DHS to disseminate technical assistance to operators such as  vulnerability assessment tools and cybersecurity guidelines.   Finally, H.R. 5766 requires TSA to review its regulations, policies,  and procedures regarding the transportation of firearms and ammunition  and submit a comprehensive report to Congress on its findings and any  planned modifications. The presence of firearms and ammunition in  public areas of transportation facilities is a timely concern.                                time  1945    In January 2017, an arriving airline passenger in Fort Lauderdale  retrieved a gun and ammunition from his checked bag and opened fire on  travelers in the baggage claim area, killing five people and injuring  six others.   In 2017 alone, TSA reported that its officers discovered 3,957  firearms at security checkpoints, 84 percent of which were loaded.   Mr. Speaker, given the prevalence and availability of guns in this  country, the very least we can do is evaluate TSA's policies for  transporting them and ensure that they are sensible and tailored to the  risk.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5766 is an important piece of legislation that has  strong support on both sides of the aisle. It is nice to see the  bipartisanship once again. It directs meaningful, sensible action to  help enhance the security of public-facing areas.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 5766, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5733, the DHS Industrial  Control Systems Capabilities Enhancement Act. H.R. 5733 would codify  the Department of Homeland Security's role in leading Federal efforts  to secure industrial control systems.   I want to commend the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon) for his  hard work on this legislation. I have enjoyed collaborating with him on  it, and I am grateful for his support and his support of the amendment  that I offered in committee to make the act, I think, even better.   Mr. Speaker, we depend on control systems to deliver basic  necessities like clean water, a steady energy supply, reliable  transportation systems, and medical care.   This is not a new role for DHS, which has been working on control  system security since 2004. However, enactment of H.R. 5733 will help  provide clarity to DHS and its Federal partners at a critical moment in  our Nation's history.   Cyber threats, Mr. Speaker, to critical infrastructure have never  been greater, yet leadership from the White House is dangerously  lacking. Over the past few months, we have seen top cyber officials at  the White House leave, resign, or, in the case of the Cybersecurity  Coordinator, have the position eliminated altogether.   What is more, the President appears to be making major foreign policy  decisions with little, if any, regard for cybersecurity. The President  ignored warnings from the intelligence community about Chinese telecom  company ZTE when, in May, he directed the Commerce Department, by  tweet, to save this habitual sanctions offender. The same month, the  news broke that the Chinese Government had hacked into the networks of  a U.S. Navy contractor and syphoned off sensitive military data.   This month, DHS officials reported that the North Korean Government  is ramping up its cyber intrusions on critical infrastructure in the  U.S. and around the world.   With respect to Russia, we know that the Kremlin has the capability  to turn off the lights with a cyber intrusion, as it has done in  Ukraine. We also know that Russia has been able to successfully  infiltrate the networks of a wide range of U.S. critical infrastructure  operators, including power plants.   DHS, through the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center, or the NCCIC, provides critical infrastructure  owners and operators with valuable cyber assistance and resources to  help secure their systems. The NCCIC, and specifically the Industrial  Control Systems Computer Emergency Response Team, or ICS-CERT, has  longstanding relationships with critical infrastructure stakeholders  and the expertise to help owners and operators harden their defenses.   Expertise in operational technology, or OT, cybersecurity is even  harder to come by than the more traditional information and  communications technology, or ICT, space, and all of my colleagues know  how much of a workforce challenge we are facing there.    Congress is wise to recognize the amazing resource we have in ICS- CERT by formally authorizing it with Mr. Bacon's bill. Security  solutions in the ICT space do not always map well onto operational  technology, and being conversant in the nuances is essential if we are  to protect the systems that we so heavily rely on.   During the committee consideration, I was also proud to offer an  amendment to codify ICS-CERT's coordinated vulnerability disclosure  program that ensures ICS vulnerabilities can be reported securely,  promptly, and responsibly. Through this program, manufacturers are  assured of a chance to patch  [[Page H5632]]  vulnerabilities before they are publicly announced, and security  researchers are assured that their voices will be heard.   ICS-CERT is to be commended for running a progressive program that  recognizes that most security researchers want to help make the  internet and the scary devices that connect to it a safer place. The  coordinated vulnerability program does just that by helping critical  infrastructure owners and operators who receive notices from ICS-CERT  about discovered vulnerabilities and effective patches before malicious  actors have a chance to exploit any flaws. Mr. Speaker, this bill would  empower ICS-CERT to carry out this mission fully and effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again commend the gentleman for his work on  this important piece of legislation. I urge my colleagues to support  the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, there is no question that industrial control systems are  a high-value target for our adversaries. Critical infrastructure owners  and operators use these systems to deliver the services that underpin  our day-to-day lives, and destruction to one of those systems could  have tremendous economic ramifications or could even be the difference  between life and death.   We know that our adversaries--most notably Russia, China, Iran, and  North Korea--have all targeted U.S. critical infrastructure and the  operational technology employed across these sectors. Mr. Speaker, it  is important that we solidify DHS' longstanding leadership role in  securing critical infrastructure, particularly with respect to  industrial control systems.   It has been a pleasure working with my colleague Mr. Bacon, the  gentleman from Nebraska, on this bill. I deeply appreciate both his  service to the country as well as his contributions both on the Armed  Services Committee and on the Homeland Security Committee. Likewise, it  has been a pleasure working with him over these years.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 5733, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5206, the OBIM Authorization  Act of 2018.   First, I want to begin by commending the gentlewoman from Arizona for  sponsoring this piece of legislation. It is very thoughtful and  certainly very timely.   Of course, I am not surprised that she would come up with such a  great idea, knowing that she originally hails from Rhode Island and  comes from great roots. So I am not surprised that she would come up  with a great idea like this.   Mr. Speaker, for the past decade, the Department of Homeland Security  has collected biometric data from foreign nationals and U.S. citizens  for a wide range of purposes, including counterterrorism, border  security, credentialing, national security, and public safety.   Over that time, the Office of Biometric Identity Management, or OBIM,  has become a repository for more than 240 million biometrics, such as  fingerprints and photographs collected by DHS. OBIM is charged with  analyzing biometric data, sending updates to critical terror watch  lists, and sharing information with trusted partners inside and outside  the Federal Government to support law enforcement, public safety,  national security, and homeland security.   Given the sensitivity of this type of biometric data and its  increasing integration into security programs, I am pleased that H.R.  5206 requires this office to comply with privacy policies and  procedures established by the DHS privacy officer.   This is a good bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5206 authorizes the department's existing Office of  Biometric Identity Management, which is charged with collecting and  using biometric data to enhance DHS's counterterrorism, border  security, and national security operations.   Increasingly, Federal agencies see the value of adopting biometrics  as an additional security measure. As more and more Federal programs  make use of such personal data, it is absolutely vital that privacy be  baked in from the start. Importantly, H.R. 5206 requires a privacy- forward approach to all that OBIM does.   For these reasons, I support this measure. This is a good, bipartisan  bill, and, again, I commend the gentlewoman from Rhode Island, who is  now from Arizona, for sponsoring this bill and getting it through  committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill as well, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5207, the Immigration Advisory  Program Authorization Act of 2018.   H.R. 5207 authorizes an important function within U.S. Customs and  Border Protection, the Immigration Advisory Program, or IAP. Under this  program, CBP deploys officers to overseas airports to advise law  enforcement partners about certain passengers before they board U.S.- bound flights. This important program seeks to essentially push out our  borders to prevent travelers who may pose a threat to the U.S. from  ever boarding an inbound flight.   Importantly, beyond simply authorizing the program, the bill requires  CBP to notify Congress whenever a new agreement is put in place with a  foreign partner. It also requires CBP to assess how the overseas  deployment of officers may affect officer coverage at U.S. ports of  entry.   While I certainly appreciate the sacrifice made by officers serving  abroad, I would note that this authorization is coming at a time when  CBP has acknowledged that it is currently 4,000 officers short of what  it needs to carry out current operations, both domestically and abroad.   Mr. Speaker, there is continued bipartisan support for CBP to push  out our borders to prevent individuals who pose a threat to the U.S.  from making their way here to our country. H.R. 5207 authorizes an  existing DHS program that has proven helpful to our foreign partners in  carrying out our shared interest of preventing terrorism, and it  reduces the burden of deporting individuals who would be denied entry  into the U.S. upon landing here.   Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentlewoman for sponsoring the bill. I  support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
