 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, maintaining and improving our ports, waterways, and  water infrastructure is critically important to the 14th District of  Texas, as well as to our great State and Nation. Our families, our  businesses, and the critical infrastructure along the upper Texas Gulf  Coast will benefit from WRDA 2022.   Of particular importance to Texas, and the Nation, quite frankly, is  a coastal spine. I have heard it several ways. It will mitigate the  impact of major hurricanes and other significant water events in and  around Galveston Bay, just south of the Houston Ship Channel, and all  the families and the vast petrochemical industry that surrounds it.   In September 2008, Texas 14 was slammed by Hurricane Ike along a  track similar to the deadly 1900 Storm of Galveston that cost 5,000 to  8,000 lives and billions of dollars in damage.  [[Page H5296]]    The damage from Ike, and the even more catastrophic Hurricane Harvey,  could have been reduced significantly by the proposed coastal barrier  that we call the Ike Dike. After years and years of pushing for this  vital barrier system, I am proud that it is included in WRDA 2022.   While this bill does not reflect all the priorities we might prefer,  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. I, too, add my  order of thanks to both sides. This has been a great task, a great  staff we have.
