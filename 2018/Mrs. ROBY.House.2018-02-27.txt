 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1865.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, today, this body will make tremendous progress towards  ending online sex exploitation. This is a big deal.   I am proud to stand here as an original cosponsor of the important  legislation we are considering today, H.R. 1865, the Allow States and  Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act.   I have been so pleased to work closely with my colleague,  Congresswoman Ann Wagner, on this issue, and I know that I am not the  only person here who greatly appreciates her leadership on this. It has  been sobering, to say the least, to hear some of the personal accounts  of sex trafficking victims, and several from my home State of Alabama.  [[Page H1291]]    It is our responsibility to provide justice for these victims and to  do everything we can to protect the most vulnerable members of our  society from trafficking. This is modern-day slavery.   As it stands now, the sad truth is that criminals can easily and  anonymously purchase women and children on the internet using various  websites.   Thanks to broad interpretation of existing law, specifically section  230 in America's courts, these websites are, essentially, immune from  State and local prosecutions. These websites make millions by enabling  sex trafficking while facing very little risk of being punished for  these crimes.   The bill we are considering today would change that by amending this  law to ensure that websites that unlawfully contribute to the  exploitation of sex trafficking victims are no longer immune to  punishment.   H.R. 1865 will finally hold bad actor websites accountable for these  unspeakable wrongdoings. The bill also provides increased criminal  liability and, thus, deters websites and individuals from selling human  beings online. Websites will no longer be able to turn a blind eye or  actively conceal this horrific practice without facing very real  consequences.   This legislation has been a work in progress for some time now, and I  am excited today to have the opportunity to cast my vote in favor of it  here today. I urge my colleagues to join me.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Poe).    Mr. Chair, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), my friend and colleague.   Mr. Chair, let me just say thank you to her for her tireless work on  this effort.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), our fearless leader, the chairman  of our conference.                                time  1445    Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding me time, for her tremendous leadership; the leadership of the  gentlewoman from Missouri; and so many more.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Allow States and Victims  to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017.   There is no question that human sex trafficking is one of the most  significant epidemics that we face today. It often takes place in our  own backyards, like in my district in eastern Washington. It targets  our children, families, friends, and neighbors.   Fortunately, there are so many organizations, and I am grateful for  those in eastern Washington who have stepped up--the Coalition to  Abolish Human Trafficking--working to stop these horrific and  heartbreaking crimes.   This bill will help fight online human trafficking through websites  like Backpage, that serve as an illicit forum for traffickers.   I also rise in support of the amendment by my friend Mimi Walters  from California, which I believe is crucial to the success of this  bill.   By strengthening section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, we  can restore victims' access to justice and hold accountable tech  companies and online websites that make human trafficking easier and  knowingly turn a blind eye.   We know these websites have the ability to sensor content, and we see  it in the political world every day. So why can't they work harder to  sensor and remove posts related to sex trafficking and enslavement of  other human beings?   This isn't hard. It is common sense to hold websites accountable for  the crimes committed on their sites.   We all must work together to put an end to human sex trafficking,  which is why I urge my colleagues to support the Walters amendment and  the underlying bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Crawford).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I again want to thank my colleague, Ann Wagner, for all  of her hard work on this very, very important piece of legislation.   It is our responsibility here in Congress to provide the strongest,  most effective tools possible to confront, punish, and, ultimately,  prevent the horrific nightmare that is human sex trafficking. For far  too long, we have seen a stark rise in the use of the internet to buy  and sell trafficking victims and minors for sex.   This sick industry has been allowed to prosper because, due to broad  interpretation of existing law, there have been no serious legal  consequences for websites that turn a profit by selling human beings.  Today it is incumbent upon us to stop this horrifying injustice by  passing H.R. 1865 to finally give prosecutors the tools they need to  crack down on sites that promote and participate in the human sex  trade.   Mr. Chairman, I call on all my colleagues to support this legislation  today and to send a clear message that we will no longer tolerate this  evil, atrocious behavior, and we will no longer be complicit in letting  these bad actors get away with these hateful crimes against humanity.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment,  [[Page H1305]]  although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I support Ms. Jackson Lee's amendment requiring  a GAO study. It is always helpful to require more information on the  efficiency of a new law. This study will provide useful information to  determine whether this legislation has proven to be the meaningful tool  that we anticipate it will be. I commend Ms. Jackson Lee for  introducing this amendment and for her commitment to combating sex  trafficking.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs.  Wagner).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no additional speakers.    Mr. Chair, I support Ms. Jackson Lee's amendment, and I  urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Donovan) having assumed the chair, Mr. Pittenger, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1865) to  amend the Communications Act of 1934 to clarify that section 230 of  such Act does not prohibit the enforcement against providers and users  of interactive computer services of Federal and State criminal and  civil law relating to sexual exploitation of children or sex  trafficking, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
