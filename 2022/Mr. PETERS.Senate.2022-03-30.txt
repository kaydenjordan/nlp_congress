Gilda has made an  immeasurable impact on the Detroit metropolitan area and the State of  Michigan over the past 30 years, and it is a privilege to recognize her  here today and celebrate her retirement.   Gilda began her career as an educator, graduating from the University  of Michigan in 1971 with a masters in behavioral science in education.  Following her graduation, Gilda began working as a special education  teacher in the Madison School District in Oakland County, MI. Gilda  taught one of the Detroit region's first classes for children with  emotional disabilities. It was her role as a leader in the rapidly  developing field of special education services that led her to begin  engaging in local activism, community organizations, and politics.   In 1978, she was asked to work first as the campaign manager and then  as a district office manager for newly-elected State Senator Doug Ross.  In helping Senator Ross launch his political career, Jacobs set in  motion the beginning of her own. In 1981, after a contentious election,  Gilda was elected to the Huntington Woods City Commission, the first  woman to do so. In 1994, she ran for and was elected to serve her  community as an Oakland County Commissioner. Four years after this, she  was elected to serve two terms in Michigan's House of Representatives.  At this time, I represented a portion of her district in the State  senate and had the pleasure of collaborating with her on many  initiatives on behalf of our constituents. I knew the senate district  was in capable hands when she succeeded me, winning the seat in 2002.  Her strong reputation as an effective leader in championing issues and  getting things done were immediately recognized by her colleagues who  elected her chair of the senate's Democratic caucus, making Gilda the  first woman to serve as floor leader in either chamber of Michigan's  Legislature.   As a State-elected official, Gilda was a tireless advocate for the  rights of women, children, and people with disabilities. In the State  legislature, she served as the vice chair of the economic development,  small business and regulatory reform committee, the families and human  services committee, and government operations and health policy  committees. Among her many successes were the establishment of a  bipartisan bicameral talent caucus to develop strategies to encourage  Michigan entrepreneurship and discourage college graduate flight.   In 2011, following the conclusion of her leadership and service in  the Michigan Senate, Gilda joined the Michigan League for Public Policy  as president and CEO. At the Michigan League for Public Policy, Gilda  focused on the promotion of racial equality, economic security, and the  overall health and well-being of Michiganders. During her  [[Page S1865]]  tenure she helped the organization move major policy victories,  including, among others, successfully defending the Michigan Earned  Income Tax Credit; raising the age at which Michigan's juveniles can be  tried as adults, and changing the asset test on food and cash  assistance in the State, allowing more residents to be eligible for  assistance. As a result of her leadership and tireless devotion, the  State of Michigan has seen progress in policy for Michigan's youth,  women, and families.   During a time of great personal loss, Gilda--and her late husband  John--worked on developing policy efforts to better ensure railroad  safety after their daughter, Rachel, was tragically killed in the  Philadelphia Amtrak crash of May 2015. Although confronted with  unimaginable grief, they felt it essential to address the issue head  on, advocating for enhanced safety measures so no other family would  experience what they did during that horrific time.   Gilda's contributions go well beyond her professional endeavors. In  addition to serving as a public representative and policy maker, she  has been a lifelong volunteer for numerous causes and organizations,  including the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, the United  Way for Southeastern Michigan and New Detroit, and the JARC--a  Michigan-based nonprofit dedicated to enriching the lives of those with  disabilities. She was further recognized as one of Crain's Detroit  Business 100 most influential women and awarded the Michigan Food Bank  Council Hunger-Free Award in 2015.   I cannot understate the impact that Gilda Jacobs has had on the  people of Michigan. She has spearheaded initiatives to eliminate hunger  and support Michigan's families, promoted positive changes in our  communities, and created a model for public service that is unmatched.  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing Gilda's many years  of work on behalf of others, and congratulating her on a well-earned  retirement from the Michigan League for Public Policy. Though her  leadership there will be sorely missed, her legacy will most certainly  endure.                            ____________________
