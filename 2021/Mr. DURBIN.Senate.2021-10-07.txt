 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to speak as if in morning business.    Madam President, today, the Senate Judiciary Committee  released a report after an investigation of the circumstances  surrounding Donald Trump's efforts to take over the Justice Department  during the closing days of the last calendar year and beginning of this  year.   Since January, the Committee has investigated reports that White  House officials, including the President himself, pressed the  Department of Justice to support President Trump's unsubstantiated bids  to overturn the 2020 election results, and that Acting Civil Division  Assistant AG Jeffrey Clark aided in that effort.   Today's interim staff report sheds new light on former President  Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Jeffrey Clark  became Donald Trump's Big Lie lawyer, pressuring his colleagues in the  Department of Justice to force an overturn of the 2020 election.   Let me put this in perspective. The election was in November. The  results were announced. Most of the world accepted it, but the former  President, Donald Trump, never did. He filed a succession of lawsuits  to prove that the election had been stolen. He failed in every effort  in court. That was stage one.   Having failed in court with some of the most outlandish theories  imaginable, but considered normal for the likes of Rudy Giuliani, they  went into the second phase. The second phase was to coerce the  Department of Justice and the Attorney General to intervene in the  election results and to reach out directly, as the President did  himself personally, to the election officials in States where he  thought he should have won but he didn't.   So all that effort was under way when William Barr, President Trump's  Attorney General at the time, issued a statement saying there was no  evidence of widespread fraud in the election. That was disappointing to  the President.   It occurred that in the middle of December of last year, William  Barr, the Attorney General, announced that he was going to resign as of  December 23. A man was chosen as the Acting Attorney General, Jeffrey  Rosen, and Richard Donoghue as Deputy Attorney General.   There was a full court press on at that time by President Trump and  his supporters to influence Jeffrey Rosen into intervening into this  election contest. When I say ``full court press,'' I am talking about  repeated telephone calls and meetings in the White House over a period  of 2 weeks.   This report, which we have brought to the attention of the public, as  well as members of the Committee, obviously, went into detail as to  what happened during that 2-week period of time. It was an incredible  moment, which most Americans didn't even know was going on. We were a  half step away from a full-blown constitutional crisis because what the  President was trying to do was to convince the Attorney General to  contact the leaders in the States where he thought--the President  thought he had won the election and to tell them to not certify the  results and to pick an alternative set of electors in some instances.   In each of these cases, the President was--President Trump--pushing a  theory on why he actually won. These theories went from crazy to silly,  to outlandish.   Let me give you one of them. It was called Italy-gate. I hope you  caught this one because, naturally, Rudy Giuliani was somehow involved  with this--some notion that Italian satellites were intercepting the  voting machines in America and changing the results against Donald  Trump. That is the nature of things.   In the State of Georgia, the President and his supporters were  arguing that they have videotapes proving that people brought in  suitcases full of ballots, and they showed these videotapes. The  election officials in Georgia--which, I might add, all Republican-- countered that by saying that those were actual containers of ballots  and that was the ordinary process; there was nothing sinister going on  there.   State after State, case after case, Trump was making the argument  that he was cheated out of the election--which, of course, was false,  but he still believes it to this day--and putting the pressure on  Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to be complicit in this plot. He  even asked him to consider filing a special case in the Supreme Court  across the street to stop the election results from being certified.   Our report shows that Jeffrey Rosen and his Deputy, Richard Donoghue,  resisted this from the start. Jeffrey Clark, another Assistant Attorney  General in the Civil Division who had nothing, literally, to do with  this matter on a legal basis, were in conflict from that point--Clark,  on the side of Trump, saying that the letters to the States should be  issued, and Rosen and Donoghue arguing that there was no basis in fact,  no proof of election fraud that could warrant that kind of  unprecedented action.   In the meantime, many other players, like Mark Meadows in the White  House, were also pressuring the Department of Justice. The net result  of it was a fateful day--I believe it was January 3 of this year--when  the President called Rosen, Donoghue, and Clark to the White House to  pursue his effort to replace Rosen with Clark, a more complicit person  in the process.   At that moment, two things happened that were significant. The White  House Counsel, Pat Cipollone, dissented from the President's position  and said it was a murder-suicide pact for him to engage in this.  Secondly, at that point, the eight leading officials in the Department  of Justice all said that they would resign en masse if there was a  replacement of the Acting Attorney General by Mr. Clark.   The President hesitated and decided at the very last minute not to  pursue that course, not to replace him. That was significant, I will  tell you, because had it happened otherwise, there would have been a  possibility that there would have been a contest on the election  results.   What did the President do next after deciding that? Well, just for  good measure, he ended up forcing the resignation of the U.S. attorney  in Georgia who refused to buy his outlandish claims. It was the  President's way of protesting that particular U.S. attorney's--Mr.  Cox--independence in the situation.   What followed? We know what followed. In a matter of 3 days, this  President, former President, desperate in his situation, having failed  in every court case, having failed to take over the Department of  Justice, decided to take his cause to the streets. We saw it in the  U.S. Capitol 3 days later on January 6. The President turned loose a  mob--a mob that was supposed to stop us from counting the electoral  votes and electoral ballots.   Most people say: Well, we heard most of this story before, so what is  the point of it? The point of it is that we were so close to a  constitutional crisis at that moment that it bears continued  investigation and disclosure so the  [[Page S6952]]  American people know that we should never be complacent when it comes  to our rights as citizens and to our responsibilities to our  Constitution.   This President, former President Donald Trump, would have shredded  the Constitution to keep his office in the Presidency. There is no  doubt in my mind.   To think that we reached that stage in history is certainly worth  reflection for a moment. What more should we do going forward to make  certain that we protect this democracy from the likes of Donald Trump  or any of his successors in interest? That, I think, is a major  responsibility that we face.   I hope this report from the Senate Judiciary Committee will reopen  the conversation. I hope as well that the select committee of the House  on the January 6 occurrence, the mob insurrection here at the Capitol-- we submitted this evidence to them. I hope it is a benefit to them as  they move forward.   I certainly hope that, on a bipartisan basis, we can decide that the  ordinary course of action with a valid, legal election deciding the  future of this country is always the best route in a democracy.                            ____________________     Madam President, there has been a controversy going on  the last several years which has really been to the detriment of many  good people.   In 2007, Congress made a promise to college students. Here is what we  said 14 years ago: If you will give us 10 years of life in public  service and you make your student loan payments during that 10-year  period of time, at the end of it, America will forgive the remainder of  your student debt.   We said that, and more than a million people took us up on the  promise. They passed up perhaps higher salaries in more lucrative  professions in order to serve the country. Then they discovered at the  end of the 10-year period that the loan forgiveness they were promised  wasn't coming. Nearly 99 percent of those who applied under the Public  Service Loan Forgiveness Program were denied relief, often for  superficial clerical errors, loan servicing mistakes, or other matters  beyond their control.   Well, good news: Those days of broken promises are over. Yesterday,  the Biden administration announced important changes to this program to  help hundreds of thousands of borrowers finally get the relief we  promised over 10 years ago. The Education Department estimates the  changes will immediately erase the debt of 22,000 borrowers, more than  the total number of loans that have been forgiven so far under the  program. All told, more than 550,000 borrowers could see a reduction in  the amount of additional time they make in payments.    Servicemembers whose loans were deferred while they were on Active  Duty will have those periods of duty applied towards payments, as they  should be. This is good news, and it is long overdue.   Many of my Democratic colleagues and I tried for 4 years during the  Trump administration to fix this program. They ignored us. So I want to  thank President Biden and Education Secretary Cardona for following  through on their commitment to fix this important program and recognize  the essential work of these public servants who sacrifice for this  country and for the people who live here and should receive what we  promised--helping hands on their student loans.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, today, President  Biden is traveling to Chicago. He arrives with a simple message:  Vaccines work.   In Illinois and across the country, vaccine mandates are saving lives  and allowing life to return closer to normal. Over the past month, our  State has experienced a nearly 40-percent decrease in new COVID cases.  We are seeing similar trends around the country.   In the months since the Biden administration announced its policy  requiring the majority of Americans to get vaccinated, the United  States has finally begun to turn the corner against the delta variant.  Over the past 2 weeks--2 weeks--our Nation has seen a roughly 25- percent decrease in new COVID infections. Hospitalizations have  decreased by 20 percent, and deaths are down as well.   In Illinois, we are proud to support the Biden vaccine policy. In  fact, some of the biggest employers in our State were ahead of the  curve. In early July, Loyola Medicine in Chicago was one of the first  health systems in America to implement the vaccine requirement. In  August, United Airlines, based in Chicago, announced it would require  its employees to get vaccinated.   At the time, skeptics questioned whether this would lead to mass  resignations or labor shortages. They predicted chaos. Well, much to  the dismay of the doomsayers, as of yesterday, more than 99 percent of  United Airlines' employees in America have rolled up their sleeves and  gotten vaccinated. Every major airline in the country has followed  United's lead and introduced a vaccine requirement. This means safer  skies for passengers and crew members. It is another big step back to  normal.   Unfortunately, not everyone is on board with this science-driven  approach. Earlier this week, one of my colleagues from Wisconsin took  the floor and made some unfortunate and irresponsible statements about  the safety of coronavirus vaccines. This false information,  unfortunately, may mislead some people. Senator Johnson decided to  bring an argument from a Facebook comment section to the floor of the  Senate.   So let me say this: More than 700,000 Americans have now died from  coronavirus. That is more than the number of Americans who have died in  every war since the Civil War combined.   We have the power to prevent more needless deaths from this disease  in the form of three remarkably safe and effective vaccines. Fully  vaccinated individuals are 10 times less likely to die from COVID, 10  times less likely to be hospitalized, and far less likely to spread the  virus.   The strong majority of Americans agree with President Biden's  actions. Importantly, the administration's vaccine mandate is saving  lives while also providing commonsense exceptions for those limited  numbers of people who have medical or religious reasons.   The fact is, the President's vaccine policy is constitutional,  evidence-based, and it is what America needs to once and for all put  this pandemic behind us.   Still, some of our colleagues continue to oppose it.   Yesterday, the senior Senator from Utah once again introduced  legislation that would do away with the President's vaccine policy. It  would also allow anyone to sue the government or their employers for  any perceived harm from vaccine requirements. What that harm might be  is unclear.   Can you imagine the chaos in our courtrooms if the Senator from Utah  has his way? Well, you don't have to imagine too hard because some  States have already shown us the deadly cost of taking a stand against  public health.   There are several States in our country that both threaten to sue the  Biden administration and enact the policies on their own to ban vaccine  and mask mandates. They include Texas, Florida, Utah, Arkansas, South  Carolina, and Georgia. The leaders in these States have gone to  extraordinary lengths to stymie public health efforts to save lives.   How has that worked out for these States? What has this dangerous,  deadly policy of opposing vaccines and masks meant in those States?   Take a look at the map here.   This was the deadly cost of resisting science and vaccines between  July 1 of this year and October 1. Of the 6 States--Texas, Florida,  Utah, Arizona, South Carolina, and Georgia--their infection rates per  100,000 people was 4,441 compared to the rest of the country at 2,548  per 100,000. The death rate, sadly, was 54 per 100,000 in these 6  States, 20 in the rest of the country.   I bring this chart to the floor to make it clear that taking a  political position is not about polling and deciding what sounds  popular to so many people. It is about the life-and-death reality we  face with this virus and this pandemic.   These leaders are arguing for a position against vaccines and against  masks, and look who is paying the price: the men and women who live in  [[Page S6953]]  their States, who are facing higher infection rates and, sadly,  dramatically higher death rates because of it. It is time for them to  accept the reality that vaccines are safe and effective and that they  work.   These States have reported almost twice as many coronavirus  infections as the rest of the country and, tragically, nearly three  times as many deaths. Lawmakers in these States have chosen a political  course rather than one that makes common sense or cares for the well- being of their people.   Our Nation's healthcare professionals are exhausted. You would be,  too, if you had to battle the virus every day for 18 months. Now they  are threatened with another deadly public health crisis: COVID  disinformation from politicians. Doctors and nurses and healthcare  workers are being threatened by the virus, and the patients, sadly, who  carry it or those who don't believe COVID even exists.   What makes this all the more troubling is that some of the biggest  peddlers of disinformation about vaccines have taken steps to protect  themselves from the coronavirus.   Allow me to give you exhibit A.   Nearly every night, Tucker Carlson appears on FOX News and  distributes bogus information to hundreds of thousands of households  across America. Tucker Carlson is the biggest anti-vax quack in  America.   But while Tucker is quick to question the science behind masks and  vaccines, what he won't tell you is that, every day, he has to comply  with a vaccine policy at FOX News. That is right. FOX News requires  every one of its employees to disclose their vaccination status.  According to ABC News, more than 90 percent of FOX Network's employees  have been vaccinated. The remaining 10 percent are required to get  tested every single day.   Sound familiar, the FOX policy? It is the same thing Joe Biden has  asked for nationwide that many Republicans come to the floor and scream  about every day and then turn on FOX News for their information.   So, while there is little ideological overlap between the heads of  FOX News and the officials in the Biden administration, they both  recognize one undeniable truth: Vaccine mandates are the key to ending  this pandemic.   I thank President Biden for showing the world that Chicago is leading  the way in putting the pandemic behind us. If we want to save lives,  jump-start the economy, get kids back in school, all I can say is three  words: Follow the science; stop villainizing public health officials;  and start encouraging every American to do their part in, finally,  ending this pandemic.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez), is necessarily absent.    Madam President, last night, a Federal judge in Texas did  what the U.S. Supreme Court should have done. He issued an injunction  blocking Texas' clearly unconstitutional bounty hunter abortion ban  from being enforced while challenges to the law make their way through  the courts. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman came in  response to a challenge of the Texas ban brought by the Federal  Department of Justice.   The Texas abortion law, known as S.B. 8, is the most restrictive  abortion law in the Nation and the most serious challenge to Roe v.  Wade in 50 years. It was deliberately crafted to outlaw most abortions  while allowing State lawmakers to evade judicial review. It deputizes  private citizens to enforce the ban by suing anyone who ``aids and  abets'' a woman seeking an abortion. And it offers rewards of $10,000  or more to plaintiffs who bring suits.   In his ruling, Judge Pitman wrote that Texas politicians had  ``contrived an unprecedented and transparent statutory scheme'' that  has ``unlawfully prevented [women in Texas] from exercising control  over their lives in ways that are protected by the Constitution.''   The Supreme Court order allowing the Texas law to take effect was a  product of the Court's ``shadow docket'' of cases that are decided  without full briefing or oral arguments--and without transparency or  accountability.   The 5-4 order, from the Court's conservative majority, was criticized  by some of the Court's own members, including Chief Justice John  Roberts, who warned that Texas lawmakers had created a ``model for  action,'' that other States could copy to undermine constitutionally  protected rights.   The Chief Justice was right. Since the Court's ruling on S.B. 8,  elected officials and political candidates in a number of States have  vowed to introduce similar abortion bans.   With Judge Pitman's wise ruling last night, that rush to use citizen  bounty hunters to avoid legal accountability while denying the  constitutional rights of women and perhaps others is on hold--at least  for now. But the threat to constitutional rights remains. Texas has  already filed a notice of appeal in the conservative Fifth Circuit.   Abortion providers remain at risk of facing bounty hunter lawsuits if  they perform abortions prohibited by the ban while the injunction is in  place. Anti-choice organizations have vowed to be ``vigilant'' in suing  individuals retroactively if the order is reversed.   I hope that justice--and the Constitution--will prevail in the coming  days as this litigation continues. The fundamental rights of millions  of Texans are at stake.                            ____________________
