 Mr. President, the Senate is considering an infrastructure  bill, and I am glad we are. For too long, Americans have been compelled  to send their tax dollars overseas to improve the infrastructure of  other countries. I have been fighting, for several years, to invest in  infrastructure here at home, which is why I find it frustrating that  the very people who celebrate this package today actually opposed my  efforts in the past.   We have a short memory here in the Senate. Only 2 years ago, I  offered my Penny Plan for Infrastructure for a vote. My plan would have  invested nearly $40 billion in infrastructure over those 2 years. In  those 2 years, nearly 20,000 miles of roads could have been resurfaced.  Instead, those investments weren't made and 2 additional years of wear  and tear passed by.   The parade of Senators coming to the floor and expounding upon the  urgency of this package is nothing less than shocking, particularly  when those same Members voted against 20,000 miles of resurfaced roads  only a short time ago.   The Penny Plan was not my only effort to invest in infrastructure.  Six years ago, I worked on a bipartisan package that would have made $  130 billion available for infrastructure. Had my plan been enacted into  law, Americans would now be driving on 130 thousand miles of new roads.   So, why for more than 5 years have my infrastructure proposals been  stifled? For only one reason: each of my proposals were paid for.   And if there is only one thing Congress always agrees on: never pay  for any new spending. Ever.   Proponents of this bill claim it is paid for. And by using budgetary  gimmicks, they hope they will erect enough smoke and mirrors to obscure  this bill's enormous price tag. But this $1.2 trillion bill is not paid  for. And, perhaps the most alarming part of the cost, is the authors of  this bill know it is not paid for. And we know that because they wrote  the bill so as to exempt it from rules that require the bill be paid  for.   You see, Congress passed a law back in 2010 mandating that new  spending has to be paid for. That law is called statutory pay-go, or  pay as you go. And if Congress can't help itself and refuses to offset  the cost of new spending, pay-go is enforced by an automatic cut to  spending elsewhere.   But Congress rarely adheres to its own rules. Instead, Congress  waived pay-go more than 60 times over the past decade and added over  $10 trillion to our debt.   This time is no different. This bill, which its proponents say is  paid for, also carries a provision that says pay-go won't apply to it.   The only way to ensure Congress adheres to pay-go is through a point  of order. If this bill is actually paid for, then you should have no  trouble supporting the point of order. But if you vote to waive the  point of order, if you vote to exempt Congress from its own rule  requiring that we be good stewards of taxpayer dollars, then stop  telling people something you know is not true. The truth is, this bill  is not paid for.   And every American should ask a simple question: Why won't Congress  obey its own rules?   This bill plus the next pork-laden bill will add trillions of dollars  of new debt. We are adding debt at an unprecedented pace. There will be  repercussions. A day of reckoning awaits.   But today there is a choice to make. A vote for the point of order is  a vote not to keep adding debt.   I urge my colleagues to vote with me to stop the bleeding, to stop  the red ink that threatens our country's future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an  outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Southcentral Veterinary Services, a family-owned small business in  Bowling Green, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 2011, Dr. Eddie Grimes and his wife, Nicole Grimes, founded  Southcentral Veterinary Services--SVS--in Bowling Green, KY. Growing up  in Warren County, Dr. Grimes and Nicole were childhood friends and both  attended Western Kentucky University--WKU--where Dr. Grimes majored in  animal science and Nicole studied finance. The couple, high school  sweethearts, married after graduating from WKU in 2000. Dr. Grimes went  on to earn his doctorate of veterinary medicine from Auburn University  and worked as a veterinarian for a few years before moving back to  Bowling Green. With Nicole, who had experience in the banking industry,  by his side, Dr. Grimes established Southcentral Veterinary Services.   Today, Southcentral Veterinary Services provides exceptional mixed  animal care in Warren County, KY. Initially, Dr. Grimes worked out of  his truck and provided ambulatory veterinary services; however, the  business grew quickly and expanded to a physical location that provides  grooming and boarding services, in addition to veterinary care. Being  very hands on with the daily operations at SVS, in addition to being  co-owners, Dr. Grimes is one of the veterinarians, and Nicole is the  human resource manager. Together, they lead a team of more than 10  employees, including a second veterinarian, to meet the animal needs of  the community. Since opening its doors, Southcentral Veterinary  Services has been recognized by local and industry publications for its  outstanding, high-quality veterinary care. Furthermore, for the last 3  years, Southcentral Veterinary Services was recognized as Bowling  Green's Best Veterinarian, and in 2020, SVS earned the title of Bowling  Green's Best Pet Groomer.   Outside of being business owners, Dr. Grimes and Nicole can be found  giving back to their community. Southcentral Veterinary Services has  sponsored local youth sports teams and regularly hires local high  school and college students, providing training and mentoring to  students interested in pursuing a career in veterinary medicine. One of  these students is the Grimes' son, Garrett, who works part-time as a  veterinary assistant and one day aspires to follow in his father's  footsteps becoming a veterinarian himself. Dr. Grimes and Nicole's  charitable acts don't stop at mentoring students. Notably, the Grimes  established 4AnnieGirl, an organization dedicated to raising awareness  of Spinal Muscular Atrophy--SMA--after their second child, Annie, who  was born with SMA, passed away from the terminal disease that causes  weakness and loss of voluntary muscles. After cherishing 9 precious  months with their baby girl, the Grimes sought to help other families  affected by this disease by promoting early testing, research, and  fundraising to combat SMA through 4AnnieGirl. By hosting speaking  engagements and fundraisers, 4AnnieGirl has raised over $30,000 for SMA  research and awareness. To honor Annie's memory, the Grimes family  remains committed to raising awareness for SMA and to advocating for  more research.   Southcentral Veterinary Services is a remarkable example of the  positive role that family-owned small businesses play in their  communities. Local veterinary practices, like Southcentral Veterinary  Services, form the heart of towns across Kentucky, regularly stepping  up to support their communities. Congratulations to Dr. Grimes, Nicole,  and the entire team at Southcentral Veterinary Services. I wish SVS the  best of luck, and I look forward to watching this small business'  continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
