 Madam President, today I would like to honor the  lives of Rob and Pam Stephens who were integral members of the Billings  community. Both Rob and Pam had a passion for sharing their love of  aviation with others. Tragically, on Sunday, September 26th, the  Stephens were involved in a fatal plane crash with their son Riley.  Riley was the only survivor.   With over 40 years of flying experience and more than 30 years as a  professional airline pilot, Rob loved sharing his knowledge and  expertise with others who aspired to become pilots themselves. In 2018,  Rob founded Mission Aviation flight school, located at Montana's Laurel  Municipal Airport, with the intentions of serving others in Yellowstone  County who also wanted to pursue careers in aviation.   Most notably, Rob shared his skills and passion for flying with his  two sons, Riley and Steele, both of whom have pursued their own careers  in aviation and take pride in teaching the next generation of  prospective pilots.   Rob and Pam will be dearly missed by their children Steele, Riley,  and Piper, their friends in the aviation community, and so many more in  the Billings area whose lives they touched. Piper recently served  Montana as an intern in my Washington, DC office. As Riley continues to  receive medical care, our prayers are with him and the entire Stephens  family during this very difficult time. May God continue to bless and  look over them.                            ____________________
