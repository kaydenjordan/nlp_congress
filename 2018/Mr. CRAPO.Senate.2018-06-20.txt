 Mr. President, in a few minutes we are going to vote on  the Crapo-Whitehouse amendment. I stand to support that amendment and  encourage my colleagues all to vote in favor of it.   I first want to thank my colleague Senator Whitehouse. He and I have  worked together on a number of issues, building bipartisan support to  advance our ability to utilize nuclear energy in the United States.   I also thank Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein for their work  to complete this Omnibus appropriations bill and to continue to push to  bring our appropriations process to regular order.   Our amendment focuses on the development of fuel sources for our  advanced nuclear reactors. The United States currently lacks both the  supply of high assay low-enriched uranium, called HALEU, and a process  to make HALEU for advanced reactor designs.  [[Page S4255]]    Advanced reactor startup cores require a high assay low-enriched  uranium containing less than 20 percent fissile content. At the end of  naval fuel's life, it contains highly enriched uranium with an average  enrichment of 80 percent. Current operating naval reactors have the  potential to create a total of 100,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel, and  the Department of Energy estimates disposal of this spent nuclear fuel  will cost about $100 billion.   However, advanced nuclear reactors have the potential to reuse this  spent nuclear fuel and to reduce the overall disposal cost. HEU  repurposing, from materials like spent naval fuel, can be done using  hybrid processes that use advanced dry head-end technologies followed  by material recovery, which creates the fuel for our new advanced  reactors. Repurposing this spent fuel has the potential of reducing  waste that would otherwise be disposed of at taxpayer expense, and  approximately 1 metric ton of HEU can create 4 useable tons for our new  reactors.   I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor Rocky Barker  for his extensive career as an Idaho journalist.   Rocky is retiring from the Idaho Statesman where he worked as an  environmental reporter-blogger-columnist for the past 22 years. Prior  to his position at the Statesman, Rocky was a columnist and  correspondent-at-large for the Post Register in Idaho Falls. He has  also written and contributed to numerous books, created an Idaho news  website, and received many awards and recognitions for his reporting.   Over his more than 30-year career, Rocky has reported comprehensively  [[Page S4278]]  on issues that matter deeply to Idaho. He has dug into pressing and  often controversial issues, including reporting on water, public lands,  fish and wildlife habitat, fires, and other related matters that no  doubt have required considerable resolve. Throughout, his devotion to  reporting and his deep respect for the importance of a free press to  our system of governance has remained unwavering.   Congratulations, Rocky, on your years of writing. ``Litera scripta  manet,'' meaning the written word endures, is among the inscriptions in  the Library of Congress. You can go onto the next chapter of your  career and life knowing that you have been an important part of taking  down that written word for our great State for decades. Thank you for  your devotion to and deep personal interest in chronicling issues that  matter greatly for Idahoans. I wish you and your wife, Tina, all the  best in your retirement and much happiness in the years ahead.                            ____________________
