 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the so-called budget before us ``squanders the  opportunity to start this new Congress working together to address the  concerns and priorities of the American people in a constructive and  bipartisan manner.''   Mr. Speaker, those are not my words. That is what was said at this  very same moment in 2017 by my colleague across the aisle who is now  chairman of this committee. You see, he found the very same process  they are starting today to be so objectionable, so one-sided, so  partisan, such an abuse of power, that he spoke in opposition for an  hour to the very same thing the House Democrats are doing now.   The truth is, I look forward to the time my colleague on the other  side and I can actually formalize our committee, welcome our members,  organize, and develop an oversight plan for the new administration, but  that has yet to happen.                                time  1315    But here we are on the floor with a bill already; a so-called budget  resolution; a resolution which, in reality, isn't any sort of budget.  It is simply a mechanism for the Democrat leaders to enact a radical  agenda rejected by Americans this fall. They know it. It was rejected  because their caucus is much smaller now today than it was before the  election.   So why are they doing this?   While five different COVID stimulus packages were negotiated and  ultimately signed into law on a bipartisan basis over the last year,  they apparently now need a more one-sided approach, one which is much  more partisan and bends the rules to radicalize this Congress and the  policies it produces. Quite the opposite of the speech we all heard  from out in front of this building 2 weeks ago today.   The power of our example, isn't that what we were told?   Well, what is the example here?   That the unification, the bipartisanship, and work-together attitude  that the President called for were just empty words for the House  majority. Though I suppose with this partisan process, our House  Democrat colleagues are, in a sense, following the example of President  Biden from his first days in office.   President Biden has spent his first few days signing one executive  order after another and pushing policies that will destroy American  jobs, make our country less secure, and raise the cost of living for  American families. I will just name a few:   Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline directly eliminates an estimated  11,000 jobs, including 8,000 union jobs.   Enacting a 60-day moratorium on new mining, oil and gas leasing, and  permitting on Federal lands will cause severe damage to America's  economy and energy independence, and will result in the loss of over  100,000 jobs.   Mr. Speaker, 100,000 Americans are fired by the stroke of a pen.   Returning the U.S. to the failed Paris Agreement of 2015 will reduce  U.S. competitiveness in manufacturing and next-generation technologies,  as industries move to China.   Terminating a national emergency declaration which immediately stops  all wall construction at the Southern border leaves American taxpayers  with an incomplete government project and the loss of thousands of  jobs.   Mr. Speaker, thousands of Americans are, once again, fired, again, by  the stroke of the President's pen. That is a powerful example by the  President of how to make life harder for the working class and to  weaken America.   Again, I come back to: Why is this happening today?   I think the American people deserve to know, and the answer is  simple: Democrats in Washington are setting up a partisan process to  have the Vice President cast the decisive vote in the Senate on an  array of radical policies.   At worst, their plans are to try and use this pandemic to seize more  government control of your life; to grow government power over your  healthcare choices; to place new rules, mandates, and regulations on  your small businesses; and to grant citizenship to millions here  illegally.   At best, their plan is to actually award hundreds of billions of  dollars to the very same State governments which are shutting down our  schools, telling restaurants they can't open, and keeping families  locked inside. They want to bail out their political allies who are  telling small businesses they can't open, who are blocking Americans  from going into their houses of worship, and who are ruining more  families by the day.   America is suffering right now, but they are suffering because of the  choices, the mandates, and the lockdowns being put in place by  government. We all know the quote from President Ronald Reagan: ``The  nine most terrifying words in the English language are: `I'm from the  government, and I'm here to help.' ''   Well, I think there are about 3,800 more families who have loved ones  in New York nursing homes, who would agree with that statement right  now.   Government harm has gone on long enough. It needs to stop, yet we are  setting up a process today to give hundreds of billions more to those  very same State governments. The numbers  [[Page H290]]  don't lie. Adding in the President's $2 trillion proposal from earlier  this month, we will have spent $6 trillion in less than 1 year in so- called COVID-19-related stimulus. That is larger than the GDP of every  country on Earth other than the U.S. and China. It is the equivalent of  $17,000 per every American and $70,000 per household.   Do families really feel like they have gotten $70,000 out of their  government in the last year?   No way.   What is worse is we have now crossed over. Government policies are  now making the crisis worse, resulting in millions of needless deaths.  Suicide rates among adults and children are way up. The U.S. National  Bureau of Economic Research, just this past month, said that, over the  next 15 years, more than 890,000 Americans could die as a direct result  of the unemployment caused by COVID-related lockdowns.   Here was the headline in The New York Times last week: ``Surge of  Student Suicides Pushes Las Vegas Schools to Reopen.''   Lockdowns, mandates, closures, virtual: It is unrealistic, not  sustainable, and not the way.   Under remote virtual learning, students are not getting the  instruction they need, especially those who may not have access to  reliable broadband. Not to mention the mental health and emotional  development needs that are not being met.   If we want to support families and communities, let's follow the  science and let's reopen our schools. Our country is about giving  Americans the power of information and letting them decide what is best  for their family and for their loved ones, not government telling them:  Stay indoors; don't see your family; and I am going to destroy your  job, small business, and everything you have spent your life building.    So here we are, setting new precedent under the Democrat-controlled  House. In more than 30 years, Congress has never voted on a House- originated budget that has not first gone through committee.   For what?   To bail out the very governments who are the ones costing families  everything right now.   Is this how the Democrats intend to govern: to put Government ahead  of the people?   I remind my friends that the power of the majority is a fleeting  thing, and the American people are watching.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Massachusetts. I will remind him that the government there in his State  has already received $7.5 billion in bailouts and, under this plan,  would receive an additional $7 billion. During the lockdown there in  his State, more than 2,500 small businesses have been closed and the  death rate has been more than the top five in the Nation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the great  State of Colorado (Mrs. Boebert), who understands what it is like to  run a small business and the burdens that government places on them.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline), who proudly represents their Sixth  District, a wonderful new addition to the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  New York. I will remind him that his State government has already  received $28.5 billion in bail-out money and, under this proposal,  would receive $20.5 billion under the plan; while that very same  government has enacted some of the strongest lockdown policies in the  Nation, resulting in the closure of more than 6,500 small businesses in  the State of New York, with an unemployment rate currently at 8.2  percent. And the State of New York also has the second highest COVID- related deaths per capita in the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Obernolte), an entrepreneur from California, a leader in his State  legislature on budgetary issues, and a new member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond to the gentleman from Oregon  saying that this is unprecedented. What is unprecedented is that this  is the first time that a budget resolution that originated in the House  bypassed the Budget Committee.   Reconciliation has been used numerous times, but this is the first  time in the history of this country that the Democrats bypassed the  Budget Committee in a budget resolution that originated in the House.  The people are watching, Mr. Speaker.   I also appreciate the gentleman from Oregon. I will remind him that  his State government has already received $4.5 billion in bailouts, and  they will receive another $4.5 billion in bailouts while their State  has locked down small businesses, costing more than 1,000 small  businesses to close their doors.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter), a true defender of commonsense, conservative values and a good  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from  Texas. I will remind her, as we debate how to improve the economy, the  administration's hostility to the energy industry, as demonstrated by  his executive orders, threatens at least 120,000 jobs in the State of  Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.  Feenstra). As a freshman, he has already shown leadership as a true  defender of conservative principles.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Pennsylvania. I will remind him that his State government has already  received $14 billion in bailouts. They will receive another $13.5 under  this plan while that very same State government has enacted lockdown  policies, causing the closure of more than 3,000 of their small  businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Donalds), a great addition to the Budget Committee and a true leader.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Virginia. I will remind him that his State government has already  received $6.5 billion in bailout money, and they will receive another  $9 billion under this plan while that very same government has enacted  lockdown policies directly leading to the closure of more than 2,000  small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the great  Commonwealth of Virginia (Mr. Good), who already is a leader in this  conference.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds  to the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  California. I will remind him that his State government, yes, indeed,  has already received $43 billion in taxpayer bailouts and will receive  another $42 billion in taxpayer bailouts if this bill passes.   But let's talk about California. This is the State that has some of  the most stringent lockdowns in the entire country. In fact, their  lockdowns are so significant that more than 16,500 small businesses  will never open their doors again. That is government that believes  that it is okay to deny you to go to your house of worship and to eat  out in an outdoor restaurant, but you can go to a strip club or get a  tattoo. That is California.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the great  State of Georgia (Mrs. Greene), a small businessowner who proudly  represents the people of the 14th Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey, and I wanted  to remind the Chamber that his State government has already received  $9.5 billion worth of taxpayer bailouts and under this proposal, would  receive an additional $9.5 billion under this plan, while that very  same government has enacted lockdown policies directly leading to the  closure of more than 3,000 small businesses.   And that State, very sadly, actually has the highest per capita death  rate of all States in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Arrington), who represents the 19th Congressional District and has been  an active participant in the budget process for as long as I have known  him, a true defender of fiscal responsibility.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight that just in the last couple  of days, the Congressional Budget Office released a report that, in  fact, the economy will strengthen, grow, and recover without any  additional stimulus dollars by the middle of 2021. You are looking at  in just 5 to 6 months, the Congressional Budget Office said that the  economy will recover without one single penny being spent of stimulus  money.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McClintock), a leader on the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's  comments, and the best way to help her constituents and to help those  small businesses in the State of New York is to stop the lockdowns.   Mr. Speaker, we have more than $1 trillion that is lingering out  there that has been appropriated to help these small businesses, to  help healthcare professionals, to help with vaccinations. They are  still hurting, but the money is still there.   Mr. Speaker, what is happening so bad in the State of New York is  that they are not using science. They are using arbitrary items that  have shut down more than 6,500 small businesses in the State of New  York. Open up the State of New York so small businesses can operate and  grow.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr.  Banks), a distinguished Navy veteran, our leader on the Republican  Study Committee, and a rising podcast star.    Mr. Speaker, the last 2 weeks, working-class  Americans have faced a great target on their backs from the new  President. By the stroke of a pen--47 different executive orders and  actions--he has fired hundreds of thousands of American workers.   Mr. Speaker, by the stroke of a pen, in the last 2 weeks, the sitting  President has fired hundreds of thousands of American workers who are  wondering where their next paycheck will come from, who are wondering  how they are going to pay their mortgage, who are wondering how they  are going to survive in South Dakota, North Dakota, Texas, Wyoming,  Colorado.   Just because this President was trying to unify his liberal base, he  fired hundreds of thousands of American workers. It is war on the  working class.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs.  Hinson), a distinguished journalist.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Michigan, and I will  remind him that his State government has already received $10 billion  in taxpayer bailouts and will receive another $10.5 under this plan.   However, if President Biden wouldn't have done 1 of his 47 executive  orders, his State would have received another $230 million. But the  President shortchanged the State of Michigan by $230 million because of  one of his 47 strokes of the pen in the last 2 weeks. So, I think the  gentleman would be a little upset with his President for that action.    Also, because of the lockdowns, the State of Michigan has lost more  than 3,500 small businesses. Such a shame.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Jacobs), a great addition to the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Nevada for his  comments and how we are eager to work in a bipartisan approach in this  package. That is why we are kind of frustrated, because our committee  has not even organized so that we could even have a discussion on a  bipartisan approach.   Instead, the majority's side decided to force through this  reconciliation without even going through the Budget Committee because  they have not even organized.   So, I would love to work with them, but you have already closed the  door. Hopefully, you will reopen it so we can discuss this, and I would  love to work with him.   Also, in my State, in my congressional district, we have operated  under what I believe are the best processes in fighting COVID, not  locking down and shutting the doors on your small businesses.   We have some of the lowest unemployment rates in the State of  Missouri, thanks to the leadership of Governor Parson. Also, we have  the lowest death rates of COVID in our State, thanks to the leadership  of Governor Mike Parson.   I wish the States of Nevada, California, and New York, and a lot of  other States, would open up and stop the lockdowns and follow the  science. Then, there wouldn't be bailout pieces of legislation to go to  the States that have made the wrong choices.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Spartz), a true patriot.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Texas, but I would like to remind this Chamber again that the  administration's hostility to the energy industry has demonstrated by  just the stroke of a pen his executive actions have threatened at least  120,000 jobs in the State of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the great State  of Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), who is a veteran of the Budget Committee,  whom I am glad to have back.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy), who is a true defender of conservative  principles.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, if this Chamber really cared about helping the working  class, we would first call on the schools to reopen immediately; end  the small business lockdowns so Americans can get back to work; and  stop the President's job-killing executive orders, which are firing  hundreds of thousands of Americans.   I stand ready, with my colleagues, on policies that will help support  the working class. I look for the opportunity that we actually come  into the Budget Committee, where we can work together and help the  working class.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
