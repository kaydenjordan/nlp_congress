 Mr. Speaker, our Nation's HIPAA patient  privacy laws should be improved to allow for compassionate  communication between doctors, primary caregivers, families, and  patients. Recently, the editorial board of the Observer-Reporter joined  the conversation in support, citing a specific instance in Greene  County, Pennsylvania. They wrote:         Christopher was arrested in early December and attacked       police officers at the scene. Witnessing his erratic       behavior, the officers decided to take him to a hospital for       a mental health evaluation.        Christopher was released from the hospital after there was       apparently no communication between the hospital's medical       staff and the arresting police officers.    Less than 4 weeks later, Christopher was shot to death by his  brother, Ryan, in what Ryan and others described as self-defense.   If only the doctors were allowed to share limited, critically  important information with the family, with law enforcement, and with  supportive community specialists, this tragedy could have been avoided.   The leading predictor of success in treatment for a person with  serious mental illness is family involvement. We must change Federal  regulations to help, not block, treatment. Until then, there will be  more sad stories like Christopher's every day.                            ____________________
