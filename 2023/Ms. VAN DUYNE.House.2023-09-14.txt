 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24  hometown hero, the Grapevine High School wrestling team.   This week, on the 22nd anniversary of the horrific September 11  terrorist attacks, Grapevine High School wrestling team paid their  respects by hosting a tribute climb.   On the steps of Mustang-Panther Stadium, participants climbed a  symbolic 110 flights in remembrance of this tragic day. Student  athletes, first responders, and members of the community all climbed  side by side to mourn those lost and remember the sacrifices our first  responders made for the American people.   I am so encouraged by the leadership displayed by the members of the  Grapevine High School wrestling team and their work to unite the  community in commemoration of the heroes of September 11. Their  patriotism and love for country is apparent.   I thank the Grapevine wrestling team for hosting this event and  representing north Texas so well.                            ____________________
