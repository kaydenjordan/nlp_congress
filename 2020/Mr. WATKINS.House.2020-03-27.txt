 Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the good people of  eastern Kansas.   The war analogy has been thrown around a lot these days. As a man who  has been to war and spent many years there, I can say that is not  altogether inaccurate.   In both cases, people are frightened. In both cases, people die. In  both cases, people discover what it is they are made of. And in war,  just like now, people need to come together.   This bill is an example of having done just that. It is not perfect,  but it is what we have got.   It has got my vote. I urge my colleagues to do the same.
