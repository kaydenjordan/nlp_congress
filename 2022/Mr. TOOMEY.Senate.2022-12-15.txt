 Madam President, I rise for the customary farewell  address.   I would like to begin by thanking our colleague and our leader, Mitch  McConnell, for his very, very kind words.   I appreciate that, Leader McConnell. I would also like to say that I  appreciate the confidence you have repeatedly placed in me. Your  recollections have brought back many memories.   One was the supercommittee. I served on the supercommittee, but what  most of you probably don't know is that Leader McConnell had great  reservations about putting me on the supercommittee. Oh, yes, he  grilled me for what seemed like hours over several occasions.   Here is why: He grilled me because he wanted an outcome. And his  concern was, will this firebrand from the Club for Growth be willing to  compromise, be willing to reach an agreement that couldn't possibly be  exactly what he wanted?    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S7222, December 15, 2022, in the first column, the  following appears: And his concern was, will this be firebrand  from the Club for Growth be willing to compromise,      The online Record has been corrected to read: And his concern  was, will this firebrand from the Club for Growth be willing to  compromise,    ========================= END NOTE =========================      What was most important--as I recall from our conversations--to  Leader McConnell was that the people on that supercommittee, at least  the ones that he could appoint, be interested in a successful outcome?   I would suggest that one of the things that is underappreciated about  Leader McConnell is how relentlessly focused he is on outcomes. It is  hard to know because he doesn't tell us that much about what he is  thinking, if you haven't noticed, but I am pretty sure that that is a  big driver.   So, Leader McConnell, I appreciate your leadership. I appreciate the  confidence you placed in me. I appreciate our friendship and terrific  working relationship.   For the many thanks that I have to give, I will start with my family.  Starting with my parents, they did a great job raising six kids, I will  tell you that much.   I have to really stress my gratitude for my wife Kris. Most of you  probably don't know, but Kris had a very successful and promising  career as a consultant, which she put aside so that I could pursue  mine. So, in many ways, I think she had a tougher job because she was  home raising three kids. And she has done a phenomenal job of that.   Last month, we celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary, and I think I  will spend the next 25 years letting her know how much I appreciate  her.   Our kids are here. Bridget is 22; Patrick is 21; and Duncan is 12\1/ 2\.   You know, growing up in a political family has its disadvantages. You  would be surprised to learn, but it seems like about every 6 years or  so people ran some really nasty ads about me on television. They did.  The kids see ads, obviously. Also, I missed more of their activities  than I would have liked to because I had to be here, but they were  always terrifically understanding about that. I am sure looking forward  to spending more time with each of them.   For those of us who serve on this body, we all know that staffs are  the unsung heroes of our successes. I have been luckier than anybody  deserves to be with the teams that I have had working for me over the  years--18 years in public office over a 24-year period; 6 in the House  and 12 in the Senate. I have just had wonderful, wonderful folks-- mostly younger people, as we know our staffs tend to be, but just  terrifically capable, hard-working, bright people.   My State staff, for instance--Leader McConnell was kind enough to  point out--the reputation that we had. I don't deserve the credit for  that. They are the ones who worked so hard on behalf of our  constituents.   From Philly to Erie and the other 65 counties and enumerable little  boroughs and townships, every day they approached constituent service  with enthusiasm and professionalism that was amazing. I mean, little  boroughs requesting Federal grants and businesses struggling with  Federal bureaucracies and regulations, veterans stymied by the VA or  the Social Security Administration--it didn't matter what it was, my  staff was on the ball getting the job done and doing it with a great  attitude.   My personal office here in DC, both when I was in the House and in  the Senate, also are just terrific, terrific people.   You know, I represent a very big State that is relatively close to DC  so we have a huge number of constituents who want to come down and make  their case, as they should. Most of those meetings end up getting taken  by our staff, as you know. They have just done such a great job.   Our leg and comms shops are always working so hard to get the policy  exactly right and get our message right; the administrative staff that  kept things running smoothly so I never had to worry about anything.   I have to say a special thanks to the Banking Committee staff. I have  been on the Banking Committee since I got here, but only the last 2  years have I been the ranking member on the committee. I honestly think  we accomplished about as much as you can when you are in the minority,  and so much of it is because it is a great team.    We focused on all the areas of jurisdiction of the committee:  financial services, monetary policy, housing, transit. We did a lot of  important work on the nominees to important regulatory posts. I think  we did a good job of providing the oversight of powerful regulators,  including encouraging them to stay in their lanes. I will always be  grateful to them.   By the way, many of them are still here, and they will be here to the  bitter end. We are still processing requests for the omni.   I have got to say a big thanks to the campaign teams that I have had  over the years. You know, my first House primary was a very improbable  success. I know most of you are thinking any election that I won was an  improbable success. I get that. But I can tell you for sure, it  wouldn't have happened without a terrifically talented and dedicated  campaign staff, some of whom became part of the official staff, others  have chosen to stay on the political side.   As for all of you guys, my colleagues, I have teamed up with every  Republican at some point over the years, and most of my Democratic  colleagues also at one time or another, and it has been a real honor  and it has been a privilege to work with each of you. You folks have  been terrific allies, even when it is on an item that is a rare item of  agreement.   Speaking of which, let me say a word about my colleague Bob Casey.  You know, I don't think you could ask for a more collegial, thoughtful  colleague than the fellow that shares the senatorial responsibilities  with me for Pennsylvania. The fact is, we canceled each other's vote  out almost every time--that is a true fact--but we have also worked  together when we could.  [[Page S7223]]    One of the areas where we had just tremendous success is filling  vacancies on the Federal bench in Pennsylvania.   In fact, Senator Casey, and according to the last count that I have,  you and I working together these last 12 years got 33 Federal judges  confirmed to the bench in Pennsylvania.   Now, that happens because we have great staff work happening; we have  volunteers who do a wonderful job of vetting candidates across our  Commonwealth; but it also happens because Bob and I wanted to get this  job done so that the people of Pennsylvania could have justice. And I  think that only two--only New York and California have had more judges  confirmed in this time.   So, Senator Casey, I appreciate the great working relationship we  have had.   As a general matter, as a body, I think we all understand we are not  that popular, but I don't think I have ever worked with a more  impressive group of individuals. So I appreciate having had that  chance.   I also have to thank the people of this great Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania that my family and I get to live in. Leader McConnell used  my line. It is true, and I say it all the time, and it will always be  true, representing Pennsylvania in the U.S. Senate for these 12 years  has been the greatest honor of my professional life. I will always be  enormously grateful to the wonderful people of this great State for  their entrusting me with this awesome responsibility.   I am also uniquely grateful to the people, the volunteers, who made  those campaigns successful.   When I think about my mission in the Senate, I think about two  complementary aspects of it.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S7223, December 15, 2022, in the first column, the  following appears: When I think about my mission in the Senate, I  think about two complimentary aspects of it      The online Record has been corrected to read: When I think about  my mission in the Senate, I think about two complementary aspects  of it    ========================= END NOTE =========================      First, it is to represent and defend the specific interests of  Pennsylvania, and I tried to do that to the best of my ability.   You know, I think sometimes we are such a big and diverse State that  what is good for Pennsylvania is usually good for America and vice  versa, but it has also been important to me to defend and advance the  cause of personal freedom. In the hierarchy of political values,  freedom is first for me.   I think the purpose, the real purpose of government is to secure the  blessings of liberty, and government too often is the source of  restrictions on our freedom instead.   But in this category of defending and advancing personal freedom, my  focus has tended to be the economic realm. Economic freedom is a  fundamental aspect of personal freedom, and there is a well-documented  high correlation between a society's economic freedom and the level of  prosperity and the standard of living of the people in that society.   So you probably won't be surprised to learn that I think my biggest  legislative accomplishment was that opportunity that I had to be a part  of a small group of Senators, Finance Committee members, who got a  chance to develop and help pass the 2017 tax reform. That group  included Senator Portman, Senator Scott, Senator Thune, and countless  hours that we spent in a conference room dealing with what was a very  complex product.   We took our draft, and we presented it to our colleagues, and over a  course of many weeks, we kind of iterated our way to what became the  most sweeping tax reform in at least 30 years. And we expanded economic  freedom with that product. Honestly, I have to tell you, I think the  results were even better than what we had hoped for.   By the time the tax reform had been fully implemented--I think  calendar year 2019--we had the strongest economy of my lifetime. We had  strong economic growth, a 50-year low unemployment, alltime record-low  unemployment for African Americans, alltime record-low unemployment for  Hispanic Americans and other ethnic minority groups. Wages were  growing, and they were growing faster than the rate of inflation, which  means that workers were able to see a rise in their standard of living.  And wages were growing fastest for the lowest income Americans so we  were also narrowing the income gap.   We ended corporate inversions. There hasn't been one since. Remember  how frequently they were occurring?   And with a lower corporate tax rate but also fewer deductions,  business boomed. The corporate tax rate was down to 21 percent. This  year, with a 21-percent top rate, we are exceeding the revenue  projections that were made prior to tax reform when the rate was 35  percent. This is not just about inflation. As a share of our economy,  total Federal tax revenue is at a multidecade high. So much for the  thought that we were going to increase the size of the deficit from the  tax reform.   Oh, and by the way, we also made the Tax Code even more progressive  than it was. That is right. Higher earners now pay a greater portion of  the total tax burden than they did before our tax reform.   I know my Democratic colleagues were skeptical about this, and I  understand. But I would like to suggest, the data is in, and it is  really good. There are important provisions that are scheduled to  expire, and I do hope that Congress and the administration can find a  bipartisan path to extending--or better still--making permanent these  otherwise expiring provisions.   I hope you will indulge me for just a few moments to make a couple of  other recommendations. I have got one for my Republican colleagues; I  have got one for my Democratic colleagues--mostly for my Democratic  colleagues--and two for this institution that we have had this  privilege to serve in.   For my Republican colleagues, let me just say, our party can't be  about or beholden to any one man. We are much bigger than that. Our  party is much bigger than that. We are the political representation of  this huge center-right coalition across America. On a good day, that is  more than half of Americans.   And I hope we resist the temptation to adopt the protectionist,  nativist, isolationist, redistributive policies that some are  suggesting we embrace. I think those are inconsistent with the core  values of a majority of the people in this coalition. More important, I  think those ideas lead to bad outcomes for our country.   For my Democratic colleagues, I have heard many of you passionately-- and I believe sincerely--declare your determination to defend our  democracy, but I would suggest we all remember that democracy requires  much more than the ease of voting in an election.   Elections are absolutely necessary, but they are an insufficient  condition for a truly democratic society.   Elections really are a means to an end; they are not the end  themselves. The end, or purpose, of elections is to provide the  mechanism of accountability of the government to the people whose  consent is our sole source of legitimacy.   When we hand over Congress's responsibilities to unelected and,  therefore, unaccountable parts of our government--be that the courts or  independent regulators or executive branch Agencies--we really  undermine our democracy, which, of course, is really our Republic,  because we weaken the accountability of our government.   Now, look, both sides have done this over time, but I would just hope  we could all agree that preserving more responsibility and, therefore,  accountability for the legislative branch of government is a good thing  for our Republic.   And then two suggestions for this amazing, historic institution. The  first one--and it is the most important one: Please keep the  filibuster. It is the only mechanism that forces bipartisan consensus.  It prevents governance from the extremes. By forcing bipartisanship, it  results in more durable legislation and so lessens the likelihood of  big swings in policies. It provides stability for our constituents. And  if you want to see more polarization, get rid of the filibuster and we  will have much more polarization.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S7223, December 15, 2022, in the third column, the  following appears: It prevents government governance from the  extremes.      The online Record has been corrected to read: It prevents  governance from the extremes.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The second thought I had that I wanted to share with you is, I think  we can all agree that the Senate has not been functioning as well as it  once did and as it really should. I don't think too many committees are  producing too much legislation the old-fashioned way. The old-fashioned  way was actually a pretty good vetting process for developing  legislative ideas. And when legislation does get to the floor,  typically, there are very few substantive amendments that are allowed  to be considered.   The result is, as a body, it is very difficult for us to discover  whether and  [[Page S7224]]  where there might be a consensus. I know there are a lot of reasons for  this, including political polarization, reasons why the Senate behaves  in a way that tends to block debate and voting.   But there might be some relatively modest tweaks in Senate rules that  might just facilitate restoring some of what used to be normal  functioning. I know a lot of you have done a lot of work in this and  that work is still underway. Let me suggest you consider one small  tweak, a small but important technical change to a rule, the rule which  enables the obstruction of the body.   I am not talking about the filibuster but, rather, the rule that  effectively requires unanimous consent, in most cases, to allow a vote  on an amendment, any amendment, even a germane amendment.   I can tell you, most Pennsylvanians are very surprised to learn that  in order for a Senator to get a vote on almost anything, he or she  needs the permission of every other Senator. I don't think this rule is  workable any longer, and it contributes to the dysfunction. So I have  just got a simple idea: Consider raising the threshold for blocking an  amendment to some number greater than one.   Now, I support the filibuster because I think it is reasonable for 41  Senators to be able to block legislation. It just doesn't seem  reasonable for one. So I don't know what the right number is, and I am  not religious about this. Maybe it is 10. Maybe it is 20. Maybe it is  50. But I would just suggest that this body consider somehow raising  the bar of preventing the Senate from functioning. There may be better  ways to do it, but that is one suggestion.   Let me conclude with this: You know, we have all inherited something  really, really, truly special. I know we all appreciate that, the fact  that we live in the greatest country in the history of humanity and  that we serve in this amazing legislative body.   I suspect we all get asked--I know I get asked from time to time-- some version of the question: How worried are you about our country's  future? And, often, there is some combination of national security,  political polarization, and the future of our economy that is the  primary concern of the people posing the question.   My short reply is usually: Look, we have gotten through much tougher  times.   But think about it. I think that is so true, and it is important to  remember. On national security, we have got real threats out there.  Russia is obviously led by a violent, dangerous bully. The Chinese  Communist Party is a rising and increasingly aggressive threat. But  nowhere do we face the imminent threats that we faced during World War  II and at several moments during the Cold War.   And we are polarized, and it is uncomfortable and it is problematic;  but, in 1968, we had political assassinations and cities were being  burned down. And this Chamber, this very Chamber we are in right now,  first opened its doors in 1859. Imagine living through the decade that  followed that.   As for the economy, look, there are always risks to any economy. Ours  is no exception. I think inflation is a significant problem. There is a  possibility we have a recession next year. We have huge and growing  national debt, and I think that is going to be a real challenge for us.   But I think it is worth remembering this: The vast majority of  Americans have a much higher standard of living today than our parents  did when they were our age. And a rising standard of living is, after  all, the purpose of economic growth.   So I always answer that question about America's future with the  truth, and that is that, despite our challenges, I am extremely bullish  on America. And I think my optimism is easily justified by our history.   America has always been able to survive and thrive, and America  remains the greatest nation in the history of the world. If we keep on  being Americans, we will remain the greatest nation on the planet.   Thank you, Madam President.   (Applause, Senators rising.)
