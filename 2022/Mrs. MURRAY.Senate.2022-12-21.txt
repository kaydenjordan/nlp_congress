 Mr. President, I have had the honor over the past       several years to lead the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions       Committee. It is a committee that I truly feel represents the heart and       soul of our country's values. As I prepare to hand over the gavel now       to my colleague Senator Sanders in the new Congress, I want to take a       moment to reflect on the incredible work we have done on our committee       and to recognize the many people who have made it all possible,       especially my colleagues on the committee over the last 8 years, who       worked time and time again across the aisle to solve tough problems       together, from healthcare to education, to supporting workers and       retirees, and working to ensure that everyone can live with dignity and       respect. The issues that we tackle are the issues families across our       country face in their everyday lives, and they are the issues I       constantly hear about when I am talking with people back home in       Washington State.        During my time as the top Democrat on this committee, spanning three       Presidential administrations, we have had so much to talk about. After       all, a lot can happen in 8 years, especially when you push, every day,       to work with your colleagues to make progress for our families.        We have made sweeping changes to help students and families, defended       and expanded healthcare coverage, and worked to bring down drug costs.       We have updated and expanded worker training. We have helped to       expedite and expand our national efforts to bring cutting-edge medicine       to millions. We have addressed the unfair practice of surprise medical       bills and more--all before we worked to face the COVID pandemic.        During our COVID response efforts, we were able to bring about the       largest Federal investment in childcare ever. We provided significant       resources to get all kids safely back in the classroom and address       students' academic and mental health needs, which the pandemic       worsened. We made historic investments to ensure seniors and people       with disabilities can get the care they need to live independently, and       we saved the pensions of over a half a million workers and retirees and       counting.              But if I had to pick one moment that set the tone for my time in       leading this committee, I would have to say it was right after the 2014       election, when I was preparing to take over as ranking member and       Senator Alexander was the incoming chair. As every colleague in this       Chamber knows, Senator Alexander was a true partner and was always       wanting to sit down and find solutions to problems. For 6 years, we       continued the longstanding HELP tradition of finding bipartisan       solutions to issues, large and small.        Early on, we sat down and found that we both were hearing from       schools and educators and parents who all agreed that the No Child Left       Behind law was not working. We had to do better. It was time to replace       the No Child Left Behind Act. Now, Senator Alexander, my partner across       the dais for 6 years, had said before that he had initially been       thinking of just moving forward on a partisan bill. Thank goodness that       did not happen. He chose to work with me. Together, we followed his old       80-20 rule of finding the 80 percent where we could agree and working       on that to help American families. Instead of staking out partisan       positions, we staked out common ground with a bipartisan draft bill,       which ultimately became the Every Student Succeeds Act.        That was one of the first of many bipartisan breakthroughs HELP has       made over the last 8 years. But in following that model, it was far       from the last. In fact, 1 year and 3 days after President Obama signed       ESSA into law, he was signing another massive bipartisan HELP bill--the       21st Century Cures Act--a package of policies focused on advancing       biomedical innovation for patients and families. Our bill also included       sweeping mental health reforms championed by Senators Murphy and       Cassidy. It focused on addressing the opioid crisis, and it created the       Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot. We built on that work even further with our       2017 FDA user fee package. Even now, Senator Burr and I are       strengthening that legacy in our end-of-the-year package.        Senator Alexander and I also worked with Senator Casey, Senator Enzi,       and others to strengthen our workforce with a bipartisan       reauthorization of the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act,       which invests in students and workers by giving them the education,       skills, and training they need so they can get better jobs and higher       wages, and it includes accountability measures to help improve programs       and ensure that people aren't falling through the cracks.        In working with Senator Hassan and Senator Cassidy, we passed the No       Surprises Act to finally end surprise medical bills and establish new       price transparency rules for hospitals. Our legislation has already       stopped millions of people from getting hit with exorbitant bills for       the care they thought was covered, including 2 million patients in       Washington State.        Senator Alexander and I also passed the SUPPORT for Patients and       Communities Act in order to fight the opioid crisis and help those on       the frontlines of that effort. It is painfully clear, in light of the       sharp rise in the youth mental health crisis and the deadly new threat       of fentanyl, that there is more to do here, which is why Senator Burr       and I have been working around the clock this year on the bipartisan       package of mental health and substance use disorder policies that are       now included in the omnibus.        Then, of course, there was COVID-19. On the HELP Committee, we worked       quickly to respond to the pandemic, in the spring of 2020, with       historic bipartisan relief bills and regular bipartisan briefings and       oversight hearings to press the administration about the issues with       our pandemic response. The            [[Page S9717]]            many packages we put together addressed so many facets of our       response--from getting shots into arms to getting kids safely back in       school for in-person learning, to getting our businesses open, and to       getting people back to their daily lives.        Senator Burr and I have continued to work to provide oversight of our       COVID response and to craft bipartisan legislation to make sure we       fully learn the lessons of this pandemic. That has been a life passion       for him. Even before the pandemic, Senator Burr was a leader on these       issues. As a hearing witness once put it, he is the ``papa of PAHPA,''       the bill which is the foundation of our public health and pandemic       preparedness system. I could not have asked for a better partner across       the aisle to work with me on strengthening that foundation these last 2       years.        I will miss Senator Burr and his passion and desire to get things       done. I join all of my colleagues in wishing him the best as he gets       some well-earned grandparent time and being jealous of how much fishing       he is going to be fitting in over the next few years.        Thanks to our joint focus, we were able to include most of our       bipartisan PREVENT Pandemics Act into this end-of-the-year omnibus,       along with an impressive suite of other bipartisan bills, like the FDA       package I alluded to earlier, which, among other steps, includes       policies to address the infant formula shortage, to reform accelerated       approvals, and to improve diversity in clinical trials. Our FDA package       includes a bipartisan cosmetics reform as well. This is something we       have been trying to get done since Senator Kennedy was chair of this       committee, and I am so glad we are finally getting it across the finish       line.        The omnibus also includes bipartisan deals we negotiated to bolster       families' financial security through greater access to retirement       plans, better information about fees and lump sum pension buyouts, and       new emergency savings accounts, and to respond to our Nation's mental       health and substance use disorder crisis, which the rise of fentanyl       has made so much worse.        Mr. President, this is so important. I have heard from so many       heartbroken parents who have lost a child to suicide or to drug use,       too many first responders who are feeling overwhelmed by the sharp rise       in overdoses, too many kids who are struggling with depression and       stress and anxiety. Getting them help has been a priority for me all       year.        The package that Senator Burr and I negotiated includes valuable       steps to strengthen the new 9-8-8 suicide hotline, makes it easier for       people to get substance use disorder treatment, helps tackle the opioid       crisis head-on, has critical support for mental health care for our       kids, and more.        Amid all this work on the HELP Committee, I have also been fortunate       to have Senator Blunt as my partner on the LHHS Appropriations       Subcommittee. We worked on a parallel track, in a bipartisan way, to       provide historic support for biomedical research, more than triple the       size of our childcare programs, fund new CDC programs to look at issues       like maternal mortality and gun violence, make progress toward my goal       of doubling Pell grants, and more.        I am honored to have played a part in so much progress over the past       few years. Of course, I could not have done it without willing partners       down the dais and across the aisle. I didn't always agree with Senator       Alexander or Senator Burr or Senator Blunt, but I have always trusted       them to hear me out, to understand that families sent us here to fight       problems, not fight each other, and to make a sincere effort to find       common ground.        Speaking of common ground, Senator Burr has several lessons that he       actually shared in his farewell speech last week, and I want to take a       moment to heed one of those lessons now.                   Thank your staff. They are actually the reason you are            here. It isn't you.              I couldn't agree more. We couldn't hold a single hearing or confirm a       single nominee or pass a single bill without them. Simply put, we       couldn't do our jobs without the many staff members who are so       dedicated to doing theirs.        So I want to thank the nonpartisan committee staff--led by the chief       clerk, Chung Shek--who have supported both sides over the past 8 years,       helped us put together so many hearings, and allowed us to make       unprecedented adaptations during the COVID pandemic.        I want to thank the staffs of Senators Alexander and Burr for their       cooperation and collegiality--in particular, David Cleary, and Lindsey       Seidman.        Most of all, I want to thank the many, many members of my team, past       and present, who have done so much. There are way too many to name. I       am just going to name a few. I will submit the full list for the       record. Nick Bath, health policy director for all 8 years; Kara       Marchione, my education policy director; Amanda Perez, my labor policy       director; Kendra Isaacson, my pensions lead; Amanda Lowe, my disability       lead; Carly Rush, my oversight lead and general counsel; Anali Alegria,       my HELP communications director; and so many others, current and past--      I want to thank them all. They have been precious to me, and I       appreciate their friendship, their hard work, and all they do to help       the American people. Of course, I want to thank our ``fearless       leaders''--my staff director, Evan Schatz, and deputy staff director       John Ryder, who have done a fantastic job steering my team over the       past 8 years.        Thank you all. I am so grateful for all that you have done for me and       for what you have done for all the American people. It is clear that       you understand we aren't just writing words on a page; we are writing       policies that shape the lives of families across our country and the       future of our Nation. That means so much to me because I know what it       is like to be one of those families who are hanging by a thread. I know       just how personal the HELP Committee's work can be, what it is like to       try and get by on a tight budget.        You see, my dad got sick with multiple sclerosis when I was young,       and that meant he couldn't work. Thank goodness the VA helped cover his       medical bills. So with my dad sick, my mother had to work while raising       seven kids. To make ends meet, she was able to take advantage of a       Federal work program so she could get a decent job as a bookkeeper. And       my brothers and sisters and I were all able to afford college thanks to       Federal grants and student loans. So I am here because our government       had our back.        I also remember in the days before Roe a friend who was not able to       safely get an abortion, and ultimately she lost her ability to have       kids because politicians put their ideology ahead of her health.        As a mom in tennis shoes, I got into politics to advocate for a       preschool program that my kids were in that the State was threatening       to cut.        So this work of the HELP Committee is deeply personal to me. As a       former preschool teacher, as a mother, and as a grandmother, it has       meant so much to me to have this opportunity to lead us forward on so       many issues that motivated me to get involved in politics in the first       place.        Now I look forward to continuing that work in the new Congress, both       as a member of the HELP Committee under Chair Sanders and Ranking       Member Cassidy and as the chair of the Appropriations Committee,       working alongside my friend Senator Collins.        I plan to tackle that new role with the same approach that has proven       so effective over the past 8 years leading the HELP Committee because       there is still much work to be done to ensure that healthcare is truly       a right, not a privilege; that every kid can get a high-quality public       education; that every parent can get childcare; that every worker has a       living wage and a safe workplace and paid leave and a secure future;       and that every woman can get abortion care and make their own       healthcare decisions; and to tackle the harsh realities of unequal or       downright unfair systems that have held too many families back.        Our Nation is facing so many crises at this moment--the childcare       crisis, the mental health and substance use disorder crisis, the       economic challenge of recovering from this pandemic, global challenges       like supporting our allies and standing up for democracy--and we are       not going to solve them by fighting each other. Our best bet for       meaningful progress next Congress is to work together and to listen to       each other.        So I am going to continue listening to the people of Washington       State,            [[Page S9718]]            bringing their voices and their concerns here to Washington, DC, and       urging my colleagues to work with me to focus on making their lives a       little easier.        I am going to continue coming to work every day, asking, how do we       help the people we all represent? How do we solve problems for       everyone? And who is willing to work with me?        I yield the floor.                                      ____________________                Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I share my       colleague's determination to address the opioid crisis. In fact, I       worked in a bipartisan way with Senator Burr to ensure that this end-      of-the-year spending bill includes serious steps to help our       communities. We worked year-round on bipartisan policies to support       States as they tackle fentanyl and the worsening opioid crisis, to help       people get treatment for substance use disorders, and a lot more.        So I sincerely hope the Senator from Tennessee will join us in voting       to get this across the finish line. This is really important to help       folks on the front line of this fight. And, of course, we have more       work to do here, and I will keep pushing with everything I have got to       help fight the opioid crisis. But as I have reminded my colleague       before, title 42 is a public health tool, and how it is used should be       guided by public health experts looking at data and looking at science,       not politicians looking to score political points.        Drug trafficking is a serious problem and one we have law enforcement       agencies who are responsible for. We should leave that work to them and       support their efforts, and we can do that by passing the omnibus bill,       which increases their funding.        So while I welcome the opportunity to work with my Republican       colleagues on this serious issue, bipartisan solutions are needed to       address drug trafficking--we need to build on the strong steps we are       taking in the omnibus to fight fentanyl. So at this time, I object.         Mr. President, I am here today to urge all my colleagues       to let us make life just a little bit easier for working moms by       passing this bipartisan PUMP Act.        This is really straightforward. When new moms return to work, they       should have the time and space they need to pump and breastfeed their       baby. It is not new. It is not controversial. It is actually       commonsense and basic human decency.        Right now there is this loophole that leaves nearly 9 million working       moms who are not covered by Federal protections. Nine million working       moms do not have the simple right to a reasonable break time and a       private place to pump when they are breastfeeding.        That is plain wrong. Right now, we have a chance to change that.       Right now, we can pass the PUMP Act. We can help close this loophole to       make sure moms are covered so they can keep their jobs and keep       breastfeeding their babies. It should not be controversial.        This is a bipartisan bill, and I am really thankful for my       colleagues, Senators Merkley and Murkowski, for their relentless work       on this. They have worked nonstop to get this done. And we have, by the       way, made great progress. The bill passed the House in a bipartisan       vote with huge margins. The vote was 276 to 149. And it passed in our       HELP Committee by voice vote. So let's get it to the President's desk.        It is so simple: Moms deserve to be able to return to work and still       breastfeed. They deserve a reasonable break and a private space to       pump, and they actually are watching us right now to see if we can       deliver on this really straightforward bill. So I urge my colleagues,       don't stand in the way. Stand with moms. Let us pass this bill.         Madam President, I ask that the following names be       placed in the Record in recognition of the outstanding service of my       staff on the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions over       the past 8 years. I thank them all for their service.
