 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and neighbor across the  Sabine River for having this special order honoring Representative  Young.   We are here to honor the dean of our House, Congressman Don Young.  For nearly half a century, Don devoted his life to serving the people  of Alaska and our Nation, starting his long career in Congress just 4  years after we landed an astronaut on the surface of the moon. A  staggering thought.   ``North to the Future'' is the motto of our 49th State. It is meant  to represent Alaska as the land of promise. Throughout 10 different  administrations, multiple wars and conflicts, national tragedies, the  invention of the worldwide web, September the 11th, and much more, Don  never stopped trying to spread the motto of his home State to the rest  of our Nation because he saw America as a land of promise.   He understood the need to learn from our successes and our failures,  adapt and push forward boldly, and bold he was. I will miss his fiery  personality, his fearlessness, and his unique ability to get bills  expedited if he concluded that they were taking too long.   I share Don's fierce love for Alaska and the great outdoors, and I  routinely visited his great State to hunt and fish over many years. If  you have seen Alaska's breathtaking terrain and wildlife, you will  never wonder why Don adored that State so much. He stood by his  State through the thick and the thin.    It was an honor to walk with him in these sacred Halls, to serve  alongside of him in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, to  hear the wisdom that he gleaned throughout his many years in Congress,  and to call him my friend.   God threw away the mold after he created Don Young. History will  remember him fondly, as it very well should. Anne and his children are  in my prayers.
