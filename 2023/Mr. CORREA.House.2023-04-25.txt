 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the life of a very  good friend, a dedicated father, a great neighbor, George Fenton.   He was born on Valentine's Day in 1935 and devoted his entire life to  serving his country and his community. After graduating from high  school in Detroit, Michigan, George joined the U.S. Marine Corps.  Decades after his service in the Marine Corps, he often talked and  relayed stories about his time at boot camp in Parris Island and Camp  Lejeune, and he called it his hot weather training at Twentynine Palms.   Later, George moved his entire family to Garden Grove. He worked for  the  [[Page H1935]]  city of Orange before joining the Orange County Sheriff's Department in  1971. That is where he met his wife, Lynn, at the courthouse on the job  in 1989. They were married in Santa Ana in 1991, and recently they  celebrated 31 years of marriage.   After George retired from the Orange County Sheriff's Department in  1993, he spent the next 15 years working at Disneyland as a cast member  and ticket taker.   George, you will be missed. Thank you for your time and service.                            ____________________
