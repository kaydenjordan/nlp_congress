 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2704, the Improving VA  Accountability to Prevent Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Act of  2021.   It is a terrible reality that, according to a recent study, roughly  26 percent of female employees and 14 percent of male employees at VA  have reported experiencing sexual harassment over a 2-year period.   Sadly, an even higher percentage of employees reported some type of  discrimination, such as reprisal or racial discrimination.   Though these problems are large, I applaud the work of the VA Office  of Resolution Management, Diversity and Inclusion and what they do.  They are taking these issues on headfirst, but there is still a long  way to go.   That is why I am proud to support H.R. 2704, which would eliminate  the potential conflict of interest in VA's chain of command; require  stricter reporting of allegations of sexual harassment and  discrimination; and require VA to finalize and deploy the Harassment  Prevention Program, along with increasing training and reviews.   I am grateful to Chairman Chris Pappas and Congresswoman Ashley  Hinson for introducing this bill and leading it. The bill has my full  support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa  (Mrs. Hinson), the cosponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill.   With that, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2788, the VA Equal  Employment Opportunity Counselor Modernization Act.   Current law prohibits VA from having more than 40 full-time EEO  counselors. With a workforce of around 400,000, that is only one  counselor for every 10,000 employees.   This arbitrary cap has hamstrung VA, and we have heard from the  Department and stakeholders that the lack of counselors prevents VA  from addressing complaints quickly. H.R. 2788 would remove this cap and  finally allow VA to rightsize its need for EEO counselors.   I thank Congressman Conor Lamb and Ranking Member Tracey Mann for  introducing and leading this commonsense legislation. I am pleased to  support it this afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2911, the VA  Transparency & Trust Act of 2021.   In the American Rescue Plan, the VA requested and received $17.1  billion in emergency funding. I demanded justification from the VA to  support that funding, and very little came. I asked why the VA needed  additional money since roughly $10 billion in CARES Act funding was  still available, and no one answered.   Ranking Member Tracey Mann offered an amendment to oversee the use of  those funds during the committee's markup of the American Rescue Plan.  It was voted down on party lines.   What I feared at that time I can now confirm. The American Rescue  Plan has essentially become a blank check for the VA to the tune of  $17.1 billion.   H.R. 2911 would establish strict oversight and reporting requirements  over all remaining COVID supplemental funds. It would also require the  VA inspector general to conduct regular audits of these funds.   Lastly, it would require the GAO to conduct a complete review after  all funds have been spent.   I believe these requirements are appropriate given that we are  talking about tens of billions in taxpayer dollars. We should all  expect full transparency on the use of these funds.   I thank Chairman Pappas and Ranking Member Mann for joining me in  introducing this bill. I encourage all my colleagues to support this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 240, the Homeless Veterans  with Children Reintegration Act.   This legislation would direct the Secretary of Labor to prioritize  homeless veterans with dependents when administering homeless  reintegration programs.   The Department of Housing and Urban Development recently released  2020's Point-in-Time count for homeless veterans. This count showed  that on a single night in 2020, there were 37,252 veterans living on  the street. This is a slight increase of 0.4 percent from 2019.   With COVID-19 impacting the economy and increasing unemployment, we  must do everything we can to help our homeless veterans find work.   By passing this bill to prioritize job training for homeless veterans  with dependents, we are ensuring this vulnerable population is at the  front of the line for help.   I thank Congresswoman Brownley for her hard work on drafting this  bill, and I am proud to support it today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 711, as amended, the West Los  Angeles VA Campus Improvement Act.   In 2016, Congress gave the West Los Angeles VA campus the authority  to carry out leases with third parties. These leases have the potential  to create revenue for the VA. However, the funds generated by these  leases could only be used for renovation and maintenance. This bill  would change that.  [[Page H2366]]    It would require that any land use revenues received by the VA from a  third party be credited to the medical facility's account. The funding  in these accounts would be used to meet existing needs and new services  for homeless veterans.   Revenues would now be available for the medical center to provide  emergency shelter and supportive housing services for homeless or at- risk veterans and their families. These funds would be available  without fiscal year limitations and further appropriations.   It makes sense that the medical center receives these funds and can  use them to improve its campus and help homeless veterans.   I thank Congresswoman Brownley for her amendment at the markup which  eliminated the mandatory score for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 711, as amended. I thank  the gentleman and his staff for the hard work they have done on this  bill to get it right. I appreciate it very much.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2167, as amended, the GI Bill  National Emergency Extended Deadlines--or NEED--Act.   This bill would extend time limitations for the use of entitlement  for VA education programs due to an emergency. I am supportive of the  underlying bill. I also thank Chairman Takano, Congresswoman Sherrill,  for including several Republican provisions in this legislation.   This bill includes the text of two of Congressman Moore's bill, H.R.  2420, the Overseeing the GI Bill Act of 2021; and H.R. 2457, the  Colonel John McHugh Tuition Fairness for Survivors Act.   H.R. 2420 would require VA to submit regular reports to Congress on  the progress of the Digital GI Bill program. This is a system that the  VA is purchasing to overhaul the antiquated system that processes GI  bill claims. The failed implementation of the Forever GI Bill in 2018  led to thousands of veterans waiting weeks for their claims to be  processed. This provision would provide the needed oversight to ensure  that these mistakes are not repeated.   H.R. 2457 would require institutions of higher learning to provide an  in-State tuition to participants in the Survivors' and Dependents'  Education Assistance Program. This would bring the benefits in line  with other GI Bill programs that require that veterans be provided in- State tuition.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Moore for his hard work on both of  these bills. H.R. 2167, as amended, also includes texts from  Congresswoman Mace's bill, H.R. 2327. Congresswoman Mace's provisions  would ensure that benefits through the Dependents' Education Assistance  GI Bill program will never expire for eligible students. This would  bring this program in line with the way the post-9/11 GI bill benefits  work for most other veterans. I commend Congresswoman Mace for her hard  work on this bill to expand benefits to dependents and survivors.   Finally, this bill also includes the text of Congressman Cawthorn's  bill, H.R. 2391, the Veterans Fellowship Act. This bill would direct  the Department of Labor to carry out a pilot program to help veterans  find meaningful employment through short-term fellowships. The DOL  would provide a stipend for the veterans to participate in the pilot  program.   Madam Speaker, I thank all of these Members for their hard work  drafting these important pieces of legislation. I am pleased to support  the bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Moore).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).  [[Page H2369]]         Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2878, as amended, the  Native VetSuccess at Tribal Colleges and Universities Pilot Program  Act.   This bill would direct the VA to carry out pilot programs on at least  two Tribal colleges or university campuses.   During the pilot, a VetSuccess counselor would be assigned to these  campuses to help eligible veterans navigate VA programs and benefits.   I support the underlying bill. I am also pleased that the bill, as  amended, included many Republican provisions.  [[Page H2371]]    This bill includes the revised text of Congresswoman Miller-Meeks'  bill, H.R. 2335, the VET TEC Enhancement Act of 2021. Her bill would  increase funding for the popular VET TEC pilot program to ensure that  funding does not run out before the end of the fiscal year. The bill  also provides additional funding for those programs in fiscal year 2022  and 2023.   Madam Speaker, I am glad we authorized additional funds for this  important program that is putting veterans back to work with a 70  percent placement rate. I think we would be hard-pressed to find  another program with such a high rate of success.   This bill also includes the text of Congressman Mann's bill, H.R.  2419, the Affordable Housing for Homeless Veterans Act of 2021.  Congressman Mann's provision would authorize the VA to sell, lease,  rent or donate homes to homeless veterans providers.   These homes were acquired by the VA due to veterans defaulting on  their VA-guaranteed home loans. This change would increase the stock of  affordable housing that is available to house homeless veterans.   Finally, this bill would provide authorization for the VA to continue  the practice of rounding out the semester for GI Bill students. This  practice ensures that the students who are finishing their education  early are able to take an additional class to receive their full  housing stipend.   I am dismayed that, without this legislative fix, the Biden  administration is poised to end the decades-long practice on August 1.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Levin for working with us to ensure  rounding out continues and students are not hurt by the VA's decision.  I also thank Congresswoman Miller-Meeks and Congressman Mann for their  hard work on both of these bills.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to gentleman from Kansas  (Mr. Mann), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1510, as amended, the  Veterans' Camera Reporting, or the VCR, Act. The VCR Act would require  VA to assess how cameras are used for patient safety and law  enforcement purposes in VA medical center facilities. It would also  require VA to report to Congress about how camera use could be improved  to make VA safer and more responsive to veterans' needs.   I was proud to introduce this bill with Congressman   David McKinley  of West Virginia and others earlier this year. We drafted it in  response to a series of incidents across the country where missing or  malfunctioning cameras played a role in serious lapses. In some of  those incidents, veterans' lives were lost. Those tragedies have no  place in the VA healthcare system. The VCR Act will help make sure they  will never happen again.   Most importantly, it will help ensure that veterans are safe seeking  the care that they have earned. The VCR Act is a bipartisan bill. It is  supported by the VA and the veterans service organizations, including  The VFW and the Wounded Warrior Project. I am grateful for that  support.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2494, which would  direct the VA to create a new fourth administration. This new  administration would oversee programs that support economic opportunity  for our veterans.   During my time in Congress, I have seen repeated instances of  mismanagement within the programs. I believe it is time for this new  administration to be created so that more focus can be placed on  economic opportunities for our veterans. This new focus is even more  important today as we are trying to help veterans get back on the right  economic track following the COVID-19 pandemic.   I want to thank Congressman Wenstrup for his dedication and hard work  on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues. I urge them to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2441, the Sgt. Ketchum  Rural Veterans Mental Health Act.   May is Mental Health Awareness Month. I am pleased to commemorate it  today by passing this bill to expand mental healthcare to veterans in  rural areas.   The Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental Health Act would expand VA's  RANGE program. The RANGE program provides veterans who have serious  mental illness or who are at risk of homelessness with intense case  management.   Almost a quarter of our Nation's veterans reside in rural  communities. I am one of those veterans who does. While I wouldn't have  it any other way, I know firsthand that living in a rural area can be a  barrier to care. This bill will help remove that barrier for some of  our most vulnerable veterans. It will help ensure that they do not fall  through the cracks. It will help them heal.   It will also require GAO to assess whether VA has sufficient  resources to support mental health in rural areas. That will help  identify any other barriers to care that may exist for these veterans  so that we can break them down.   This bill is supported by the entire Iowa delegation, including by my  friend, fellow veteran, and fellow committee member, Congresswoman  Mariannette Miller-Meeks.   It is named after Brandon Ketchum, an Iowa veteran who died by  suicide in 2016. My heartfelt condolences go out to his family and  friends. I am honored to support this bill today in Brandon's memory.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks), from the Second Congressional District.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Hinson), from the First Congressional District.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. Feenstra).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, I just encourage everyone to support this piece of  legislation. There should be no one that would vote against this.   Like all of the pieces of legislation that we have worked on this  afternoon, Madam Speaker, I do want to thank the chairman and his staff  for the job of working together. This is truly a case where this  committee has done its bipartisan work the way it should.   I also want to thank our staff for the hard work that they have put  in with each one of these bills, as well as each of the Members today  who have presented these pieces of legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
