 Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of  the majority leader the schedule for next week.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my  friend, the majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. As we go through  the bills that may come up next week--of course, we just finished a  week bringing some bills to the floor, but as we look around the  country, clearly the main concern we are hearing from families are all  of the various crises that are facing American families.   You have an inflation crises with goods of all kinds costing  dramatically more when people go to buy things at the grocery store. If  they try to get a new appliance, they are waiting longer, they are  paying more money.   You think about the energy crisis with families paying 50 percent  more for gasoline, in some cases, with dramatic increases at the pump  and the pain that it causes, especially lower income families.   The border crisis, where every day we see stories of thousands of  people coming across our border illegally. The Attorney General was  before the Committee on the Judiciary and he couldn't even give a  number of how many people have illegally crossed or plan to address it.   The supply chain crisis that we see getting worse and worse with  ships backed up, maybe almost all the way to China, because that crisis  is not being addressed.   So when you think about all these crises that families are angry  about--it is hurting hardworking families, it is costing them, it is  taking money out of their paychecks--there has not been a single bill  brought to this floor last week. It doesn't sound like any is being  brought to the floor next week to address any of those crises.   I would ask the gentleman, would he be open to bringing actual  legislation to the floor to address the various, serious crises that  families are facing today?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, clearly, we stand ready to help on all of  those issues. But had Washington spending and borrowing money solved  the problem, we would not have any of these crises because trillions of  dollars have been borrowed and spent under this administration.   In the previous administration, we worked together on those budget  deals, every one of them. The Paycheck Protection Program and the CARES  Act were all very bipartisan, and it included addressing the debt that  went along with it.   There has been nothing bipartisan in any of the debt that has been  racked up under this administration. So if the gentleman is concerned  about the full faith and credit of the United States, which we all are,  then stop borrowing and spending trillions more dollars.   Families get this, by the way. Families know that if spending  trillions was going to solve the problem, there wouldn't be a problem  because trillions have been borrowed and spent just from January to  October. What they know is it is the very borrowing and spending of  trillions of dollars in Washington that has exacerbated these problems.   The inflation crisis would not exist if you didn't have Washington  borrowing and spending trillions more dollars, making it harder for  people to get back into the workforce, making it harder for the supply  chain to be addressed.   What was inherited? I think we know what was inherited by the Biden  administration. We had energy dominance the day President Biden took  the oath of office. Not only were we producing enough energy for our  needs, but gas was less than $2 a gallon all across America. We were  exporting oil and natural gas to our friends around the world. We were  undermining our enemies around the world.   Instead of President Biden begging OPEC and Russia to produce more  oil, we were actually shipping oil and gas to our friends because we  could produce enough for ourselves. We created great American jobs here  at home. We had low-cost energy.   By the way, the technological advances we made here in this country,  if there is anywhere in the world where fossil fuel production is going  to be done, you want it done here because we have actually lowered  carbon emissions. We were lowering carbon emissions in America while  producing more energy. Now we have become more reliant on OPEC nations,  on Russia.   Not only is that bad for American families, but they are paying more  at the pump because of that crisis created by President Biden's  actions. He inherited an energy-dominant Nation. Now you have the  President of the United States begging OPEC and Russia to produce more  oil, which they are not going to do because they want oil to be over  $80 a barrel, but they actually emit more carbon to produce the same  oil.   Oil is going to be needed to run an economy, any economy anywhere in  the world. You want to make it here because we do it better than  anybody else. But that is not what is being done. We have an answer for  it.   I know, last night, President Biden was asked specifically about this  crisis that he created. His response was, ``I don't have a near-term  answer'' for high gas prices.    Well, President Biden might not have an answer, but we do. We have a  number of bills, and I know the gentleman has pointed it out. We have a  number of answers.   Here is one. H.R. 684 green-lights the Keystone pipeline. You want to  talk about creating thousands of good jobs, private-sector money, more  energy independence for America; this bill would do just that, and it  would do it today.   If pipelines were a problem--I know President Biden doesn't want  American pipelines, but he green-lighted the Russian pipeline, the Nord  Stream II. So, clearly, it is not pipelines; it is American pipelines  he doesn't want.   Why don't we bring up H.R. 684 to create jobs and lower energy costs?  H.R. 543 and H.R. 859 would both green-light more production in America  that President Biden shut down. There was production going on all  across America, really good, safe, environmentally sound production.  Again, our standards are the best in the world.   For people who want to bash America, go find a country that produces  energy that does it better than America. We do it best. Yet, President  Biden, through executive action, shut a lot of that production down.  These bills would open that back up again. These bills would lower gas  prices.   I know President Biden isn't interested in that because, in his own  budget, he specifically blocks the Corps of Engineers from doing  infrastructure projects that would lower energy production. President  Biden blocks that. You would think OPEC would have come up with that  idea or maybe Russia would have come up with that idea. No, that was  President Biden in his own budget who said you can't even do  infrastructure projects if it lowers energy production. Who would come  up with that? Yet, that is in his budget.   Then you go to the border crisis, again, self-created. President  Biden inherited a secure border. A wall was being built. You had  agreements with South American and Central American countries.   Remain in Mexico was a great policy that President Biden reversed; he  blocked it. Did he block it because it was bad policy? No, it was  working really well. It was an agreement between two neighboring  countries. He just blocked it because President Trump did it. It was  working, yet he got rid of it. He could go and reinstate that tomorrow.   We have bills that would solve the border crisis. I will read a few  of them off.   H.R. 4828 is a bill I brought to the majority leader's attention back  a month ago, in September. This is a bill that deals with a number of  problems facing our border today, and it would give more tools to our  Border Patrol agents to secure our border.   H.R. 471 is another bill I brought to the gentleman's attention a  month ago that would help secure America's border, dealing with the  crisis.   None of these bills seem to draw the interest of the majority even  though every one of them would address these very real crises facing  families that were not around a year ago.   President Biden inherited a secure border; he inherited energy  dominance; and he inherited an economy that was recovering from the  worst pandemic we have seen in lifetimes. Then, on top of that, there  is a proposal to raise trillions more in taxes, more in Soviet-style  spending coming out of Washington that would make inflation worse.   The gentleman is correct. We don't support those ideas that would  make inflation worse, that would raise gas prices even higher. But we  bring a lot of good ideas that would address these crises. We just want  to see these ideas brought to the floor.   When you look at the floor schedule and there is nothing last week,  next week, a month ago to address any of these crises, these are the  things that families are having the hardest time with, and they are  struggling.   Inflation is the biggest tax on lower and middle-income families.  President Biden promised he wouldn't raise taxes on anybody making less  than $400,000.  [[Page H5818]]  Yet, in the tax proposal that President Biden wants to bring forward by  next week so that he can go fly to Europe and talk about other  proposals that would make it impossible to produce energy in America,  they include, among other things, a natural gas tax. That tax would  fall the hardest on lower income families, not the millionaires and the  billionaires. It would be people making less than $60,000 that would be  hit the hardest by a natural gas tax. Yet, it is in the bill.   You talk about adding 83,000 IRS agents. Maybe some people in  Washington think that is job creation. Most people in America have  shivers running down their spines at the thought of the Federal  Government, which now wants to track every transaction if they make  more than $10,000 a year, to track all their transactions with 83,000  new IRS agents. Again, maybe to some that is called infrastructure, but  to most people, it is called a nightmare right before Halloween.   Why don't we bring bills to the floor to address these crises? If  these aren't the bills that the majority likes, let's work on some  other ones. All of these would address these problems, and many of them  would get us back to the point where we were, where we had a secure  border, where we had energy dominance, where we had jobs being created.   Each of these last few months you have seen jobs created dramatically  lower than what the projections were because there are all of these  self-created crises by the administration that are making it harder on  hardworking families. It is the lowest income families that are being  hit the hardest by these failed policies and all the Big Government  socialist spending coming out of Washington. We don't need more. We  need to actually go and confront the problem that is creating a debt  crisis and all the other crises that families are facing.   It is not going to be by spending more money and taxing people more.  It is going to be by working to address each of them, starting at the  root of the problem and what created them. I yield to the gentleman.     Madam Speaker, I sure hope that the gentleman is  concerned not just about making sure the credit card bill is paid but  making sure that the spending that maxed out the credit card is being  done responsibly.   There are some key facts the gentleman left out in his conversation  about how we got here. We got here because in January, one party, the  Democratic Party--who is in the majority in the House, is in the  majority in the Senate, and has control in the White House--made a  decision--I don't agree with the decision--but made a decision that  they were going to go it alone on the spending side. They decided that  they were going to go max out the credit card. We urged them not to do  it. We still to this day are urging not to go and just spend trillions  and trillions more dollars.   If my friend wants to work with us on what the responsible decision  should be, we are right here. We have been here from the beginning.   Madam Speaker, do you know, to this day President Biden has not met-- we are in October, late October. President Biden has not met with the  House Republican leadership on any of these issues--any of them.   The gentleman referenced a number of opportunities where it was  described we were there to help President Trump. The majority wasn't  just there to help President Trump, the majority was in the meetings  when the decisions were being made.   The Paycheck Protection Program was not a partisan exercise. In fact,  it was one of the most successful bipartisan exercises I have seen  Congress come together and do. Everybody was in the room making those  decisions. They were all very important decisions and big decisions  that involved a lot of money, and we all made those decisions together.  We all voted for those bills together, and then, ultimately, the  spending that went along with it, the debt that went along with it was  part of that negotiation and we voted for it together.   There has not been a decision made this year where the majority has  negotiated with the minority to figure out if we could come to an  agreement, so the majority did it on their own and look, the majority  had the votes to do it.   But when the majority maxes out the credit card on their own, don't  come and chide our side and say: Well, you need to be there to pay the  bill when we weren't included in the decision to max out the credit  card. And now that the credit card is maxed out, it is not as if there  is an effort to slow down, in fact, it seems like it is full steam  ahead, damn the torpedoes, spend trillions of dollars more on  additional things like, again, 83,000 more IRS agents.   Madam Speaker, do you think anybody on this side supports that?   That is not something we support. It will rack up more debt, by the  way. We don't support it, but I guess the gentleman expects we should  pay for it even if we don't support it. Maybe if there was a  negotiation where both sides were part of it.   Sam Graves, who is the ranking member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, has not been included in any of these  decisions on infrastructure. Yet, I am sure the gentleman would expect  him to vote for whatever comes out of a partisan exercise. That is not  how things work, and I know the gentleman knows that.   Again, if the President wants to work with us--    Of course, those are true.    We all negotiated on the three different debt ceiling  increases that happened under the Trump administration, including CARES  and the Paycheck Protection Program. They were very bipartisan.   Does the gentleman disagree with that?    Those are the facts. And so when the gentleman looked at  those facts, the gentleman talked about jobs and COVID. Before COVID  happened, we had the hottest economy maybe in the history of our  country. Wages were up for every demographic group. Those are facts.  The gentleman saw small businesses up and women-owned small businesses  were up over 20 percent. African-American unemployment was at its  lowest level, Hispanic unemployment was at its lowest level, and then  COVID came along.   Maybe there is a reason why the majority won't hold a hearing on the  origin of COVID, but if the gentleman wants to just say because of  COVID all of that is Donald Trump's fault, clearly the economy shut  down, and we worked to get it back going again, and it is coming back.  Frankly, some of the efforts to pay people not to work--and it is not  just enhanced unemployment, it is a whole list of things--are hurting  the recovery.   But those things were happening before COVID hit a year and a half  ago, and it was because of good, sound policies that got us a secure  border and that got us energy dominance, and, frankly, it was things  like that that helped us get the economy going again because it was  creating good jobs.   Keystone pipeline was moving forward. Those are good union jobs, by  the way, and that was ended by President Biden unilaterally. He never  even tried to have a meeting and a conversation with us to see if we  could come to an agreement.   Again, I guess it is the prerogative of the majority. If the  gentleman is in the majority, then the majority doesn't have to talk to  the minority. But just because the majority didn't talk to the minority  and they made decisions on their own about what they wanted to do, they  didn't try to reach an agreement with us, to come to us after the fact  when the majority has spent trillions of dollars, it has wreaked havoc  through our economy, it has led to inflation we haven't seen in  generations and gas prices we haven't seen in decades, then the  majority wants to come and not ask us how to fix it--we have got ideas  on how to fix it--the majority asks us to pay the bill.   Why don't we work together on the front end and not rack up trillions  more in spending?   Because the things the gentleman talked about would rack up trillions  more in spending which created these problems, and we were not a part  of those conversations. I wish we were a part of the conversations and  it was done in a bipartisan way. But, again, President Biden, 10 months  into his administration, has yet to sit down and meet with House  Republican leadership to talk about any of these ideas and solutions we  could come up with together which is how it should be done.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    No one is being threatened.    Madam Speaker, I would be happy to answer the question.  It might not be the answer the gentleman wants, but I would be happy to  be part of an actual bipartisan negotiation on how to solve our  country's debt. That has not happened.   But if you look at the bill that the gentleman brought to this floor  to deal with the debt over a month ago, it absolutely dealt with  spending, not that already happened, but that will happen in the  future, including the trillions of dollars of debt-laden bills that  spend more money in Washington.   It picked a date, and the date that the gentleman put in the bill  that was brought to this House floor was December 31, 2022. That is not  spending we have already done. That is spending that the majority plans  to do in a very partisan way, not just through this year but through  all of next year.   When we are not even included in those decisions, then you come and  say, well, you should just be expected to pay for whatever we want to  spend, trillions more, between now and the end of a year, over a year  from now, that is not a negotiation. That is not even an attempt to  want to work with the other side.   Now, again, the gentleman is in the majority. In the Senate, they are  in the majority, and the gentleman very well knows that both sides have  the ability, if you want to do the spending on your own, to address the  debt that would be created by all of that spending on your own. It  doesn't take 60 votes. The gentleman is well aware that there is a  legislative instrument that if all the spending wants to be done in a  partisan way--and I am talking about the trillions that are still  laying in front of us that the gentleman said may come to the floor  next week, not necessarily will, might come to the floor, might come to  the floor a month from now, might come to the floor a year from now.  And we won't even be included in those negotiations, but we ought to be  expected to vote for the debt that would be racked up by it?   If the other side were being asked to do that, you know your majority  wouldn't go for that. But we wouldn't do it. We would at least include  you in a negotiation. If we didn't want to, then we would be  responsible for doing it on our own if we did the spending on our own.  And the tools are there to do just that.   Threatening to default on the Nation's debt when legislative  instruments are included in this majority to not have default is  irresponsible. That threat keeps being thrown out there by the  majority, even though the majority knows they could, with a majority  vote in the House and a majority vote in the Senate, address the debt  that wants to be racked up between now and next December.   Again, I would urge that all of that new spending doesn't happen,  that we come together and negotiate what budget limits should be like  we have done in the past under Republican and Democrat Presidents.  Those were bipartisan deals. There has been no bipartisan attempt to do  that this year.   Why is there opposition to infrastructure? Well, first of all, if  there was a desire to do bipartisan infrastructure, you are going to  find a lot of takers over here. I know the gentleman made an  assertion--probably not realizing it--but there would have been no  threats, no threats made on our side of the aisle on a bill.   Now, I see people being followed into bathrooms on the other side and  all kinds of other things being done. There are no threats on this  side. What we said is, we want an infrastructure negotiation. But the  day that the deal was reached in the Senate with the President, he  turned around about an hour later and undermined that deal by tying it,  linking it, to the tax-and-spend bill.    That is when it became a problem because taxing and spending  trillions more dollars would be a problem to this country. It would  hurt middle-class families and lower income families to have that  natural gas tax, to have all the additional inflation on top of the  inflation they already see. It became a problem for all of those  reasons, that package, not the individual bill.   As the President himself has said multiple times, as the Speaker  herself has said multiple times, it is not a standalone bill. It is not  two standalone bills. It is a package. They are married together at the  hip.   That is where the opposition comes from. By the way, there is a  really  [[Page H5821]]  good bipartisan infrastructure bill that is out there. S. 3011 came  over from the Senate unanimously. $500 billion of infrastructure is  authorized in this bill. If the gentleman would bring this up for a  vote, it would probably fly overwhelmingly. It would allow for, again,  about $500 billion immediately that could be spent on infrastructure  all across this country, plus an additional large sum next year--maybe  $100 billion next year--on top of the $500 billion.   It just passed out of the Senate unanimously; every Republican, every  Democrat supported this bill. This is real infrastructure. This is not  tied to some tax-and-spend bill that maybe the gentleman might think is  a good idea. We surely don't. We know how damaging it would be to our  country and to our economy and to middle and lower income families.   This is a very bipartisan bill that could be bipartisan here, where  we could be a part of a negotiation on something really good, where  States wouldn't have to wait months. They have the money ready to go  today. This gives them the flexibility to make their own decisions on  what is best for the infrastructure in each of these States.   Maryland would be able to control their own destiny on over $1  billion. Louisiana would be able to control their own destiny on over  $1 billion today if this bill passed.   So, absolutely, we support real infrastructure. If it is tied  together and married to something that would be devastating to the  economy, of course not. Maybe if the majority would look at delinking  those two and abandoning the bill that would raise taxes--and even  internally in the Democrat Caucus those discussions have been going on.  That is not just Republicans asking for that. There are a number of  Democrats asking for that, too. That would be a bipartisan initiative  to say we are jettisoning this idea that we are going to raise hundreds  of billions, if not multiple trillions--whatever the number--if it is  $1 trillion, $5 trillion it would be devastating to our economy and  middle-class families.   Let's abandon that and go work on something that would actually be  real infrastructure that we could all rally behind. It would pass  overwhelmingly. It would be good for the country. President Biden would  get to sign it into law. We would support that.   I ask the gentleman to look at S. 3011, and if he is not a supporter  of that plan that passed with 100 Senators, maybe there is a better  idea. But this one is a really good one that got every Republican and  every Democrat in the Senate earlier this week to say yes. We would be  happy to say yes to it as well if we are given that opportunity. I  yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman again for his  comments.   There is clearly a bipartisan bill on infrastructure that we would be  happy to support, S. 3011. Nobody in the House on the Republican side  was included in any of those negotiations, including the ranking member  of the Transportation Committee who he himself has been urging a large  bill. $450 billion was put on the table, which, by the way, if that  were passed, it would be the largest infrastructure bill in the history  of the United States. He was pushed out of the negotiations.   Again, the majority has that ability because they are in the  majority, but they surely never tried a bipartisan negotiation, as well  the gentleman knows, on those prior budget agreements.   It wasn't just voted for or against because of who was in the White  House. It was voted for by both parties because the negotiation on what  that spending limit was was agreed upon by the leadership of both  sides.    The House, Senate, Republican, Democrat, we came to  agreement on those budgets, and that is why the gentleman voted for it.  That is why I voted for it, because it was a negotiated agreement.  There was give and take on a number of items but ultimately agreed by a  date certain but under a budget agreement.                                time  1230    There is a date certain of December 31 of 2022 that has no bipartisan  agreement. We know what a lot of the spending will be, because  trillions have already been spent that we were not included in and we  strongly opposed. The gentleman knew that when he brought the bills to  the floor, but he wanted to bring them to the floor anyway because you  had the votes. I get it. That is the way majorities work.   But if you decide to exclude one party from negotiations and go spend  the money anyway and then have a whole list of trillions more in  spending down the road and include that in a bill, I don't really think  anybody expects the people who were pushed to the curb to vote for the  credit card limit being increased with all the spending that is going  to continue to be racked up--not that has already been racked up--that  will be racked up between now and December 31 of 2022 is going to be  done in a partisan way. That is what the record has been so far this  year on the trillions that have already been added by bills passed by  this majority. They weren't bipartisan. Again, that is the prerogative  of the majority.   We have stood here ready. We have listed bill after bill to address  crisis after crisis, none of which have been brought to the floor. We  are still ready to go to solve these problems. We have  [[Page H5822]]  talked about a bipartisan bill on infrastructure that we can support.  Ultimately, the majority makes that decision.   I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, we need to do this in a bipartisan way,  which hasn't happened. But partisanship is not patriotism, and we have  seen a lot of partisanship.   I have served in leadership under three different Presidents now.  When we had to negotiate how to come together on the priorities of our  government, how to properly fund things and deal with our debt, under  President Obama, we had those bipartisan meetings in the White House.  When President Trump came in, we had those bipartisan meetings in the  White House. Still to this day, late October, 10 months into his  Presidency, there has not been a single time where President Biden has  brought a bipartisan group of our leadership together.   I understand he has met with Democrat leadership many times in the  White House. Again, that is his prerogative. He is the President; you  are in the majority. If you want to do all of this in a partisan way, I  don't suggest it is healthy and I don't suggest it is the right way.  Every President I have served under in leadership has had bipartisan  meetings to have these conversations and come to an agreement. That has  not happened under this President.   He ought to go and live by the words that he promised during the  campaign, that he would work with both parties in a bipartisan way. To  not have met with House Republican leadership once during his  Presidency, 10 months in, is not an acceptable way to run this  government.   Then all of a sudden, things end up partisan, and everybody throws  their hands up and goes: How did this happen? Just reach out. He is the  President of the United States. If he says let's go tomorrow, we will  be there tomorrow. But he won't do that. We have asked for meetings. At  some point they have to have them.   Again, if he doesn't want them to happen, that is his prerogative,  because the same party controls all levers of government. But if the  same party controls all levers of government and wants to just toss  aside the other party in either Chamber--oh, we worked with Senators.  Even some of those Senators that were mentioned are not supporting what  is happening with debt, because there has been no negotiation with both  parties on the debt, on the spending that gets us to the debt. So there  can be proposals for trillions more in spending. If we oppose it, we  have been very clear why we have that opposition.    It wasn't us that married those bills together. President Biden came  here just two weeks ago. They said he was going to be closing the deal.  He was going to be the closer. We were going to have a vote on the  House floor. The Speaker promised there would be a vote on the House  floor.   Instead, at that meeting, it has been reported that he said the two  bills are tied together. Since then, he said: I want both of them  coming to me. He has tied them together. I wish he wouldn't. That is  the President's prerogative. He has made it very clear. The Speaker has  made it very clear. It has not been our side that has done that. We  want to separate those as a package, but they have been kept together  as a package. Until then, at least we have been looking for other  opportunities, and we found one in S. 3011 that passed the Senate  unanimously. That would be $500 billion in real infrastructure today.  Every Governor of every State would have the ability to start doing  $500 billion in new infrastructure projects. We think that would be  really good for our country. We support it. We are ready to negotiate.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, we stand ready to work, if there is  bipartisan efforts made. We will see if that develops.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
