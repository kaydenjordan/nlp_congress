 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize the Ohavi Zedek  community and former Vermont Governor and U.S. Ambassador to  Switzerland Madeleine Kunin for their efforts to preserve and restore  the Shul Mural. Painted in 1910 by Ben Zion Black, the mural was  commissioned by Burlington's Lithuanian Jewish community, who had come  to Vermont from the town of Kovno and its environs to escape Russian  pogroms.   The immigrants founded the Ohavi Zedek Synagogue in 1885 and the Chai  Adam Synagogue 4 years later. It was at the latter synagogue that the  Shul Mural was painted. Stretching from floor to ceiling, it depicts  the Tent of the Tabernacle, as described in the Book of Numbers. The  style in which it was painted was well-known to the members of Chai  Adam, as it could be found in synagogues throughout Eastern Europe.  Now, the Shul Mural is one of the few remaining examples of this style  of painting in the world. The works which inspired it were destroyed,  as part of the burning of synagogues and the extermination of millions  of Eastern European Jews by the Nazis, including the decimation of  Lithuania's Jewish population.   In Burlington, the Ohavi Zedek and Chai Adam synagogues merged in  1939. Chai Adam was sold. The building went through multiple uses and  in 1986 the mural was covered with a false wall to protect it at the  urging of Jeffrey Potash, a historian and Ohavi Zedek's archivist.   In 2012, the building was sold once again. The new owner agreed to  donate the mural to Ohavi Zedek and efforts began to move the mural, a  massive undertaking that was successfully completed in 2015. Since  then, work has been underway to fully restore the painting.   The relocation and restoration of the mural were a significant  undertaking, with costs exceeding $1 million. The funding came from  foundations, historic preservation groups, arts organizations, and  individuals.   Governor Kunin, herself a Jewish immigrant, lent her leadership  skills to the effort, chairing the Friends of the Mural Board. Governor  Kunin's parents were German Jews who fled to Switzerland, where her  father died. Her mother brought Madeleine and her brother, Edgar, to  the United States to escape the Nazis when Madeleine was 6 years old  and Edgar 10. Although her immediate family survived the Holocaust,  Governor Kunin lost extended family in the concentration camps. She is  fond of saying both she and the mural are survivors.   Despite having arrived in the United States at a time of rising  nativism, racism, and anti-Semitism, the families which had originally  arrived from Lithuania continued to encourage their friends and former  neighbors to follow them. At its peak, the community had more than a  thousand members in Burlington. That community produced leaders in a  number of fields, including Robert Larner, a physician who treated  soldiers at Guadalcanal and Okinawa, and for whom Vermont's only  medical school is now named, and Ed Colodny, the former CEO of U.S.  Air.   While the story of Burlington's Lithuanian Jewish community is  unique, it is also a perfect example of what immigrants have brought  and continue to bring to the United States. They enrich our country and  society by sharing their art, their culture, and their experience.   The story of the Shul Mural, the people who commissioned and created  it, and those who ensured its preservation for future generations, is a  Jewish story, an immigrant story, and a quintessentially American  story.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have long told the story of my love for  Batman comics dating back to my younger years growing up in Montpelier,  VT. When I was 4 years old, I would race to the Kellogg Hubbard Library  in Montpelier with my latest Batman comic. As a child, reading comic  books allowed me, like so many others, to broaden the expanses of my  imagination. While Spider-Man and Superman are fine, I have always  preferred Batman. His values, his pursuit of justice, his balance of  human strength and vulnerability have always resonated with me.   I would like to take a moment today to recognize a store where I have  bought more than my fair share of ``The Dark Knight,'' an institution  foundational to the comic-loving community in Vermont: Earth Prime  Comics.   Founded in 1983, Earth Prime Comics was one of Vermont's first comic  book stores. It began as a shared venture between Christine Farrell and  John Young, first operating out of John Young's attic in Burlington,  VT. In that attic, John and Christine's extensive collection of comics  quickly garnered a surprisingly large following. Earth Prime Comics  soon moved into a real retail space: a converted Victorian house on  Bank Street in Burlington. Requiring even more space for its growing  business, Earth Prime moved to a storefront on Church Street in  Burlington in 1989, a location where it has remained for 33 years.   Over the past few decades, Earth Prime Comics has drawn comic book  fans from across Vermont and forged a comic-loving community where all  were welcome. Christine still owns Earth Prime Comics, and it has been  great to see how she and her team have continued to build and shape  their community to keep pace with the ever-changing comic landscape. In  the years to come, I have full faith that comic lovers of all ages will  continue to  [[Page S2739]]  thumb through the pages of comics in Earth Prime Comics, as I have on  so many occasions.   Earth Prime Comics was recently featured in an article published  earlier this year in ``Seven Days.'' I ask unanimous consent that  excerpts from the article, titled ``Origin Story: How Burlington's  Earth Prime Comics helped unite Vermont's comic lovers,'' be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      [From Seven Days, Mar. 2, 2022]      Origin Story: How Burlington's Earth Prime Comics Helped Unite                           Vermont's Comic Lovers                           (By Chris Farnsworth)         I was 10 years old, staring at a strange house on Bank       Street.        It was late summer, and my mother was inside the Burlington       Square Mall shopping, so my brother Pat and I were cut loose       to investigate the comic book shop across the street. Shadows       from the trees in the yard cast the house in a mysterious       darkness, making it resemble some Jungian archetype of a       cave.        Pat and I were no rubes, despite our ages--Pat was 9. We'd       been to the comic shops in New York City. We had a growing       collection of X-Men and The New Mutants comics inherited from       family friends. Hell, we had the Longshot miniseries,       something we were rather proud of--and continue to be 30       years later.        Still, the house didn't look like a comic shop, and we       climbed the porch stairs with trepidation. We'd only been       Vermonters for a little while, and when you're the new kids       in town, caution is a defense against disappointment.        I heard Pat gasp and followed his gaze to a poster taped       inside the window. Staring out was the ferocious visage of       Wolverine, leaping at us with adamantium claws drawn. Our       hero.        This was the late 1980s, more than a decade before Hugh       Jackman's Wolverine and the rest of the X-Men ushered in the       age of superhero films dominating multiplexes. Back then, you       wrote letters by hand to the publishers of comic books--and       sometimes they answered. Comics fandom in the '80s was a       club, and Pat and I were pledges standing before the       clubhouse.        Steeling our nerves, we entered the store and breathed in       the smell of newsprint and cardboard, the telltale musk of a       good comic shop. Posters on the walls depicted more of our       favorite characters, alongside many we had yet to discover.       The mystery of these strange heroes and villains filled us       with tension, a curiosity that had to be satiated.        But the real treat was the comics themselves. Even before       we got to see the back-issue room, we salivated over the       sheer number of books on display.        A bearded, longhaired man with a knowing grin looked at the       two kids who'd wandered in with wide eyes.        ``Well,'' I remember him saying, almost smugly, ``looks       like you found your place.''        Our place, as the shopkeeper called it, was Earth Prime       Comics. One of Vermont's first comic book shops, Earth Prime       has been a center of the state's comic community since it       moved out of original co-owner John Young's attic and into       that Bank Street house-turned-shop in 1983. The shop has       remained a polestar in its current home on the bottom block       of the Church Street Marketplace, where it moved in 1989.        ``Not many places downtown have been around longer,'' said       Bill Simmon, who managed Earth Prime from 1989 to 1998. ``Old       Gold, Pure Pop, maybe a few others? You can count them on one       hand, I bet. Earth Prime is an institution.''        In its 39 years, Earth Prime has fostered generations of       local comic fans, helping some of them go on to become comic       artists themselves. The store has survived and thrived       through the excitement of the underground comics explosion in       the '80s, through the crisis and near collapse of the       industry in the '90s--all the way to the modern epoch when       movies and shows based on Marvel and DC Comics monopolize pop       culture and, some say, draw interest away from their source       material.        The little shop on Church Street is driven by the passion       of its mysterious proprietor, Christine Farrell, who is       rumored to have one of the largest and oldest private       collections of comics on the planet. While Sen. Patrick Leahy       (D-Vt.) may be Vermont's most famous Batman fan, she's said       to have been collecting Bruce Wayne's exploits from the very       beginning.        Farrell's store has been as much a clubhouse for the comic       community to celebrate groundbreaking independent creators as       a place to pick up the latest issue of Iron Man. It's no       longer the only comic store in Vermont--many have come and       gone over the decades, and the state is currently home to       Barre's Wonder Cards and Comics and Rutland's newly opened       Night Legion Comics. But Earth Prime has a special status for       veterans of the scene.        ``I have to give all due respect and honor to Earth       Prime,'' Stephen Bissette said. The Duxbury native is one of       Vermont's most influential and respected comic artists,       having established himself with a seminal run in the early       1980s on Saga of the Swamp Thing with Alan Moore. He has       taught for 15 years at the Center for Cartoon Studies in       White River Junction.        Earth Prime has ``outlived every Vermont comic shop I've       ever been to,'' Bissette said. ``Long may that continue.''                         It Came From the Underground         Earth Prime's arrival in the '80s was perfectly timed, as       the world of comics was undergoing a revolution on the       national stage. Meanwhile, in Vermont, the store united a       ragtag crew of comic fans into a community.        ``I find, with people like us, it's inevitable, right?''       said John Odum, who hosts a podcast about all things geek       called ``Open World Chat.'' ``It's part of being a comic fan.       Eventually, we all start finding each other. It's just a       question of where.''        Odum is the Montpelier city clerk and a freelance writer       for comics sites such as Bleeding Cool. He grew up during the       independent comics revolution of the '80s, when artists like       Bissette and Veitch started pushing back against the       censorship of their youth, working with writers far removed       from the kid-friendly scripts of Stan Lee.        Moore's Watchmen series and Miller's dark, noir-tinged work       on Batman and Daredevil changed the mainstream superhero       books. The arrival of titles such as Cerebus and Elfquest       marked the rise of the underground.        ``The 1980s changed comics,'' Odum said. Veitch agrees.        ``The '80s for comics were like the '60s for music,'' he       said. ``For a short time, before the moneymen caught on, the       inmates got control of the asylum.''        Earth Prime was at the forefront of that movement in       Vermont. Its reputation drew fans from all over the state.                           Don't Call It a Comeback         As the 1980s wound up, the scene changed at Earth Prime.       Amidon left for Massachusetts. Many of the first-generation       Earth Prime kids grew up and either moved away, as Pat and I       did in 1989, or simply lacked the time they once had to hang       out at the shop all day.        ``The family atmosphere kind of changed,'' Simmon said.       ``It was still fun to be there and talk comics, but look, we       weren't kids anymore. Life tends to get more serious, even at       comic shops.''        In the spring of 1989, Farrell bought out Young's half of       the business and moved Earth Prime to its current spot at 152       Church Street. Though none of the original gang wanted to go       into details, they implied that some sort of schism occurred       between the two founders of Earth Prime. Young opened Comics       City at the other end of downtown Burlington, before moving       eventually to Winooski. Customers were split; many, like       Rovnak, switched over to Young's new store.        Within a few years, the entire comics industry was rocked       like never before, as its own increasing cultural legitimacy       sent it into a boom-and-bust cycle. Collectors started       snapping up ``big event'' books such as The Death of Superman       and Batman: Knightfall, creating a bloat in the speculator       market that coincided with a disastrous decision by Marvel to       bypass the distributors and form its own distribution wing.       When the market crashed, the company was stuck with multiple       printings of variant issues that were meant to be       ``collectible'' but are now the exact opposite.        What kept Earth Prime afloat while all the other boats       sank? Farrell herself seems to have been a major factor. Her       clear vision of how to create communities of like-minded fans       would serve her well, as one industry faltered and another       emerged.        In 1989, Farrell opened Quarterstaff Games directly above       Earth Prime. With its medieval-tavern vibe, it's Vermont's       longest-lived gaming shop. Like its sister store,       Quarterstaff has fostered a long-marginalized community and       given them a home--another tribute to Farrell's dedication.        Farrell's tenacity was rewarded as the century came to a       close and the fortunes of comics changed once again. Though       superheroes had made their mark on cinema in the past,       notably with Tim Burton's Batman and Richard Donner's       Superman films, the 2000s saw the rise of Marvel as an       entertainment business. In 20 years, the company went from       barely surviving bankruptcy to being a multibillion-dollar       juggernaut that dominates Hollywood. Disney would buy it in       2009.        For Giordano, that process started at Earth Prime, where       the future illustrator would draw all day at a table beside       the back issues.        ``I would never have become an artist if I didn't have       somewhere like Earth Prime,'' he said. ``People there would       see me drawing, whether it was coworkers or customers, and       gave me positive feedback. There's power in that--I started       to think, Hey, maybe I'm not a total piece of shit. Maybe I       have some value. I owe everything to that experience.''                               To Be Continued         I remembered Giordano's words as I stared down the front       door of Earth Prime a few weeks ago. I hadn't been inside in       years, but knowing that the store was there hung on me like a       weight, like a gift I couldn't dare take for granted.        I walked inside, unsurprised by the posters this time. The       staff were helping customers or reading comics as hip-hop       played softly over the speakers.        I thought of Shady, the black cat who used to guard the       boxes of comics with a lazy swipe of her paw. I thought about       how I've skipped every school reunion I've ever been  [[Page S2740]]       invited to and how none of them would have felt as much like       an authentic reunion as being inside Earth Prime did at that       moment.        A man roughly my own age walked in, flanked by several       children. One of them, a young girl wearing a white-and-pink       Spider-Gwen hoodie, had a list in hand. She bounced on the       balls of her feet as she browsed from shelf to shelf, humming       quietly.        I looked away, overcome by a rogue wave of emotion. I       seemed to see a thread stretching back through time,       connecting Bissette, Veitch and Farrell hunting the comics       racks to misfits like Giordano and Simmon finding family at a       fledgling shop. That thread reached all the way to the girl       in the hoodie, humming to herself in her happy place. Earth       Prime was hers now more than mine, and I loved that so much       that I felt a strange, damp sensation at the comers of my       eyes.        As I walked away from Earth Prime, I made a mental note to       text my brother. I wanted to say something reflective of the       strange epiphany I'd had standing in the shop. In the end,       though, I decided to keep it simple.        ``Dropped by Earth Prime,'' I texted Pat. ``Still the       same.''    (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
