 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1, to  lower energy costs. United States energy independence is critical to  meeting domestic demand, and growing needs from the rest of the world.   Rather than pulling out all of the stops to keep domestic production  moving forward to meet this increased demand, the Biden administration  has instead begged the OPEC cartel to boost their output, culminating  in a failed appeal from President Biden to the Saudi Crown Prince in  July of last year. To me, this is exactly why we are here in support of  H.R. 1 today.   As a result of the historic increases in inflation under the Biden  administration, the average American family is spending an extra $395  to purchase the same monthly necessities as they did a year ago.   In November 2022, one in six families were behind on utility bills,  and we are not out of the woods yet as natural gas prices rose over 14  percent just last month. This is especially concerning as 47 percent of  U.S. households use natural gas to heat their homes.   The Lower Energy Costs Act seeks to reverse the troubling energy  policy strategy that the Biden administration has carried out, and it  prioritizes American energy dominance ahead of misguided Green New  Deal-style policies.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Lower Energy Costs Act.
