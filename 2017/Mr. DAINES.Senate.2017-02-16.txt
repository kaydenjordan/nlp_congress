 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing Ellen Wood of Winnett. Ellen has been serving up  hospitality to the folks in Petroleum County for the past 25 years. Her  culinary prowess have also pleased the tastebuds of many others well  beyond her central Montana community.   In 1992, Ellen decided it was time to make an occupational change and  purchased the Kozy Korner Bar and Cafe. It was not long after that The  Kozy Korner became known for its delicious pies. Hunters, ranchers,  tourists, and locals are all fortunate if they get a slice. Some even  call ahead just to make sure they will not leave empty handed. You know  a pie is good when you have to make reservations. Ellen has even  shipped her homemade pies to repeat customers around the country. In  addition to her pies, Gourmet Magazine did an article in 2005 on  Ellen's plate-sized pancakes. It is no wonder that every 5 years during  the Winnett all-school class reunion, the Kozy Korner serves as a hub  of activity for the local community. A quarter century of hospitality  and service to her neighbors and guests is a great accomplishment.   Being a small business owner is tough work, but Ellen had a trusted  partner in her husband, Buck. He was U.S. Marine Corps veteran with  over 4 years of service in Vietnam. He helped her run the Kozy Korner  until he passed away in 2014. Today Buck's Bacon Cheeseburger is still  one of the favorite menu items for Kozy Korner patrons. Hometown cafes  are a staple of our Montana communities and so are people like Ellen  and Buck. With that community spirit in mind, it is an honor to say  thank you to Ellen for making a corner of Petroleum County a  comfortable place to visit. If you are going to stop in, just remember  to call ahead if you want a piece of the marionberry pie.                            ____________________     Madam President, I can tell you it is bittersweet to be  here  [[Page S1386]]  today. As we sometimes say back home: I've got some good news; I've got  some bad news. On the good news side, we are here today to confirm  Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be the next Administrator of the EPA.  While he should have been passed through the Senate weeks ago, we are  here now. We are here today. We are going to get it done in a couple of  hours. That is good news.   As they say about Montana, we are a unique blend of Merle Haggard and  John Denver, and mastering that melody is always a challenge. When you  do, it results in a commonsense approach to environmental stewardship,  and I can tell you Scott Pruitt is the guy to do it.   I literally left my office to come here and make these remarks, and  guess who I was meeting with in my office. It was Scott Pruitt.   You know what we talked about?   He came into my office. When you come into my office, you can see  Montana all over the walls. You are going to see me with a fly rod in  my hand. You are going to see pictures of trout that we have caught and  released back into the streams and rivers of our State. We talked about  fly fishing in Yellowstone Park. He loves to fly-fish.   In fact, he asked to me: Do you know where Cooke City, MT, is?   I said: Scott, Cooke City, MT? Let me show you. I have a map of the  Beartooth in my office with pins in all the lakes that I have blown to.  In fact, I spent 65 miles in the Beartooth Wilderness in August on  horseback and on foot, above 10,000 feet, with an elk hair caddis and  my fly rod, chasing golden trout and cutthroat trout. We spent a lot of  time talking about that. We talked about elk hunting and deer hunting  in Montana.   Scott Pruitt understands the important role that States play,  especially in a State like Montana. I am confident he is going to  restore this balanced focus, this Merle Haggard and John Denver balance  that Montanans are pleading for. He will bring that back to the EPA,  rather than this heavy-handed Gina McCarthy out-of-touch Federal  approach.   Let me tell you a couple of stories of what is going on in Montana  and why Scott Pruitt is exactly the right guy for the job. Today in the  small town of Colstrip, MT, they face a real struggle to survive.  Colstrip is a generating station and neighboring mine and the lifeblood  of this small town.   Over the years, the Colstrip plant has continued to develop. They  have adopted new technologies, and they made remarkable reductions in  emissions and pollution. Yet it has been met with an onslaught of new  environmental regulations that are having drastic compliance costs on  our State.   Let me share some of those. Under this EPA power plan that was  launched by Gina McCarthy, Montana needs to cut its emissions by 47  percent--the largest reduction in the Nation, leading almost inevitably  to the entire shutdown of Colstrip.   In fact, according to a study conducted by the University of Montana,  they said this plan will cost our State 7,000 jobs, $500 million in  lost revenues, and $1.5 billion in gross sales for our State. And  Montana moves from being an energy exporter to being an energy  importer. That is outrageous, and the people of Montana know it.   For what? For what the Obama administration had projected to have a  0.02-degree impact on global temperature in the next 100 years-- negligible. In fact, I confronted Gina McCarthy on that in a hearing,  and she did not refute my data.   Similarly, the waters of the United States serves yet another example  of the detrimental effects of Gina McCarthy's and President Obama's  EPA, which has harmed Montana's farmers and ranchers. As I mentioned,  one of my favorite things to do is get into the fresh air of Montana,  the clean waters of Montana, up in wilderness country with my fly rod  in my hand. We all want clean water. We all want clean air. I have yet  to meet a single Montanan who says I don't want clean air; I don't want  clean water.   The WOTUS rule was a clear effort by the Obama administration to gain  control over Montana's livelihoods. It was a private property taking,  seeking to regulate virtually every ditch and pond that could be  occasionally wet across the State of Montana.   While, thankfully, this incredible overreach by the EPA and the Obama  administration has been stopped by the courts, I am looking forward to  working with Scott Pruitt to defend Montana farmers and ranchers and to  defend Montana property owners from this unnecessary and harmful rule.   Scott Pruitt understands the important role our States play and not  to levy unnecessary and overreaching Federal regulations--regulations  that could decimate a State's economy. That is unacceptable.   I will tell what you else I talked to Scott Pruitt about; that is,  the importance of cleaning up our Superfund sites. This is a critical  responsibility of the EPA. We need to unleash American innovation,  American cooperation--not cut off affordable energy sources at its  heels.    Regarding Superfund cleanup, as Scott and I concluded our meeting, we  talked about the Berkeley Pit in Butte. He has committed to getting  that environmental disaster cleaned up. He assured me he will address  these issues head-on.   The largest Superfund site in the United States is right there in  Butte, MT. We had snow geese that came across our State migrating. They  landed in the toxic waters in the Berkeley Pit, and thousands of snow  geese died just by landing in the water. Scott is committed to getting  that fixed. It has been on the list for over 20 years. It is time to  fix it, and Scott is committed, saying: Let's get this done.   That is why he is going to be a great Administrator, to protect the  environment in Montana.   That is the good news. We are going to move Scott Pruitt through  today, and I am looking forward to casting a ``yes'' vote for our next  Administrator of the EPA.    I will.    I am not sure if that is a direct question or a  rhetorical question. Of course, Cory--the Senator from Colorado--they  would be held accountable, and that is why we need to hold the  Superfund sites. We need to hold sites, like what happened here with  the mine in Colorado--hold the EPA accountable for that.    We will work together on that.   I yield back my time.
