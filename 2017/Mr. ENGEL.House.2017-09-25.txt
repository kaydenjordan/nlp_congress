 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure.   First, I thank our chairman, who always conducts himself in such a  bipartisan fashion. I thank him for including everyone and thank him  for the work that he does.   I also thank the bill's author, our former chair of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen from Florida. I am pleased to join  her as the Democratic cosponsor of this legislation. She authored an  earlier version of this bill, which is a testament to how long she has  been working to shine a light on the daily horror of so many living in  North Korea and to bring American leadership to bear, to ease their  suffering.   We have been focused on North Korea a great deal lately because of  the Kim regime's increasingly provocative behavior and our own  administration's inconsistent and irresponsible rhetoric.   North Korea poses a great threat to our national security and the  security of our friends and allies. We need a smart, coherent approach  that combines diplomacy, pressure, and deterrence to halt North Korea's  progress in developing nuclear weapons.   At the same time, we cannot lose sight over what the North Korean  people are enduring. This is a country where people don't have rights,  and anyone who dares speak his or her mind may find themselves  subjected to beatings, torture, brutal imprisonment, or even death.   The United States Commission of Inquiry found that Kim Jong-un's  regime is very likely committing crimes against humanity.   Mr. Speaker, I visited North Korea twice. When I was there with a few  of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, our North Korean minders  were very careful to make sure we only saw what we were supposed to  see.                                time  1515    But we could sense that beneath the surface, something was terribly,  terribly wrong. First of all, they wouldn't let us go out of Pyongyang;  that just out of sight, it was amazing that there were so many people  living under the most brutal conditions imaginable and that no one  dared shatter the illusion that the North Korean authorities had just  created.   When you go into North Korea, it feels like you are stepping back  into 1953 Berlin. Everything was gray and dark and drab, and you could  just see something was wrong.   We know better. We have seen year after year of disturbing reports  and stories from defectors who have told us exactly what life is like  for most North Koreans, and we haven't forgotten them.   The law that we are reauthorizing today first became law in 2004.  This legislation will preserve funding for American assistance to North  Korean refugees, for humanitarian assistance inside the country, as  well as information efforts by our government, and to try every means  possible to get the message out to regular North Korean people that we  are not their enemy.   I will say that I am greatly concerned that the latest iteration of  the President's travel ban, which now includes North Korea, sends  exactly the wrong message to defectors from that country. By closing  our door to them, we reinforce the paranoia that the regime  perpetrates. We have to be careful not to get caught in the middle of  that.   An earlier version of this law created a senior State Department  position to focus on human rights in North Korea. It is a big job, Mr.  Speaker, and in recent years, there has been someone to do this  important work full time, but it has been reported that the  administration plans to combine this position with the Under Secretary  for Democracy. I think that would be a mistake.   The Under Secretary position already oversees the bureaus and offices  that deal with a huge range of issues from counterterrorism, to  refugees, to narcotics, to human trafficking. It is a pretty full  agenda, yet the administration on the one hand says North Korean human  rights should be combined with that job, and on the other hand has not  yet nominated anyone to fill the position.   So I think there is a lot of work to be done on both sides, and that  is what we are doing on the Foreign Affairs Committee. We are working  together.   This reauthorization reaffirms Congress' view that we should have a  senior full-time diplomat dealing with North Korean human rights. I ask  that this provision be included once again. I am grateful to Chairman  Royce and Chairman Emeritus Ros-Lehtinen that Congress will continue to  speak out on the importance of this role.   It is also my view that we need to stop neglecting our diplomacy and  get these positions filled. We cannot expect the State Department to  deal with these challenges--whether North Korea's nuclear program or  North Korea's human rights record--without leadership in place, but I  am glad that Congress is continuing to do its job in helping to promote  human rights for the North Koreans.   I am, again, grateful to my friend from Florida and the chairman.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the Kim regime poses a grave threat to global security,  and it is critical that the United States move ahead with a coherent  strategy to help meet this challenge.   At the same time, the Kim regime's treatment of its own people  represents one of the worst human rights situations in the entire  world. We cannot lose sight of that human suffering that is going on  every day.    For years, the United States has made it a priority to do what we can  to help those living under this brutal dictatorship and to assist those  who have escaped it. This legislation will ensure that the United  States continues this important work in the years ahead.   I want to say that Chairman Royce has made it a mark of his to travel  the region, to speak with South Korea, to speak with the leaders in  Asia. I am pleased that we are well represented when he goes there and  lets the regimes know that we in Congress have a lot of things to say  and that we want to stand by our allies and let North  [[Page H7444]]  Korea understand that they cannot push anybody around.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for having visited Korea with him  and for all the things he does in Asia. I think the committee is united  in supporting this legislation. We have to speak out. We have to  protect the North Korean people who have no protection from a brutal  dictator and a regime that treats them like they are worthless.   I urge Members to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume,  and I rise in support of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking the authors of this resolution,  two valued members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Castro from  Texas and Mrs. Wagner from Missouri.   In addition to bringing this legislation forward, these two lawmakers  established the first ever Congressional ASEAN Caucus. I am grateful  for their leadership helping to advance American interests in the Asia  Pacific.   Part of ensuring America's strong role in that region is our work  with ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations. This  organization has worked to promote stability, prosperity, and peace  among the countries of Southeast Asia. It is in our own strategic  interest to see stronger countries, closer partnership, healthier  economies, so our own success in Asia is closely tied to the success of  ASEAN and its members.   This resolution underscores the accomplishments of ASEAN as it marks  its 50th anniversary. It sends a signal to our partners and friends in  Southeast Asia that the United States is committed to peace and  prosperity in the region, and it puts Congress on record saying that,  in this challenging time, the United States must remain engaged around  the world, particularly in the Asia Pacific.   The administration's budget proposed a 46 percent cut to assistance  in East Asia and the Pacific. I think this would be a grave mistake.  What kind of impact would that have on American-backed initiatives that  are having a positive impact? What message does it send to the  countries that we depend on as partners?   Rather than drawing back, America should be even more engaged in the  Asia Pacific. This measure reaffirms our commitment to America's  leadership in the region.   I want to end by thanking the authors, and I want to compliment  Chairman Royce, who knows more about this region of the world than  virtually anybody in Congress, and has been to that part of the world-- I have gone with him many times--and the United States Congress has  shown the ability to work with countries for the betterment of their  people, for the betterment of our relationship with them.   Mr. Speaker, this measure reaffirms our commitment to America's  leadership in the region. I thank the authors, I thank Chairman Royce,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Castro), who is the author of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The Asia Pacific presents the perfect case of what might happen if  the United States withdraws from the world. In recent years, our focus  there, especially working with ASEAN and its members, has really helped  to promote growth and stability in that region of the world, to enhance  human rights, and the rule of law.   It is important for us to stay engaged. If we draw back, it is pretty  clear that China would be happy to fill the void, and I guarantee the  values we consider critical to foreign policy, democracy, justice, and  equality would not be part of the agenda in Beijing. We need to stay  engaged in Asia and around the world. We need to demonstrate that  American leadership is a sure thing.   The resolution before us today will provide much needed reassurance  to our partners and friends in Southeast Asia. Even Vietnam works with  us. I remember, and others here remember, when we had the Vietnam war.  Now we have so many Vietnam Americans in our country, and they help to  really be good citizens and really help to show why it is important for  us to keep engaged in that part of the world.   We will underscore the important role ASEAN stands to play, just as  it has in the last 50 years. Again, it is important to reassure our  partners and friends in Southeast Asia--I mentioned Vietnam, but all  the other countries that belong to ASEAN.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this measure. I thank Chairman  Royce, I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of this measure, and I am glad we are taking  up this bill from our colleagues in the other body, Senators Shaheen  and Capito, and I want to thank our colleagues who have worked so hard  on the House version of this bill, Representatives Jan Schakowsky and  Representative Noem.   Jan Schakowsky has brought forward a version of this bill for the  last few Congresses. The House passed a version of this bill last year,  and I am glad we are finally moving a version of it forward.  [[Page H7449]]    One of the hallmarks of the Obama administration foreign policy was  the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security. It was based on  a wealth of research that showed very clearly, as the chairman said,  getting women involved in conflict prevention and resolution leads to  more successful outcomes.   Since the launch of this plan, the United States has promoted efforts  to enhance the physical and economic security of women around the  world. We have sought to break through the barriers that have stopped  women from being full participants in peace processes.   This bill would make these policies permanent. It would build on the  Obama administration's achievements, making sure State Department,  USAID, and Pentagon personnel fully understand just how important it is  to get women involved in conflict prevention and resolution. It would  also require annual reporting so Congress can stay apprised of these  efforts.   Now, we have been working a few years to get this legislation across  the finish line, and, frankly, I don't think we can wait another  moment. The administration's budget proposal would slash funding for  diplomacy and development to dangerous levels, and a current redesign  effort at the State Department might strip out initiatives like Women,  Peace, and Security. I hope that won't happen. I got assurances today  that that won't happen. I hope that is right, but we have to still  fight for this.   Congress has a role to play in foreign policy and, by passing this  bill, it will be clear that we support efforts to expand opportunity  and participation for women around the world.   I am pleased to support this measure. As always, Chairman Royce has  been a bulwark of helping to push this through. I thank the Members who  have worked so hard on it.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a leader on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Illinois.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  will close now since there are no further speakers on either side.   I want to start again by thanking Chairman Ed Royce for all of his  work and for all of his collaboration working together with us; as well  as Representatives Schakowsky and Noem, who worked very closely  together, for their really hard work and really good work.   Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons I always support a strong investment  in development and diplomacy is that we get such a good bang for our  buck. Diplomacy and development efforts help to build stability. They  defuse crises, they prevent conflicts, they help lay the groundwork for  a more secure and more prosperous world.   History and research have shown us that when women are involved in  these processes, they work even better. So it is smart policy. It is  not a matter of being condescending. It is a matter of smart policy.   Think about the alternatives, about when we don't have diplomacy to  help spread peace. Conflicts grow into wars--sometimes wars that  American men and women will be required to fight. Populations are  driven from their homes, triggering humanitarian crises. And the cost  of dealing with these problems down the road is far higher than the  cost of investing in diplomacy and development right now.   So this legislation is a piece of that puzzle. It isn't the whole  thing, but it is an important piece. It is an important part of making  sure American diplomacy can succeed, and I am glad to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote. I thank Chairman Royce for his  hard  [[Page H7450]]  work, and I yield back the balance of my time.
