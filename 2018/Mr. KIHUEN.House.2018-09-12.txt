 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the life of  Christopher Elijah Harnum.   On November 13, 2010, Chris was a victim of gun violence, a 14-year- old boy shot through the stomach as he played with his friends.   Chris spent over a year in the hospital recovering from his injuries.  As he recovered, Chris devoted his life to serving others. Chris worked  to become an EMT so that he could help those in need.   In the aftermath of the October 1 shooting in Las Vegas, Chris formed  Vegas Out of Ashes, a nonprofit devoted to helping those victims. Chris  personally collected donations, purchased water and goods, promoted  blood drives, and visited local hospitals.   Through it all, Chris struggled with PTSD and depression from his own  trauma. The events of October 1 reopened Chris' wounds, and as he  worked tirelessly to help those suffering around him, Chris suffered  himself.   On August 19, 2018, Chris lost his battle against depression.   Today, I honor Chris as a fighter, who rose from his own ashes to put  the needs of others above his own, who exuded love through his own pain  and who embodied the best of what it means to be a Nevadan, a Las  Vegan, and an American.                            ____________________
