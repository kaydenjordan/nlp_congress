 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when the term ``genocide'' was created in 1944 to  describe the systematic destruction of an entire people. Its author,  Raphael Lemkin, explained the term by saying: ``It's the sort of thing  Hitler did to the Jews and the Turks did to the Armenians.''   When he ordered the invasion of Poland in 1939, Adolf Hitler said:  ``Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?''   Mr. Speaker, in the year 2000, and again in the year 2015, I chaired  two congressional hearings on the Armenian genocide. In 2000, the House  was moving to pass a bipartisan resolution by Congressmen Radanovich  and Bonior, H. Res. 398.   After hearing fact-based, eloquent testimony from Congressmen James  Rogan and David Bonior, followed by the State Department, history  professors, and then witnesses from both the Armenian and the Turkish  side, my subcommittee successfully marked up H. Res. 398 for  consideration by the full committee.   Ambassador Marc Grossman, however, testified at the hearing that  President Bill Clinton was against the Armenian genocide resolution.  That opposition proved to be very significant, and as we were moving  with the highest expectations toward passage, President Clinton's  National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, took the extraordinary step of  admonishing Speaker Hastert not to bring it to the floor. And he caved.  The resolution never even got a vote.   In 2007, Chairman Tom Lantos, like Chairman Henry Hyde before him,  reported the resolution out of committee, sponsored by Congressmen  Schiff and Radanovich; although it never got out of the committee in  2000, but he wanted it to. That was H. Res. 106. That too never made to  the floor.   Mr. Speaker, that changes today. The Affirming the United States  Record on the Armenian Genocide, H. Res. 296, is a sense of Congress  resolution that commemorates the Armenian genocide through official  recognition and remembrance.   The resolution wisely notes that the United States has officially  recognized the Armenian genocide through the U.S. Government's May 1951  written statement to the International Court of Justice regarding the  Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  through President Ronald Reagan's proclamation, Number 4838, on April  22, 1981, and by H.J. Res. 148, adopted in 1975, and H.J. Res. 247,  adopted in September of 1984.    The resolution also points out that the U.S. played a major role in  the humanitarian relief efforts and, of course, the Near East Relief  agency saved tens of thousands of Armenians and others. As a matter of  fact, the historian, Howard Sachar, noted it ``quite literally kept an  entire nation alive,'' and that is reflected in the resolution.   Yet, today, the Armenian genocide is the only genocide of the 20th  century where survivors, family, and all those who care about this  important issue, have been subjected to the ongoing outrage of a  massive, well-funded, aggressive campaign of genocide denial, openly  sustained and lavishly funded by the State authority, in this case, the  Government of Turkey.   The Turkish Government underwrites a disgraceful disinformation  campaign to confuse the historical  [[Page H8561]]  record. It often employs lobbyists in this town to carry that message  forward.   Mr. Speaker, my 2015 hearing marked the 100th year since the  beginning of the genocide; and I appropriately entitled it: A Century  of Denial: The Armenian Genocide and the Ongoing Quest For Justice.   As Pope Francis said at his Mass marking the 100th year of genocide:  ``Concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding  without bandaging it.''   Mr. Speaker, the facts of the genocide were reported throughout the  world as they were happening, corroborated immediately afterward by  survivors and even some of the perpetrators, and have been amply  documented by the historians, and in one particular book that I have  read, by Ambassador Morgenthau, who was our U.S. Ambassador  contemporaneously, at the time, to the Ottoman Empire.   In 1915, as we know, there were about 2 million Armenians living in  what was then the Ottoman Empire, now Turkey. They were living in the  region that they had inhabited for 2,500 years or more.   By 1923, however, over 90 percent of these Armenians had disappeared.  Most of them, an estimated 1.5 million, were slaughtered. Most of them  were death-marched into the desert, or shot, and many of the women were  raped. The remainder, the remnant was forced into exile.   U.S. Ambassador Morgenthau wrote: ``When the Turkish authorities gave  the orders for these deportations, they were merely giving the death  warrant to a whole race; they understood this well, and, in their  conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to conceal the  fact.''   The Encyclopedia for the Armenian Genocide states: ``During the  march, many Armenians were killed indiscriminately by Ottoman forces,  which left a trail of corpses along the route of the march. To break  the will of the marchers, the killings were performed with swords,  resulting in great bloodshed.'' And as they continued the march, they  were marched into the Syrian desert where they died from starvation.   At the Center for Holocaust, Human Rights & Genocide Education  exhibit at Brookdale Community College, which my good friend and  colleague from New Jersey, Mr. Pallone, knows so well as well, they  have many remembrances of people in our State and elsewhere who were  survivors.   Well, one of those survivors put it this way, and I quote her: ``Life  was a matter of trying to survive. Every morning a cart would come  around and take away the sick and the dead to be dumped into a common  grave. They had taken my brother because he was a little sick. My  crying and weeping were of no avail, especially because I was sick and  petrified of being put on the cart.''   She was one of the lucky ones who survived.   Let me remind my colleagues that the Genocide Convention of 1950,  which the Turkish Government has ratified, makes clear--here is what  the Genocide Convention says, and the Armenian genocide fits this to a  T.   The definition says this: ``Genocide means any of the following acts  committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,  ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such:   Killing members of the group;   Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of that group;   Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to  bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. . . . `'                                time  1430    In the case of the Armenians, it wasn't in part. It was in whole.  They wanted the Armenians eviscerated from the face of the Earth.   Let me just point out to my colleagues, despite Turkish Government  threats--and they do make threats. At my hearing, the Ambassador made  threats in the year 2000. Frank remembers that. It was outrageous.   Well, 28 countries and 49 U.S. States, including my own State of New  Jersey, have passed a law, resolution, or declaration recognizing the  Armenian genocide.   I ask Members to support this resolution. It is bipartisan, and it  needs to be done.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   I thank my colleague and good friend, Mr. Hoyer, for his comments. We  did travel so many times to the Soviet Union, to the Eastern Bloc  countries, and to Turkey. We raised issues methodically, persistently.  But this issue has always been one of those unresolved, festering sores  that if we could get it right--and this House going on record I think  is the beginning of that process. So I thank him for his leadership  over these years, for his friendship, and, above all, for that very  eloquent statement.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank Anna Eshoo for her  leadership throughout many decades on this issue. It was her idea to  bring it up on the floor today. I want to thank her for that. Of course  she had to work within the leadership to get it done, but I thank her  for recommending that.   Mr. Speaker, I want to remind Members that, in 2018, Anna Eshoo and I  wrote the Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act. It was  signed by President Trump into law. That provided two things:  humanitarian relief for the tens of thousands of Christians and Yazidis  fleeing from ISIS; it also provided an accountability piece to collect  for, hopefully, utilization in future court cases against the  perpetrators of these heinous crimes.   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for that work that  we did together and, again, for her leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the cosponsor of  the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that  there are no further speakers other than the chairman, and I would like  to close.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As I mentioned earlier, the Encyclopedia of the Armenian Genocide  states:         During the march many Armenians were killed       indiscriminately by the Ottoman forces, which left a trail of       corpses along the route of the march. To break the will of       the marchers, they used swords, resulting in great bloodshed.       Marchers who survived these attacks faced starvation, as no       provisions whatsoever were made. Many elderly  [[Page H8567]]       and infirm marchers died in this way during the march. This       significantly reduced numbers of marchers who, upon finally       making it into the Syrian desert, were put into concentration       camps and then released into the scorching desert with no       food or water and to a certain death.    Mr. Speaker, despite having ratified the Genocide Convention back in  1950, the Turkish Government has waged an amazingly deceitful campaign  of denial and has done so over the course of decades using a variety of  means to bully, intimidate, and punish Turkish citizens who dare to  acknowledge the genocide committed by the Ottoman Empire beginning in  1915.   Ankara also seeks to intimidate nations. Many nations have refused to  be intimidated and to be bullied: Poland, Germany, the Holy See, Italy,  Russia, France, Holland, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Denmark,  Paraguay, Bolivia, Brazil, Austria, Bulgaria, the European Parliament,  Luxembourg, Sweden, Chile, Argentina, Lithuania, Venezuela, Slovakia,  Canada, Uruguay, Switzerland, Lebanon, Belgium, Greece, and Cyprus all  have come out strongly and acknowledged the Armenian genocide. We need  to do the same today.   Over the years, several U.S. Presidents have acknowledged the cruelty  and the carnage. But it was Ronald Reagan who called it an Armenian  genocide. He said: ``Like the genocide of the Armenians before it, and  the genocide of the Cambodians, which followed it--and like too many  other persecutions of too many other people--the lessons of the  Holocaust must never be forgotten.''   To be sure, Presidents Carter, Bush, Clinton, and Bush, said strong  words. They had strong words to describe it. President Bush called it  the ``forced exile and the annihilation'' of 1.5 million Armenians.   President Obama had promised to recognize the genocide but didn't. A  Los Angeles Times story on April 21, 2015, says it all: ``Armenian  hopes crushed as Obama decides not to use the word `genocide'.''   It does matter, Mr. Speaker. Genocide is a very precise term. It has  real meaning in international law because of the Genocide Convention,  and all Presidents and Members of Congress, I hope, will stand up and  say that word.   Let me remind my colleagues, because it is referenced again in the  resolution, that back in 1984 we passed a joint resolution to designate  April 24, 1985--it didn't pass in the Senate, but it did pass here--and  it said in part that April 24, 1985, is designated as ``National Day of  Remembrance of Man's Inhumanity to Man'' and authorized the President  to observe the day of remembrance for all the victims of genocide, and  especially for the 1.5 million people of Armenian ancestry who were the  victims of genocide perpetrated in Turkey between 1915 and 1923.   So I say to my colleagues who are watching, we have gone on record  before. Let's not be intimidated by Turkey, Erdogan, and others.   I would like to say a special thanks to the tenacious leaders of the  Armenian National Committee of America, the Armenian Assembly and the  Armenian diaspora for persistently encouraging Congress to step up and  pass this kind of resolution. After a century of denial, obfuscation,  and lies by Turkey, it is time to affirm and reiterate the truth of the  Armenian genocide and honor the victims, the survivors, and their  families.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
