 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Valerie Calhoun.   Valerie is the cohost of ``Good Morning Memphis'' on WHBQ-TV, and she  is the recipient of five Emmy awards. Most recently, Valerie was  recognized and honored as an inductee into the Tennessee Journalism  Hall of Fame.   Anyone who knows Valerie Calhoun recognizes how well-deserved this  honor is for her and her family. Valerie is someone who puts passion  and dedication behind everything that she does.   Through Valerie's lifelong commitment to journalism, she has brought  news from around the world into every home in Memphis, west Tennessee,  and the Memphis metropolitan community.   On top of her skills in journalism, Valerie and her family have  become an integral part of the Memphis community through their  volunteer work. You can always find Valerie and her husband, John,  volunteering at Southern Reins, at Beau's school, and hosting numerous  charitable events throughout the community.   Through her hard work and dedication to journalism, Valerie has  become an inspiration to many looking to make their career in  broadcasting and in journalism.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Valerie on her induction into the  Tennessee Hall of Fame.                            ____________________
