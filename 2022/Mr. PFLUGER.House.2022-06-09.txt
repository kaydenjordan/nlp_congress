 Madam Speaker, I rise today as a Texan, a father of  three young girls who go to school, and a defender of constitutional  rights. This is not just about doing something; this is about doing  something that matters.   The horror of the school shootings is an unforgivable tragedy due to  the evil we see in people.   There is room for bipartisan solutions. Unfortunately, Democrats  don't want to make law; they want to make politics.   Republicans offered an alternative, a bill that would fund school  resource officers and mental health counselors, close gaps in security,  and strengthen active shooter preparations, with all the costs being  offset by the unused COVID funds. Unfortunately, this has been blocked  by House Democrats.   There is nothing more important than ensuring our children are safe.  I know this because I take my children to school and drop them off and  pick them up. But in no way are the recent tragedies justification for  an infringement upon the rights of law-abiding Americans.   I won't support legislation that infringes upon those rights being  stripped without due process. This is an emotional issue, but it is our  job to step back and have an adult conversation.                                time  1030
