 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Jim Risch,  Representative  Mike Simpson, and Representative Russ Fulcher, I  congratulate Andy Brunelle on his remarkable career in government  service. Andy is retiring on January 31, 2022, after 27 years with the  U.S. Forest Service.   For more than 20 years, Andy has worked with our offices in his  position as the Capitol City Coordinator for the U.S. Forest Service.  In this position, he has represented both the U.S. Forest Service  Region 1 and Region 4 and the seven National Forests in Idaho as he has  served as a liaison working with State and local government officials,  agency directors, Idaho's Congressional Delegation and interest groups  in Idaho on issues of statewide concern. Given the importance of the  natural resources and species habitat on the more than 20 million acres  of federal forested land in Idaho he has acted on behalf of, Andy has  worked on many challenging issues over the years. This includes working  closely with our delegation concerning improving and extending the  Secure Rural Schools program, a vital resource for Idahoans. We thank  him for his thoughtful, helpful, and pragmatic work for the betterment  of our great State and country.   Andy began working for the U.S. Forest Service in 1995 after serving  as Special Assistant for Natural Resources in the Office of Idaho  Governor Cecil D. Andrus. From 1988 to 1995, he was the Governor's key  staff person on a wide variety of natural resource issues, including  challenging issues such as water quality, federal lands management, and  protection of Snake River salmon. Additionally, he served on the  Northwest Power Planning Council; Boise City Planning and Zoning  Commission; and City of Boise advisory committees. Andy also dedicates  considerable time to serving on boards of nonprofit organizations,  including the Boise WaterShed Exhibits Environmental Education Center;  Idaho Environmental Forum; Ted Trueblood Chapter of Trout Unlimited;  and Harris Ranch Wildlife Mitigation Association.   As we wish Andy well in his well-earned retirement, we express our  deep gratitude for dedicating so much of his time and talents to  enhancing, sustaining, and conserving such an essential part of our  State's treasures. Thank you, Andy, for your decades of dedicated work  and skilled problem-solving on behalf of Idahoans, and congratulations  on your retirement.                            ____________________
