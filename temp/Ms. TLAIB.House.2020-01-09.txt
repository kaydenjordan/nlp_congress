 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of #13DistrictStrong.  This is a district that believes in leading with compassion. They  believe in a full stop to endless violent wars that only result in loss  of life and the destruction of lives forever changed.   For us, Mr. Speaker, it is important to protect our democracy and  promote global peace. We must remove political motives and for-profit  schemes from the decisionmaking process to go to war. If we don't, it  would only lead to more warfare and death.   We cannot allow a process that is tainted, secretive, or encompasses  lies to make that choice. We need a country that easily chooses peace  for generations to come.   I proudly represent a district that believes in the rule of law. That  is why I rise today as their voice in support of a War Powers  Resolution that will give them a say in whether or not our country goes  to war.
