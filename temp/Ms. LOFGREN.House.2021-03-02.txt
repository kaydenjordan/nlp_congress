 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 179, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1) to expand Americans' access to the ballot box,  reduce the influence of big money in politics, strengthen ethics rules  for public servants, and implement other anti-corruption measures for  the purpose of fortifying our democracy, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1 into the Record.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1, the For the  People Act of 2021. Today, we can deliver this to the American people.  We can deliver the gold standard of reforms to protect the right of  Americans to vote. We can take a huge step to fulfill that promise in  our Constitution of a more perfect Union.   More voters cast a ballot in the 2020 election than in history, in an  election that has been called the most secure in American history by  election security experts.   The last election, conducted during a once-in-a-generation pandemic,  saw changes that made it easier for many Americans to vote, with  reforms like absentee voting and early voting. It also put into stark  focus what many of us already knew: deep inequities persist in our  democratic system.   Now comes the backlash to the increase in voter participation. That  record turnout, with no credible instances of election irregularity,  stimulated hundreds of bills in State legislatures to make it harder  for Americans to vote in the future.   We should protect access to the ballot, not restrict it. H.R. 1 gives  voters choices for how to cast their ballot. They want and need that.   The bill has a minimum of 15 days of early voting, minimum standards  for the number and location of ballot drop boxes, and a national  standard for no-excuse absentee voting. It improves access for voters  with disabilities, addresses challenges faced by Native American voters  living on Tribal lands, and improves access for uniformed and overseas  voters.   H.R. 1 ends the practice of disenfranchising Americans with a prior  felony conviction who are no longer incarcerated. It unrigs the drawing  of congressional district lines by requiring independent redistricting  commissions, removing politics from the process and creating fairer  maps.   H.R. 1 begins to remove the advantages of dark money and secret  donors and lets our neighbors and communities regain their voice to  fully participate in our political system.   H.R. 1 will amplify the voices of small donors with an alternative,  voluntary matching system for financing campaigns by empowering small- dollar contributors, without any taxpayer funds.   The bill will save money and bolster the integrity of election  administration. It makes improvements to our election security and  requires States to use individual, durable, voter-verified paper  ballots, a simple safeguard from cybersecurity threats that ensures an  auditable paper trail.   H.R. 1 will also strengthen congressional and executive branch  ethical standards.   Democracy is resilient, but the falsehoods spread in the lead-up to  and following the 2020 election, as well as the shocking events right  here on January 6, showed us all that democracy requires us to defend  it.   I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 1 and ensure all Americans  have an equal voice in our democracy.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I would just note for the record that I  am not worried about the administrators in Georgia. I am worried about  the legislature in Georgia that just passed restrictions cutting Sunday  early voting and absentee voting and restricting the use of drop boxes  to suppress the vote.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs.  McBath).    Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Bourdeaux), a new member of our House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Levin).    Madam Speaker, I am honored to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Craig).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining?    Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jones), who is a new Member from New  York and an expert in election law.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez). It is an honor to recognize her as a  member of the Committee on House Administration and one of the newest  Members in the House, but an accomplished attorney.    Madam Speaker, it is interesting to listen to some of  the comments that are made here this morning. We have talked a lot  about Article I, Section 4, that says that the Congress may at any time  regulate these elections. But what is the basis for that? It is really  Article IV, Section 4, which says, ``The United States shall guarantee  to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.''   If a majority of voters vote and their votes are not powerful, they  are not counted. Or if Americans are prohibited from voting, even  though they should be able to cast their vote, that is not a Republican  form of government. So what we are doing here is the most important  thing we could do, which is to preserve our American democracy.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), chairman of the Subcommittee on the  Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Madam Speaker, I just received word that the legendary  civil rights leader Vernon Jordan has passed. In addition to our  beloved John Lewis, I feel we are considering this bill in his memory  and also to honor those who came before us who worked so hard to  preserve our American democracy.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a number of  letters, the first from more than 150 groups urging support for the For  the People Act, including the American Friends Service Committee, the  Center for Disability Rights, Common Cause, Franciscan Action Network,  the League of Conservation Voters, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social  Justice and the Sierra Club.                                           Declaration for American                                                       Democracy,                                                   February 5, 2021.      Re More than one hundred and fifty Groups urge support for           the For the People Act (H.R. 1/S. 1).         Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the below       organizations representing tens of millions of Americans, we       write in strong support of H.R. 1/S. 1, the For the People       Act. This transformational democracy reform package would       help return power to everyday American families and amplify       the voices of communities that have historically been       marginalized in our democracy.        For far too long, special interests, wealthy donors, and       vote suppressors have dominated our politics and attempted to       silence the voices of everyday Americans, especially in Black       and Brown communities. The For the People Act would help       shift power away from bad actors and transfer it to ``we the       people.''        The 2020 election has underscored the urgent need for       transformational democracy reform. Across the nation,       Americans experienced unprecedented voter suppression,       historic levels of dark money spent to drown out the voices       of everyday Americans, and rampant ethical abuses. One bill,       the For the People Act, addresses many of these problems.       Therefore, we are urging Congress to make this pro-voter,       anti-corruption legislation a first priority in the 117th       Congress.        Common-sense reforms in the For the People Act, most of       which are deeply popular across the political spectrum and       have passed in many states and localities, aim to accomplish       three overarching goals: (1) protecting and strengthening the       sacred right to vote, (2) ending the dominance of big money       in politics, and (3) implementing anti-corruption, pro-ethics       measures to clean up government.        Many of the critical issues that our nation faces--ensuring       quality, affordable health care, creating good paying jobs,       combating climate change, and achieving racial justice, to       name just a few--cannot be fully solved until we fix our       broken democracy. Wealthy special interests have too strong       of a grip on the status quo, and we need to first unlock this       stranglehold that they have on our political system.        We therefore urge you to support and vote for H.R. 1/S. 1,       the For the People Act, early in the 117th Congress to help       put the people back in charge of our democracy.

I also include letters from the  Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and a letter from  attorneys general around the United States: the attorneys general of  Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia,  Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New  Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,  Vermont, Virginia, and Washington. The attorneys general of all of  these States have written in support of H.R. 1.                                          The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                                   January 19, 2021.                   Support H.R. 1, the For the People Act         Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 220       national organizations committed to promoting and protecting       the civil and human rights of all persons in the United       States, and the 82 undersigned organizations, we write in       strong support of H.R. 1, the For the People Act. We are       pleased that the incoming Senate leadership has today       announced it intends to introduce this critical bill as S. 1.        The For the People Act represents a transformative vision       for American democracy. It would create a democracy that       welcomes every eligible voter's chance to participate in       civic life and a democracy that demands integrity, fairness,       and transparency in our nation's elections. For far too long,       voter suppression has been a shameful reality in our       country--undercutting the power and representation of African       Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders,       Native Americans, people with disabilities, Arab Americans,       and other communities historically excluded from our       political process. The ability to meaningfully participate in       our democracy is a racial justice issue. It is a civil rights       issue. And the need for legislative action is urgent. The       U.S. House of Representatives passed the For the People Act       in March 20 I 9, and we are pleased that Speaker Pelosi has       committed to making this bill a top priority in the new       Congress.        The recent and deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol by far-      right extremists attempting to overturn the free, fair, and       secure 2020 presidential election was a catastrophic reminder       of the fragility of our democracy. This violent insurrection       did not happen in a vacuum. It was paired with numerous       hurdles that voters faced during the pandemic-plagued 2020       election cycle and exacerbated by the relentless efforts by       President Trump to undermine election integrity, impose       barriers to the ballot box, and discount the votes of       communities of color. These experiences reinforce the urgent       need to repair our democratic system. The historic voter       turnout in the November election despite these challenges       demonstrated the determination and resilience of the American       people.        Not every flaw in our democracy can be easily fixed, but       there are strong and ready solutions to many of the most       significant voting rights problems. H.R. 1 would enhance and       ensure democracy in America by establishing many critical       reforms in federal elections, including:        Ensuring early voting and polling place notice: H.R. 1       would require at least 15 consecutive days of in-person early       voting including weekends, for a minimum of 10 hours each       day, and ensure that early voting polling places are       accessible by public transportation. The bill would also       require that voters be given a minimum of seven days' notice       if their polling place location is changed.        Safeguarding the right to vote by mail: Sixteen states       require voters to provide an excuse as to why they are unable       to vote in person on election day in order to receive an       absentee ballot. This practice is designed to impede the vote       and was particularly galling during the COVID-19 pandemic.       H.R. I would eliminate such restrictions on the right to vote       by mail. The bill would require the prepayment of postage by       the government on return envelopes for absentee ballots or       voter registration forms.        Reforming voter registration: Nearly 20 percent of people       who are eligible but do not vote cite registration hurdles as       the main reason for not voting. H.R. 1 would modernize       America's voter registration system and improve access to the       ballot box by requiring states to establish automatic voter       registration (``AVR''), same day registration (``SDR''), and       online voter registration for voters across the country, and       by ensuring that all voter registration systems are inclusive       and accessible for people with disabilities. A YR alone could       add an estimated 50 million people to the voter rolls, and       SDR increases voter turnout by roughly 10 percent.        Ensuring reasonable wait times to vote: Voters in some       states last year were forced to stand in line for more than       10 hours to vote, and recent studies have shown that such       barriers occur more frequently in communities of color. H.R.       I would require states to ensure that voters do not have to       wait longer than 30 minutes to cast their ballot at a polling       place.        Permitting voting without a photo ID: Between 2010 and       2020, 16 states enacted strict voter identification laws.       H.R. I requires states to allow registered voters in states       with a photo ID requirement to sign a sworn affidavit to vote       if they lack a photo ID.        Requiring access to drop boxes: During the 2020 election       cycle, some states politicized and limited the use of drop       boxes. H.R. 1 would require states to provide secure drop       boxes as an option for voters casting absentee ballots.  [[Page H982]]         Restoring voting rights for formerly incarcerated people:       H.R. I would restore voting rights for people with felony       convictions who have finished their sentence, a necessary       repudiation of our nation's discriminatory and racially       violent past. This would re-enfranchise approximately 4.7       million voters nationwide. Reforming felony       disenfranchisement has strong bipartisan support; in 2018, 65       percent of Florida voters cast their ballots to restore the       right to vote for over 1.4 million people.        Combating voter purging: H.R. 1 would overturn the Supreme       Court's troubling 2018 decision in Husted v. A. Philip       Randolph Institute that allowed Ohio to conduct massive       purges from its voter rolls based on non-voting in past       elections. Such practices disproportionately target and       remove traditionally marginalized people from registration       rolls. Voting should not be a ``use it or lose it'' right.        Prohibiting deceptive practices and voter intimidation:       H.R. 1 would ban the distribution of false information about       elections to hinder or discourage voting. This provision is       particularly important in an era in which Facebook, Twitter,       and other digital platforms have been readily manipulated to       spread misinformation about elections and voting rights to       vulnerable communities. The bill would also increase the       criminal penalties for intimidating a voter for the purpose       of interfering with their right to vote or causing them to       vote for or against a candidate.        Reforming redistricting: H.R. 1 would be a milestone in the       battle against the extreme partisan gerrymandering our       country has witnessed in recent years, by requiring states to       draw congressional districts using independent redistricting       commissions that are bipartisan and reflect the demographic       diversity of the region. It would establish fair       redistricting criteria and safeguard voting rights for       communities of color.        Modernizing election administration: H.R. 1 would       reauthorize the Election Assistance Commission--an       independent, bipartisan commission that plays a vital role in       ensuring the reliability and security of voting equipment       used in our nation's elections. It would also promote       election reliability and security by requiring voter-verified       permanent paper ballots and enhanced poll worker recruitment       and training. And H.R. 1 would prohibit state election       administrators from taking an active part in a political       campaign over which they have supervisory authority.        Committing to restoring the Voting Rights Act (``VRA''):       H.R. 1 contains a commitment to restoring the landmark VRA       and updating its preclearance provision, which is crucial to       prevent racial discrimination in the voting process. VRA       restoration is being pursued on a separate legislative track       that will involve investigatory and evidentiary hearings,       thus enabling Congress to update the preclearance coverage       formula and develop a full record on the continuing problem       of racial discrimination in voting. In 2006, the VRA was       reauthorized on a unanimous vote in the Senate and a near-      unanimous vote in the House. We need the same type of broad       and bipartisan support for restoring the VRA today.        H.R. 1 would also make significant advances in the areas of       campaign finance and ethics reform. It would correct the       rampant corruption flowing from the corrosive power of money       in our elections. It would replace the current campaign       finance system that empowers the super-rich and big       corporations with one that relies on small donors and public       matching funds. It would end secret election spending and       force disclosure of all election-related spending. And it       would call for a constitutional amendment to overturn the       disturbing Citizens United decision that made it       impossible to restrict outside spending by corporations or       billionaires. In addition, H.R. 1 addresses our government       ethics crisis by, among other things, requiring the       development of a code of conduct for Supreme Court       Justices to enhance accountability on ethics and recusal       issues; overhauling the Office of Government Ethics to       strengthen federal ethics oversight; establishing more       robust conflict of interest requirements for government       officials; prohibiting members of Congress from using       taxpayer dollars to settle allegations of employment       discrimination; and requiring presidents to disclose their       tax returns.        The For the People Act provides a North Star for the       democracy reform agenda. It is a bold, comprehensive reform       package that offers solutions to a broken democracy.       Repairing and modernizing our voting system goes hand in hand       with reforms that address the rampant corruption flowing from       the corrosive power of money in our elections, and reforms       that address the myriad ethical problems that plague all       three branches of the federal government. The reforms in the       For the People Act are necessary to advance racial justice       and ensure that our government works for all people, not just       a powerful few.        Congress must also pass two other essential racial justice       and democracy reform bills: the John Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act--which would restore a critical provision of       the Voting Rights Act gutted by the Supreme Court's infamous       2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision--and the Washington,       D.C. Admission Act, which would grant long overdue statehood       status to the nation's capital.        Shortly before his death last year, Representative Lewis       remarked: ``In our country, the right to vote is precious--      almost sacred. Countless people marched and protested for       this right. Some gave a little blood, and far too many lost       their lives. Around the globe, generations of U.S. officials       boasted of this legacy and progress. Today, the world is       horrified in watching Americans--especially people of color--      once again stand in immovable lines and experience       undeniable, targeted, systematic barriers to democracy . . .       . Time is of the essence to preserve the integrity and       promises of our democracy.''        Congress and the Biden-Harris administration must heed this       call. As the 2020 election cycle and the recent violent       assault on the U.S. Capitol made abundantly clear, our       democracy is vulnerable and is in dire need of protection. We       must enact transformational change to build a democracy that       works for everyone. The civil and human rights coalition is       strongly committed to expanding the franchise and fixing our       democracy, and we urge both chambers of Congress to pass the       For the People Act as early as possible in the 117th       Congress.

Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, Leader McConnell, and       Leader McCarthy: We, the undersigned Attorneys General of       Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of       Columbia, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan,       Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon,       Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington       (collectively the ``States''), write to express our support       for H.R. 1/S. 1, the For the People Act of 2021 (the       ``Act''). The Act would strengthen our democracy by making it       easier to vote, reducing the pernicious influence of dark       money in elections, and codifying ethical standards for our       public servants.        America faces a stark choice--whether to pursue the reforms       necessary to make this country a functional multiracial       democracy, or to accept the systemic and accelerating       disenfranchisement of Black and other minority voters.       According to a Brennan Center report, in 2021 legislative       sessions to date, at least 165 bills in 33 states have been  [[Page H983]]       introduced to restrict voting access--four times the number       of similar bills introduced last year. This new push for       voter suppression follows the 2020 election, where a record       number of Americans exercised their right to vote. Offering       Americans new and convenient methods of voting, including       expanded absentee and mail-in voting options, had the dual       benefits of protecting the public health during the COVID-19       pandemic and enabling greater turnout.        Despite confirmation by former Attorney General Barr and       others that there was no evidence of widespread fraud or       irregularity in the 2020 election, state legislators have       seized upon former President Trump's baseless voter-fraud       allegations to curtail mail-in voting options, impose       stringent voter ID requirements, limit voter registration       opportunities, and allow even more aggressive purging of       voter rolls. In the wake of a safe and secure election, which       enabled greater levels of voter participation than in over a       century, we should be building on this progress, not       dismantling it.        The Act includes several measures that would neutralize       these cynical efforts at voter suppression by improving       access to the ballot. Voters in many states face the       frustrations of antiquated, error-ridden voter registration       systems; the Act would modernize voter registration by       requiring states to implement online registration, establish       automatic voter registration, and prohibit unnecessary purges       of the voting rolls. The Act also addresses discriminatory       voter identification laws by requiring states to permit       voters in federal elections to submit a sworn statement to       meet ID requirements. Early voting provisions contained in       the Act would expand access to federal elections by providing       for at least 15 days of early voting at accessible locations       and making available the option to vote by mail to anyone       eligible to cast a vote in an election for federal office.       Although the States' election laws vary, we have broad       collective experience with the implementation of similar       voting-access reforms and do not anticipate that the Act's       mandates would prove overly burdensome to implement.        Critically, the Act would also confront the problem of       partisan gerrymandering by putting redistricting in the hands       of independent commissions. The threat of severe       gerrymandering in the post-2020 redistricting process is       especially acute given the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby       County v. Holder, which effectively eliminated the       preclearance protections contained in Section 5 of the Voting       Rights Act (``VRA''). Without the preclearance restraints of       the VRA and the corresponding oversight from the Department       of Justice, there is a substantial risk that states with a       history of racial discrimination will seek to minimize the       political power of minority voters by drawing aggressive       congressional district lines. By divesting redistricting       power from politicians who manipulate the process to       consolidate power, the Act will ensure that voters choose       their representatives, not the other way around.        As the chief law enforcement officers of our respective       states, we are well-acquainted with schemes to discourage,       impede, and prevent our citizens from voting. In the lead up       to November's election, disinformation designed to depress       voter turnout was endemic, spread by bad actors through       social media, robocalls, and texts. Thankfully, the fear of       widespread, aimed intimidation at polling places did not       materialize last year. That possibility, however, looms in       future elections--especially once election day turnout is no       longer diminished due to an ongoing pandemic. By prohibiting       the knowing dissemination of materially false information       about elections and stiffening penalties for voter       intimidation, the Act will provide law enforcement officials       with the tools needed to thwart and punish those who attempt       to interfere with the exercise of the fundamental right to       vote.        The Act also contains important changes to campaign finance       law designed to address the concerning rise of dark money in       federal elections. Since the Supreme Court's ruling in       Citizens United v. FEC, dark money has flooded political       campaigns at unprecedented levels. As a result,       billionaires, corporations, and special interest groups--      groups that already had outsized voices in our political       process--now wield even more power, often exercising that       power anonymously through opaque ``non-profits'' that are       not required to disclose their donors. The Act would close       dark-money loopholes by requiring disclosure when wealthy       donors give $10,000 or more to a group that spends money       on elections. As the Supreme Court has explained,       ``transparency enables the electorate to make informed       decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and       messages.'' Bringing sunlight to political contributions       is a crucial step to restoring faith in government.        Last but certainly not least, the Act seeks to close a       number of legal loopholes--revealed in striking and       disturbing ways during former President Trump's term in       office--that allow the President to evade accountability for       personally profiting from the Office. In particular, the Act       heightens disclosure requirements applicable to the       president, requires the holder of the Office of the President       to divest from financial interests that pose a conflict of       interest, and ensures accountability by providing the Office       of Government Ethics with enhanced enforcement powers.       Surprising gaps in the ethics laws affecting non-presidential       public servants would also be closed. For instance, the Act       would prohibit members of Congress from serving on the board       of directors of for-profit entities during their terms in       office and, for the first time, require the Judicial       Conference to develop a code of ethics applicable to Supreme       Court Justices. Collectively, the ethics reforms contained in       the Act would ensure that our public servants are working on       behalf of America's best interests, not just their own.        American democracy needs repairing. The problems we face--      outdated election infrastructure, unjustified barriers to       voting, extreme gerrymandering, the polluting influence of       dark money, and insufficient ethical constraints-urgently       need addressing. We believe that the Act represents an       important step toward addressing these problems and urge its       swift passage.            Sincerely,        Brian E. Frosh, Maryland Attorney General; Philip J.       Weiser, Colorado Attorney General; Karl Racine, District of       Columbia Attorney General; Tom Miller, Iowa Attorney General;       Maura Healey, Massachusetts Attorney General; Keith Ellison,       Minnesota Attorney General; Gurbir Grewal, New Jersey       Attorney General; Letitia James, New York Attorney General;       Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania Attorney General.

Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), who is the author of H.R. 1.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining on  each side?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), who is a member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, there have been a number of statements made on the  floor today that were hair-on-fire inaccurate, and 5 minutes would not  be enough to actually correct the mistakes and the incorrect comments  that have been made, but let me just address a couple of them.   I keep hearing ``speech czar.'' I must confess, when I first heard  that, I thought, what the heck are they talking about? Then I looked at  the rhetoric, and it appears that there is an objection to section 603  of the bill, which allows the chair of the FEC and other commissioners  to take certain actions.   Now, it has nothing to do with being a speech czar. There is no  connection with that. To suggest that the FEC doing its job is somehow  becoming a speech czar is just not correct.   I have heard a lot of comments about the voucher program. People have  objected to our tax dollars being spent. Well, here is the good news:  There are no tax dollars being spent in this program. It is a pilot  project that allows for a matching system to see whether small donors  can actually empower more diversity and empower the voices of ordinary  Americans as compared to the big interests.                                time  1100    It is not funded by taxpayer funds, and it is not funded from a  source that  [[Page H992]]  could be used for anything else in the government. It is an additional  penalty to corporations that have done wrong and are fined. There will  be an additional fine to fund this pilot project.   I have heard that somehow H.R. 1 would allow the IRS to go after  conservative groups. That is not true. Section 4501 simply repeals the  prohibition that prevents the IRS from examining the meaning of social  welfare in the context of 501(c)(4) organizations. That is about any  group that misuses the Tax Code for politics, pretending to be a social  welfare group, whatever their ideology. It never made sense to preclude  the IRS from doing this job. That would be like prohibiting the FEC  from administering the Federal elections code.   Voter ID: Members act as if that is just a piece of cake. Well, 11  percent of eligible voters in the United States don't have an ID, and  they can't get it because they don't have the money to pay for the  underlying documents that would be necessary to get that ID. And those  11 percent are disproportionately senior citizens, young people, people  with disabilities, low-income voters. So what is the alternative? They  sign under penalty of perjury. They can be prosecuted for a felony if  they are lying.   Ballot harvesting: There is no such thing as harvesting ballots. It  is about getting someone you trust to turn in your ballot for you if  you can't do it yourself. We have had that in California for many  years. I will note that Republican candidates used that extensively in  California this year. There was no evidence of fraud when they did it,  and there was no evidence of fraud when Democrats did it. You give your  ballot to your neighbor, if you wish. The neighbor has to sign, and  they turn it in for you. That is not fraud, and it is not a problem.   Finally, I just want to address the issue of so-called Federal  overreach. The Constitution of the United States, Article I, Section 4  says this: ``The times, places, and manner of holding elections for  Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the  legislature thereof,'' but here is the important next section, ``but  the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations.''  And that is what we are doing in H.R. 1.   I think it is interesting that earlier this year the Republican Study  Committee endorsed the Save Democracy Act. That legislation would  establish national standards for prohibiting automatic voter  registration, to make it hard to cast a ballot, to impose restrictive  rules on vote tabulation. So, I guess that overreach only matters to my  colleagues if it empowers voters, not if it restricts voters.   For too long, this Chamber has been silent, and this silence has  harmed the people. We need to stop that silence and vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 1.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 179, I offer  amendments en bloc.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this bloc of amendments provides important additions  to H.R. 1 that strengthen the bill and enhance voter access.   This bloc includes, for example, an amendment from the gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania that requires States to ensure that there are polling  places during the early voting period on college campuses. This will  help young people to engage in our elections and will likely help boost  youth turnout.   It also includes an amendment from the gentlewoman from North  Carolina that will help ensure the timely delivery of absentee ballots  by the Postal Service. It calls for the Postal Service to perform same- day processing of ballots when they are received at a postal facility.   Also included is an amendment from the gentlewoman from Georgia that  supports access to the franchise. It implements voter protections by  ensuring that States cannot prohibit access to voting materials  provided by third parties, such as get-out-the-vote organizations.   There is also an amendment from the gentleman from Pennsylvania that  allows for voter education information at naturalization ceremonies for  newly sworn-in citizens. That will help educate and inform new citizens  about the opportunities to register to vote.   Finally, there is an amendment from the gentlewoman from Texas that  exempts cybersecurity assistance, including assistance in responding to  threats or harassment online, from limits on coordinated political  party expenditures.   Madam Speaker, I support these amendments. I urge their adoption, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Auchincloss), a new member of the House who has two  amendments encompassed in this en bloc amendment.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms. Bush), a new Member of Congress and a  member of the House Judiciary Committee, who I serve with.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just a few points. As I am sure the gentleman from Illinois knows, we  had a markup last year on H.R. 1, and one of the issues raised was the  propriety of having taxpayer dollars fund the pilot program, the  matching program.   And we agreed--we agreed with that observation. So we changed it. We  made an amendment to address that concern.   It is not an additional--an existing fund. If a corporation does  wrong and is assessed a fine, there is an additional fine hit on that  bad-doing corporation that would fund the pilot project. And if there  aren't enough bad-doers to actually fully fund the program, the program  is scaled back. There is no taxpayer money in this program.   These amendments in this bill address things that are important. And  let me just reference the letter from the attorneys general that I  included in the Record earlier. We are talking about what is happening  right now, and this is what they state:   ``. . . State legislators have seized upon former President Trump's  baseless voter fraud allegations to curtail mail-in voting options,  impose stringent voter ID requirements, limit voter registration  opportunities, and allow even more aggressive purging of voter rolls.  In the wake of a safe and secure election, which enabled greater levels  of voter participation than in over a century, we should be building on  this progress, not dismantling it.''   And that is what this act would do. They go on to say:   ``The act includes several measures that would neutralize these  cynical efforts at voter suppression. . . .''   Madam Speaker, I think we should recognize that what is going on in  State legislatures around the United States right now is, in fact, what  the attorneys general have said, a cynical effort to suppress the vote,  because we have the greatest voter turnout in American history with the  new tools that the pandemic actually led us to: a broader opportunity  to cast your vote by absentee, a broader opportunity to vote early.   We had great turnout. And I don't know in the end which party will  benefit when more Americans vote.   Could it be the Republicans? Could it be the Democrats?   I don't know. But I do know this: Who will win is America. America  wins when all Americans have a chance to cast their vote.   So, once again, I would like to thank the attorneys general of  Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine,  Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, and Washington for standing  up for the rule of law, for pointing out that H.R. 1 will lead to clean  elections, and that American democracy needs repairing, and this bill  will repair it.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the en bloc amendments, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 179, I rise  to offer amendments en bloc No. 2.    Madam Speaker, my Republican colleagues are the authors  of all of the amendments included in this en bloc, and I think these  amendments represent a number of thoughtful amendments that will  improve the bill.   Included is an amendment that exempts any State that does not utilize  voter registration on the enactment date of this act and continuously  thereafter from complying with voter registration requirements in the  act.   This is reasonable, as North Dakota does not have voter registration.  As the State does not require voter registration, it is reasonable not  to force them to begin doing so now.   There is also an amendment in this en bloc that requires a report to  Congress on the impact of widespread mail-in voting on the suffrage of  Active Duty military servicemembers, how quickly their votes are  counted and whether the high volumes of mail-in votes makes it harder  for those individuals to vote.   Republicans and Democrats alike, can agree that insights into how to  better secure our election infrastructure are needed to protect our  democracy.   Included in this en bloc is an amendment to require a report to  Congress on the data collection practices; the required necessary  security resources; and the impact of a potential data breach of local,  State, or Federal online voter registration systems.   Additionally, there is an amendment directing the Election Assistance  Commission to study the use of blockchain technology to enhance  election security. I hope that study will include the use of  electricity in the creation of blockchain technology.                                time  1130    Much of H.R. 1's provisions are aimed at restoring the American  public's faith in the government by improving ethics standards imposed  on public officials.   An amendment included in this en bloc would require ethics waivers  granted by Congress to the executive branch officials to be disclosed,  and require members of the Presidential transition team to disclose  nongovernmental positions they have held in the year prior to starting  their service on the transition team.   I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for putting  forward these amendments, and I believe it will gather bipartisan  support.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, as I said in my opening remarks, we  believe these amendments are reasonable ones. I support them, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri  (Ms. Bush) for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I would just like to note that the underlying bill  provides that once individuals are re-enfranchised, they may vote. And  H.R. 1 also ends the practice of so-called prison gerrymandering, where  persons who are incarcerated are counted where they are incarcerated  not in their home districts, even though they cannot vote there.   Now, I know different people have different viewpoints on this  amendment. The committee Democrats have no official position, but  speaking just personally, I feel there is merit to this amendment. If  you are going to count the individuals for redistricting purposes in  their prisons, then I think they have to be allowed to vote there, or  else that entire scheme is completely wrong.   Madam Speaker, further, it occurs to me that those who oppose it  think that denying a vote would somehow be a deterrent to criminal  conduct. In fact,  [[Page H1000]]  empowering people to be full citizens encourages rehabilitation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment would strike subtitle C of title III, the  election security title in H.R. 1, which requires the President to  produce a national strategy for protecting U.S. democratic  institutions. It also creates a national commission to protect United  States democratic institutions to counter threats.   In light of the evidence of foreign interference in the 2016, 2018,  and 2020 Federal elections, the Federal Government needs a coordinated  approach to protect and secure our democracy. While our election  infrastructure officials have said that the 2020 election was the most  secure in history, we know it is not because our foreign adversaries  are no longer attempting to interfere in our elections. They will  continue their efforts, and we must take steps to ensure our elections  continue to be secure.   This provision in H.R. 1 is important to that endeavor. The national  strategy will provide guidance on how to protect against cyberattacks,  influence operations, disinformation campaigns, and other activities  that could undermine the security and integrity of United States  democratic institutions.   The purpose of the national commission to protect the United States  democratic institutions is to counter efforts to undermine democratic  institutions within the United States. The national strategy and  commission will be important to protecting the integrity of our  elections and preventing foreign interference in our democracy.   Mr. Speaker, we must stay vigilant. Our enemies are not resting, and  neither are we. This provision is an important part of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment  from the gentleman from Illinois. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will just note that I oppose this  amendment. I will wait until the next amendment to go into the  underlying bill. I think much of what has been said this morning and  this afternoon is simply incorrect.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The  SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 8,  the yeas and nays are ordered.  [[Page H1004]]    Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  are postponed.        Amendments En Bloc No. 3 Offered by Ms. Lofgren of California     Pursuant to House Resolution 179, I rise to offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bloc of amendments provides important additions to  the bill.   Among the amendments in the bloc is an amendment from the gentleman  from Arizona that promotes language accessibility for voting and  ensures that notices at polling locations take into consideration  factors including the languages spoken in the jurisdiction.   An amendment from the gentleman from Arizona and the gentlewoman from  New Mexico improves voting access for individuals with disabilities in  the Four Corners region of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah by  making technical fixes to the Protection and Advocacy for Voting Access  provisions.   An amendment from the gentlemen from Rhode Island and Wisconsin  implements a recommendation of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission to  ensure the security of our elections and resilience of our democracy by  creating the position of a senior cyber policy adviser at the Election  Assistance Commission.   An amendment from the gentlewomen from Virginia and Florida prohibits  taxpayer funds from being added into the freedom from influence fund.   During the 2020 election, Postmaster General DeJoy implemented sudden  operational changes that disrupted timely mail services and the  delivery of absentee ballots. An amendment in this bloc from the  gentlewoman from Michigan ensures that can never happen again by  prohibiting operational changes at the Postal Service for 120 days  before a Federal election.   This bloc of amendments also includes an amendment from the gentleman  and gentlewoman from Minnesota that requires State election officials  to undertake accessible public education campaigns to inform voters of  any changes to election processes made in response to public  emergencies.                                time  1345    Finally, it includes four amendments from the gentlewoman from the  Virgin Islands. One of these amendments applies Federal voter  protection laws to the territories, including protection against voter  intimidation, interference, and voting by aliens in Federal elections  in the territory; that would be noncitizens.   Another of these amendments permits each of the territories to  provide and furnish statues in Statuary Hall. That is an important  amendment that allows each of the territories representation among the  statues in the Halls of Congress. These amendments represent long,  overdue recognition of important contributions of the territories.   Mr. Speaker, I support these amendments, and I urge their adoption,  and I reserve the balance of my time,    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my colleague in the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Manning).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Phillips).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that this amendment is worth  supporting. It makes improvements to the underlying bill. I was really  stunned to hear a comparison between Members of Congress going through  metal detectors--because some Members have, in violation of the rules,  carried weapons on to the House floor--and voters having to wait 8  hours to get to the polling booth, which actually happened last  November.   It is important that American voters have access to the polls to cast  their vote and to have that lawfully cast vote counted as cast. That is  what this is about.   I listened to my colleague and my friend, Mr. Davis, complain about  the constitutional basis for H.R. 1. But he has also introduced bills  like H.R. 6882, H.R. 3412, and H.R. 7905, which would all require  States to do certain things with respect to how they conduct elections.   I might disagree with the policies in those bills, but they all cite  Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution as the basis for their  legitimacy. So to say that we cannot improve the elections in America  under Article I, Section 4 simply is not correct.   So we will have more debate as these proceedings on H.R. 1 conclude,  but I will close with this: Please do support the en bloc amendments.  It improves the bill, and we will, hopefully, be passing H.R. 1 to make  America an even greater place in the near future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
