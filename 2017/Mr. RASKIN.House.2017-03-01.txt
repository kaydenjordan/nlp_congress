 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would protect all rules  relating to the enforcement of the Clean Air Act, which are in danger  now under H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act, which seeks to authorize a brand new  $30 million Presidential commission of unelected and unaccountable  bureaucrats to wipe out agency rules across the whole field of  government.   Mr. Chairman, last night in this Chamber, the President of the United  States came and articulated policy areas where he said his  administration ``wants to work with Members of both parties.'' One of  these was to promote clean air and clean water. I was happy to hear it  because earlier in the day he signed an executive order to clear the  way for weakening safe drinking water standards through redefinition of  which small bodies of water are covered under the Clean Water Act.   Now, the amendment I propose provides a chance for all of us to start  fresh in demonstrating our seriousness about this new bipartisan  commitment to protect the water we drink and the air that we breathe.   The SCRUB Act proposes to create a commission to do what Federal  agencies and commissions already do, which is to review and update  their rules. That is why a lot of us are deeply skeptical about  spending $30 million to create a new roving commission to hack away at  rules protecting the public interest.   This commission would be made up of five members appointed directly  by the President at his discretion and four members by the President  from congressional nomination, too, from each party.   The advocates for this legislation say it is not about dismantling  the rules that protect the water that our children drink or the air  that our children and our grandparents breathe or the food that all of  us eat. It is just about getting rid of unnecessary and obsolete and  profligate regulations. And I take them at their word that that is what  it is about.                                time  1330    So let's all agree that the new supercommission that you seek to  establish under the SCRUB Act will not touch, in any way, the rules  adopted under the Clean Air Act. If that is not the purpose of this  legislation, to undermine the Clean Air Act regime, as its advocates  repeatedly insist, then there should be no problem having us formalize  this commitment on a bipartisan basis.   Right now, the SCRUB Act does not explicitly protect clean air--or  clean water, for that matter--from the prospects of a roving  bureaucratic attack. Thus, it exposes all of us to unnecessary harm,  threatening to scrub away the rules that protect the air we breathe.   What will that mean for 17 million Americans with asthma, for the  millions of people with lung cancer and other respiratory diseases, for  more than 30,000 people struggling with cystic fibrosis? All of these  people are potentially in danger simply because of an overblown  ideological attack on regulations, which are just the rules that we  adopt as a constitutional democracy to protect ourselves from harm.   In answer to objections about the bill, the majority says that  Congress will still have its say; but if you read it carefully, you see  that congressional authority has actually been placed in a  straitjacket. The bill requires an up-or-down vote on the commission's  recommendations as a complete omnibus package rather than voting on  each proposal individually.   So if you agreed with loosening some regulations, for example, in the  Title X Family Planning program, which has a lot of rules, but you  don't want to eviscerate the regulatory infrastructure under the Clean  Air Act or the Clean Water Act, you would have to vote on the entire  package at once. This makes Congress into an embarrassing rubber stamp  for a nine-person body effectively controlled by the executive branch.   Dear colleagues, let's not play games with the health and safety of  our constituents. If this bill passes as is, rules that govern the very  air we breathe would be subject to the SCRUB Act's unelected,  unaccountable, and unbounded practitioners. My amendment closes a  gaping and dangerous hole in the legislation. I ask my colleagues to  think about public health and safety first, and not the magical  thinking and scientifically ungrounded cost-benefit analysis promised  by the SCRUB Act.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to my  colleague from Maryland (Mr. Cummings).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am, indeed.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to the committee. If  adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as  amended.   The purpose of this amendment is simply to carve out from the  provisions of the legislation any rules that we have adopted in order  to prevent conflicts of interest and in order to promote financial  transparency and disclosure by executive branch employees.   Mr. Speaker, since I became a Member of the House in January and  joined the Judiciary Committee, we have been subjected to an onslaught  of bills seeking to free corporate polluters, lead paint and asbestos  manufacturers, and other abusers of the rights of consumers and  citizens from having to face the people they injure in court and having  to comply with the rules that have been worked out over the decades to  protect our air, our water, our land, our people, our health, and our  workplaces.   In most cases, we don't even get hearings on these bills. In the  Judiciary Committee, I have not seen a victim of toxic torts or lead  poisoning or medical malpractice testify, but their rights are being  flattened every single day by the legislative bulldozer that is running  amuck.   These bills are flying at us with lightning speed--no hearings, no  real debate, no time to study the measures, no time to do the proper  information gathering for our constituents.   Now the SCRUB Act would establish an unelected roving commission with  unlimited subpoena power. It would be controlled by the President who  gets to appoint a clean majority--five members at his own discretion;  and four more, two Republicans and two Democrats. So when they say it  is bipartisan, remember what that means: Seven spots for majority  appointees and two spots for minority appointees. More importantly,  this roving commission can be lobbied behind closed doors by the  special interests that want to splice and dice the regulations that we  have worked out over the decades to protect the public against harm.   In all of the rules that our democracy has put in place--not just old  rules, not just obsolete rules, not just silly rules--all of them are  going to be in the crosshairs of this roving commission--no exceptions,  no firewalls, no protections for rules governing public health and  safety--like the Clean Water Act or like the Clean Air Act. They just  rejected the amendment to carve that out. There are no protections,  significantly, and this is what the amendment is about, for rules  guaranteeing transparency in government and integrity in government.   My motion to recommit, Mr. Speaker, would incorporate into the  underlying legislation an amendment that I advanced in committee that  goes to the heart of the crisis of confidence in Washington, in America  today. I think every Member of this body can support it without  betraying any of their principles or their party. On the contrary, I  think it strengthens all of our principles and it strengthens our  parties by building public confidence in the political system as a  whole. It makes sure we can keep draining the swamp, as the President  of the United States said in this Chamber last night.   My amendment states very simply that the Commission may not target  for destruction any rules relating to any law governing a potential  conflict of interest of an employee or officer of the executive branch,  or any law governing the financial disclosures of executive branch  employees, and bribery.   Right now, we know there is a dangerous crisis in popular confidence  in the national government. This administration has brought to  Washington a web of complicated conflicts of interest, real or  potential, attendant to a global business empire that engages in  business with foreign governments, foreign and domestic corporations,  and a huge host of regulated entities.   Just a mile from where we sit today, for example, the Trump Hotel is  renting out guest rooms, ballrooms, meeting rooms, and whole floors to  foreign governments, embassies, and large corporations in flagrant  violation of the Emoluments Clause, article 1, section 9, which  requires the President to come ask us--Congress--for permission to  receive payments from foreign governments.                                time  1445    They even have a director of diplomatic sales now. Furthermore, the  standard lease that the Trump Hotel has with the General Services  Administration forbids any elected official of the United States  Government or the District of Columbia from deriving any profit or  value from the lease. Clearly, there is a breach in this lease right  now. The problem is that the President is not only the tenant, he is,  for all intents and purposes, the landlord too because he controls the  GSA and appoints its director. So President-landlord Donald Trump would  have to go to court to sue tenant businessman Donald Trump for  breaching the lease by collecting money under it as a public official.  This just scratches the surface of a welter of ethical conflicts.   Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which will not  kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will  immediately proceed to final passage as amended.   Since I became a member of this House in January, my Freshman  colleagues and I have been engaged in two activities. First, we've been  sitting in hearings and trying to make sense of bills that  fundamentally change the legal and regulatory structure of America--and  we've done so without hearing from witnesses, without time to study  measures, and without time to do the proper information gathering that  I believe is necessary to serve our various constituencies. Second,  we've come to the floor at the end of each day to cast votes on  deregulation. This house has been in the business of loosening rules on  everything. We've  [[Page H1418]]  made it easier to pollute, easier to harm consumers--all in the name of  cutting regulatory costs. And so it's no surprise that a bill like this  sailed through the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to the  floor.   This bill would establish an unelected commission with unlimited  subpoena power and partisan majority to chop through the Federal  Register with a chain saw. There are no exceptions, no firewalls, no  protections for rules and regulations governing health and safety and  there are no protections for rules guaranteeing transparency in  government.   My motion to recommit would incorporate into the underlying  legislation, an amendment I offered in committee. It's straightforward  and unburdensome. In fact, when I offered it in committee one of my  colleagues on the other side indicated that the priority of this bill  is ``major rules with massive costs.''   If passed, this MTR would make certain that no provision of the SCRUB  Act could be used to eliminate rules relating to laws that govern  conflicts of interest of executive branch officers or employees. That's  it--it reinforces existing law and clarifies provisions of this bill.   Surely, we can agree that rules designed to help maintain the public  trust in those representing them in the Executive Branch are sacred  enough to be explicitly protected. And if anyone should ask why it's so  important, we don't have to look too far. This administration is a  walking, talking billboard for the need to protect laws that protect  the public trust.   I urge my colleagues to support this common sense measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jayapal. She has been  a sensational leader within the Democratic Caucus and within the  Congressional Progressive Caucus, especially on the issues of  immigration and the rights of refugees. It is such an honor to be able  to serve with her. I appreciate being able to spend some moments just  reflecting on what took place in our Chamber last night with the  President's speech.   We should start by giving credit where credit is due. This speech was  not ``American Carnage II.'' It was a vast improvement, I would say,  over all of the violent and apocalyptic imagery and rhetoric that we  saw in the inaugural address. So hats off to the President's new speech  writer, whoever that may be.   However, having said that, I think it is simply old wine in a new  bottle. The same basic extremist Steve Bannon infrastructure governed  that address despite the fact that the manners had improved  considerably.                                time  1945    When I thought about President Trump's speech in this Chamber last  night, I thought about George Orwell. Not because of 1984, although I  admit that my well-thumbed copy of this great dystopian novel is  sitting on my desk right now and the words ``war is peace'' and  ``ignorance is strength'' have been running through my mind over the  last several weeks. No, I thought of Orwell not because of 1984, but  because of a great essay he once wrote called ``Notes on Nationalism.''   In this essay, George Orwell contrasted patriotism and nationalism-- two concepts that often get conflated. But at least, in his view, they  represented two very different things. Patriotism, he argued, was a  positive emotion, a passionate belief in one's own community--its  people, its institutions, its values, its history, its culture.   An American patriot today, I would argue, believes in our magnificent  constitutional democracy--our Constitution; our Bill of Rights; our  judiciary and our judges; our States and our communities; our poets  like Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman and Langston Hughes and Merrill  Leffler; our philosophers like John Dewey and Ralph Waldo Emerson; our  extraordinary dynamic culture which invites and absorbs new waves of  people from all over the world, our artists, our musicians like Bruce  Springsteen, the Neville Brothers, and Dar Williams. All of these  people and things are what we love about America, and they evoke the  positive emotion of patriotism.   Patriotism is all about uplifting people; drawing on what is best in  our history; finding what is best in our culture; invoking our  Founders, Madison,  [[Page H1457]]  Jefferson, Franklin, and Tom Paine; invoking the people who founded the  country once again through the Civil War and the reconstruction  amendments, Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass; the people who  transformed America in the women's suffrage movement, like Susan B.  Anthony; the people who remade America once again in the civil rights  movement, like Martin Luther King, Bob Moses, and the Student  Nonviolent Coordinating Committee; the people who blew the doors off of  discrimination and oppression against other groups, like the LGBT  community, like Harvey Milk.   All of these people stand for a progressive dynamic and inclusive  concept of America, and patriots want to draw on this culture in  history in order to continue to make great progress for our people  today. A patriot wants to improve the health of our people, the  education of our people, the critical thinking skills of our people,  the well-being of America.   Now, nationalism is different. If you look at it historically as  Orwell did, nationalism has been not about building people up and  improving their lives, it has been about militarizing society and  getting everyone to sync their individuality, their creative  personality into a large corporatist and authoritarian state, one that  is destined to exploit people's goodwill by mobilizing them for  groupthink and endless hostility in war, the kind that Orwell  dramatized so frightfully in 1984 and in ``Animal Farm.''   Well, I am sorry to say that I didn't see a lot of patriotism in  Orwell's terms in the speech last night. Ninety percent of our kids go  to public schools, but 90 percent of this President's energy and  administration's energy seems to go into maligning and defunding public  education and diverting public money away from public schools into  private education. That is the Betsy DeVos agenda.   Or take health care. The Affordable Care Act represents a magnificent  national investment in health care of our own people. More than 22  million of our fellow citizens, previously uninsured, got health care  because of the ACA. Thirty million if you include the expansion of  Medicaid that took place under the ACA.   If you decide to go to a town hall, yours or someone else's, you will  meet people who will tell you that their lives were saved because of  the Affordable Care Act--victims of breast cancer and colon cancer and  heart attacks and strokes and on and on. These things are just in the  nature of life. We are all subject to medical misfortune. If you learn  you have cancer or if you have a heart attack, that is a misfortune. It  happens to people every day. But if you have cancer or leukemia or you  have a heart attack and you can't get health coverage because you lost  your job or because you are too poor, that is not just a misfortune,  that is an injustice because we can do something about that. Because  that has to do with how we have organized our own affairs as a society.   But what did we hear from the President last night about the health  care and well-being of our people? Repeal and replace the Affordable  Care Act. They voted more than 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care  Act and never once to replace it. They have got no plan. The President  did not offer a plan.   The President restated the values of the Affordable Care Act itself.  And understand, the Affordable Care Act was the compromise because the  logical thing to have done, as President Obama said, if we were  starting from scratch, would be to adopt a single payor plan. But  because we were along a certain path, he felt we couldn't do that.   So he took the plan that was adopted at The Heritage Foundation, the  conservative think tank, the one that was put in in Massachusetts by  Governor Romney--RomneyCare. That is the Affordable Care Act. But they  couldn't tolerate that because they cared more about scoring political  points against the President than they did about actually making health  care available to as many Americans as possible.   So the President showed up empty-handed again. No plan whatsoever. If  there were a plan, we would be debating it. If they had something to  offer, we would be talking about it. But they don't have it. They just  want to repeal and consign everybody back to medical oblivion. Millions  of people going back to not having it. Making everybody else's  insurance premiums skyrocket and just turning our backs on the families  that now depend on the Affordable Care Act.   Now, I will say the President mentioned in passing something that he  made a big deal of during the campaign, and I was happy he did. He went  back to saying that we needed to give the government the authority to  negotiate with the large drug companies, the prescription drug  companies, for lower prices.   And I was happy to hear my colleagues from the other side of the  aisle in talking about the pharmacist just now, also talking about the  extraordinary power of the pharmaceutical companies and their predatory  practices.   Well, what the President has said makes perfect sense on this point,  which is there was some special interest legislation that came out  several years ago saying that the government could not negotiate for  lower prices with the drug companies when it comes to Medicare. We do  it with Medicaid, we do it with VA drug benefits, but we can't do it  for Medicare drug benefits because some lobbyist was able to get  somebody to stick that into the bill, and the GOP majority stands by it  now.   And so I appeal to the President, if you are serious about it, I will  work day and night to get every Democratic vote I can to side with you  in giving the government the authority to negotiate for lower drug  prices. That is a common ground agenda. Let's do that.   But as to the general picture of health care in the country, the  President gave us nothing last night. We also got no jobs plan. We got  no plan to confront the shameful inequality in our society.   When the President and his Cabinet entered the Chamber last night,  the net worth of this room went up by $9.6 billion. This is the richest  Cabinet in American history. These 17 people in the Cabinet have more  wealth than 43 million American households combined. That is one-third  of American households. When you look at the Trump Cabinet, you can see  the net worth of one-third of American families together.   And the President, who campaigned like a crusading populist, like  William Jennings Bryan, for working people, creates a Cabinet of  billionaires and CEOs, people who profited like mad from NAFTA and all  the trade deals that the President now denounces. He closed his  campaign by railing against Goldman Sachs. But Goldman Sachs may as  well be the nickname of this Cabinet. From Secretary Tillerson to Steve  Bannon and many others, Goldman Sachs is all over this administration.   And last night, we also got more immigrant bashing. And I know my  friend and colleague, Congresswoman Jayapal, will discuss this.   How patriotic is immigrant bashing? I would say not very. Tom Paine  said America would be a haven of refuge for people fleeing political  and religious repression all over the world. Madison said it would be a  sanctuary for religious and political refugees. America would come to  be symbolized by the Statue of Liberty. ``Give us your poor, your  tired, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,'' that is the  spirit of America.   We are a nation of immigrants. Other than Native Americans, we were  here before everybody else got here. And the slaves were brought here  against their will. But everybody else, we are immigrants or we are the  descendants of immigrants. So if you attack immigrants, you are really  attacking the dynamic and inclusive culture of America, a community of  communities.   And then there is the big proposal we got to slash $56 billion in  domestic spending and put it into a great big, new military buildup.  And here we see the fingerprints, of course, of Steve Bannon. We could  destroy the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for  the Humanities, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National  Institutes of Health, the State Department, the Peace Corps, the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Securities and  Exchange Commission, the Federal Election Commission, the CFPB, and on  [[Page H1458]]  and on, and still not come close to the $56 billion that they want to  rip out of the domestic priorities of the American people and simply  give to the Pentagon. And for what? Why? No one has told us why. What  is all of that money going to buy? Who is going to get rich off of all  of that money?   Ladies and gentlemen, when you add it all up, this program seems like  it partakes of the ultra-nationalist politics that Orwell perceived in  authoritarian regimes, not the kind of patriotism that reflects the  best in our own Democratic political culture.   The great thing is that Americans are deep patriots. We love our  communities. We love our institutions. We love our values. We love our  Constitution. We love our Bill of Rights. And we are not going to fall  for a right-wing, ultra-nationalist agenda that takes us away from  everything that we love.                                time  2000
