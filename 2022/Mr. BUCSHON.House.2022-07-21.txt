 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 8373.  [[Page H6933]]    The bill isn't about access to traditional contraception. It is about  preserving access to abortion drugs.   As a physician, I adamantly believe that treatment decisions should  be made by a patient and their provider. In making that decision, they  need to be fully informed, knowing what we are using, for what purpose,  and whether the FDA has determined it is, number one, safe; and, number  two, unless the drug falls under right-to-try laws, fully proven to be  effective.   The legislation defines a contraceptive as any device or medication  used to prevent pregnancy, whether specifically used to prevent  pregnancy or for other health needs. There is no explanation of what  the device or medication might be, and no definition for other health  needs.   The bill is dangerously vague. It could be applied to chemical  abortion drugs to end a pregnancy in addition to traditional  contraceptives. It could be used to provide statutory access to drugs  without the guidance and administration of a trained healthcare  professional or without any FDA review.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this ill-crafted bill.
