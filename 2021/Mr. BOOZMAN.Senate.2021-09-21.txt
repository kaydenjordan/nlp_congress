 Madam President, I rise today to recognize  Bentonville Police Chief Jon Simpson whose dedication to law  enforcement and community service will be deeply missed following his  retirement as chief of the Bentonville Police Department.   Chief Simpson's dedication is grounded in his strong roots to  northwest Arkansas as a Bentonville native and graduate of the  University of Arkansas. He established a career in public safety, first  in the security division of Walmart Stores, Inc., before transitioning  to work for the city as a patrol officer in 1994, where his service  quickly stood out. After only 2 years with the Bentonville Police  Department, Jon was named officer of the year.   From there, the chief held numerous supervisory positions and led by  example, inspiring officers in both the patrol and criminal divisions.  He was promoted to a command staff member in 2006 and, in 2011, was  appointed chief of the Bentonville Police Department. In these  leadership roles, Chief Simpson reorganized the rank structure of the  department, added personnel with further opportunities for advisory  positions, and upgraded the department's vehicles and equipment.  Additionally, he led an extensive renovation to the police department  building that added a bomb squad facility, emergency communication  center, criminal investigations building, and emergency operations  center.   The Bentonville community's rapid growth and unique challenges  certainly shaped Chief Simpson's tenure. He recognized the high  expectations of Bentonville citizens and was encouraged to do more to  ensure his officers lived up to those standards. That approach led to  the incredible level of safety and security within the Bentonville  community today. Chief Simpson's impact has also been recognized beyond  his own department. Recently, the Arkansas Fraternal Order of Police in  Little Rock recognized him with its Outstanding Police Chief Award.   Chief Simpson has demonstrated a relentless pursuit to improve  himself, his team, and the community he served throughout his career. I  applaud his dedicated, decades-long commitment to law enforcement and  the safety of his fellow Arkansans. He is a true public servant who has  strengthened law and order in Bentonville. It has been an honor to work  with him during his tenure, and I wish him all the best in his next  endeavor.                            ____________________
