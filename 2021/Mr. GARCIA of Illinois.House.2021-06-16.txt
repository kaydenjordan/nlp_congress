 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor my  friend and activist Marcos Munoz, who lived a life of service and  commitment to workers' rights.   Marcos migrated to the United States from Coahuila, Mexico, when he  was 13 years old. He was looking to make money to help his mother and  his siblings after his father left them.   He worked for a Texas rancher, who had him deported when Marcos asked  for money he was owed after 5 months of backbreaking work.   When Marcos returned to the U.S. in his twenties, the abuse he  experienced turned him into an activist, fighting for basic labor  rights for farmworkers.   The late Cesar Chavez, leader of the United Farm Workers, recognized  Marcos' leadership skills and asked him to lead efforts across the  United States on behalf of the United Farm Workers union.   I met Marcos when he came to Chicago seeking support for the second  grape boycott. I was a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago  and learned a lot about labor organizing from him.   Marcos later made Chicago his home, settling in our neighborhood of  Little Village, where he organized block clubs to create unity and  elect representatives from the community.   He later became a steelworker, joined the United Steelworkers union,  and spent his last years before retirement as manager of supplies and  linen at Cook County Hospital.   Marcos passed away on May 15. I was lucky to call Marcos a mentor and  a  [[Page H2824]]  friend. My wife, Evelyn, and I are thinking about his family during  these difficult times.   May you be in glory, my brother.                            ____________________
