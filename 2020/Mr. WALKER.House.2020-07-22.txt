 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to participate in this Special  Order, and I will look forward to hearing from our speakers in honoring  the great John Lewis.   Over this past weekend, America lost not only a civil rights icon but  also a loving father, a loving husband, a caring friend to this entire  House body, Congressman John Lewis.   Mr. Lewis' courage and strength in the face of oppression are  unmatched. His contributions to America's soul are paramount to the  progress that we have made in our histories.   His experience on Bloody Sunday left him battered, covered in blood,  and on the side of the road in Selma, Alabama, yet he carried on with  his unifying message for America.   Many years ago, John Lewis crossed the monumental Edmund Pettus  Bridge, fighting for freedom and a path toward achieving what our  Founding Fathers had pledged but fell short to uphold.   I was extremely honored to have the opportunity 54 years later to  walk across this very bridge in Selma, and we all honored the brave  steps he led, rallying an entire Nation. The fact that I was asked to  give the closing remarks at Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church  in Montgomery is something, frankly, I will always treasure.   John Lewis' protest inspired our Nation to not only do better but to  reflect on all of our actions. Through his grace and humility, he made  monumental progress. He liked to refer to these acts as ``good  trouble.''   While we don't share many of the same political opinions, there was  never a doubt in my mind that Congressman John Lewis lived his entire  life fighting for our country and the American people.   He gave us all hope, hope that we could get over this partisan  divide, hope that we could get over the divisions of the past to paint  a brighter future.   May we never lose that spirit and forever honor his legacy by never  letting the forces of division, hatred, and evil tear down those  bridges that so many of us have sacrificed to build.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise),  the minority whip.                                time  1930     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Ferguson), our deputy whip. It only makes sense to go first to John  Lewis' colleagues in the delegation from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Lowey).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Austin Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Scott for his  comments tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Hice), a fellow pastor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, may I get a time remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen).   MR. ALLEN. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for this  privilege.   Mr. Speaker, many Americans learned about the civil rights movement  in the news or read about it in history books. John Lewis lived it.   One of my greatest memories here was to have dinner with Congressman  Lewis at his home, where he shared with the entire Georgia delegation  his experience in leading the civil rights movement.   He shared with me that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. prayed with them on  those buses before the demonstrations and urged everyone to remain at  peace to ensure lasting change.   I know we can all learn from the example Congressman Lewis set as a  civil rights icon. We must meet injustice with humility and  perseverance to do what is right.   Pride and fear are the opposite of humility. John Lewis and all those  in this movement demonstrated perfect love while being persecuted.  Perfect love casts out all fear and only comes from God and obedience  to His word and was perfectly demonstrated at the cross of Jesus  Christ.   My wife, Robin, and I pray that his family finds peace during this  difficult time. And this is a lesson for this body as we honor those  like John Lewis, who have come before us and fought for an America that  is stronger and is unified, by putting aside our differences to serve  the American people in perfect love.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Cohen), with his own amazing civil rights history.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter), another one of Mr. Lewis' colleagues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Turner).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Cardenas).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind if we can keep the  remarks about 1 minute, we will get as many as we can in tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Ms. Stevens).     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota  (Ms. Craig).    Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to introduce the majority  leader. As he is coming, I want to express to him my thanks for  allowing me to have the honor to pray for Representative John Lewis at  his birthday party this past March. It is a privilege and a memory that  I will cherish.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, may we make a commitment to make sure this  next generation does know the name ``John Lewis.''   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Casten).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs.  Fletcher).    Mr. Speaker, as we conclude this Special Order, I am most  reminded by my colleagues this evening of the immense impact of a life  that was John Lewis.   In our current House, who can we think of that has more of an impact  in the civil rights movement than John Lewis?   His legacy is not simply of humility and kindness in the pursuit of  equality, but one in which we should all aspire  [[Page H3683]]  to replicate. We have talked many times tonight of his nonviolent  approach, but do not hesitate for one second to think that John Lewis  was not a strong man, a strong man with a lion's heart.   America is the greatest country in the world, but let's be  transparent. It took us a few years to really act out that all men were  created equal. John Lewis dedicated his life to making sure this  country lived up to the ideals of our Founding Fathers in making this  Nation a better place for everyone.   John was a man of faith. He grew up as a young preacher and later  became an ordained Baptist minister, and I can relate to that. It was  under this background that he began this fight for equality. Had the  church joined him, I am convinced there would be less division today.   As a member of the Freedom Riders, John and his fellow Riders were  subjected to mob beatings and arrested for his efforts. Despite this  opposition, he remained steadfast in his conviction and continued  onward with his courageous message as he pressured our Federal  Government to do the right thing.   Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago, John Lewis ascended to a seat in the U.S.  Congress and continued to make ``good trouble,'' as he would deem it.  During this distinguished time as a Member of the United States House  of Representatives, John left no stone unturned in his fight for the  American people.   As you can see this evening, Congress has felt this impact  resoundingly. It has been made clear: John Lewis' kindness and humility  in the many faces of oppression and adversity have lifted up Congress  and America for decades. To say he will be sorely missed is a vast  understatement.   Let us continue to tell the story of John Lewis for generations to  come. Remember his guidance, and let his presence live on in our  hearts. In other words, let's keep on a walkin' and keep on a talkin'.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
