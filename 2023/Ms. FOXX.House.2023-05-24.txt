 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 429, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 45) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Department of Education relating to ``Waivers and  Modifications of Federal Student Loans,'' and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 45, which would block the  Biden administration's debt transfer scheme and prevent any further  extension of the student loan repayment pause.   For Democrats, there is a specter looming over this debate, an  incontrovertible truth that disproves all their supposed principles and  contradicts all their virtue signaling.   Student loan cancellation is regressive. Let me repeat that for the  Progressive Caucus. Student loan cancellation is regressive.   Two-thirds of this debt transfer plan would go to the top half of  earners. It takes from those in the lower half and gives to the upper  half. It redistributes wealth, but from the bottom of our socioeconomic  ladder to the top.   For example, the repayment pause has provided $65,000 in de facto  loan cancellation for the average lawyer. This is a professional-class  bailout. More specifically, it is a professional-class, graduate-degree  holder bailout. Of the loans that will be disbursed in 2024, 70 percent  will be borrowed for graduate school. Nearly 40 percent of those people  will go on to make over $100,000 annually in their careers. Those are  the data absent partisan spin provided directly from the Department of  Education.   The spin comes from the left when they use words like  ``forgiveness.'' There is no such thing as forgiveness. The Biden  administration is simply transferring the debt from borrowers who  willingly took out student loans to hardworking taxpayers who did not.  The 87 percent of Americans who hold no Federal student debt are paying  for the 13 percent who do.                                time  1230    On top of that, the bailout is inflationary, which is always and  everywhere a regressive working-class tax.   According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget,  inflation could rise by as much as 27 basis points if mass student debt  cancellation is implemented. Enacting mass student loan  [[Page H2563]]  cancellation could also lead to an additional two rate hikes by the  Federal Reserve.   Billionaires don't feel the effect of inflation. They don't notice  when eggs cost $5.99 a dozen. They don't need to take out a mortgage to  pay for their house, but working Americans do.   Inflation already has a vise grip on blue-collar America. In fact,  The Hill reported yesterday that ``a record share of Americans in a new  survey from the Federal Reserve Board say they are worse off  financially than they were a year earlier.''   That is troubling and should be enough evidence alone to pass H.J.  Res. 45 and nullify the Biden administration's deficit-increasing  inflationary plan, but in typical limousine liberal fashion, Democrats  want future taxpayers and hardworking Americans to foot the bill.  Americans shouldn't buy it.   America also shouldn't buy accusations from the left that H.J. Res.  45 would charge borrowers backpay on interest payments. It couldn't be  further from the truth.   Nowhere in this resolution does it mandate backpay. It is  prospective, not retrospective. If anything, it would be Secretary  Cardona's decision to enact backpay.   We know who will pay for the loans if the administration's plan is  allowed to go forward. Those who will pay are those without degrees and  those who paid off their debt, and those who can't afford to put gas in  their cars or food on their table. The rest is just political noise.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Congress to cut through that noise and stop this  administration from enacting the biggest transfer of wealth from blue- collar workers to white-collar professionals in our Nation's history.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 45, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good), the author of this resolution and the chair of the  Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg), a member of the Committee on Education and the  Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's comments, but we  are showing compassion to the 87 percent of the people in this country  who played by the rules and paid their bills or didn't go to college.  The 13 percent who did take out debt who haven't paid it back should  show some similar compassion to their fellow human beings and not ask  them to pay their bills.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen), a member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bean), chair of the Early Childhood, Elementary, and  Secondary Education Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, my colleagues want us to feel so sorry for  these people who took out these loans and who are not going to pay them  back. My colleague in the 12th District of North Carolina said 121,000  people in her district.   Mr. Speaker, you know who I am feeling sorry for? The 622,600 people  who are being asked to pay off the bill that those 121,000 people took  out willingly and have benefited from. This is a backward way of  looking at things. Compassion should be shown to the 622,600 people who  didn't take out the loan but are now being asked to pay it back.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs.  Miller), the vice chair of the Committee on Education and the  Workforce.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise, again, in support of H.J. Res. 45 and urge my  colleagues to pass this bill.   The Democrats and the White House have accused Republicans of working  against the interests of our constituents; however, this just shows how  out of touch Democrats are with the realities of the people in my  district.   While the White House likes to point to the fact that 75,000 of my  constituents are eligible for the administration's bailout, they  conveniently ignore that 675,000 of them, or over 90 percent, receive  no benefit from this illegal scam.   Moreover, 212,000 of my constituents have never even set foot on a  college campus. According to the National Taxpayers Union estimate, the  administration's blanket loan cancellation and income-driven repayment  plan will cost over $3,500 per constituent. This will cost the  hardworking constituents in my district $1.2 billion alone.   Mr. Speaker, there is no such thing as debt forgiveness. The  administration's student debt scheme simply transfers the cost from  well-off college graduates to the backs of my constituents. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.J. Res. 45, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would let Representative Davis know that in  Illinois 11,655,200 people don't have student debt, and they will be  the ones bearing the cost of the transfer from 90,800 people.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Rose).    Mr. Speaker, I think our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle are doing their best to gaslight the 87 percent of their  constituents who are going to be saddled with the debt from the 13  percent.   In Washington's 7th Congressional District, there are 686,200 people  who don't have any college debt who are going to be asked to pay the  debt off for 84,300 people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Moran), who is a member of the Education and Workforce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand that words be taken down.    Mr. Speaker, I have no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that in the 10th District of  Florida, 654,500 people will be paying the debt for 122,500 people.   Mr. Speaker, over the last two decades, tuition and fees have  increased nearly three times the rate of inflation.   Democrats continually talk about how college is unaffordable yet fail  to realize their failed policies exacerbate the problem of outrageous  college costs.   More Federal aid and generous loan subsidies allow schools to  increase their prices to capture those additional funds. Economists at  the New York Federal Reserve found that for every $1 increase in  student loan subsidies, colleges increased their tuition 60 cents.  Another study found colleges reduced their own grant aid by as much as  83 cents for every dollar students receive in taxpayer student aid.   The Biden administration is telling borrowers that someone else will  pay their loans and telling institutions that someone else will cover  the cost of tuition.   It is no wonder the Congressional Budget Office found that the Biden  administration's new income-driven repayment plan alone will increase  student borrowing by 12 percent.   Let's work toward actually lowering college costs, not dumping  hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars on well-off college graduates  to make the problem worse.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.J. Res.  45, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close whenever the gentleman  from Virginia is prepared, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, we all know that access to college is available to every  single person in this country. It is not a matter of access. It is a  matter of who is paying back their loans.   Coupled with the permanent repayment pause, expansive new  regulations, and a radical new income-driven repayment plan, the Biden  administration's student loan scam could end up costing taxpayers $1  trillion. That is more than the Federal Government has ever spent on  postsecondary education.   The Biden administration's policies do nothing to solve the root  issues of student debt. If this bailout moves forward, then outstanding  student debt will return to current levels in just over 5 years. We  will be right back here again.   The Federal student loan system is broken, and real reform is needed.  Simply put, the administration's action will mean that future students  will come to expect their loans will be canceled, and colleges will  continue to increase already skyrocketing tuition because they know  Democrats will leave taxpayers to foot the bill.   We need to hold colleges accountable for charging outrageous prices  for degrees with no value. We need a student loan program that has the  best interests of students and taxpayers in mind.   As the institution that holds the power of the purse, Congress has  the responsibility to protect the interest of taxpayers. A vote in  support of today's resolution will do just that.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.J. Res.  45, and I yield back the balance of my time.
