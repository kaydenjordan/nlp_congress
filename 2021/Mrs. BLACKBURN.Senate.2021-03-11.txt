 Mr. President, I have to tell you, you can always  tell how controversial a nominee is by how fast his supporters work to  finish the confirmation process, and last night, at 6:12, we found out  that the Democrats tried to pull a fast one on Xavier Becerra's  nomination. They were trying to fast-track this, and I was able to  object to that hotline request, but the fact that they tried it shows  that they are worried about this nominee, and they should be. After two  unimpressive hearings and seeing the split vote on the Finance  Committee, I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  come to realize that his lack of experience in the healthcare sector is  one of those big things.   You know, we have over 400 healthcare companies in Tennessee and tens  of thousands of employees in that sector. They all--each and every one  of them--have more healthcare experience than the Biden  administration's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services.   His greatest hits from his job keep coming back to haunt him, and as  much as his allies here in the Senate try to spin his record, they just  can't seem to convince people that he is fit to lead. I was curious how  wide the divide is between Tennesseeans and the Becerra nomination, so  I asked my staff to look through our mailbag and see what people were  calling and writing about.   This nomination was in the top five issues of concern. People in  Tennessee are not happy. As I mentioned, healthcare, our religious  organizations--what they are seeing is somebody who has crossed the  line too many times. They do not see him as fit to lead.   His lack of experience in the healthcare industry explains why so  many people would oppose him. He thinks it would be a good idea to take  private health insurance away from 160 million Americans and throw them  into a disastrous single-payer system. If that is what you want, then  he would be a great Secretary of HHS for you.   If he has his way, he will use his new position to further undermine  our immigration laws. He has admitted--his own admission--that given  the chance, he would decriminalize illegal entry and extend Medicaid  benefits to anyone who manages to make it across the border. It is like  winning the lottery. If you get across that border, we are going to  give you healthcare benefits, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer.   We cannot afford to keep confirming nominees who have zero respect  for the rule of law--zero--and even less respect for the value of human  life. Throughout his career, Mr. Becerra has made his appallingly  radical positions on abortion very well known. He is proud to support  abortion up until the moment of birth. He even opposed the 2003  partial-birth abortion ban. He defended a truly evil California law  that forced pro-life crisis pregnancy centers to advertise abortion  services offered by State-run clinics.   Recently, a physician friend of mine made a comment about Mr.  Becerra's nomination that has really stuck with me. She said:         I'm horrified--    Bear in mind, this is a physician.         I'm horrified by his position on abortion because he would       abort a baby that I would resuscitate. He would abort a baby       that a family is willing to adopt.    Now, think about that. This is a guy, in his congressional career and  in his job as the attorney general for California, he is a radical on  abortion--a radical. You have physicians who stand there to resuscitate  these babies that have difficulty during birth. He would allow those  babies to be aborted when a physician would choose life, would choose  to help that baby live.    According to Mr. Becerra, religious exemptions should be a thing of  the past. He relentlessly harassed religious employers like Hobby Lobby  and nonprofit organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor as part  of his crusade to uphold ObamaCare's contraception mandate. I think it  is clear why the Finance Committee split their vote on this nomination.  It has nothing to do with politics.   Xavier Becerra's obsession with dismantling American society and  rebuilding it in his own image can't be boiled down to a simple policy  position. Instead, it signals his desire to force Americans to live  their lives according to his twisted world view.   He may have the approval of leftists, but the American people and  thousands of Tennesseans have already written him off as radically  unqualified, and, frankly, so have I.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this motion to discharge  and opposing the nomination. He is radically anti-life, anti-religion,  anti-border security, anti-free speech. He is unqualified to lead.   I yield the floor.
