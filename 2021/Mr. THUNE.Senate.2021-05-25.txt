 Mr. President, H.R. 1, the Democrats' supposed election  integrity bill, is filled with bad ideas: making the Federal Election  Commission into a partisan body; effectively banning voter ID and  gutting other safeguards against voter fraud; providing for taxpayer  funding of political campaigns.   Nowhere is that more true than when it comes to the bill's truly  terrible provisions on the IRS.   Everyone remembers the IRS scandal during the Obama administration.  Around 2013, it emerged that the Obama IRS had been unfairly singling  out conservative organizations applying for tax-exempt status, slow- walking their applications and subjecting them to burdensome extra  scrutiny. This had been going on for more than 2 years, and top IRS  officials compounded the Agency's misdeeds by providing misleading  information to Congress.   Well, Americans should brace themselves, because if H.R. 1 is ever  enacted, it would allow for the same kind of targeting that went on  under the Obama administration, if not worse. To start with, H.R. 1  repeals a Treasury Department rule finalized last year that was  designed to help prevent the kind of abuse that went on under the Obama  IRS.   Under the rule, many tax-exempt organizations are no longer required  to turn over to the IRS the names and addresses of individuals who have  made substantial donations. This is not information the IRS needs to  know for tax purposes, and there is no reason the Agency should have  information beyond what it needs to do its job.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of Leader McConnell and Senator Braun's  bill which would permanently codify the Treasury rule and its  protections against unnecessary disclosure. Providing the IRS with  additional extraneous information opens up opportunities for the kind  of abuses we saw during the Obama administration.   But stopping IRS abuse doesn't seem to be a big priority for the  Democrat Party. Indeed, there is reason to believe at least some  Democrats would like the IRS to take a more aggressive role in  Americans' lives. And so H.R. 1 explicitly repeals the Treasury  Department rule, but that is not all.    As if Democrats were determined to prove that they intend to  weaponize the IRS, H.R. 1 and S. 1, which is the Senate version of the  House bill, would allow the IRS to consider organizations' views when  deciding whether or not to grant them tax-exempt status. Let me repeat  that. H.R. 1 and S. 1 would allow the IRS to consider an organization's  views when deciding whether or not to grant that organization tax- exempt status.   It is difficult to think of a more outrageous and dangerous  provision. This rule would allow any administration of either party to  use the IRS to censor and suppress groups whose ideas the party in  power opposes. If the administration in power doesn't like the  positions that your organization champions, say goodbye to your hopes  for tax-exempt status. The Obama IRS scandals could look tame compared  to the kind of political weaponization of the IRS that could occur  under H.R. 1.   This provision could have real political implications. Selectively  granting tax-exempt status could be a means of weakening political  opposition. A group that can't get tax-exempt status may be a group  that never gets off the ground for financial reasons and, thus, a group  that never becomes a significant voice in opposition to policies of the  reigning party.   Do you think this is a worst case scenario? Well, let's remember that  something like this already happened under the Obama administration.  The IRS was weaponized once, and it can be weaponized again, especially  if Democrats succeed in their efforts to eliminate safeguards against  such abuse.   And, of course, if the President has his way, the IRS may soon be  swimming in money that would substantially increase its reach.  President Biden wants to provide the IRS with--get this--an additional  $80 billion over 10 years. That would give the IRS a larger budget than  the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, the Department of  the Interior, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other  significant government Agencies. It would allow the IRS to hire nearly  87,000 new employees--87,000. All told, the Biden plan would double the  number of IRS employees over the next decade.   Now, the reason President Biden gives for this massive increase in  IRS funding is increased enforcement efforts in order to close the tax  gap--that gap that exists between taxes owed and what Americans end up  actually paying. But there is little reason to believe that the IRS  will come anywhere close to recovering the amount of money the  President claims it can recover, even with a massive infusion of cash.  And there is reason to be seriously concerned about what that massive  infusion of cash, plus new reporting requirements on Americans' bank  and Venmo accounts, could mean for IRS intrusion into Americans' lives.   President Biden, of course, also claims that any increased  enforcement will be targeted against wealthy Americans. In what is  becoming a typical Democrat class-warfare rhetoric, the President  states that ordinary Americans pay their taxes while some wealthy  Americans dodge them. Of course, according to the IRS, our Nation has a  relatively high and stable voluntary tax compliance rate, and tax  compliance levels remain largely unchanged since at least the 1980s.  And, in fact, failure to pay tax owed occurs among all kinds of  taxpayers in every place along the income spectrum. But the White House  isn't letting those facts interfere with its class-warfare rhetoric.   What is more, what guarantees will we have other than Democrats' say- so at this point that this infusion of money will be restricted to  combating  [[Page S3390]]  tax evasion? As far as I can tell, there is nothing to prevent the new  agents the IRS will hire from being retasked at some point to other  priorities, like investigating the views of conservative organizations  before deciding whether or not to grant them tax-exempt status.   Closing the tax gap is a serious goal that deserves serious  discussion, and it is possible that a targeted IRS funding increase for  that purpose would be worth considering. But $80 billion is a  ridiculous number. In the words of one of President Obama's IRS chiefs:  ``I'm not sure you'd be able to efficiently use that much money.''   And any plus-up in funding for the IRS should be accompanied by  serious reforms, as well as many protections--not fewer protections-- against IRS politicization.   While the Obama IRS scandal represents one of the more egregious  abuses of the Agency's power, the IRS is well known for serial  mismanagement, like Americans' inability to actually get through to the  IRS with their questions   The Washington Post reported in April that if you were calling the  IRS this tax season, you had a 1-in-50--1-in-50--chance of actually  getting to speak to a human being.   In May, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration  released a report on the 2021 filing season, which noted the IRS  struggled to get new hires squared away on the job partially because it  is--and here, I am going to have to quote from this report--``difficult  to find working copiers . . . to be able to prepare training packages  for new hires.'' That is right. And I wish those were the only Agency  printer or copier problems, but they are not.   Let me quote from the inspector general's report again.         Audit teams continue to perform onsite walkthroughs at the       Ogden, Utah, and Kansas City, Missouri, Tax Processing       Centers to meet with staff to discuss challenges they are       facing as it relates to addressing the ongoing backlogs of       inventory. A major concern that surfaced during these       walkthroughs was a lack of working printers and copiers. IRS       management estimated that, as of March 30, 2021, 69 [or] (42       percent) of 164 devices used by the Submission Processing       functions are unusable and others are broken but still       functioning. IRS employees stated that the only reason they       could not use many of these devices is because they are out       of ink or because the waste cartridge container is full.    That is from the inspector general's report. I wish this were a joke,  but that is straight out of the IG's report.   Hearing that, you might think that we don't need to worry about the  weaponization of the IRS because the Agency isn't capable of work that  sophisticated. But, as we know, that isn't true. The IRS was  successfully weaponized for political purposes during the Obama  administration, and the same thing could happen again, especially if  Democrats succeed in removing protections against IRS abuse.   As our Nation's revenue-collecting Agency, the IRS is an Agency with  immense power, and it is not a voluntary government program. Americans  don't get to choose whether or not they interact with the IRS. For that  reason, it is vital that there be as many safeguards in place as  possible to prevent the IRS from abusing its power or being used for  political purposes.   We have seen plenty of evidence that the IRS often doesn't use the  money or resources that it currently has in a responsible way. And any  increase in money for the IRS--which it certainly should not be  anywhere close to $80 billion--should be matched with significant  reforms and increased accountability.   And H.R. 1, with its multitude of unwise and unconstitutional  provisions even beyond the alarming provisions I have discussed today,  must be stopped. Otherwise, the Biden legacy may be the weaponization  of the IRS.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Louisiana (Mr. Kennedy).
