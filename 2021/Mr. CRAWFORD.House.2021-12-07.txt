 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama for  his leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the 2022 NDAA. This process  began months ago. A bill was introduced, Members offered amendments,  debated accordingly, and reached bicameral consensus.   However, as Members arrived in Washington this afternoon, they  realized they only had about 8 hours to review and vote on a 2,100-page  document to secure our national defense--a surprising and frustrating  process that has become all too familiar with House Democrats and the  majority.   While I will always support our men and women in uniform, I am  concerned that not all these men and women, specifically those who  serve in the Army as explosive ordnance disposal technicians, as I once  did, are adequately equipped to defend our Nation by this year's  version of NDAA. I will continue to work hard to achieve this purpose  going forward.   I am voting in favor of the legislation because of the critical  funding it provides for our national defense, pay raises for our  servicemen and -women, provisions to hold the Biden administration  accountable on its irresponsible withdraw from Afghanistan, and serious  steps to assess the involvement of the Chinese Communist Party in the  origins of COVID-19 as well as their unacceptable and increasingly  aggressive behavior around the world.   I sincerely hope that next year we have more time to absorb the final  provisions of the NDAA to make sure that all of our troops feel  confident they have the full support of Congress.
