 Mr. Speaker, at this time I am very proud to have  a dear friend and colleague on the floor with me.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio- Cortez).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  message, and I assure her that I will be part of that fight.                                time  1345    There are some fights that you cannot escape. I believe that women  should have the right to choose. It is not my choice. It is the choice  of the woman. I hope that we will see a time when the Supreme Court  will realize that it has made a mistake that has to be corrected.   But today I am here primarily and principally to talk about a state  of affairs in Texas. Sadly, regrettably, and unfortunately, the GOP-- the Grand Old Party, the party of Lincoln--has degenerated and devolved  into what I call the COT, the cult of Trump. The party of Lincoln has  devolved into the cult of Trump. It is no longer the Lincolnian party  firmly planted on the bedrock of the democratic principles, government  of the people, by the people, and for the people. It has deteriorated  into the Trumpian party firmly planted on the dubious ground of  ``government of Trump, by Trump, and for Trump.''   This is best evidenced and evinced by juxtaposing the public policy  stance taken by the GOP with the public policy stance codified and  voted on by the Texas Republican Party--the COT, the cult of Trump--on  June 18, 2022, at their party convention in Houston, Texas. And  juxtaposing, the GOP, the party of Lincoln that took a stand and fought  to keep the Union together, the COT, the cult of Trump, has taken a  stand to secede from the Union literally. Texas now under Republican  leadership desires to leave the Union.   When I say Republican leadership, I mean those persons who  participated in the convention. The Governor sent a message and State- elected officials were a party to it. Either directly or in some  vicarious way they were all affiliated and associated. They knew about  this vote that was taken, and either they voted for it, or they have  acquiesced to it.   The GOP, the party of Lincoln historically, accepted and participated  in the peaceful transfer of Presidential power. The COT, the cult of  Trump, rejects the certified results of the 2022 Presidential election  and holds that President Biden was not legitimately elected by the  people. This is all news that has taken place in the State of Texas  recently--as of June 18, 2022--Texas wanting to leave the Union by and  through the GOP.   Now the cult of Trump and also the Texas Republican Party indicated  that President Biden is not the President. They went so far as to say  that they reject the certified results of the 2022 Presidential  election that holds that President Biden was elected but they say not  legitimately elected.   Lastly, of the many things that I could mention--but it is something  that is critical to people of color and women--the GOP, the party of  Lincoln, forged the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution recognizing  the right of former slaves to vote. Under the hand of GOP President  George W. Bush, a 25-year reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act was  signed into law.   On the other hand, the COT, the cult of Trump, urges that the Voting  Rights Act of 1965, codified and updated in 1973, be repealed and not  reauthorized. The Texas former Republican Party, now the cult of Trump,  would repeal and not reauthorize the Voting Rights Act.   Should this happen, the gender, complexion, and diversity of the  Congress will change significantly.   Here is why: In 1965, when our dear colleague and brother, John  Lewis, crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge on what we now call Bloody  Sunday, when he crossed the Edmond Pettus Bridge that day, he had to  sense what fate was awaiting him on the other side of the bridge. I am  not sure he anticipated it would be as dastardly imposed as it was. As  he approached the bridge--I have been to the bridge many times; it has  a zenith, and it has crest. As you approach the crest, Mr. Speaker, you  can see what awaits you on the other side.   On Bloody Sunday in 1965, peaceful protesters were marching from  Selma to Montgomery. They were peaceful, doing no one harm, and simply  wanting to peacefully demonstrate that they were willing to walk to a  city that for years had been a place where there had been persons who  were being mistreated and not having the opportunity to vote as other  people were voting. But in any event, they were walking, and they came  upon the police and the constabulary on horses.   I spoke to my friend, John Lewis, about this. He said he thought he  was going to die because they started beating them. They beat them all  the way back to the church where they started. It was a sad day in  history. It was a sad day in the history of this country and a sad day  in the history of the world. The camera's eye caught what was  happening, and it was broadcast around the world.   A President from Texas, Lyndon Johnson, wanted to do what he  ultimately did. But he didn't have the momentum to get it done until  Bloody Sunday when people saw the meanness, the hate, and just the  desire to harm peaceful people. When they saw all of this, it gave him  that momentum that he had been seeking. I admire him. He was able to  get the Voting Rights Act of 1965 signed.   That Voting Rights Act of 1965 changed the diversity in Congress, the  complexion of Congress, and the agenda of Congress. This is the same  Voting Rights Act, Mr. Speaker, that the cult in Texas--the COT, the  cult of Trump, no longer the Grand Old Party, the GOP--they would not  reauthorize, they would repeal it.   President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. At the time he signed  it in 1965 in the 89th Congress, there were four Asian Members--four.  There were four Latino Members, six Black Members, and 13 women in the  Congress.   There were four Asians in 1965. Now, fast-forward to 2022, the 117th  Congress.  [[Page H5917]]  There are 21 Asian Members. Before the Voting Rights Act became law,  there were four. In 2022, there are 21. Before the Voting Rights Act,  there were four Latino Members. In 2022, there are 52. The Voting  Rights Act has afforded opportunities that were not there prior to  Bloody Sunday.   There were six Black Members in 1965. In 2022, there are 61 Black  Members. I am proud to be one of them--61. I would daresay that but for  the Voting Rights Act of 1965, I would not be one of the 61. The Voting  Rights Act of 1965 has made a difference in the complexion of Congress.  There were thirteen women in 1965. In 2022 there are 151 women.    You see, Mr. Speaker, when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made it  possible for African Americans to have these opportunities, it did open  the door for others as well. It opened the door for people of color.  They were not the slaves that benefited from the 13th Amendment, but  they were people who benefited from the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   It also provided people in my congressional district to have a ballot  printed in more than one language. Houston is a polyglot city. Many  languages are spoken. The ballot in the Ninth Congressional District,  where I am fortunate enough to serve, is printed in four different  languages: English, Spanish, Vietnamese, and Chinese. The Voting Rights  Act made that possible. It has been reauthorized and amended such that  language has been made a part of the Voting Rights Act giving people  the opportunity to simply vote in a language that they understand. Some  people would say: Well, they should all speak English.   Well, there are some Native Alaskans who don't necessarily find  English as their native tongue. They are citizens. They ought to be  able to vote. They are people who acquired citizenship and speak  another language. They speak English well enough to have the kinds of  conversations that can help in your daily life, but when you are  casting a vote for President of the United States or some other public  office such as judgeships, it would serve people well to be able to do  this with the language they are most comfortable with. Hence, we have  the ballot in these four languages.   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 has made, and continues to make, a  difference notwithstanding the fact that a significant portion of it  has been eviscerated. We still have section 2 of the Voting Rights Act  to help prevent invidious discrimination that Texas is known for, by  the way. Texas is the home of invidious discrimination. Texas has twice  left its place in countries where slavery was not acceptable. Rather  than remain, Texas has seceded. Texas left Mexico because of slavery,  and Texas left the United States because of slavery. So the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 has made a difference.   But the State of Texas through many of its agents, and especially  those associated with the cult of Trump--formerly known as the GOP, the  Grand Old Party--many of those agents would repeal the Voting Rights  Act which would make a great difference in who speaks at this  microphone and who walks the Halls of Congress.   It seems that in Texas if you can't conform with the law or you don't  want to, then you just simply change the law.                                time  1400    And that is what they seek to do now, to change the law, rather than  allow the diversity to exist that we currently see. They would change  the law and roll back the clock; and I assure you, the diversity that  we currently experience would cease to exist.   So I am here to say that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 must be  reauthorized. It must be.   I understand that the Supreme Court seems to be hostile to the rights  of minorities, hostile to the rights of women. My dear friend, Ms.  Ocasio-Cortez, spoke quite eloquently on the subject.   I indicated that this was my last topic, as it relates to the cult in  Texas, but I do have to confess that in Texas, the former GOP, now the  cult of Trump, bans abortions, or would ban abortions--this is what  they codified and published--would ban abortion from the moment of  fertilization. That means that there would be no legal abortions in  Texas from the moment of fertilization.   I do have sympathy for women who are raped. There would be no  options, from the moment of fertilization. It appears, at least to  some, that this would also mean, even if the mother's life is in  question. This is as draconian as a law can be.   Women should have the right to choose. It is their body. I can have  opinions, but they have to deal with the reality. And it is not an easy  reality for many women to confront.   So this is something they should have the opportunity to talk about  with their most trusted confidantes and make hard choices. I don't wish  the choice upon anyone, but I do think that women ought to have that  choice.   And my hope is that, as I indicated earlier, I live long enough to  see a Supreme Court that will realize that Roe v. Wade--the decision in  Roe v. Wade was a decision that gave women the opportunity to make  choices that only they should have the opportunity to make.   Mr. Speaker, these are some very difficult times. I see many people  celebrating. But I also know that when I called a friend to discuss  this, there were many tears being shed. And not everybody is happy  today. For many people, this is a very dark day in the life of our  country.   Just yesterday, or the day before--the days run together sometimes  when you are up late--the Supreme Court ruled that you can carry your  gun openly, notoriously.   I don't want to live in a world where my safety is dependent upon my  having an automatic Kalashnikov model 47, or some replica of an AR-15.  I don't want my safety to depend upon my being--having the quickest  draw. I don't want to resolve my disputes with a gun.   I just think this is a very difficult time for us. And my prayer is  that we will have persons in the Senate who will understand that there  is little time left for us to make a difference.   We have the House, meaning Democrats. We have the Senate, and we have  the Presidency. There is just little time left. But there is enough  time left for us to make a difference if we choose to.   And my prayer is that those Senators will understand that either we  take up our agenda now, or we risk not having the opportunity to take  it up within the foreseeable future. That is what we risk.   I hope that they will see that now is the time to deal with a woman's  right to choose. The legislation is there.   Now is the time to deal with gun safety laws that can prevent 18- year-olds from having weapons of war.   Now is the time to take up voting rights, so that all persons will  have an equal opportunity to serve.   Now is the time to take up an agenda that will make America the  beautiful a more beautiful America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
