 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to implore my colleagues to  join me in the fight to protect the most vulnerable in our society,  infants who survive abortions.   Again and again, more than 75 times, Democrats have refused to even  allow a vote on my legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors  Protection Act. This, Mr. Speaker, is shameful.   Every child should be welcomed with joy and wonder, no matter the  circumstances of their birth. I will not stop working until this  legislation is passed and signed into law, so all newborns have a  chance at life.   Just 2 hours ago, Representative Kat Cammack filed a discharge  petition so that Democrats can't continue to block the Born-Alive Act.  It is my sincerest hope that every Member of Congress, Democrat or  Republican, finds the courage to add their name to this petition. This  is the simplest decision that any of us can make. Do you support babies  receiving lifesaving care after they are born, or would you deny these  children that care and murder them or leave them to die in front of  you?   I am challenging Congress to stand up and do the right thing. I urge  my colleagues to sign the discharge petition to ensure no American  child is denied medical care.                            ____________________
