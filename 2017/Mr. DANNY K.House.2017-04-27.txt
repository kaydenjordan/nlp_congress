 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, April is National  Minority Health Month, and I have pledged to use every opportunity that  I can to promote awareness, greater understanding, and direction toward  solutions to some of our health needs and problems.   I have with me today a statement from one of the staff members in my  district office who describes what it is like to live with sarcoidosis.   She begins her statement by saying:         Hello. My name is Shonna Latrice Smith, and I have       sarcoidosis. Living with sarcoidosis has been a tough battle       for me, not knowing what other parts of my organs could be       affected by this terrible disease.        I began having symptoms of experiencing hoarseness for       months at a time, swollen lymph nodes, loss of weight, loss       of breath, severe joint pain with deformity in my fingers. My       face and arms showed noticeable skin lesions with severe       swelling. I experience most mornings chronic dry coughs that       feel like my chest would burst open.        After a series of blood tests, X-rays, pulmonary testing,       and skin biopsies, test results indicated sarcoidosis, I       began to have anxiety attacks. Because I had no clue where,       when, and how I contacted this disease, I didn't know if it       would affect the longevity of my life. I began with small       doses of prednisone orally to treat inflammation and       swelling, including steroid injections to my face, arms, and       fingers to reduce swelling.        My battle with sarcoidosis has affected my getting up,       walking with struggling not to lose my balance due to my       joints being stiff and sore. Doctors begin treating me for       rheumatoid arthritis with a medication called methotrexate, a       chemotherapy agent and immune system suppressant to treat       autoimmune diseases and rheumatoid arthritis.        After taking methotrexate for about a year, doctors saw no       change in the swelling of my hands and face, so I began       taking a new medication called Plaquenil also used to treat       rheumatoid arthritis, skin diseases, and autoimmune diseases.       I am currently taking prednisone to continue to treat severe       swelling for my face and hands.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Smith for sharing this information and this  experience with us. Therefore, I urge that we continue to support  research so that we may find more effective treatment and a cure for  sarcoidosis and other disease entities.   It is my position that health is wealth. We can have all of the other  attributes of life, but if we have chronic disease that has not been  cured or for which we are not sure of a cure for, then that takes away  from the quality of life for the individuals with those experiences.  Therefore, I reiterate that research could be the answer.                            ____________________     DAVIS of Illinois (for himself, Ms.               Adams, and Mrs. Beatty):        H.
