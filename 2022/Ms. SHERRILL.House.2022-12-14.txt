 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1437, the  ``Providing Research and Estimates of Changes in Precipitation,'' or  ``PRECIP Act.''   I am the proud author of the PRECIP Act, a bipartisan measure to  address flooding--the most common and widely experienced natural hazard  both in the nation and in my northern New Jersey district. My  commitment to this bill is grounded in the painful experiences of my  New Jersey constituents devastated by flooding who, sadly, know the  life-and-death impact of lacking precise and accurate forecasts ahead  of flooding caused by extreme rainfall. Flooding is pernicious  throughout this country, not just in coastal areas, and for that  reason, the practical tools enabled by this bill benefit all Americans,  and the bill has enjoyed bipartisan support.   Flooding can occur from major multi-state events--like Tropical Storm  Ida, which swept away a woman in Woodland Park in my district and took  the lives of 27 New Jerseyans--or smaller localized rainfall that  causes flash flooding, like five inches of sudden rainfall that swept  through Parsippany, New Jersey, in just hours last October.   The PRECIP Act improves local forecasting of these events by  requiring NOAA to update outdated rainfall data that has hampered the  accuracy of forecasting. It also ensures this data is updated more  frequently going forward, accounts for future impacts due to climate  change, and requires development of best practices to estimate maximum  precipitation amounts.   I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle of the  Science Committee, Chairwoman Johnson, and Senators Booker and Wicker  for their support of the PRECIP Act. I urge my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to support the passage of this bill.
