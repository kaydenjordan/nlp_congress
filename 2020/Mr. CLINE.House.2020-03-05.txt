 Mr. Speaker, Virginia Military Institute is world renowned  for many achievements, but I rise today to recognize VMI for producing  one of the highest numbers of Fulbright Scholars, nationally, for the  2019-2020 academic year. This world-renowned program seeks to improve  cultural relationships through the exchange of students, faculty, and  ideas.   The three bright individuals to receive this prestigious honor are  Second Lieutenant Annika Tice, Colonel Howard Sanborn, and Colonel  Geoff Jensen.   One of only 2,200 students who received a scholarship last year,  Second Lieutenant Tice used her Fulbright to educate others and taught  English in the Ivory Coast.   Colonel Sanborn, a professor of international studies and political  science, used this opportunity to study legislative politics in Hong  Kong.   Colonel Jensen, a professor of history, will conduct research in  Madrid this coming summer.   Sanborn and Jensen were among only 470 faculty to receive a Fulbright  distinction this year.   With more colleges and universities than nearly any other district in  the country, I am proud that these three individuals exemplify the  talent that the Sixth District attracts.   Congratulations to VMI on this noteworthy accomplishment.                            ____________________
