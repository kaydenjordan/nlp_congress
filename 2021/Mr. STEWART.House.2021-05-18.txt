 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Hill, and  my colleagues. I especially thank my cosponsor from New Hampshire for  her support and her words today.   Madam Speaker, much has been said, so I will be brief.   I obviously stand before you in support of awarding the Ghost Army  veterans the Congressional Gold Medal. For more than 40 years, this  World War II unit of more than 1,000 soldiers was nothing more than a  myth; a bit of a ghost, if you will. More than 20 years ago, their  heroic actions were still classified until, finally, we could learn the  things that they had done.   Today, I ask my colleagues again, both Democrat and Republican, to  join me in giving these men and women the recognition that they really  deserve.   During our Nation's darkest hour, the Ghost Army did not shy away  from the fight. They saved thousands of lives. They stood eye-to-eye  against the axis of evil. They defeated fascism in Europe. To do so,  many of them made the ultimate sacrifice.   For those heroes who returned home, no one knew of their courage and  sacrifice; neither did many of them know of the great success that the  Ghost Army had had. They kept their top-secret mission and the  operations they did even away from their friends and family.  [[Page H2454]]    But, still, they have not been yet recognized by the Army or by this  Congressional body. We have the opportunity to right that wrong.   Today, there are only 11 members of more than 1,000 of the original  Ghost Army who still remain alive. And to this day, they continue to  embody the ideals that Americans strive for: Duty, honor, sacrifice,  courage, service.   Let's pass this bill. Let's give the Ghost Army heroes the highest  honor that we can.
