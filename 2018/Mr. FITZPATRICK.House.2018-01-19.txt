Northampton rose to the top of the list of 25 safest cities with over  39,000 residents with a score of 90.97, the top fifth percentile in the  entire Nation. The rankings are run by SafeHome, a professional  security organization dedicated to making communities safer.   This recognition would not have been possible without the dedicated  work of the entire Northampton Township Police Department and the  leadership of Police Chief Mike Clark. Every day, these men and women  put their lives on the line to protect their family, their friends, and  their neighbors.   Quoting Chief Clark, who said it best:         It is not just us; it is working hand in hand with our       residents, our administration and our board of supervisors,       our fire department, our rescue squads, our school district.       It is everyone working together that makes this a great place       to live.    Well said, Chief Clark. We are so proud of the emergency services,  governmental officials, and residents of Northampton Township. A job  well done.                            ____________________
