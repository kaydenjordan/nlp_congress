All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.

Sec. 5.  Each day during the period addressed by section 3       of this resolution shall not constitute a legislative day for       purposes of clause 7 of rule XIII.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Hastings), my dear friend, pending which I yield myself such time  as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time  yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the  underlying legislation.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3798, the Save American  Workers Act of 2018, and H.R. 5895, Energy and Water, Legislative  Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations  Act of 2019.   Mr. Speaker, today is quite an unusual day, not only for our Nation,  but also for Members of Congress. As a result of that, I have had a  discussion with my dear friend, Judge Hastings, and we have decided we  are going to try to expedite that which we do today, so all Members  need to be advised we might finish the process of the rule on the floor  some 55 minutes early   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying  legislation. The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3798, the Save  American Workers Act of 2018 and H.R. 5895, Energy and Water,  Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veteran Affairs  Appropriations Act, 2019.   Since 2010, the American people have been dealing with the impacts of  the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare. As we now know, Obamacare  contains a number of provisions that have greatly impacted the labor  market, the workforce, and employers of all sizes. At the broadest  level, the bill created massive mandatory spending spending programs  that have contributed greatly to the  [[Page H8182]]  country's debt and financial burdens on the American tax payer.   At the center of this is the employer mandate. The employer mandate  impacts hiring and employees' hours because it requires employers with  50 or more full-time employees to provide health insurance and carries  a specific fine for noncompliance. Under this, employees who work 30 or  more hours per week are considered full-time. In addition, complex  reporting requirements make the burden of this provision even greater  for employers.   The employer mandate requirement has resulted in employers reducing  workers' hours to 29 hours per week or less in an attempt to minimize  the mandate's devastating impacts. These reduced hours have caused  millions of workers to receive less take home pay.   The 30-hour rule does little more than discourage employment and  financial stability for American workers--especially low wage workers.  According to a Hoover institution study, 2.6 million Americans making  less than $30,000 were at risk of having their hours and wages cut as a  result of Obamacare's 30-hour rule.   H.R. 3798 would give employers and workers more flexibility by  changing Obamacare's definition of full-time worker from 30 hours per  week to 40 hours per week and from 120 hours per month to 174 hours per  month for full-time equivalents. In addition, the bill gives employers  retroactive relief from the employer mandate penalty. Thus, any  employer that owed a penalty for failing to provide coverage during  that period would no longer owe it, a big help to some our small  businesses.   The bill also includes a provision that will delay the implementation  of the Obamacare tax on high-cost health plans, known as the ``Cadillac  tax,'' until 2023, granting employers one additional year of relief  from the tax.   Finally, in light of the repeal of the individual mandate penalty,  H.R. 3798 removes burdensome regulatory requirements on some providers  of minimum essential coverage.   Mr. Speaker, this rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 5895,  Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and  Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019.   This three-bill Appropriations package provides funding for fiscal  year 2019 in three very important categories. This bill is a product of  members working across the aisle in a wonderful display of  bipartisanship and I am pleased to see this body take up such an  important measure.   The agreement addresses one of our fundamental responsibilities here  in Congress, taking care of our veterans. The bill provides $5.3  Billion above FY18 levels and ensures funding for VA medical care. It  funds VA medical care at $72.3 Billion, providing for 7 million veteran  patients to be treated in FY19. The bill strengthens veteran programs  like mental health care services, opioid abuse prevention, suicide  prevention, and rural veterans health initiatives. Additionally, the  legislation continues to rebuild infrastructure for our service members  and their families with $10.3 Billion for military construction  projects, an increase of $241 Million.   The second part of this appropriations package, energy and water,  prioritizes our national security and invests in American  infrastructure. The bill supports a strong nuclear national security  strategy with a total $560 Million above FY 18 levels for the  Department of Energy's nuclear weapons security programs. It also  provides a much-needed influx of funds into our nation's water  resources infrastructure by directing $7 Billion to the Army Corps of  Engineers.   Finally, the legislation directs a much-needed increase of $29.8  Million for our extremely dedicated and brave Capitol Police Officers.  This money will ensure their safety, the safety of our Capitol complex,  and the thousands of guests who visit every day.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the distinguished gentleman, his work with me is  appreciated. On behalf of not only Judge Hastings and myself, really,  the Rules Committee, which both of us represent, with great anxiety, we  recognize, as our Members do, about the storm that is headed to the  United States of America.   We want to wish all the people who are in the storm's way the very  best, but we are attempting to do what we can to make sure we complete  our work properly.   Thus, I ask for my colleagues to vote for this conference report,  which will do so much to move us not only to the point where we can  continue to work together, but to fund the important activities that  need to take place.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues support this bill and the  underlying bills.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good rule and so are the two underlying bills.  it has become abundantly clear that Obamacare has failed the American  people. Our nation's healthcare system is broken and only getting  worse.   The American people are counting on us to empower individuals,  families, and employers to spend their health care dollars the way they  want. They are counting on us to remove the federal government from  their health care and the first bill is another step in the right  direction.   The second bill is a wonderful example to bipartisanship--the package  isn't perfect, but it is a good bill. It takes care of our veterans and  our military, it provides much-needed funding for our infrastructure  and our waterways, and it ensures we are providing the Capitol Police  officers the funding they need.   I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bills.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
