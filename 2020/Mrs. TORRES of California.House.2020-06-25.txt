 Madam Speaker, with one word--one word-- George Floyd spoke to the conscience of this Nation in a way that  countless cries for justice were met with deaf ears before.   When George Floyd called out, ``Mama, Mama,'' he activated every  mother who saw that horrible video. We saw our own child with a police  officer's knee on their neck. We saw our own child being murdered  slowly, painfully.   As someone who spent 17\1/2\ years as a 911 dispatcher for LAPD  telling people, ``Don't worry. It will be okay. The police are on their  way,'' as someone with that background, my disgust is palpable for any  police officer who would harm the very same people they have sworn to  protect.   This was not an isolated incident. We don't have just a few bad  apples. We know the names of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Philando  Castile, and Michael Brown because George Floyd was far from the first.  And we know Rayshard Brooks' name because George Floyd is far from  being last.   So the Justice in Policing Act is long overdue and urgently needed.  It reforms qualified immunity so everyone who faces discriminatory  policing or  [[Page H2436]]  excessive force has an avenue for recourse. It creates a national  police misconduct registry to track officer misconduct. It improves  training and practices to make sure that officers are properly prepared  for the situations that we ask them to address, and much more.   I commend my colleagues for delivering this bill, and I thank  Chairman Nadler for working with me to strengthen the misconduct  registry included in it.   We have a long way to go as a country to heal the wounds that cut  back for generations. The Justice in Policing Act is an important first  step. I look forward to seeing it passed today and to the many steps  that will follow in the march for justice.
