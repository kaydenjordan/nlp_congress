 Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in crisis. Yesterday, the  United States added more than 1,000 names to the already unbearably  long list of 140,000 people killed by COVID-19. There have been nearly  4 million confirmed cases in the United States, and the CDC believes  the number is many times greater. There are hotspots around the  country, most notably in Southern States.   Many States like California and my State of Illinois that have taken  measures to reopen are now looking at rolling back these measures and  reinstating greater restrictions to keep their citizens safe.   The pandemic has affected all of us, putting our loved ones at risk,  keeping our kids from school, overwhelming our healthcare systems, and  devastating our businesses while costing 40 million people their jobs  and pushing State and local governments to the brink.   With so many people and communities suffering, we desperately need a  national strategy to beat back this virus. Unfortunately, while  families, students, community leaders, and citizens are all making  great sacrifices, and local governments are being forced to cut vital  services, leadership and support from the administration have  repeatedly fallen short. The American people deserve better.   All the sacrifices made since March were and are meant to buy us time  to bend the curve, knock down this virus, and, ultimately, stand up our  economy. But the sacrifices are only valuable if we are using the time  to prepare for what many experts believe will be a spike come the fall.   Sadly, around the country, testing capacity remains below where it  needs to be. Hospitals in many States are over capacity in their ICUs,  understaffed, and anxious about still looming shortages of personal  protective equipment, or PPE.   Six months into this pandemic, it is simply unconscionable that there  are still shortages of PPE, the masks, gloves, and gowns we need to  safely treat patients, protect workers and residents in our nursing  homes, confidently open our schools, and get our economy on the road to  recovery.   In Illinois, we have lost nearly 7,500 lives to this disease already.  With concerns that the disease may get worse this fall, and with  conditions already worsening as States struggle to reopen, I am calling  on Congress and the administration to take urgent action to address our  immediate needs while at the same time preparing for the challenges  that lie ahead.    It has been nearly 10 weeks since the HEROES Act passed the House and  was sent on to the Senate. States and local governments, hospitals and  nursing homes, and schools and businesses need the aid provided by the  HEROES Act. The Nation needs the supply chain czar included in the  HEROES Act. We all need the testing capacity funded by the HEROES Act.   Yet, after 10 weeks, the Senate still has neither taken up our  legislation nor offered a plan of their own. Instead, they are delaying  the Federal response to an urgent national crisis.   Ending this pandemic should not be a partisan issue. We need to move  forward together, Democrats and Republicans.   That is why I am asking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support the COVID PREPARE Act. I introduced this commonsense,  bipartisan legislation with my colleague,   John Katko, to assure the  American people that their Federal Government is prepared to address  this ever-changing public health crisis.   This legislation would require Federal agencies to submit to Congress  their plans for addressing COVID-19 in the fall, anticipating a  potential increase in infections and even greater demands on our  healthcare system and pressure on our economy.   The COVID PREPARE Act will provide bipartisan oversight and full  transparency into both the planning and execution of our national  response. We all certainly hope for the best, but we must responsibly  prepare for the worst.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I count among my life's greatest  blessings the distinction of being able to call John Lewis my colleague  and my friend.   Martin Luther King said the moral arc of the universe bends toward  justice. John Robert Lewis spent his entire life working to accelerate  and complete that bend fully committed to justice, to nonviolence and,  in his own words, to good trouble.   John Lewis' incredible capacity for love, his steadfast belief in  nonviolence, and his limitless humility inspired all of us, Democrat  and Republican, to be better. His singular character established him as  the conscience of the Congress.   I have too many personal stories to share in a short 1-minute speech,  enough stories, in fact, to more than fill the entire hour. I will hold  each of these treasured memories in my heart for the rest of my life.   I join with my colleagues to honor his legacy and together hope we  will continue his work bending that arc toward justice.   Rest in peace, John, knowing your memory will be a blessing to your  Nation and to all whose lives you touched.
