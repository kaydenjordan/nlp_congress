 I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business  for 90 seconds.    Madam President, I have two points I would like to  make. I have three bills designed to help students better understand  the actual cost of college because it is kind of a complicated thing to  determine because there is not enough transparency.   Colleges tend to think that having a high tuition is a reflection of  quality, which just means that they all have to offer more  scholarships. Between that and the complexity of Federal student aid,  price shopping for college is very difficult and some people might  think impossible. That is why I was glad to learn that one of Iowa's  well-respected private colleges, Central College in Pella, IA, has  lowered its tuition from $38,600 a year to $18,600 to better reflect  the actual cost. Yes, that is right--they reduced their college tuition  by $20,000 a year. Maybe Pella Central College will start a trend.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another point, Iowans, and  particularly veterans, mourn the loss of Chuck Geertz of Muscatine.  Sergeant First Class Geertz was an Active-Duty servicemember for 23  years but continued to serve his Nation after his retirement in 2009,  and this is how he did it: through establishing an organization in 2008  called Healing at English River Outfitters or, as he established the  acronym, HERO. That organization does great good. It provides veterans  and their families with relaxing outdoor activities for physical and  mental healing.   Chuck is remembered for his caring spirit and dedication to his  community and, most important, his fellow veterans. While he will be  missed, his legacy of community service will continue.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
