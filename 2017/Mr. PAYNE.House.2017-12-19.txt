 Mr. Speaker, what a disaster. The American people wanted a  Tax Code that works for them. Instead, my esteemed colleagues just  passed a tax plan that only works for crony capitalists and oligarchs.   The GOP tax plan is scamming hardworking American families in order  to line the pockets of millionaire real estate developers and people  who paint their toilet fixtures in their private jets gold.   Mr. Speaker, hardworking American taxpayers want jobs, investments in  our highways and railroads, fully funded children's healthcare, state- of-the-art schools, and well-paid teachers.   Oligarchs who own gilded skyscrapers, gold-leafed golf courses, and  real estate passthroughs want to drown in the excesses of wealth.   The American people wrote their Representatives. They called us. They  marched in the Halls of the Capitol for a democratic Tax Code. Instead,  they got a scam that takes away money from schools, police officers,  fire departments, and families. But I guess money talks.                            ____________________
