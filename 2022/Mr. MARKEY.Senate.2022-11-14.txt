 Mr. President, today I recognize Ms. Diane  Portnoy, a renowned educator, advocate, author, and CEO and founder of  the Immigrant Learning Center in Malden, MA. As the Immigrant Learning  Center celebrates its 30th anniversary, I am honored to acknowledge Ms.  Portnoy's extraordinary work.   As the founder and CEO of the Immigrant Learning Center, a nonprofit  organization located in Malden, MA, Ms. Portnoy has spent the last  three decades supporting the educational goals of thousands of  immigrants from more than 122 countries. Under Ms. Portnoy's  leadership, the organization has worked to draw attention to the many  plights that immigrants and refugees face and has helped to amplify  their voices.   Ms. Portnoy's own personal experience as an immigrant inspired her to  start the Immigrant Learning Center. She came to the United States as  the daughter of Polish Holocaust survivors and witnessed firsthand the  many challenges immigrant families face when adjusting to life in the  United States.   She began her career in education, receiving her bachelor's degree in  elementary education from Boston University, followed by a master's  degree in curriculum and instruction from Cornell University. Since the  founding of the Immigrant Learning Center, local and national groups  have recognized Ms. Portnoy as both a leader and advocate for the many  immigrants in Massachusetts. Her dedication, passion, and endless  resolve has helped shape the Immigrant Learning Center into an  organization that provides immigrants and refugees with scholastic  resources, ensures that adults have access to free English language  classes, disseminates educational information about immigration, and  conducts essential research on the contributions of immigrants to the  U.S. economy.   I am honored to take this opportunity to recognize Ms. Portnoy for  her tremendous achievements. She has touched many lives, and her work  at the Immigrant Learning Center will continue to have a lasting impact  on individuals across Massachusetts and beyond. So, on this 30th  anniversary of the Immigrant Learning Center, we thank her for her  service to her community, the Commonwealth, and the country.
