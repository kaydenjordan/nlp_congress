 Mr. President, there are, of course, two issues before  the Senate with respect to Judge Neil Gorsuch. The first issue is  simply, should or should not Neil Gorsuch be confirmed as an Associate  Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court? There is also a second issue, and  the second issue is, Should the Senate even be allowed to vote?    Those two questions are both important and interrelated. I want to  talk about the first one first.   I sit on the Judiciary Committee. We heard last week--2 weeks ago-- about 20 hours of testimony from Judge Gorsuch. I think he answered  about 200 questions in writing. One of the objections offered by our  friends on the other side of the aisle, the Democratic Party, was that  Judge Gorsuch refused to answer some of the questions. Now that is just  not accurate.   Many of the questions that were asked of the judge by both  Republicans and Democrats were fair questions--some of them, not so  much.   Judge Gorsuch was asked, in effect: What is your position on  abortion? How will you vote?   He was asked: How will you vote on gun control?   He was asked: How would you vote on cruel and unusual punishment, the  Eighth Amendment?   He was asked how he would vote on questions dealing with the Tenth  Amendment. He didn't answer those questions, and then he was criticized  for not answering those questions. He didn't answer those questions  because he couldn't. He is a sitting judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Tenth Circuit. Let me read to you canon 3(a)(6) of the Code of  Conduct for United States Judges. It states: ``A judge should not make  public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any  court.''   Let me read you rule 2.10(B) of the American Bar Association Model  Code of Judicial Conduct. It provides, and I quote: ``A judge shall  not, in connection with cases, controversies, or issues that are likely  to come before the court, make pledges, promises, or commitments that  are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative  duties of the judicial office.''   Now, say what you want about Mr. Gorsuch, but don't criticize him for  not violating the oath of his office and not making promises, pledges,  or commitments, like a politician, on how he would vote on the U.S.  Supreme Court, because Justices are supposed to decide the case on the  merits.   As I mentioned, I watched Judge Gorsuch answer questions personally  for over 20 hours. He was asked some other questions other than the  ones I have referenced, and I was intrigued by some of the questions  that Judge Gorsuch was asked. My friends in the Democratic Party kept  trying to draw distinctions with Judge Gorsuch between the parties in  cases that he had decided. My friends kept talking about the ``big  guy,'' the ``little guy,'' the corporation, the consumer, the employer,  the employee. The suggestion was made that Judge Gorsuch didn't vote  enough for the little guy or little gal, for whatever that means. What  struck me when he answered those questions was that we were supposed to  be talking about the faithful application of justice. Now, I was taught  in law school that Lady Justice is supposed to be blind, that neither  the wealth nor the power nor the status of the parties should matter.  That is why, in the picture that we see so often of Lady Justice, she  is blindfolded. She isn't looking at the parties at all to see whether  they are wealthy or not so wealthy. She isn't looking at the parties to  see whether they are a corporation or a consumer or what race they are  or what gender they are or what part of the country they are from. Lady  Justice is supposed to be blind because we are a nation of laws, not  men.   Of all the places in our country, an American court of law--and I am  very proud of this--is supposed to be the place of last resort, where  you can come and get a fair shake. That is how good judges operate.  They give everybody a fair shake. A good judge is supposed to make his  or her decisions based on the law, not the parties. Good judges are  supposed to be impartial--to call it like they see it, to call the  balls and strikes--and that is exactly what Neil Gorsuch has done  throughout his entire career.   I can promise that, as I sit on the Judiciary Committee, if any  President, whether he is a Republican or Democrat, ever brings a  nomination before the Judiciary Committee when I am on that committee  and that nominee starts talking about the wealth or the status or the  power of the parties and how it will influence or not influence his  decision, suggesting that will make a difference, I will vote against  that nominee--I don't care who nominates him--every single time,  because that is not American justice.   We talked about two cases in particular, and the Presiding Officer  has probably heard them talked about here on the floor. On the surface  they don't seem to be related. Judge Gorsuch ruled in both of these  cases, but I think they interact in a very important way. They tell us  that he doesn't play politics and he doesn't rule for the big guy just  because he is a big guy or the little guy just because he is a little  guy.   The first case we heard a lot about was a decision by Judge Gorsuch  called TransAm Trucking. You are going to hear a lot about that case.  In that case, Judge Gorsuch made a decision that was unfavorable to a  trucker, and he ruled in favor of the trucking company--little guy  versus big guy. Judge Gorsuch ruled for the big guy, and it is  important to know why and to look at the reasoning in that case and not  just the result.   During the discussion on the case, Judge Gorsuch made it very clear  that he only made that decision because he believed that was what the  statute controlling the facts of the case required--a statute that was  passed by a legislative body duly authorized by the people that make  the law. Unlike our courts, which are supposed to interpret the law,  Judge Gorsuch did not decide the case the way he did because he didn't  sympathize with the trucker. He decided that case the way he did  because he was doing his best to accurately apply the law, as best he  understood it, to the facts before him. Once again, that is what is  called justice--blind to the parties.   Actually, Judge Gorsuch has explained himself and what he thinks  about decisions such as this. He did it in another case that I will  talk about in a moment. Judge Gorsuch said:         Often enough the law can be ``a[n] ass--a[n] idiot''--    Quoting, of course, Charles Dickens--       and there is little we judges can do about it, for it is (or       should be) emphatically our job to apply, not rewrite, the       law enacted by the people's representatives. Indeed, every       judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a bad       judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than those the       law compels.    Now, that statement came from the second case I referenced. It was a  case called A.M. Holmes. In A.M. Holmes, a 13-year-old seventh grader  was arrested for fake burping repeatedly in class. The majority said it  was OK for him to be arrested and that, when his family sued the police  officer, the police officer enjoyed qualified immunity.   Judge Gorsuch dissented. This time he ruled for the little guy,  literally and figuratively. Judge Gorsuch said: ``In my opinion,  reading the statute passed by the legislature, this young man's family  can file this lawsuit because disciplining a 13-year-old 7th grader for  fake burping in class by arresting him instead of disciplining him is a  bridge too far.''   Now, once again, we had a little guy versus the big guy. This time  Judge Gorsuch ruled for the little guy. But again, we have to look  beyond the result. Even though he ruled for someone we can all  sympathize with, Judge Gorsuch didn't base his decision on that. He  based his decision on a good-faith application of the statutes of the  facts controlling the case. He applied the law as written by the  legislature. That is what legislatures do, and that is what Congresses  do. They make the law and judges interpret the law. To be blunt, that  is what we want in a judge.   I want a judge. I don't want an ideologue. I am not interested in a  judge who will use the judiciary to advance his own personal policy  goals. I want a judge who will apply the law as written by the  legislature or, in the case of the Constitution, as written by the  Framers of the Constitution, as best that judge understands the law,  not to try to reshape the law as he wishes it to be.   To just comment about the last question that I raised earlier, again,  one  [[Page S2202]]  issue is whether or not we should confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme  Court, but the second issue is whether the Senate should even be  allowed to vote at all. That is what this is all about when you distill  it down to its basic essence.   We are going to hear a lot about cloture, and we are going to hear a  lot about the nuclear option. But this is what it boils down to: Should  we or should we not even be able to be allowed to vote?   Now I understand that reasonable people can disagree. I also  understand that unreasonable people can disagree, and everybody in this  body has a vote, and we all represent States. There are two Senators  from every State--big States and little States--and everybody is  entitled to be able to vote his or her conscience. But it is very, very  important not only for the American judicial system but for American  democracy that the Senate be allowed to vote on Judge Gorsuch.   So to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I would say: Please  allow us to vote. You can vote for or against Judge Gorsuch. I will not  second-guess your judgment if you act sincerely, and I believe many of  my colleagues are sincere. They are wrong, but they are sincere. But  please allow the Senate to vote on this nomination. That is why I was  sent to Washington.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, Senator Graham, my fellow Senators, our  constituents in the Gallery, a lot of what has gone on today may seem  very complicated. We have heard a lot of terms being thrown around:  cloture, the nuclear option. Yet, really, the question that we were  faced with today in the Senate was very simple, and it continues to be  pretty simple and straightforward, in my judgment: Should we have an  up-or-down vote on the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an  Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court?   Earlier today, the Senate voted to do that. I think it is very  important for the American judicial system and for the American system  of democracy that the U.S. Senate be allowed to vote on Judge Gorsuch's  nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. It was not enough to only vote on  a motion to end debate; we also needed to be allowed to vote on the  actual nomination with ``yes'' or ``no.''   Unfortunately, our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle  decided to filibuster in order to make it impossible for us to vote on  this crucial nominee without modifying the rules of the U.S. Senate.  That is what we did earlier today. I do not know that anybody did it  happily, but certainly a majority of the Senate believed that the  American people deserved an up-or-down vote, yea or nay. Stand up and  be counted in front of God and country. Do you want Judge Neil Gorsuch  to be on the Supreme Court, or do you not? That vote is going to take  place tomorrow afternoon.   The Constitution reads that the President of the United States of  America ``shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the  Senate shall appoint . . . judges of the Supreme Court.'' I do not need  to tell you that this is an extremely important part of our separation  of powers. It is vital to our protecting the integrity of the Supreme  Court, the work that all of us do--not just members of the Judiciary  Committee but every Member of the Senate--in vetting our nominees and  making sure they are qualified and independent, as is Neil Gorsuch. He  is enormously important for the protection of liberty itself.   Let's not ever forget what we are protecting. We are protecting  justice, and we are protecting liberty. We are not supposed to be  protecting a certain point of view. We are not supposed to be  protecting a certain policy preference. We are not supposed to be  protecting a certain political party.   I hope tomorrow, when we finally get the opportunity to vote up or  down on Neil Gorsuch for his membership on the greatest tribunal in the  history of civilization, in my judgment, the U.S. Supreme Court, that  we will consider his nomination in light of how it will affect our  country, not our party. When we look at his nomination from that  perspective and leave the politics of the last few years in the  rearview mirror, I think we can analyze his nomination with a lot more  clarity.   Alexander Hamilton, whom I think most Americans admire, said in  Federalist No. 78 that the Court has ``neither force nor will but  merely judgment.'' I think that is what we are all looking for--or  should be--in a nominee to any court but especially to the  [[Page S2403]]  U.S. Supreme Court. We are not looking for somebody with a certain  policy preference. We are not looking for people with ideas of how the  law can be improved because the role of a judge is not to make law, it  is to interpret the law as made by the legislative body as best that  judge can understand it. That is why we need someone like Neil Gorsuch,  in my estimation, who has good judgment.   I sit on the Judiciary Committee. I have spent 20 to 40 hours with  Neil Gorsuch or with people who know him well, in hearing their  testimony. I have read his opinions. As far as I am concerned, he is as  good as it gets. I cannot imagine that President Trump could have  picked better.   He is a thoroughbred. He is a legal rock star. If you read his  opinions, you will see that he is painstaking in his application of the  law to the facts before him. He writes beautifully. His communication  skills are absolutely amazing. His analysis and analytical rigor are  clear and concise. His decisions are wise and disciplined, and he is  faithful to the law. He is an intellectual, not an ideologue. He is a  judge, not a politician. He is whip-smart, has clear writing, is a  strict constitutionalist, likes snow skiing, fly fishing, and is a  fourth-generation Coloradan. I think he will serve every person in our  country well as a member of the Supreme Court. That is why I am  supporting him.   Let me say one final thing. I do not think there is any vote that  will be more important than the vote we will take tomorrow on a  President's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, so I want to choose  my words carefully. Not a single, solitary vote is more important than  that vote we will take tomorrow. That is not to say that there are not  other important issues before this body. That is why I think it was so  important today that we decided to vote up or down on Judge Gorsuch so  that we can move on to those other important issues--jobs, jobs, jobs;  designing a healthcare delivery system that looks like somebody  designed it on purpose, which our Acting President has worked so hard  on; infrastructure; elementary and secondary education; a skilled  workforce. I could go on.    There is an enormous amount of pain in America today. There are too  many Americans who are not participating in the great wealth of  America--not economically, not socially, not culturally, and not  spiritually. We have been elected in the Congress to do something about  that.   I talk to people in my State every day, and I know the Presiding  Officer does too. The people of Louisiana are fun-loving, God-fearing,  and plain-talking, and this is what they tell me: Kennedy, this country  was founded by geniuses, but sometimes I think it is being run by  idiots.   They say: Kennedy, we look around our country today, and here is what  we see. We see too many undeserving people at the top--I want to  emphasize ``undeserving'' because I don't want to paint with too broad  a brush--who are getting bailouts, and we see too many undeserving  people at the bottom who are getting handouts. We are in the middle,  and we get stuck with the bill. We cannot pay it anymore, Kennedy,  because our health insurance has gone up, our kids' tuitions have gone  up, and our taxes have gone up. I will tell you what has not gone up-- our income.   These are real people with real problems, and they sent all of us  here because they are real mad and they expect us to do something about  it.   The sad truth is that our children's generation is at risk of  becoming the first in America, unless this body does something, to be  worse off than their parents' generation because in our country today,  for too many Americans, it is harder than ever to get ahead. That is  why so many Americans feel stuck. They feel like the hope and change  they were promised has become decline and uncertainty, and they are  looking to us to do something about it.   So let's vote. Let's vote tomorrow. I understand reasonable people  disagree. I understand unreasonable people can disagree too. But I am  going to vote for Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the U.S.  Supreme Court. Then I am going to ask this body to move on to other  important issues that are keeping moms and dads awake at night when  they lie down and try to go to sleep.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
