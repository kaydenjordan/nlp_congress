 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Liberty  Christian Academy Bulldogs on winning the VHSL baseball Class 3 State  title game.   The academy was founded in 1967, and in addition to its academic and  biblical teachings, the school excels in sports. Their baseball State  title this year marked their second State crown, as they won the 4A  State title in 2017.   This game all came down to the seventh inning at the field in  Spotsylvania, Virginia. Their opponent, the Abingdon Falcons, had taken  the lead in the top of the seventh when Lane Duff of the academy walked  three straight batters, sending home Cole Lambert for the go-ahead run.   The Falcons scored again on a bases-loaded walk to Jack Ferguson that  scored Daniel Fellhauer and made it 5 to 3.   Yet, when the Bulldogs got their chance in the bottom of the seventh,  they started a rally as Logan Duff led off with a triple. Then a sac  fly by Tanner Thomas scored Duff to cut the Abingdon Falcons' lead to 5  to 4.   Finally, Lane Duff's two-run, walk-off single marked a three-run  Liberty Christian Academy rally that propelled the Bulldogs to a 6 to 5  win last Saturday in the coveted VHSL Class 3 State title game.   Congratulations to the players, coaches, and parents on a great  season.                            ____________________
