 Madam President, I want to thank my colleague from New  York. Many of the things he has said on the floor this morning reflect  what I have seen back in Illinois in the last 5 or 6 weeks that we have  been home, people I have spoken to who are genuinely suffering because  of the coronavirus pandemic and the state of the American economy.   There was a moment here on the floor of the Senate earlier this year  when the gravity of the situation brought us together. It was March  26--almost 6 months ago--when we voted 96 to 0 to pass the CARES Act,  the $3 trillion effort to try to keep America's economy alive and  breathing during this pandemic and the impact it has had on all of our  lives. That is $3 trillion--money for the unemployed, substantial sums  for those who are about to see their lives transformed overnight. Laid  off and fired from jobs that may never return, they tried to keep their  families together with mortgage payments, rent payments, automobile  loans, the credit responsibilities they faced, and just putting food on  the table.   It was a wrenching, disquieting situation for so many of those  families, and we said that we should give them $600 a week--$600 a  week--in Federal assistance to get through this period. What we did not  only helped those families, but it helped the economy. The money those  families received was spent almost instantaneously. That is  understandable. They are struggling to survive.   But we knew that the program we enacted on March 26 had a termination  date of July 31. We hoped that by then the pandemic would be behind us,  our economy would be recovering, and we wouldn't need any further  relief. We were wrong--terribly wrong. We still face this coronavirus  in a way that we never expected 6 months ago. It is still a challenge-- a terrible challenge that has claimed over 180,000 American lives to  date.   I could speak for a few minutes here about our response as a nation  to this pandemic and talk about the lack of leadership from the very  top in Washington when it came to dealing with this public health  crisis, but suffice it to say for the moment that two numbers tell the  story. The United States has 4 percent of the world's population.  Sadly, we have 20 percent of the COVID-19 deaths in the world.   The United States has not responded as expected. Innocent people have  died. The situation was chaotic in the White House. The leadership we  needed wasn't there.   Where are we today? Here we are in the second week of September.  Where are we now as we reflect on the situation? Many of us believe we  still face a grievous, serious challenge and need to respond  accordingly, but others see it differently.   Senator McConnell, the leader on the Republican side, is going to  offer a proposal tomorrow that is a fraction--a fraction--of what was  offered on March 26 to deal with this crisis. Many people, obviously on  the Republican side, feel that America is headed in the right direction  and therefore we don't need to make a substantial investment in people,  in businesses, and in the health and resources of this country.   For those who come to the floor and argue that America is headed in  the right direction, three-fourths of the American people disagree with  them. You see, in a survey taken just 2 weeks ago, 75 percent of the  American people said America is headed in the wrong direction. So when  the Republicans come up with a modest--almost immodest--proposal that  they are going to bring to the floor tomorrow, they disagree with  three-fourths of the American people.   Many of them obviously believe that we don't have to make a massive  investment in helping families who are fighting unemployment, helping  businesses to survive. They must believe that the worst is behind us.  Well, it turns out that two out of three of the American people  disagree with them. That is right--two out of three in a recent survey  in America said the worst is still ahead. Wrong direction, 75 percent;  the worst is still ahead, two-thirds.   What is the response on the Republican side? First, it was silence.  You see, it has been almost 4 months now since the House of  Representatives, under the Democratic leadership of Speaker Pelosi,  passed the Heroes Act--a $3 trillion investment to make sure that we  stood by the families who were unemployed, to make sure that we put  money into the hands of businesses that needed to survive, to make  certain that we had adequate testing across the United States, to give  money to schools so that they could weather this crisis as they  readjust to the challenges they face, and to put money in the hands of  hospitals and providers that in some cases are just hanging by a thread  because of the state of the economy and this medical challenge. That is  what Speaker Pelosi did almost 4 months ago.   In the meantime, in that 4-month period, the Republican leader of the  Senate has done nothing--nothing. He didn't bring a bill to the floor.  He didn't pass a bill and call for a conference committee. In fact,  during this entire period of time, the Republican leader in the Senate  has refused to personally attend the negotiations between the White  House and congressional leaders. Both he and House Republican Leader  McCarthy have boycotted any negotiation sessions. Any persuasion they  want to bring to the issue, they bring to the floor of the Senate in  speeches, not behind closed doors, where compromise is reached and  where, in fact, we were successful last March, passing the CARES Act.   So now we face a challenge as a nation. Which party will stand up for  America to weather this crisis and come out strong? The Democrats have  a proposal. We have had it for 4 months.   The Republicans, tomorrow, will offer a skinny--some say emaciated-- version of that proposal. They want to take the assistance to  unemployed Americans--800,000 of them in my home State, millions across  the Nation--and cut it in half. Did Senator McConnell get a news flash  that I missed that mortgage payments will be cut in half as of  tomorrow, that rental payments will be cut in half as of tomorrow, that  car payments will be cut in half, that the cost of food will be cut in  half? Not at all.   We know these families will face the same obligations and, under the  Republican proposal, receive a fraction of what they were given and  have received between March and the end of July. That is unfair to  these families.   I know what is happening in food banks across Illinois, and I am sure  it is the same case in Kentucky, perhaps in Georgia, perhaps in New  York. People are flooding these food banks asking for help. Some of  them are embarrassed by their situation. They shouldn't be, but they  are. Many people who used to volunteer at these same food banks are now  standing in line, looking at their shoes, hoping to take enough food  home to make it through a week.   That is the reality, but it is not the reality that is reflected in  the Senate action this week. What we have from Senator McConnell is a  small effort at a time when America needs a substantial effort to deal  with not only the situation facing our economy but also the  coronavirus.   I am troubled, too, because I represent a State that is so diverse,  with the great city of Chicago but all the way downstate--my roots-- smalltown America, rural America. Many of the  [[Page S5483]]  hospitals and healthcare providers in those areas are literally  struggling to survive. They are looking to Washington for a helping  hand. Do you know what it means to smalltown America to lose a  hospital? It is devastating, not only from the viewpoint of healthcare  and emergency care, which is unavailable on a timely basis in many  places, but also because it is hard to keep a business or attract a  business if you don't have quality healthcare nearby. Many of those  hospitals are struggling to keep the lights on and survive, and they  will not make it unless we step up.   So what is included in the Republican proposal when it comes to these  healthcare providers, to increasing Medicaid assistance to them, for  example? Virtually nothing. I can't understand this. I have to believe  that the Republican leadership representing States with small towns and  rural populations are hearing exactly what I am hearing in downstate  Illinois. Yet, when it comes to a proposal on the floor, they are doing  nothing--nothing.   Let me just add, in closing here, if we don't take testing seriously  in America, we cannot be serious about reopening the economy, reopening  schools, from colleges to kindergartens. That is the reality, to be  able to test in an effective, cost-effective way people who are  positive for this virus so that they are notified and stop from  circulating among those who are, at that point, healthy.   The testing investment by this bill on the Republican side doesn't  meet the challenge at all. They can't call for opening the economy on  one hand and ignore the responsibility for testing on another.   So where do we go from here? Well, tomorrow is a symbolic, partisan  vote on the Republican side when it should be much more. After it is  finished and we know the outcome, perhaps then the Republican leader in  the Senate will be willing to sit down and negotiate. Will he be  willing to occupy that empty chair in that negotiating room with the  White House and Democratic congressional leaders? Will he be willing to  sit down and actually work on a compromise comparable to the CARES Act  that passed here in March, earlier this year?   That is what it takes--not a speech on the floor, not a press  release, not a symbolic vote but something much more significant: the  willingness to sit down and acknowledge the obvious; that America is  heading in the wrong direction, and we should be heading in the right  direction.   Many people worry that the worst is yet to come. We want them to be  more hopeful and optimistic because we care, and if both parties do  care to help the unemployed, to help businesses, to make sure that our  healthcare providers have the resources that they need, then we can  start to address this coronavirus, this pandemic, with the leadership  that has been so lacking in the months that we have faced it this year.

Mr. President, let me say at the outset how proud I am to  serve with my colleague, Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois. Her  sacrifice for America is nothing short of amazing. Her life's story,  her commitment to the men and women in uniform whom she served with and  to the veterans and others, is now well established, not just in my  State but across this Nation.   Only a small minority of Americans have had the privilege and honor  of serving in the military. Many, like myself, count themselves as  those who respect the military and understand that they deserve that  respect for their willingness to volunteer to serve and even to die for  this Nation. What Senator Duckworth has done with her life is a clear  indication of the spirit of the fighting women and men who keep this  Nation democratic and safe.   I am really disappointed. What a great moment it would have been in  the history of the Senate if we had Republican support, as well as  Democratic support, for the Duckworth resolution. I am sorry the  Senator from Georgia objected. She took exception to The Atlantic  magazine article, the one that said the President called those who died  in war ``losers'' and ``suckers,'' but even that article has been  accepted by FOX News as being a valid comment made by the President and  reported.   Even if you take The Atlantic magazine and set it aside, there is  ample evidence of this President's attitude toward our military. We all  heard Donald Trump say publicly, when he was running for President in  2015, about our friend and colleague, the late John McCain: ``He's not  a war hero. . . . I like people who weren't captured.'' John McCain  spent more than 5 years in a prisoner-of-war camp in Vietnam, and this  President, Donald Trump, dismisses him as no war hero. John McCain  suffered for his Nation. He deserves the respect of everyone, let alone  the President.   We also saw Donald Trump publicly attack a Gold Star family in 2016,  the parents of the late Humayun Khan, an Army captain killed in Iraq in  2004.   We have heard President Trump dismiss traumatic brain injury faced by  servicemembers and veterans as just ``headaches.''   We have seen his silence in the face of reports that Russia offered  bounties to kill American servicemembers in Afghanistan.  [[Page S5495]]    We have witnessed his use of military officials for photo ops or as  his own personal security forces.   Recall the scene in ``A Very Stable Genius'' by Washington Post  reporters Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig in which Trump called the  service chiefs ``a bunch of dopes and babies'' and barked: ``You're all  losers. You don't know how to win anymore.'' President Trump repeated  those claims again in a news conference just this week.   These are just a few examples of not fake news but real news about  this President's attitude toward the American fighting men and women.  It is no surprise that he would say vile things privately if he would  say these things publicly.   Instead of respecting our troops, President Trump ridicules them.  Instead of bowing his head in humility, he barks insults and  obscenities. No President in our history--none that I can even  imagine--has been so juvenile, so abusive, and so cynical in speaking  of our fallen heroes. What do we hear from Republican officeholders  about these sickening comments? Very little, if anything, in objection.  Their silence is deafening.   I want to close by thanking my colleague, Senator Duckworth, for  bringing this matter to the floor of the Senate. Every Member of the  Senate--man, woman, Democrat, Republican--we all carry the flag and  proudly march in parades and give those inspirational speeches on  Memorial Day about the men and women who have served our Nation, but  where are the voices in the Senate today to speak out against the  outrages of this President?   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4549         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
