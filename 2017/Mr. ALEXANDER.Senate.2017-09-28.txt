 Mr. President, I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Tennessee.    Mr. President, I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Tennessee.    Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  explain my reason for the objection.   First, I would like to say to the Senator from Wisconsin that I am  grateful for her work on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee, where she is a valuable, diligent, and constructive member.  We work on a great many things together and have agreed to very many  things. However, we disagree on this one, and here is why. Let me  summarize it at the beginning of my remarks and then explain it with a  little more detail.   No one who has a Perkins loan today loses that loan, period. So if  you are a student anywhere in the country and you have a Perkins loan  for this year, you don't lose that loan, period.   Second, no one who has a Perkins loan for next year loses that loan  because no one has one. They were ended 2 years ago. Every student was  told in his or her financial aid information that the Perkins Loan  Program ends this year, so no one could expect to have one next year.  No one has been granted one for next year, so no one who has a loan is  losing a loan.   Why did we, in December of 2015--2 years ago--reach a bipartisan  agreement to sunset, or end, the Perkins Loan Program in 2 years, which  is the end of this week? In that agreement, we allowed graduate  students to receive Perkins loans for 1 additional year and  undergraduates to receive Perkins loans for 2 additional years. It was  made clear at that time--2 years ago--that this was the last time the  program would be extended, but we wanted to have a smooth transition,  and we did not want students and colleges and universities to be  surprised. That agreement, therefore, included many requirements for  institutions of higher education to inform students over the last 2  years that the Perkins Loan Program would end on September 30 of this  year, which is the end of this week. That agreement also set policies  to make the sunsetting of Perkins loans as smooth as possible for  students. The expiration of this loan program was not and should not  have been a surprise. It has not received any appropriation since the  year 2004, and the U.S. Department of Education reminded institutions  that it was ending the program this year.   Now, why? Why are we ending the program? Why did we agree to do that  2 years ago, and why have the last three Presidents recommended that we  end it--President Obama, President Trump, and President Bush?   The Department of Education estimated that in the 2016 to 2017 school  year--that is the school year that just ended--the Perkins Loan Program  provided less than $800 million in new Perkins loans to about 300,000  recipients. That may seem like a lot, but by comparison, the Department  estimated that the Federal Government disbursed over $22 billion to  almost 7 million undergraduate students in the Stafford Subsidized Loan  Program, or the regular Direct Loan Program. The Perkins loan--a  separate loan--provides an average loan of roughly $2,000, and it  illustrates the complicated mess in which students find themselves  because of our Federal student aid system today.   The Perkins loans have a higher interest rate than other loans that  are available to students today. The interest rate is 5 percent,  compared with 4.45 percent for undergraduate loans. And students who  have a Perkins loan aren't eligible for certain programs that exist for  students with other loans, such as the income-based repayment programs  and the public service loan forgiveness programs, which help students  manage repayment of their loans. Those aren't available to students  with a Perkins loan. The default rate for Perkins loans is higher than  for the Stafford loan.   The bill which the Senator from Wisconsin has offered would cost  taxpayers, according to the Congressional Budget Office, $900 million  for a 2-year extension. If we were to extend the program over 10 years,  it would cost $6.5 billion, according to the Congressional Budget  Office. The bill does not have an offset, so these billions of dollars  would only serve to add to the $20 trillion Federal debt we already  have.   I object because I think it is time for our country, through  legislation by this Congress, to move on to a simplified Federal  student aid program that has only one Federal loan for students, one  Federal grant for students, and one work-study program for students.   As I have spoken often about on this floor, along with Senator Bennet  from Colorado, we would like to reduce the application form for those  Federal grants and loans called FAFSA--the dreaded FAFSA which 20  million students and their families fill out every year. We would like  to reduce that from 108 questions to 2 or 5 or 10 questions.   We need a much simpler program for Federal student loans, and the end  of the Perkins Loan Program is a small step toward that end.   As I mentioned, President Bush recommended that the program end,  President Obama recommended that the program be changed and folded, in  effect, into the regular Direct Student Loan Program, and President  Trump has the same position.   I look forward to working with my colleagues, including the Senator  from Wisconsin, on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act  later this year, when we can work together to improve our Federal  student loan programs and our grant programs, find ways to simplify  them, make it easier and cheaper for students to attend college, and to  help students pay those loans off, after they get them, in a fair and  simpler way.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.    Mr. President, I will conclude my remarks because I  see the Senator from Mississippi is here.   Of course I will be glad to work with the Senator from Wisconsin. The  fact is, 2 years ago we agreed to end the program. The graduate loans  ended last year, and the undergraduate loans end this year. Everybody  was told about it.   Every student who wants a loan can get a direct student loan from the  government at a lower rate, with better repayment programs and better  payment provisions than the Perkins loan. So no one is losing a loan,  and everyone can get a better loan if they apply for a direct loan.   We do need a simpler program, and we need to simplify the application  process for applying for the loans and grants and for paying them off.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.    Mr. President, in 1985, when I was Governor of  Tennessee, I got a call from Don Hodel, the Secretary of the Interior  for President Reagan. He asked me to be the chairman of ORRRC 2, a  follow-up (commission to the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review  Commission, which was led by Laurance Rockefeller a generation earlier.  I agreed in part because of my love for the outdoors, but also because  Don told me that Gil Grosvenor would serve as vice chairman of the  commission and Pat Noonan would serve on the board.   The chance to work with them and the National Geographic Society made  the request to serve as chairman of the commission even more  attractive. My first act as chairman was to change the name from ORRRC  2 to the President's Commission on Americans Outdoors. The new name did  a better job of conveying our mission: ``to look ahead for a generation  and see what needs to be done for Americans to have appropriate places  to do what they want to do outdoors.''   More than a generation has passed now, and on this 30th anniversary  of the commission, we can look back on the recommendations of the  report and take an assessment.   Overall, the commission found that ``outdoor recreation occurs close  to home, in or near towns or cities where 80 percent of us soon will  live. So, more and more, the solutions must be found close to home. We  have concluded that the best way to assure that Americans will have  adequate outdoor recreation opportunities is through a prairie fire of  concern and investment, community by community. State and local  governments will play a major role, but implementation of our  recommendations ultimately will depend on the efforts of thousands of  individual citizens, nonprofit organizations, and businesses.''   The idea that outdoor recreation occurs close to home was especially  true for me.   I was one of the luckiest guys in the world growing up in Maryville,  in Blount County, TN.   When you grow up next to a national park, what do you do? You grow up  in the park. You spent your weekends and special times there, and most  all the memories I have are related to the Smokies.   When I was 15, my dad dropped me off at Newfound Gap on the day after  Christmas. I was with two other boys in 3 feet of snow, and my dad  said, ``I'll pick you up in Gatlinburg,'' which was 15 miles away. He  did, later that afternoon.   Then, later that same year, we were in Spence Field, and we made an  error in judgment. About 3 in the morning, I looked over, and I thought  one of my bunkmates was moving around, but it turns out it was a bear.  We left breakfast in our packs inside the tent, which is something you  should never do and something I have never done since. These are  memories that stick with us forever.   A generation earlier, in 1958, Congress created the Outdoor  Recreation Resources Review Commission to ensure America did not  neglect its heritage of the outdoors. The commission was chaired by  Laurance Rockefeller. Like me, Laurance Rockefeller was fascinated with  the natural world from a young age. His father, John D. Rockefeller,  Jr., was an enthusiastic supporter of park-building and historic  preservation. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., also had a hand in shaping my  childhood outdoor memories.   1872, Congress established Yellowstone National Park, carving the  park out of land already owned by the Federal Government. In the  following years, Congress followed this model, protecting and  preserving Federal acres out West. In the early 20th century, citizens  in the eastern part of the country began to push for national parks of  their own. However, the land was already privately owned and would need  to be purchased and donated to the Federal Government before a park  could be created.   In the late 1920s, $5 million was raised to create a new national  park in the Smokies on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina. The  two States had appropriated $2 million each for the effort and combined  that with $1 million in private donations, but that was only half the  money needed to purchase the land that was needed to create the new  park.   That is when John D. Rockefeller, Jr., stepped in and matched the  money that had been raised with a donation of $5 million through the  Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Fund. Rockefeller's donation assured  the purchase of the land and the creation of the Great Smoky Mountains  National Park, where I spent my childhood and still live next to today.   Nearly 25 years after the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was  established, John D. Rockefeller, Jr.'s son worked with Congress to  find solutions to continue to protect our Nation's treasures. The  Rockefeller Commission advocated for a Federal national recreation  policy ``to preserve, develop and make accessible to all Americans the  resources needed for individual enjoyment and outdoor recreation.''   The Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Wild and Scenic  Rivers System grew out of the recommendations of the report. Years  later, the President's Commission on Americans Outdoors reaffirmed our  commitment to these Federal programs, and we also took an important  step forward by recommending policies that States, towns, and  individuals could adopt. We focused on State and local action, calling  for investments from communities around the country to help keep our  outdoors great.   First, our commission recommended land trusts, ``private landowners  recognizing the opportunity to provide expanded recreation resources  and services to the public.'' Local land trusts have been one of the  fastest growing conservation tools in the past 30 years. These local  land trusts work with landowners who volunteer to preserve their  property through conservation easements. According to the Land Trust  Alliance's ``Land Trust Census,'' there are over 1,300 land trusts that  are active in the United States.   These 1,300 national, State, and local land trusts have conserved  more than 56 million acres as of the end of 2015, an increase of 9  million acres since 2010. In Tennessee, 15 active land trusts have  protected nearly 900,000 acres throughout the State. In 1999, Jeanie  Nelson and former Governor Phil Bredesen founded the land trust for  Tennessee. In less than 20 years, the land trust has  [[Page S6220]]  protected over 100,000 acres of Tennessee landscapes. In 2015, the  Foothills Land Conservancy, which ``is dedicated to protecting,  preserving, and enhancing the lands and environments of the Southern  Appalachian region,'' completed ``a record number 24 land partnerships  totaling 7,215 acres'' spanning five States and seven Tennessee  counties.   When our report came out 30 years ago, less than 5 million acres were  protected by State and local land trusts. Today more than 20 million  acres are protected by State and local land trusts. The explosion of  state and local land trusts has greatly increased access to our  country's outdoors.   Second, our commission recommended that ``local and state governments  create a network of scenic byways, compose of scenic roadways and  thoroughfares throughout the nation.'' We are seeing the benefits from  that recommendation today. In 1991, Congress created the National  Scenic Byways Program to recognize and protect roads for their  archaeological, cultural, historic, natural, recreational, and scenic  value.   Today, according to the Federal Highway Administration, there are 150  designated National Scenic Byways and American Roads in 46 States  throughout the Nation. Five of these national scenic byways pass  through Tennessee.   In the 1980's, as Tennessee was building new highways to attract the  auto industry, the State created 10,000 miles of State roads and scenic  highways. These roads, marked with mockingbird signs, prohibited new  billboards and new junkyards and allow people to enjoy the beauty of  the state as they drive across the country. These scenic byways bring  visitors to Tennessee and the beauty of our State keeps them coming  back.   Third, we recommended that ``communities establish greenways,  corridors of private and public recreation lands and waters, to provide  people with access to open spaces close to where they live, and to link  together the rural and urban spaces in the American landscape.'' Today,  there are almost 1,000 greenways and trails in Tennessee that provide  access to the outdoors to Tennesseans in their own communities.   A good national example of the popularity of greenways is the  dramatic increase in rails-to-trails projects across the country. In  communities throughout the Nation, unused railroad tracks and the land  surrounding the tracks are sold or donated and converted into to new  recreational trails.   According to the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy, there are over 22,000  miles of open trails that were converted from previous railroad tracks  and rights-of-way. In Tennessee, today there are over 30 rails-to- trails projects that cover 125 miles.   Fourth, we recommended full funding of the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, which was first proposed in Laurance Rockefeller's  Commission. The idea for the Land and Water Conservation Fund was very  simple. It was to say, ``When we have an environmental burden, we  should have an environmental benefit.'' If we are going to drill for  oil offshore for example, that is an environmental burden. We said  let's take some of those revenues and use them for an environmental  benefit.   So since the 1960s, we have used oil and gas revenues to conserve  important parts of America. Rocky Fork, in my home State of Tennessee,  is an excellent example of the productive use of LWCF funding. Ten  years ago, the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy, the  Appalachian Trail Conservancy, and the Conservation Fund began working  with the U.S. Forest Service, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency,  and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to protect  Rocky Fork, a 10,000-acre tract in Tennessee within the Cherokee  National Forest.   In 2015, working together and using Land and Water Conservation Fund  dollars, Federal, State, and local partners saved the largest  unprotected tract of land in the Southern Appalachians from  development. To make sure everyone could enjoy this natural treasure,  the State of Tennessee used some of the land to create the Rocky Fork  State Park. The State park--with its proximity to the Appalachian  Trail, miles of native brook trout streams with cascades and  waterfalls, historic battle site, Black Bear Reserve, significant  wildlife habitat and scenic vistas--may 1 day be the State's most  popular park. It wouldn't have been possible without tree Land and  Water Conservation Fund.   As chairman, I also called on my fellow Governors to establish State- level outdoor commissions. Twenty-five States responded by establishing  commissions or holding Governors' forums. Seven additional States had  recently completed conferences on the topic in anticipation of a  national study. The purpose of my call to the Nation's Governors was  ``to stimulate action at the local and state levels on behalf of the  outdoors. More than 2,000 people testified at hearings or participated  in meetings sponsored by States in 1986.'' The Tennessee State-level  outdoor commission, Tennesseans Outdoors, sought to ``look 40 years  down the road, to consider what people will want to do outdoors, and to  see that there will be places for them to do those things.''   The Tennessee Commission recommended setting aside special places  throughout the State, making the most of the State's resources,  ensuring a quality environment, spreading the word on the importance of  the outdoors and recreation, and providing stable funding for important  conservation and outdoor recreation projects. Specifically, one of the  report's recommendations was for cities to promote urban open space  preservation and riverfront planning. Today all of my home State's  major metropolitan areas have taken steps to implement this  recommendation.   In 2004, Memphis adopted the Memphis Riverfront Master Plan, and the  city has been making progress on riverfront redevelopment. Just 3  months ago, the Big River Crossing--the longest public pedestrian and  bike bridge across the Mississippi River--opened in Memphis.   In 2005, the city of Chattanooga completed the 21st Century  Waterfront Project, which redeveloped 129 acres ``along the river to  create multiple public spaces and opportunities for citizens to enjoy  Chattanooga's waterfront.''   In 2006, Nashville began the process to revise the Nashville  Riverfront for the 21st Century to ``provide new public attractions,  parkland and waterfront access, giving residents and visitors a reason  to come and enjoy both banks of the Cumberland River.''   Also in 2006, Knoxville adopted the Knoxville South Waterfront Vision  Plan to implement an improvement strategy for 750 acres along the 3- mile shoreline of the Tennessee River that flows through Knoxville.   Last year, the Tennessee Wildlife Federation called for the State to  create a forum on Tennessee's great outdoors to ``assess the current  status of our state's natural resources, identify critical challenges  facing their management and conservation, and develop strategic  solutions to ensure their persistence well into the future.''   When advocating for a new forum, Mike Butler, the CEO of the  Tennessee Wildlife Federation, acknowledged the success of the  implementation of many of the recommendations of the Tennesseans  Outdoors report, but also recognized that much has changed over the  last 30 years and ``these changes have had a profound effect on our  natural resources and outdoor recreation needs.'' Mike understands the  need to reexamine the issues facing our State's great outdoors and to  work together to maintain and expand the benefits that our outdoors  provide.   Like the State of Tennessee, 30 years ago, we looked at ways to help  our future generations enjoy the great American outdoors like we did.  Our report stated: ``We have learned over the course of our study of  urgent needs for action to protect our outdoor recreation estate.  Preservation of fast-disappearing open space, investment in  rehabilitation of deteriorating facilities, getting ahead of urban  growth as it races across the land--these are actions which cannot  wait, but must be taken now, for tomorrow they will be more expensive,  or in some cases, impossible.''   From land trusts to greenways to scenic highways, many of the  recommendations have been implemented, and we, as a country, have been  able to preserve some of our open spaces and protect our outdoor  recreation estate.  [[Page S6221]]    One way to illustrate the success of these programs is to take a look  at the economic benefit of today's outdoor economy. According to an  Outdoor Industry Association economic study in 2012, outdoor recreation  generates $646 billion in consumer spending and 6.1 million direct jobs  each year. In Tennessee, outdoor recreation generates $8.2 billion  annually in consumer spending and supports 83,000 direct jobs across  the State.   Our work is not done. Theodore Roosevelt once said that nothing short  of defending this country in wartime ``compares in importance with the  great central task of leaving this land even a better land for our  descendants than it is for us. . . .''   On the 30th anniversary of the Americans Outdoors Commission report,  I look forward to continuing to work to protect and preserve the great  American outdoors and leave future generations a more beautiful nation.                            ____________________
