 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, 58 days--58 days--is the amount of time since the  administration asked and said there was a crisis on the border, that  they needed funding.   Madam Speaker, 18 times--18 times--we had the opportunity to take a  vote on this floor, and we did not come to a solution, and it did not  pass.   Madam Speaker, two times--two times--The New York Times wrote  editorials in those 58 days calling upon this body to put politics  aside, that this crisis on the border was greater than the politics  that we want to play.   The Mexican Government realizes there is a crisis on the border and  just sent 15,000 troops. We have seen the pictures. We have heard the  words. On either side they talk of it.   We were in this well just a few days ago having a debate. Many of us  said: Why would we take this moment to do a political maneuver that  will not go anywhere in the Senate?   Don't take our word for it. Take the votes for it. The bill did not  pass.   There is a time for every season. The season to continue to play  politics is over. The season to put people before politics is now.   Don't take my word for it. Take the example of the Chamber that is  just across the way. It is not far. You can see it if you look out  those doors; you can walk it without taking much breath; and you can  understand what bipartisanship looks like, Madam Speaker.   The Senate took up a bill to take up this crisis. The vote was 84-8.                                time  1145    Madam Speaker, 84-8. There has been historic legislation that was  passed with much less, but there have been very few that have ever been  defeated that have gone 84-8.   But today, we are going to take hours to learn the exact same  experience that we had just a few, short hours ago. The 84-8--when I  listen to the other side and say that this--the Democratic Party, Madam  Speaker, wants to do this.  [[Page H5228]]    Let me read the names of some of those who voted for this bill to  understand what bipartisan sounds like: Senator Chuck Schumer, Senator  Dick Durbin, Senator Tim Kaine, Senator Patty Murray, and Senator  Dianne Feinstein all voted ``yes.'' Every single member of the Senate  Democratic leadership voted ``yes'' to end the crisis on the border.   But why, Madam Speaker, are we on this floor now? Why does the  Democratic leadership on this side want to continue to play politics  when the Democrat leadership in the Senate says no?   Fifty-eight days is enough. Eighteen votes over there are too many.   But, yes, people are dying. But, yes, the money is out. We have all  acknowledged it on this floor.   Madam Speaker, it makes me begin to wonder, how can a few control so  many?   On that opening day, when we are on this floor, we all raise our hand  individually. We all swear to uphold the Constitution. Our names are  individually on the ballot when we are voted to come in here.   This is not a moment to let somebody else control your name or your  voting card. This is not a moment to say, my party tells me to go here,  because that is not the case.   Chuck Schumer is the leader of the Democratic Party. Dick Durbin is  the leader of the Democrats when it comes to immigration. I have spent  hours and months with Dick Durbin in a room trying to come to an  immigration agreement, and we have seen places far, far apart. We have  spent months trying to come to a conclusion.   But you know what? We have this time. We have found a more perfect  union when we found bipartisanship.   But are we going to allow a few to continue to deny it?   Fifty-eight days. You do not have more. The money is gone. The time  is now.   We all know that we are better than this. I do not accuse anybody on  either side of what they truly believe about a crisis. I have heard.   I have heard people on the other side of the aisle, Madam Speaker,  that said they want to vote for the Senate bill. Can we allow them to  vote for the Senate bill?   Can we allow them to join with the 84 Senators out of 100 on the  other side that said ``yes'' to it? Or do we have a few that control  what can come to the floor?   Now, I heard in this rule debate that there are some amendments; that  somehow they are going to make it better. What makes it better? That we  do not fund to pay any overtime costs for Immigration and Customs  Enforcement officers, or provide funding for the active duty of the  National Guard troops working with them on the front line of the crisis  at the border?   Is that making it better?   Is that really what you want to stake your political career on?   Is that really what you want to stand up against bipartisanship for?   Madam Speaker, I have heard a lot of names on the other side say they  would vote for it. I think everybody in this body knows that that  Senate bill will pass. I think everybody in their heart knows that is  where we are going to end up.   But do we have to go through it one more time?   You do not have to worry about what the outcome will be. The leader  of the Senate has already said what will happen; because I will promise  you this, on this side of the aisle, we will stay here until this is  done. We will not leave, and we will stand with the bipartisan vote in  the Senate.   If you are worried about getting to 218, do not worry. Put that bill  on suspension, I promise you it will pass.   I call upon all of our better angels for this one moment, for this  one time, when America is watching, that we rise to the occasion; that  we put the partisanship aside; that we have swapped; that the Senate  has actually taught us, given us the adult supervision to show that,  yes, we have had that fight; yes, you tried to make it and it didn't  make it. But there is something better. There is a window, and there is  an opportunity.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's  table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the  Senate amendment.
