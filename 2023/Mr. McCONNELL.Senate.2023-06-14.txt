 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Biden administration has been  sending the Senate a dizzying list of radical and unqualified nominees  to both the executive branch and the Federal bench. In several cases,  the President's picks have been so far outside the mainstream that this  Chamber's Democratic majority hasn't even been willing to confirm them.   Right now, our Democratic colleagues are struggling to convince one  another to confirm a State employment commissioner who was responsible  for tens of billions of dollars in fraudulent unemployment insurance  payments, and this nominee has been recommended by the administration  for Secretary of Labor. They have had a hard time agreeing to give a  lifetime judgeship to a self-described ``wild-eyed leftist'' who  likened hate for conservative Americans to ``righteous indignation''  and ``moral clarity.''   All the while, the docket of downright radical nominees continues to  fill. This week, the Democratic leader will file cloture on two new  nominations to the Federal bench. First, Nusrat Choudhury is President  Biden's latest pick to join the Eastern District of New York. This  nominee has made statements ranging from reckless suggestions that  crimes like theft do not threaten public safety to false and  inflammatory assertions that police kill Black men ``every day'' in  America. Unsurprisingly, these statements have drawn the ire and  opposition of law enforcement groups across our country.   And second, Julie Rikelman is nominated to the First Circuit Court of  Appeals. Ms. Rikelman has described efforts to limit abortion as a  ``vicious assault'' by ``hostile politicians'' and has even objected to  restrictions on reprehensible practices like sex-selection abortions.   So, Mr. President, these are the nominees of a President who promised  to unify our country. I would urge my colleagues to join me in  rejecting each of them.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1991         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
