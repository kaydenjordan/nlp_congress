 Mr. President, in the days since President Obama took  office, too many coal miners have lost their jobs, including well over  10,000 in Kentucky, and more than 25 coal mining companies have filed  for bankruptcy. This means that there are fewer active workers  available to pay into an expanding retirement pool, leaving health  benefits in jeopardy for thousands of retired miners.   Last year, I was proud to be able to secure an extension of these  benefits past their year-end expiration date. While I advocated for a  longer term solution, we did secure a 4-month plan. I made a commitment  at that time to work with my colleagues on a long-term health care  solution for these retired miners.   Today, I plan to introduce legislation to protect and permanently  extend those benefits for thousands of coal miner retirees and their  dependents. Recognizing the damage that has been done over the past 8  years, my legislation also calls on Congress to work with the incoming  Trump administration to repeal regulations that are harming the coal  industry and to support economic development efforts in coal country.   I highlighted those goals in a letter I sent to President-Elect Trump  earlier in the year regarding ways in which I hope we can work together  to provide relief to coal country. I look forward to continuing to work  with my colleagues and the incoming administration on these important  issues.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we were all saddened by the news that  Tim Mitchell, a longtime member of the Democratic floor staff, passed  away this past weekend after his heartbreaking battle with brain  cancer. I know the Democratic leader will have more to say in just a  moment, but I wanted to take a moment myself to reflect on Tim's Senate  service and express our condolences to his family.   Last September, the former Democratic leader and I had the  opportunity to recognize Tim for a remarkable 25 years of Senate  service. As we noted then, Tim has long been a critical member of the  Senate team who worked tirelessly with his colleagues on both sides to  ensure that the floor operated smoothly and efficiently.   Despite his passion for this institution, however, we know that Tim's  family always remained his top priority. I know his wife Alicia and his  young son Ben know this as well. Our prayers are with them at this  immensely difficult time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 176         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Helping Ensure Long-Term       Protection for Coal Miners Health Care Act of 2017'' or the       ``HELP for Coal Miners Health Care Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Over the 8 years preceding the date of the introduction       of this Act, the coal industry and the communities supported       by that industry have struggled, in large part due to       overregulation.        (2) Excessive regulation has, in large part, made coal more       expensive to mine and use and has put it at an unfair       disadvantage in the marketplace.        (3) Because of these struggles--        (A) the coal mining industry has lost over 30,000 jobs       since President Obama's inauguration;        (B) over 600 coal mines have shuttered since President       Obama's inauguration;        (C) more than 25 coal mining companies have filed for       bankruptcy since President Obama's inauguration;        (D) Kentucky alone has lost over 10,000 coal mining jobs       since President Obama's inauguration; and        (E) the total number of operating coal mines has hit its       lowest point on record.        (4) Because of the health risks often associated with       mining, robust health benefits are vital to coal miner       retirees; however, coal company bankruptcies, job cuts, and       closures have exhausted the ability of many coal companies to       continue providing health benefits to retirees and their       dependents.        (5) Congress has stepped in twice before, in 1992 and in       2006, to assist retired miners and to secure their health       benefits. When thousands more were at risk of losing their       benefits at the end of 2016, Congress intervened again to       provide a 4-month extension in health benefits for orphaned       retired miners and their dependents.        (6) While this extension helped prevent the loss of health       benefits for thousands of miners, it did not provide a long-      term solution.  [[Page S344]]         (7) It is necessary to provide a permanent extension of       health care benefits for the orphaned retirees who are at       risk of losing their retirement health benefits at the end of       April 2017.       SEC. 3. INCLUSION OF CERTAIN RETIREES IN THE MULTIEMPLOYER                     HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN.

For purposes of subclause (I), a beneficiary enrolled in the       Plan as of the date of the enactment of the HELP for Coal       Miners Health Care Act of 2017 shall be deemed to have been       eligible to receive health benefits under the Plan on January       1, 2017.        ``(iii) Eligibility of certain retirees.--Individuals       referred to in clause (ii)(II) shall be treated as eligible       to receive health benefits under the Plan.        ``(iv) Requirements for transfer.--The amount of the       transfer otherwise determined under this subparagraph for a       fiscal year shall be reduced by any amount transferred for       the fiscal year to the Plan, to pay benefits required under       the Plan, from a voluntary employees' beneficiary association       established as a result of a bankruptcy proceeding described       in clause (ii).''.
