 Mr. President, the Biden administration's war on  affordable and reliable energy continues.   Three weeks ago, the administration announced a cancellation of seven  oil and gas leases in the small portion of ANWR, the Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge, that is available for energy exploration and  development.   It was just the latest move by the Biden administration to stifle  conventional energy production. In his State of the Union Address this  year, the President acknowledged that ``[w]e're going to need oil for  at least another decade . . . and beyond that.'' Let me just repeat  that. Again, these are President Biden's own words:         We're going to need oil for at least another decade . . .       and beyond that.    Well, in this case, the President is right. While alternative energy  is powering an increasing share of American energy production, we are  nowhere near being able to rely exclusively on alternative energy  technologies. We are going to need conventional energy for quite a  while yet.   The best way to get that conventional energy is by developing the  United States' abundant domestic resources in an environmentally  responsible way. But the President's anti-development strategy seems  designed to force us to remain at the mercy of producers like OPEC and  to rely on expensive imports from sometimes dangerous or unstable  countries and regions.   There are multiple problems with relying on foreign sources of oil,  not the least of which is the potential for our oil dollars to fund  oppressive regimes. But even leaving that aside, depending on foreign  oil sources threatens the stability and affordability of our oil  supply. You only need to look at the energy challenges and soaring  costs countries like Germany have faced in the wake of Russia's  invasion of Ukraine to recognize how perilous it can be to rely on  another country for energy.   Anyone who is concerned about the environment should recognize that  oil and gas production here in the United States is likely to be  substantially more environmentally friendly than a lot of foreign  production.   The President's war on domestic production isn't the only dangerous  element of his energy strategy. Also of deep concern is the President's  apparent determination to force Americans to adopt electric vehicles on  a broad scale within the next decade. Why is this so concerning?  Because our electric grid is nowhere near capable of supporting that  kind of widespread transition to electric vehicles.   Rising electricity demand is already stretching our grid, which has  been weakened by the move away from conventional energy sources. In an  apparent response to the impact of overreaching Green New Deal-style  politics, NERC, which is the North American Electric Reliability  Corporation, for the first time identified energy policy as a risk to  grid reliability in its recent biennial report.   Discussing the move away from conventional sources of electricity,  NERC found that ``[c]ollectively, the new resource mix can be more  susceptible to long-term, widespread Extreme Events, such as extreme  temperatures or sustained loss of wind/solar, that can impact the  ability to provide sufficient energy as the fuel supply is less  certain.''   In February, the PJM Interconnection, which manages a substantial  part of Eastern America's electric grid, released a report warning that  fossil fuel plants are being forced to retire at a faster rate than new  renewables can be brought online at a rate of roughly 2 to 1.   In other words, we are rapidly approaching a situation which we  simply don't have the ability to keep up with current electricity  demand. Add charging for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of  electric vehicles on top of that, and we could be looking at a future  of widespread blackouts and brownouts, to say nothing of soaring  electricity prices.   I should also mention that the Biden administration's proposed  distribution transformer rule, which would require a move to amorphous  steel cores for more distribution transformers--what that would do to  the grid is simply no favors whatsoever. In fact, it would be almost  guaranteed to worsen supply chain issues and seriously slow grid  maintenance and upgrades.   And the supply chain backlog is a top concern for utilities and  electric cooperatives, which are already facing headwinds from  overreaching EPA regulations. I don't need to tell anyone that utility  bills for electricity and natural gas have risen dramatically since  President Biden took office, as have gas prices. It is a predictable  outcome of the economic and energy policies that President Biden has  pursued. If his war on conventional energy continues, today's high  prices could look cheap next to the energy prices of the future.   I am a strong and longtime supporter of renewable energy, and I am  proud to be from a State that is a top producer of ethanol and that  derives a substantial portion of its electricity generation from  renewable resources like wind and hydroelectric.   But the fact of the matter is, energy technology has simply not  advanced to the point where we can rely solely or even, for that  matter, mostly on renewables. While the President may sometimes pay lip  service to our continuing need for conventional energy,  [[Page S4733]]  his actual policies seem to ignore this fact and are setting us up for  a future of higher prices, grid instability, and insufficient supply.   The President's policies have already resulted in a 2-year-plus  inflation crisis.   If he keeps going the way he has been going, his legacy may include  an energy crisis as well.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Carolina (Mr. Scott).
