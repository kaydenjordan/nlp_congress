 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 60th  anniversary of the Bay of Pigs invasion; specifically, to honor the men  of Assault Brigade 2506.  [[Page H1796]]    Mr. Speaker, over 1,400 selfless men--many of which were only  teenagers at the time--volunteered to save the island of Cuba on April  17, 1961 from communism.   Mr. Speaker, 114 brigaders and 4 American soldiers were killed in  action by the brutal Castro regime; while thousands of others waiting  on the island for these freedom fighters were arrested, killed by a  firing squad, or sent into exile, including my grandmother.   For my Miami exile community that I represent, these are our moral  points of reference, our heroes, and are reminders of how the Cuban  people continue to suffer under a ruthless communist dictatorship led  by the Castro brothers.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart in  introducing a bipartisan resolution honoring the brigaders. I urge my  colleagues in Congress to cosponsor our resolution to join us in our  fight for freedom, democracy, and human rights in the only communist  bastion in the Western Hemisphere, the island of Cuba.                            ____________________
