 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a  leader who has devoted more than three decades to Nevada's kids, its  schools, and its educators: Dr. Dotty Merrill. For more than 35 years,  Dr. Merrill has been an educator, an advocate, and a leader in fighting  for the best possible opportunities for our students and teachers. She  continues to be a leader as the executive director of the Nevada  Association of School Boards, a role she has held since October of  2006.   Dr. Merrill graduated with a bachelor of arts from the University of  Arkansas in Fayetteville, a master of arts in English from the  University of Nevada, Reno, and finally with a doctorate in educational  leadership, also from the University of Nevada, Reno. Nevada is truly  blessed that Dr. Merrill has taken her education, experience, and  passion and devoted it to our State's education system. Her work in the  Washoe County School District was instrumental in developing a set of  education standards that aligned with Federal standards and  strengthened the 21st century education our kids need for a brighter  future. She has continued the fight for our kids on behalf of the  Washoe County School District at the Nevada Legislature where she has  been a key voice for local educators as the Silver State has debated  how best to improve our school system, train our teachers, and ensure  that every child in Nevada has the tools, resources, and support they  need to succeed in the classroom.   I would like to thank Dr. Merrill for all she has done for our kids,  our schools, and our teachers in the Silver State, especially in her  commitment to improving classroom instruction, developing initiatives  that ensure accountability, and fostering collaborative relationships  among stakeholders that achieve the best results for our kids.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. Dotty Merrill's  lifelong commitment to education and service to the Washoe County  School District, the city of Reno, and the State of Nevada. Thank you  to Dr. Merrill for all that you have done and for your life's work  fighting for a quality education for Nevada's children and standing up  for the necessary support and resources for the Silver State's  teachers.                            ____________________
