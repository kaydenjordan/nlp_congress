 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Miami  Jewish Health Systems as they break ground on their cutting-edge memory  care facility to be called the S. Donald Sussman EmpathiCare Village.  This facility will serve as an essential resource to many elderly  individuals in south Florida who find themselves in need of mental  health services. The Sussman EmpathiCare Village will also host  researchers working on cutting-edge memory care treatment.   This new facility is just the latest accomplishment in the Miami  Jewish Health Systems' long tradition of service in our community. For  over 75 years, this wonderful organization and its staff have provided  compassionate healthcare with dignity and respect and helped those most  in need in south Florida to live longer, healthier, and more enriched  lives.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored that such an amazing institution is located  in south Florida, and it is a pleasure to recognize that the S. Donald  Sussman EmpathiCare Village is now a reality. Thanks again to MJHS, and  mazel tov on a job well done.                            ____________________
