 Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the five  Pacific Island countries in Micronesia that, at their summit in  February, called for Russia to end its war against Ukraine.   Following their summit, these countries--Marshall Islands, Palau,  Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, and Nauru--joined a U.N.  General Assembly resolution demanding that Russia immediately and  unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, last September, I addressed the Pacific Islands  Conference of Leaders--the heads of all Pacific governments,  independent and territorial alike. At that gathering, I urged the  leaders to resist any overtures by China until China also demands  Russia stop its war with Ukraine: ``Before you even think about  negotiating any agreements with Beijing, you should be asking China to  live up to international standards on climate change.''   I concluded by asking them to use their ``international leverage and  prestige to tell China not to support Russia in any way in its unjust  war in Ukraine.''   Job well done by America's friends in the Pacific. ``Farewell and may  you be well,'' ``Soifua ma ia e manuia.''                            ____________________
