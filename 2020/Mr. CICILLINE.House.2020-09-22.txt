 America will soon pass 200,000 deaths from COVID-19.  This pandemic is now the second leading cause of death in our country,  only behind heart disease.   This year, it will kill more Americans than lung cancer, stroke,  Alzheimer's, diabetes, and the flu, and it didn't have to be this way.   President Trump knew the dangers in January. His Deputy National  Security Advisor told him to cut off travel from China, but he didn't  do that.   The next month, the President told a reporter that COVID-19 was more  deadly than even your most strenuous flus, but he didn't tell the  American people. He did what he always does when he faces a crisis. He  failed the American people.   Just yesterday, he told a crowd of his own supporters in Ohio that  the disease ``affects virtually nobody.'' Yet, 200,000 have died of  this disease.   He is not up to his job. He never was. It is too big for him.   The American people deserve a President who will take this deadly  virus seriously and has a plan to defeat it.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor the Uyghur  Forced Labor Prevention Act, legislation that bans products of forced  labor by Uyghurs to the United States.   I want to acknowledge and thank Chairman McGovern, Chairman  Blumenauer, Ranking Member McCaul, Mr. Smith, and others who have led  this effort.   As members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, we work every day to  ensure that America stands up for freedom around the world, and we take  action to promote freedom in human rights around the globe. So, in that  vein, we must ensure that the exploitation of the Uyghurs and other  ethnic minorities does not continue.   Most Americans would be shocked to learn that, for years, Uyghurs  have been interned, tortured, interrogated, and brutally forced into  labor by the Chinese Government, and then products they manufacture  make their way into the U.S. market. This bill will stop these  practices.   We must pass this legislation to crack down on China's abhorrent  human rights practices. We must continue to be a force for democratic  values and human rights in our own country and around the world.   This is an example of working together in a bipartisan way to make it  clear that the United States of America will not remain silent while  these gross human rights violations continue, and we will do all that  we can to bring the attention of the world to the important practices  of the Chinese Communist Government by passing these two pieces of  legislation.
