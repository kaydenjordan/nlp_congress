 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York,  Representative Espaillat, for holding this incredibly important hour on  not just the climate crisis but the Green New Deal, in particular.   As I was preparing for this evening, I would be remiss but to say  that, last night, we had a national Democratic debate, and not a single  question was asked about our climate crisis.  [[Page H1217]]    Right now, the global consensus, the IPCC report coming out the U.N.,  is sounding the alarm on what will happen if we do not keep emissions  down to contain our warming levels below 1.5 degrees Celsius. But if  you look at today, we are on track to hit 3 degrees Celsius by 2100.  This can bring unprecedented chaos to our order.   Throughout this entire year, as we discussed the Green New Deal, I  have noticed that there has been an awful lot of misinformation about  what is inside this resolution. A tremendous amount of wild claims,  everything from saying we are seeking to ban airplanes to ending ice  cream. As a consequence, I realized that many of my colleagues have  never even read the resolution that they are speaking on. They haven't  opened a single word of it. It is actually only about--I have it right  in front of me--14 pages long.   So I have decided that since some of my colleagues across the aisle  could not, for some reason, read the resolution, that perhaps this hour  would be spent best reading it to them for the public record.   So, today, what I would like to do is to read the Green New Deal  resolution for all those who are interested, who may want to fire this  up on C-SPAN, or who may want to sit in the audience today.         H. Res. 109, resolution recognizing the duty of the Federal       Government to create a Green New Deal.        Whereas the October 2018 report entitled ``Special Report       on Global Warming of 1.5 Celsius'' by the Intergovernmental       Panel on Climate Change and the November 2018 Fourth National       Climate Assessment report found that--        (1) human activity is the dominant cause of observed       climate change over the past century;        (2) a changing climate is causing sea levels to rise and an       increase in wildfires, severe storms, droughts, and other       extreme weather events that threaten human life, healthy       communities, and critical infrastructure;        (3) global warming at or above 2 degrees Celsius beyond       preindustrialized levels will cause--        (A) mass migration from the regions most affected by       climate change;        (B) more than $500 billion in lost annual economic output       in the United States by the year 2100;        (C) wildfires that, by 2050, will annually burn at least       twice as much forest area in the Western United States than       was typically burned by wildfires in the years preceding       2019;        (D) a loss of more than 99 percent of all coral reefs on       Earth;        (E) more than 350 million more people to be exposed       globally to deadly heat stress by 2050; and        (F) a risk of damage to $1 trillion of public       infrastructure and coastal real estate in the United States;       and        (4) global temperatures must be kept below 1.5 degrees       Celsius above preindustrialized levels to avoid the most       severe impacts of a changing climate, which will require--        (A) global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from       human sources of 40 to 60 percent from 2010 levels by 2030;       and        (B) net-zero global emissions by 2050;        Whereas, because the United States has historically been       responsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas       emissions, having emitted 20 percent of global greenhouse gas       emissions through 2014, and has a high technological       capacity, the United States must take a leading role in       reducing emissions through economic transformation;        Whereas the United States is currently experiencing several       related crises, with--        (1) life expectancy declining while basic needs, such as       clean air, clean water, healthy food, and adequate       healthcare, housing, transportation, and education, are       inaccessible to a significant portion of the U.S. population;        (2) a four-decade trend of wage stagnation,       deindustrialization, and antilabor policies that has led to--        (A) hourly wages overall stagnating since the 1970s despite       increased worker productivity;        (B) the third-worst level of socioeconomic mobility in the       developed world before the Great Recession;        (C) the erosion of earning and bargaining power of workers       in the United States; and        (D) inadequate resources for public-sector workers to       confront the challenges of climate change at local, State,       and Federal levels; and                                time  1530         (3) the greatest income inequality since the 1920s, with--        (A) the top 1 percent of earners accruing 91 percent of       gains in the first few years of economic recovery after the       Great Recession;        (B) a large racial wealth divide amounting to a difference       of 20 times more wealth between the average White family and       the average Black family; and        (C) a gender earnings gap that results in women earning       approximately 80 percent as much as men, at the median;        Whereas climate change, pollution, and environmental       destruction have exacerbated systemic racial, regional,       social, environmental, and economic injustices (referred to       in this preamble as ``systemic injustices'') by       disproportionately affecting indigenous peoples, communities       of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities,       depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers,       women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities,       and youth (referred to in this preamble as ``frontline and       vulnerable communities'');        Whereas, climate change constitutes a direct threat to the       national security of the United States--        (1) by impacting the economic, environmental, and social       stability of countries and communities around the world; and        (2) by acting as a threat multiplier;        Whereas the Federal Government-led mobilizations during       World War II and the New Deal created the greatest middle       class that the United States has ever seen, but many members       of frontline and vulnerable communities were excluded from       many of the economic and societal benefits of those       mobilizations; and        Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes that a new       national, social, industrial, and economic mobilization on a       scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal era is a       historic opportunity--        (1) to create millions of good, high-wage jobs in the       United States;        (2) to provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and       economic security for all people of the United States; and        (3) to counteract systemic injustices: Now, therefore, be       it        Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of       Representatives that--        (1) it is the duty of the Federal Government to create a       Green New Deal--        (A) to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a       fair and just transition for all communities and workers;        (B) to create millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure       prosperity and economic security for all people in the United       States;        (C) to invest in the infrastructure and industry of the       United States to sustainably meet the challenges of the 21st       century;        (D) to secure for all people of the United States for       generations to come--        (i) clean air and water;        (ii) climate and community resiliency;        (iii) healthy food;        (iv) access to nature; and        (v) a sustainable environment; and        (E) to promote justice and equity by stopping current,       preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of       indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant       communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural       communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the       elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities and youth       (referred to in this resolution as ``frontline and vulnerable       communities'');        (2) the goals described in subparagraphs (A) through (E) of       paragraph (1) (referred to in this resolution as the ``Green       New Deal goals'') should be accomplished through a 10-year       national mobilization (referred to in this resolution as the       ``Green New Deal mobilization'') that will require the       following goals and projects--        (A) building resiliency against climate change-related       disasters, such as extreme weather, including by leveraging       funding and providing investments for community-defined       projects and strategies;        (B) repairing and upgrading the infrastructure in the       United States, including--        (i) by eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions       as much as technologically feasible;        (ii) by guaranteeing universal access to clean water;        (iii) by reducing the risks posed by climate impacts; and        (iv) by ensuring that any infrastructure bill considered by       Congress addresses climate change;        (C) meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United       States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy       sources, including--        (i) by dramatically expanding and upgrading renewable power       sources; and        (ii) by deploying new capacity;        (D) building or upgrading energy-efficient, distributed,       and ``smart'' power grids, and ensuring affordable access to       electricity;        (E) upgrading all existing buildings in the United States       and building new buildings to achieve maximum energy       efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort,       and durability, including through electrification;        (F) spurring massive growth in clean manufacturing in the       United States and removing pollution and greenhouse gas       emissions from manufacturing and industry as much as is       technologically feasible, including by expanding renewable       energy manufacturing and investing in existing manufacturing       and industry;        (G) working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in       the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas       emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is       technologically feasible, including--        (i) by supporting family farming;        (ii) by investing in sustainable farming and land use       practices that increase soil health; and        (iii) by building a more sustainable food system that       ensures universal access to healthy food;        (H) overhauling transportation systems in the United States       to remove pollution and  [[Page H1218]]       greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as       much as technologically feasible, including through       investment in--        (i) zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing;        (ii) clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and        (iii) high-speed rail;        (I) mitigating and managing the long-term adverse health,       economic, and other effects of pollution and climate change,       including by providing funding for community-defined projects       and strategies;        (J) removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and       reducing pollution by restoring natural ecosystems through       proven low-tech solutions that increase soil carbon storage,       such as land preservation and afforestation;        (K) restoring and protecting threatened, endangered, and       fragile ecosystems through locally appropriate and science-      based projects that enhance biodiversity and support climate       resiliency;        (L) cleaning up existing hazardous waste and abandoned       sites, ensuring economic development and sustainability on       those sites;        (M) identifying other emission and pollution sources and       creating solutions to remove them; and        (N) promoting the international exchange of technology,       expertise, products, funding, and services, with the aim of       making the United States the international leader on climate       action, and to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal;        (3) a Green New Deal must be developed through transparent       and inclusive consultation, collaboration, and partnership       with frontline and vulnerable communities, labor unions,       worker cooperatives, civil society groups, academia, and       businesses; and        (4) to achieve the Green New Deal goals and mobilization, a       Green New Deal will require the following goals and       projects--        (A) providing and leveraging, in a way that ensures that       the public receives appropriate ownership stakes and returns       on investment, adequate capital (including through community       grants, public banks, and other public financing), technical       expertise, supporting policies, and other forms of assistance       to communities, organizations, Federal, State, and local       government agencies, and businesses working on the Green New       Deal mobilization;        (B) ensuring that the Federal Government takes into account       the complete environmental and social costs and impacts of       emissions through--        (i) existing laws;        (ii) new policies and programs; and        (iii) ensuring that frontline and vulnerable communities       shall not be adversely affected;        (C) providing resources, training, and high-quality       education, including higher education, to all people of the       United States, with a focus on frontline and vulnerable       communities, so that all people of the United States may be       full and equal participants in the Green New Deal       mobilization;        (D) making public investments in the research and       development of new clean and renewable energy technologies       and industries;        (E) directing investments to spur economic development,       deepen and diversify industry and business in local and       regional economies, and build wealth and community ownership,       while prioritizing high-quality job creation and economic,       social, and environmental benefits in frontline and       vulnerable communities, and deindustrialized communities,       that may otherwise struggle with the transition away from       greenhouse gas intensive industries;        (F) ensuring the use of democratic and participatory       processes that are inclusive of and led by frontline and       vulnerable communities and workers to plan, implement, and       administer the Green New Deal mobilization at the local       level;        (G) ensuring that the Green New Deal mobilization creates       high-quality union jobs that pay prevailing wages, hires       local workers, offers training and advancement opportunities,       and guarantees wage and benefit parity for workers affected       by the transition;        (H) guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage,       adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and       retirement security to all people of the United States;        (I) strengthening and protecting the right of all workers       to organize, unionize, and collectively bargain free of       coercion, intimidation, and harassment;        (J) strengthening and enforcing labor, workplace health and       safety, antidiscrimination, and wage and hour standards       across all employers, industries, and sectors;        (K) enacting and enforcing trade rules, procurement       standards, and border adjustments with strong labor and       environmental protections--        (i) to stop the transfer of jobs and pollution overseas;       and        (ii) to grow domestic manufacturing in the United States;        (L) ensuring that public lands, waters, and oceans are       protected and that eminent domain is not abused;        (M) obtaining the free, prior, and informed consent of       indigenous peoples for all decisions that affect indigenous       peoples and their traditional territories, honoring all       treaties and agreements with indigenous peoples, and       protecting and enforcing the sovereignty and land rights of       indigenous peoples;        (N) ensuring a commercial environment where every       businessperson is free from unfair competition and domination       by domestic or international monopolies; and        (O) providing all people of the United States with--        (i) high-quality healthcare;        (ii) affordable, safe, and adequate housing;        (iii) economic security; and        (iv) clean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food,       and access to nature.    That is every word in the Green New Deal, and I want every person in  this body and across the country to ask themselves why this is so  controversial.   Why is healthcare for every American so controversial?   Why is protecting our planet for the next generation so  controversial?   Why is dignified labor and protection at work so controversial?   Why is taking on the fossil fuel industry so, so controversial?   Because, for years, we have prioritized the pursuit of profit at any  and all human and environmental cost. I humbly ask my colleagues and my  country to question our priorities for once, because our priorities  have led to an unprecedented amount of income inequality to millions of  people living in poverty and many more who feel unstable in their  economic life.   So, please, as a moral, economic, and political prerogative, I humbly  ask our country to care for our planet.                                time  1545
