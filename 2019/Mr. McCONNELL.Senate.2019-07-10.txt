 Madam President, later today, all Senators will have  the opportunity to receive a classified briefing on an issue of huge  national importance: the security and integrity of our elections.   It is fitting that today's session be one bipartisan, all-Member  briefing because, while it is a cliche to say that certain priorities  ought to be above partisan squabbling, I know that every one of us  shares a genuine concern in maintaining the process through which  American democracy plays out.   Those of my colleagues who have read the January 2017 intelligence  assessment and the Mueller report will understand that it is precisely  our unity and our faith in our democratic system that Vladimir Putin  seeks to undermine.   Along with Americans' First Amendment rights to express themselves  and speak out, there are few things more fundamental to the maintenance  of our Republic than the electoral process itself.   Thomas Paine wrote, ``The right of voting for representatives is the  primary right by which other rights are protected.''   So preserving and protecting the elections that our State and local  authorities conduct is a crucial task. From the Federal Government's  perspective, States are firmly in the lead, but sometimes that means  lending a hand to local authorities. Obviously, during the Civil Rights  era, for example, some Federal guidelines were necessary to preserve  integrity.   But many other times, doing the right thing means defending against  interference, be it political interference in the constitutionally  protected role of the States to conduct elections by politicians and  bureaucrats here in Washington or, certainly, interference from  America's adversaries abroad.   In 2016, Vladimir Putin sought to interfere in our elections. I have  read the intelligence reports. I have read the Mueller report. I have  talked with our Intelligence Committee, which has investigated this  indepth and has a report coming out soon.   It is important to put Putin's efforts to interfere in our democracy  in context because he didn't just decide in 2016 to take such a bold  step. He kind of worked up to it, undermining an array of U.S.  interests slowly but surely over 8 years of the previous  administration's misguided approach to Russia.   Under President Obama, the U.S.-Russia relationship seemed to be  defined by two constants: Putin's growing assertiveness in foreign  meddling and the administration's failure to confront it.   Putin's 2008 invasion of the sovereign country of Georgia was met by  the so-called reset in 2009, which swept the aggression under the rug.  The United States may have reset our policy to  [[Page S4744]]  business as usual, but Putin's aggression continued full bore.   There was the failure to respond to Putin's efforts to strangle  democracy in his own country by shuttering western NGOs, arresting  dissidents, or possibly ordering the murder of political opponent Boris  Nemtsov.   To the extent that the United States responded to the torture and  murder by Russian authorities of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, it was due to  congressional pressure.   There was also President Obama's response to Putin's invasion of  Ukraine in 2014. Do any of my colleagues believe the administration's  response to that outrageous assault on the sovereignty of Ukraine was  sufficiently tough to defend against Putin's outrageous assault on  fundamental principles of sovereignty and the international order?   There was the debacle with the President's redline in Syria, which  turned out to be more like a red carpet for Russian influence in Syria  and the Middle East.   And there was the President telling Putin's puppet Medvedev that he  could have more ``flexibility'' to treat Russia differently once he  became a lameduck.   All this was under a President who thought it was a clever laugh line  to mock our now-colleague Senator Romney for correctly labeling Russia  as a threat.   The consequences of American weakness toward Russia were numerous.  The more Obama gave, the more Putin took.   Among those consequences, as we all know, was that Putin felt  sufficiently emboldened to seek to interfere in our 2016 Presidential  election. Through efforts to divide Americans on social media and to  hack a political party, agents of a foreign government sought to inject  division, doubt, and chaos into our democracy--a sad and embarrassing  episode.   President Trump has expressed an interest in a better relationship  with Russia, but the actions his administration has taken--which he has  authorized--demonstrate that such a relationship will not prevent  America from pushing back against Russian aggression.   The administration has pushed back against Russia in meaningful ways,  imposing new costs on Putin and his cronies for their malign activities  and improving our defenses against Russian active measures. We have  adopted new national security and defense strategies that treat Russian  aggression like the serious threat that it is. We have begun to rebuild  our military strength, which was eroded by years of budget cuts and  further damaged by sequestration. We have taken steps to provide  Georgia and Ukraine with arms to defend against Russian aggression-- weapons denied to them by the previous administration despite  bipartisan support from Congress. We worked to block Moscow's efforts  to increase European reliance on Russian oil and gas. Secretary Mattis  led efforts--continued by his successors--to reform and strengthen  NATO.   So important changes are underway at the strategic level. Now we are  back to projecting the strength, principle, and resolve that America  ought to project.   In addition, the Trump administration has also punched back in very  specific ways in response to the election interference that happened on  the Obama administration's watch. Thanks to the work of the Special  Counsel and the Department of Justice, 28 Russian nationals,  intelligence officers, and corporate interests were indicted for their  participation in the interference. And in 2018, the administration  expelled another 60 Russian agents in response to the poisoning of a  former official living in the United Kingdom. These agents are no  longer free to conduct intelligence operations or active measures here  in America.   These are all tough, important steps that pertain to our broader  foreign policy efforts to defer future threats, but there has also been  significant work done specifically on our election security. The  administration worked quickly to address vulnerabilities and ensure  that 2018 wouldn't be a reprise of 2016.   The administration directed resources through the Department of  Homeland Security to help local election authorities implement stronger  cybersecurity measures. Information sharing was streamlined between  DHS, FBI, and State and local officials.   They worked hard to gain the trust of State election officials in my  State of Kentucky and around the country and provide them with valuable  information through a voluntary information-sharing program that has  seen participation from all 50 States and 1,400 localities.   Here in Congress, we appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars in  additional aid for State governments to strengthen their systems, and  our efforts continue. This year's Defense and Intelligence  authorization bills include provisions that will help defend ourselves  and our allies against Russian aggression.   The administration will brief us today in classified session about  the many steps U.S. agencies have taken since 2016 to improve our  defenses and bolster our deterrence against adversaries who seek to  undermine our democracy.   The smooth and secure execution of the 2018 election illustrates the  success of these measures. This was not a coincidence.   Congress has taken even further action since then, building new  legislative safeguards to increase transparency and coordination with  the intelligence community on election security.   In short, it is abundantly clear that the administration and Congress  take this issue seriously. I look forward to hearing more from the  administration today about what steps have led to this greater success  and what even further safeguards they are working on in advance of  2020.   Of course, Congress will need to continue closely monitoring the  progress and assess whether future legislative steps might be needed as  well. But, as with any time when Washington politicians are clamoring  to grab greater control over something this important, we need to make  sure this conversation is clear-eyed and sober and serious.   I remember it was President Obama's first Chief of Staff who said:  ``You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.'' In other words, bad  news can give politicians cover to do things they have wanted to do for  a long time.   Remember, it was only months ago that the new Democratic majority in  the House decided their top priority for the entire Congress was a  massive bill I called the Democratic politician protection act--a  sprawling Federal power grab over election law and citizens' political  speech.   Among other provisions, it would make the FEC, the currently  nonpartisan body that regulates political speech, into a partisan  weapon.   They also want to give Washington more power to prohibit citizens  groups from weighing in on politicians' job performance. They have  twice passed bills aimed at centralizing election administration  decisions in the Federal Government, in part on the hope that election  attorneys, not voters, will get to determine the outcome of more  elections--provision after provision that would erode longstanding  safeguards. That was the huge proposal just a few months ago.   In light of this, it is interesting that some of our colleagues  across the aisle seem to have already made up their minds before we  hear from the experts later today that a brandnew, sweeping Washington  intervention is just what the doctor ordered.   I, for one, am looking forward to listening to the experts, to  hearing more about why the Trump administration was more successful in  2018 than the Obama administration was in 2016. I look forward to  ensuring that any additional Federal action actually addresses the  problems at hand; that it preserve, rather than undermine, the careful  checks and balances that have long been key parts of American democracy  since the beginning.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there are two bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the measures on the calendar under  the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings en  bloc.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11  a.m., Thursday, July 11, the Senate vote on the confirmation of  Executive Calendar Nos. 101 and 103 in the order listed. I further ask  that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table and that the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action; further, that if cloture is invoked on Executive  Calendar No. 13, the postcloture time expire at 1:45 p.m.; finally,  that the ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public  Works control the time from 1 p.m. until 1:40 p.m.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Environment and Public Works be discharged from further  consideration of S. 1811 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Thursday, July 11; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to  [[Page S4777]]  executive session and resume consideration of the King nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:16 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, July 11, 2019, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
