 Mr. Chair, I rise today to put on the Record my  opposition to H.R. 1, the polluters over people act, for the many  unnecessary and unhelpful provisions that would jeopardize the health  and well-being of Ohio's 13th Congressional District and communities  across this great Nation.   I find it hard to believe that the bill designated as H.R. 1, the  priority bill that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  uplifting, would increase the national deficit all while endangering  our communities by creating unsafe drinking water. That is the  priority, increasing the national debt and making us less safe.   Everyone here agrees that we must ensure that the Federal Government  is approving domestic energy projects safely and quickly, and we can  all agree that the current permitting process leaves much to be  desired. However, this process should not come at the expense of the  communities who simply want clean drinking water.   I have been in Congress, Mr. Chair, for about 3 months, and this is  at least the second time this body has rejected clean water. All of  this in the backdrop of a train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio,  just about 40 miles from my district. We know pollution knows no  boundaries, particularly no congressional boundaries. Whether it is  East Palestine or Portage County where I represent, I simply cannot  stand silent as polluters attempt to poison our water.   Further, Mr. Chair, I have listened to accusations of activist  Governors who  [[Page H1515]]  would weaponize provisions of the Clean Water Act. For that reason,  States like mine, Ohio, with a Republican Governor, Republican  statewide leaders, and a Republican supermajority in the legislature  should not decide how to protect the people of our State. Again, I am  shocked about the total disregard of the people of Ohio simply to  protect polluters.   Mr. Chair, my community elected me to find bipartisan solutions, not  pollute their water or pursue partisan politics, and that is why I  offered an amendment that would allow States to decide what they  thought was best for their community, and particularly in a State like  Ohio where there is a train derailment that has jeopardized the water  quality and safety in Ohio. However, that amendment was rejected.   There is nothing partisan about wanting to make sure our children and  our neighbors can drink a glass of water without worrying if chemicals  like vinyl chloride are also being consumed. Time and time and time  again, my colleagues are promoting and protecting polluters at the  expense of our people, and I simply refuse to vote for this bill.                                time  1830
