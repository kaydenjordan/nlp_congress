 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1503, the  Orange Book Transparency Act of 2019.   The Food and Drug Administration's list of approved brand name  therapeutic drug products, known as the Orange Book, plays an important  role in drug development. H.R. 1503 will ensure the Orange Book  continues to be effective and accurate by requiring drug companies to  provide up-to-date information on patents that are relevant to each  individual drug. It also directs the Government Accountability Office  to study the impact of the patents being listed in the Orange Book.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Kelly from Illinois for her  commitment to maintaining the value of the Orange Book to drug  manufacturers, payers, providers, and patients. I appreciate her  willingness to work together in a bipartisan manner, and I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 1503.
