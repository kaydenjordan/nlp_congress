 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of  Christopher Cartwright, who passed away in May 2021, at age 52. Chris  was a dedicated civil servant with a brilliant mind, a vast well of  patience, and boundless compassion. He spent most of his 30-year career  with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and served  most recently as the Director of NOAA's Budget Office.   Chris created an environment of trust and collegiality everywhere he  went. He was unflappable in navigating the budget and appropriations  process and always applied a calm and thoughtful approach to achieving  NOAA's mission. Through it all, Chris was unfailingly kind and humble.  His gentle leadership inspired his team and those around him to be  better people, leaders, and public servants.   Chris was a proud graduate of Syracuse University's Maxwell School of  Citizenship and Public Affairs, where last year he had the honor of  leading the graduating class in recitation of the Athenian Oath. True  to the oath he held so dear, Chris ``strived unceasingly to quicken the  public sense of civic duty.'' We are grateful for his service.                            ____________________
