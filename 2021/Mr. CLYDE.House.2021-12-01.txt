 Madam Speaker, in light of the U.S. Supreme Court oral  arguments for the landmark Dobbs v. Jackson case earlier today, I would  like to highlight what is truly at stake here; that is, millions of  precious, innocent lives.   It all comes down to one simple fact: The presence of a heartbeat  means the existence of life.   As early as 5 weeks, unborn babies in the womb can have a heartbeat.  Furthermore, they start developing pain receptors just 2 short weeks  later and are able to process pain by 15 weeks.   Anyone who claims an unborn child is not a human life is ignoring  science, denying morality, and condoning murder. That is right: Murder.   Even President Biden acknowledged back in 2015, ``The moment of  conception is a human life and being.'' On this rare occasion, I  sincerely agree with the President.  [[Page H6845]]    As an unapologetic pro-life American, I will never stop fighting for  the sanctity of human life or defending the unborn.   While we wait for further developments in this pivotal legal case, I  am hopeful the eventual outcome will save countless innocent human  lives and not add to the already 60-plus million who have lost their  lives to abortion.   To put that number of 60-plus million into some perspective, the  number of Americans killed in combat in the entire history of our  Nation, starting from the war of independence, is just under 667,000,  or about 1 percent of the 60-plus million unborn babies who have died  during the last five decades.   I pray this crucial moment will confirm for all Americans that every  life is precious, worth saving, and made in the perfect image of God.  That revelation is a victory we should all celebrate.
