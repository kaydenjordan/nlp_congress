 Madam President, on February 14, I successfully underwent  surgery for prostate cancer. I am grateful to the doctors and other  medical professionals who provided me with excellent care, and I am  glad to be back in the Senate working for the people of Pennsylvania.  As the result of my medical treatment, I required several weeks of  recovery and thus missed several votes in the Senate. The outcome of  these votes was unaffected by my absence, but I wish for the record to  show, had I not been absent due to my cancer treatment and recovery,  how I would have voted on the following votes: yea on vote number 11,  on the confirmation of Gina R. Mendez-Miro to be U.S. District Judge  for the District of Puerto Rico; yea on vote number 12, on the motion  to invoke cloture on Lindsay C. Jenkins to be U.S. District Judge for  the Northern District of Illinois; yea on vote number 13, on the  confirmation of Lindsay C. Jenkins to be U.S. District Judge for the  Northern District of Illinois; yea on vote number 14, on the motion to  invoke cloture on Matthew L. Garcia to be U.S. District Judge for the  District of New Mexico; yea on vote number 15, on the confirmation of  Matthew L. Garcia to be U.S. District Judge for the District of New  Mexico; yea on vote number 16, on the motion to invoke cloture on  Adrienne C. Nelson to be U.S. District Judge for the District of  Oregon; yea on vote number 17, on confirmation of Adrienne C. Nelson to  be U.S. District Judge for the District of Oregon; yea on vote 18, on  the motion to invoke cloture on Ana C. Reyes to be U.S. District Judge  for the District of Columbia; yea on vote 19, on the motion to invoke  cloture on Daniel J. Calabretta to be U.S. District Judge for the  Eastern District of California; yea on vote 20, on confirmation of Ana  C. Reyes to be U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia; yea on  vote 21, on the motion to invoke cloture on Lester Martinez Lopez to be  an Assistant Secretary of Defense; yea on vote 22, on confirmation of  Daniel J. Calabretta to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District  of California; yea on vote 23, on the confirmation of Lester Martinez- Lopez to be an Assistant Secretary of Defense; yea on vote number 24,  on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of Maria Araujo Kahn  to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit.   Due to my medical treatment on February 14, I also missed committee  hearings and other Senate business when the Senate was in session from  February 14 to February 17.                            ____________________
