 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and to  my colleague, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, for bringing us all together  today.   I would just say a word or two about Doris Liber, who I met a few  weeks ago. She came to the Capitol with other families who have loved  ones who were taken hostage. Her son, Guy, was taken hostage by Hamas  on October 7; 26 years old.   He was at a festival with his friends, and terror took over. He was  shot in the arm and called his mother. That was the last time she heard  his voice. We hope and pray that he is alive and that he will be  released.   Every single one of these hostages must be released. Hamas must  release every single hostage, and they must surrender.   They can end this nightmare, and they can end this war.
