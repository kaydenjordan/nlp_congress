 Mr. President, before they leave the floor, I just want  to compliment my colleagues from Alaska and Ohio on making a very  important point. You would think, from the press, that there are  negotiations taking place, but the truth is that Speaker Pelosi and the  minority leader in the Senate, Senator Schumer, have shown zero  interest in resolving the differences on this next COVID-19 package. I  think it is just very important for my colleagues to lay out the facts  because there is a tendency to ignore the facts in favor of a mythical  or a fantasy construct, so I appreciate their statements.   Hopefully, sometime soon, now that the enhanced unemployment benefits  have been allowed to expire as a result of Democratic objections and  where the Paycheck Protection Program, which was the single most  successful part of the CARES Act legislation that we passed, is  likewise scheduled to terminate here soon, I hope Democratic  negotiators will get serious about providing a fifth coronavirus relief  package to support our country through this unprecedented crisis.   We are doing pretty well. During the previous legislation, we  virtually passed these trillion-plus-dollar bills, multitrillion-dollar  bills, essentially by unanimous vote because we knew we were in the  middle of an emergency. We knew that it was not a time for politics; it  was a time to try to help people who were out of work or needed help  from our beleaguered healthcare providers.   So we rose to the occasion, previously, by bolstering our healthcare  response, making testing free of charge, providing vital funding for  our hospitals, and arming our medical workers with the personal  protective equipment and other medical equipment they needed in order  to sustain the fight. We have poured funding into the research and  development of a vaccine, therapeutics, and treatments, which are  coming along, and we are all hopeful an American company will win the  global race for a vaccine in addition to these therapeutics.   The legislation we passed so far has buoyed the workers and families  in need of financial assistance with direct payments, bolstered  unemployment benefits, as well as conferred the ability to defer  student loan payments  [[Page S5250]]  with no penalty, and we have supported our wobbly economy with  assistance for Main Street businesses through the Paycheck Protection  Program that I mentioned a moment ago and other loans for industries  that our State and counties rely upon, as well as countless jobs.   While Republicans and Democrats were negotiating these bills in good  faith, it was clear we had some different ideas about the best way to  support our country through the crisis, but what mattered most was that  we shared the same goal. At least we did then. I am beginning to doubt  whether we share the same goal now. The goal then was to help people in  distress, economically and from a public health standpoint. Now, it  seems like Speaker Pelosi and the minority leader in the Senate are  more interested in trying to score political points and use people who  are in distress and anxious and fearful as hostages.   Well, it is really, really unacceptable. We should be strengthening  our fight against the virus and supporting those harmed by economic  impact and laying the foundation for a rebound of our economy, which  was one of the strongest in my lifetime right before this pandemic hit.   Those remain my priorities today, as we navigate these uncharted  waters and prepare to strengthen our fight at this crucial time, but  the hangup in negotiations between Democrats and the administration  seems to indicate that our Democratic colleagues have shifted course-- or at least that Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer have.   The majority of information we are learning about these negotiations  is not coming from rank-and-file Members but from leaks and press  conferences to the media about private meetings in Speaker Pelosi's  office. From what I understand, it sounds like the Speaker and the  minority leader have simply stiff-armed any offers that fall short of  their ridiculous Heroes Act legislation that the Speaker and the House  passed on a partisan basis a few weeks ago--that they knew at the time  had no chance of becoming law.    This legislation was heralded by Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader  Schumer as the solution our country needs to defeat this virus, so  let's talk about what is in it. For starters, the so-called Heroes Act  is a massive tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. If the Heroes  Act became law, the wealthiest people in New York and San Francisco  would receive an average benefit of nearly $60,000--$60,000--higher  than the household income for many Texans.   Well, this has nothing to do with COVID-19 or supporting those who  are struggling to make ends meet. It is a handout to the people who  need it least, at everyone else's expense. But that is only one line in  the long list of absurdities in this legislation, the Heroes Act, that  have absolutely nothing to do with the crisis at hand.   What is the Speaker's priority when it comes to COVID-19? Well, it is  a soil health program, environmental justice grants, permanent changes  in election law, and not one but two diversity studies in the marijuana  industry.   POLITICO called this bill, at the time, a Democratic wish list filled  with all the party's favorite policies. NPR, hardly a bastion of  conservative communication, said it is a long wish list for Democrats.  The New York Times--the New York Times--basically, a party organ for  the Democrats, said the bill was more a messaging document than a  viable piece of legislation. The reason they said that is because one- third of that bill is unrelated to the coronavirus.   It paid people more to stay home than to work. It sent checks to  illegal immigrants. It bailed out poorly run States. It facilitated  ballot harvesting, marijuana banking, and, as I said, tax breaks for  coastal elites.   That stands in stark contrast to what we have proposed and what  Leader McConnell aptly summed up as kids, jobs, and healthcare. Those  ought to be our priorities. As we discover our new normal that exists  somewhere between the virus arriving in the United States and a vaccine  being distributed, that is where we need to target our attention and  our support.   That includes funding for educators who are in the process of  planning the safest way to teach students in the fall and childcare for  working parents who are heading back to the office. It includes helping  the workers who had the rug pulled out from under them when our  Democratic colleagues refused to continue bolstered unemployment  benefits until these workers can get back to a steady paycheck.   Our bill included continued support for our war against the virus  itself, both in hospitals and in research labs. These have been the  main concerns in my recent conversations with my constituents in Texas,  especially now that the bolstered unemployment benefits provided by the  CARES Act have expired.   Since March, more than 3 million Texans have filed for unemployment  benefits, and recipients have taken advantage of the additional $600 a  week. This additional income has helped families cover the rent,  groceries, and other critical expenses until they are able to return to  work, and for many workers there is still a great deal of uncertainty  about when that might happen.   Well, it is clear, though, that that $600 additional benefit had some  unintended consequences. Frankly, we should have capped the amount that  somebody could receive for unemployment benefits at their previous  earning level, but, according to the Texas Workforce Commission, with  the $600 weekly benefit on top of the State benefit, 80 percent of the  people receiving the unemployment insurance benefit were making more on  unemployment insurance than they were previously employed--80 percent.   That brings us to a point far beyond giving workers the financial  support they need to stay afloat. Instead, the Federal Government is  paying people not to work. That is the wrong incentive and, certainly,  completely unnecessary. Payroll, wage substitution--yes. Paying people  not to work--no.   A recent poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe that these  enhanced benefits discourage people from going back to work, and they  are right. Among unemployed Americans, nearly half say they would avoid  returning to work if these benefits were extended.   The businesses in my State which closed their doors earlier this year  have now had trouble hiring employees back because some 80 percent of  those former employees are making more not working than they were  working. If we were to extend that benefit through January, as the  Heroes Act would, our economy would not recover, as we all need it to  do.   So there is a delicate balance--but an important balance--between  supporting those who need help until they can return to the workforce  and giving them an incentive to avoid returning to work. This is not an  all-or-nothing approach. It is not 600 bucks or bust, even though that  is the way Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer like to put it.   We can and we should begin and continue to supplement State  unemployment benefits and give workers the income they need to support  their families without paying people more to stay home than to work. It  is not rocket science.   We are all anxiously waiting for the Speaker and the minority leader  to wake up and start focusing on the task at hand, which is on  commonsense policies that support our country through this crisis.  Texans don't have time to wait for the posturing or the politicking and  the grandstanding, not to mention the heel-dragging. They don't have an  interest in knowing how diverse the marijuana business is, and they  don't want to provide a massive tax break to the richest Americans on  the east coast at the expense of everyone else.   My constituents want to be able to feed their families; they want to  be able to work; they want to be able to pay their rent; and they want  to know their kids will be healthy as the school year begins.   I implore our colleagues, Speaker Pelosi, and Minority Leader Schumer  to drop the games, quit hurting people you claim to champion, and pay  attention to what America really needs.
