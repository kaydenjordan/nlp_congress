 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself and Senator Cruz.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senators Tillis and  Cruz is for the House managers:         You have based your case on the proposition that it was       utterly ``baseless'' and a ``sham'' to ask for an       investigation into possible corruption of Burisma and the       Bidens.        Chris Heinz, the step-son of then-Secretary of State John       Kerry, emailed Kerry's Chief of Staff that ``Apparently,       Devon and Hunter both joined the board of Burisma and a press       release went out today. I can't speak to why they decided to,       but there was no investment by our firm in their company.''       Heinz subsequently terminated his business relationship with       Devon Archer and Hunter Biden because ``working with Burisma       is unacceptable,'' and showed a ``lack of judgment.''        Do you agree with Chris Heinz that working with Burisma was       ``unacceptable''? Did John Kerry or Joe Biden agree with       Chris Heinz? If not, why not?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The reason why Joe Biden is not material to these  proceedings, the reason why this is a baseless smear is that the issue  is not whether Hunter Biden should have sat on that board or not sat on  that board. The issue is not whether Hunter Biden was properly  compensated or improperly compensated or whether he speaks Ukrainian or  he doesn't speak Ukrainian.   What the President asked for was an investigation of Joe Biden, and  the smear against Joe Biden is that he sought to fire a prosecutor  because he was trying to protect his son. I guess that is the nature of  the allegation. And that is a baseless smear.   As we demonstrated--as the unequivocal testimony in the House  demonstrated, when the Vice President sought the dismissal of a corrupt  and incompetent prosecutor, it had nothing to do with Hunter Biden's  position on the board. It had everything to do with the fact that the  State Department, our allies, the International Monetary Fund were in  unanimous agreement that this prosecutor was corrupt. And the  uncontradicted testimony was also that, in getting rid of that  prosecutor, it would increase the chances of real  [[Page S724]]  corruption prosecutions going forward, not that it would decrease them.   So the sham is this: The sham is that Joe Biden did something wrong  when he followed United States policy, when he did what he was asked to  do by our European allies, when he did what he was asked to do by  international financial institutions.   And the other sham is the Russian propaganda sham that this  CrowdStrike--kooky conspiracy theory that the Ukrainians, not the  Russians, hacked the DNC and that someone whisked the server away to  Ukraine to hide it. That is Russian intelligence propaganda, and yes,  it is a sham. And it is worse than a sham. It is a Russian propaganda  coup is what it is. Thank God, Putin says, that they are not talking  about Russian interference anymore; they are talking about the  Ukrainian interference.   Now, counsel says: Well, isn't it possible that two countries  interfered?   But you heard what our own Director of the FBI, Christopher Wray,  said: There is no evidence of Ukrainian interference in our election.  There is no evidence. So, yes, I think we can cite the FBI Director for  the proposition that that is a sham. And that is why--that is why--we  refer to it as such.   But at the end of the day, what this is all about is the President  using the power of his office, abusing the power of that office to  engage in soliciting investigations--and actually just the announcement  of them. If the President thought there was so much merit there, then  why was it that he just needed their announcement?   And what is more, as counsel just conceded before the break, Rudy  Giuliani was not pursuing the policy of the United States. OK. If it  wasn't the policy of the United States, then what was it? If it wasn't  the policy to pursue an investigation of the Bidens, then what was it?   It was a ``domestic political errand'' is what it was.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Oregon.
