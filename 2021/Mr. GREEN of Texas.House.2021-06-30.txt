 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairperson  DeFazio for his leadership on this issue of importance to all  Americans. I especially want to thank the staff for being people with  great integrity. They are honorable people. With them, we can do great  things. Without them, we can do very little.   Mr. Speaker, there is no national drinking water standard for  chromium-6. The American Cancer Society lists chromium-6 as a known and  probable human carcinogen.   Mr. Speaker, there are an estimated 200 million Americans exposed to  drinking water with unsafe levels of chromium-6. This amendment, if  passed, will require the EPA to establish national standards for  chromium-6. Lives will be saved, and the American people will be in a  better place.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. DeFazio for his efforts. I also  would like to thank Debbie Strauss at KPRC Channel 2 for calling this  issue to my attention.
