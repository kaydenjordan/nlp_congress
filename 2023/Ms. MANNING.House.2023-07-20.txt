 Madam Speaker, the United States is experiencing a  maternal health crisis.   This country has the highest maternal mortality rate among all  developed nations, disproportionately impacting women of color, women  in rural areas, and low-income women.   Yet, according to the CDC, 60 percent of these deaths are  preventable. Let me say that again: 60 percent of maternal deaths in  the U.S. are preventable.   That is unacceptable. Healthy mothers and healthy babies must be a  priority for this country. That is why I reintroduced my Advancing  Maternal Health Equity Under Medicaid Act so that all people with  Medicaid coverage can get the access and the care they need during and  after pregnancy.   I encourage all my colleagues to support this critical legislation to  help reduce the stark racial, ethnic, and income-based disparities in  healthcare outcomes and save lives.                            ____________________
