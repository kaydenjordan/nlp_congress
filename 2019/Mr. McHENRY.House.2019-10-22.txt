 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am opposed to H.R. 2513, and I want to begin by outlining my  opposition.   This bill before us is a new small business mandate on the smallest  businesses in America. The bill before us today requires some of the  smallest businesses in America, those with fewer than 20 employees and  those with less than $5 million in receipts, to file annually a list of  all of their owners with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or  FinCEN.   For those who are watching on C-SPAN, I have a trivia question for  them, Mr. Chairman. I bet most of them have never heard of FinCEN. I  bet those in the House office buildings, Mr. Chairman, have not heard  of FinCEN. It is a little-known agency even here in Washington that  deals with financial crimes, in the Treasury Department.   Imagine you are a small business owner. You are getting a notice from  the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network mandating that you disclose  the owners of your entity. This would be the first consumer-facing  intelligence bureau that we would have in the Federal Government.   This bill would require small business owners and small business  investors to submit their personal information to a new Federal  database without adequate privacy protections. This new Federal  database will be accessible to law enforcement without a warrant and  without a subpoena, a disturbing violation of due process, in my view.   This has the fewest civil liberties protections of any Federal  intelligence  [[Page H8317]]  bureau database. It is a lower standard of accountability than what  Congress provides in the PATRIOT Act, which largely targets foreign  actors.   According to the National Federation of Independent Business, this  bill would also add more than $5.7 billion in new regulatory costs for  America's small businesses.   Supporters of the bill are calling for these changes without any  direct evidence to justify the mandate. There is plenty of anecdote,  but no data.   For several months leading up to the committee's consideration of  this bill, I sought data from the intelligence bureau called FinCEN and  from the Treasury Department, along with the Department of Justice, to  better understand the need for this legislation. They provided none.  They gave anecdotes of very scary stories to try to compel me as a  legislator to vote for what is a very specific threshold in law and a  very specific new small business mandate.   I refuse to legislate based off of anecdotes. I would like to have  hard data. My questions have not been answered by FinCEN, the Treasury  Department, or the Department of Justice.   We have no information on how beneficial ownership information will  be protected, in addition to that. We do not have information on how  the privacy of small businesses will be preserved. In fact, we have an  amendment here considered on the House floor that could further expose  their data to the public, so even that determination is not in stone  now with the bill before us.   We don't have information on how many law enforcement agencies will  have access to the database, how many financial institutions will have  access to the database, or what threshold for amount of sales and the  number of employees will yield the most effective outcome.   In the bill, we have $5 million of revenue and under, and 20  employees and under. We have no data to back up that that is the right  threshold for either the dollar amount or the number of employees.   We will have stories, and we will have Members come to the House  floor telling us stories of bad actors, but that is anecdote. That is  not data to provide for this threshold.   If we are going to have such an encroachment on America's personally  identifiable information of small businesses across this country,  shouldn't we have solid data? I believe so.   I believe we have a number of issues that need to be dealt with to  make this bill sustainable and provide protections for civil liberties.  I believe that combating illicit finance is a nonpartisan issue that  all Members want to address. Our actions must be thoughtful and data- driven.   For example, in committee, we came together in support of H.R. 2514,  the COUNTER Act, introduced by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Cleaver) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers). H.R. 2514 is a  compilation of bipartisan policies that modernize and reform the Bank  Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regimes. It balances security and  privacy. I think we have a nice bipartisan bill that was reported out  of the committee without a dissenting vote. It provides the Treasury  Department and other Federal agencies with the resources they need to  help catch bad actors.   There have been years of work in the production of that bill that is  wrapped up in this larger bill. I am disappointed that the COUNTER Act  is not being considered as a standalone bill, instead being swept into  this bill. Because I believe as a standalone bill, we could get that  bill through the House, through the Senate, and signed by the President  into law this year. I think it is unfortunate that we are not  considering that as a standalone measure.   I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for listening to  some of our concerns on the Republican side of the aisle. We will have  some Republican Members who vote for this bill. I, however, will not.   The encroachment on the question of civil liberties, the lack of  separation of powers, the lack of the use of a subpoena, and the lack  of regulatory relief for those who are collecting this data, both in  terms of small businesses and financial institutions, has not been  fixed nor dealt with.   In particular, the Rules Committee last night rejected amendments  that would require law enforcement to obtain a subpoena before  accessing--I am sorry, during committee, there was a rejection of a  subpoena in our discussions, and then last night, the Rules Committee  rejected my amendment that would provide greater certainty for small  businesses and for community banks by repealing the customer due  diligence rule, which requires financial institutions to collect  similar data that is being required in this bill.   I believe that issue still merits a more thoughtful solution that  doesn't treat legitimate small businesses as collateral damage, like  the current bill does.   Mr. Chair, I am opposed to the bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend the chair of the Investor  Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets Subcommittee, Mrs.  Maloney, for the work that she has put into this bill. She has been  willing to address many concerns from Republicans about her  legislation, though we are not able to come to final terms between her  and me; but, as she knows and as I have stated clearly, it is for lack  of data from the Treasury Department and from FinCEN itself, and those  issues still remain.   It is not because of a lack of good will on her behalf or her staff's  behalf, but an enormous amount of frustration we have from one of our  intelligence bureaus that is not complying with reasonable oversight  from Congress.   So I want to commend Mrs. Maloney for her work that she put into this  important piece of legislation, and I do wish that we were able to come  to terms on the details in the finer points of this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Barr), who is the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee ranking  member.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Kentucky an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Little Rock, Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Stivers), the ranking member of Subcommittee on Housing,  Community Development and Insurance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Diversity and Inclusion, and the vice ranking member of the Committee  on Financial Services.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Troy, Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    May I inquire of the Chair the time remaining.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from the  National Federation of Independent Businesses in opposition to this  bill and a letter dated October 18, 2019, in opposition to the bill.                                                            NFIB,                                   Washington, DC, October 21, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of NFIB, the nation's       leading small business advocacy organization, I write in       strong opposition to H.R. 2513, the Corporate Transparency       Act of 2019. This bill saddles America's smallest businesses       with 131.7 million new paperwork hours at a cost of $5.7       billion, and treats small business owners as criminals by       threatening them with jail time and oppressive fines for       paperwork violations. To make matters even worse, the       legislation puts the personal information of small business       owners at serious risk.        The Corporate Transparency Act of 2019 requires       corporations and limited liability companies with 20 or fewer       employees to file new reports with the Treasury Department's       Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regarding the       personally identifiable information of businesses' beneficial       owners and update that information every year. The       legislation imposes its reporting mandates only on America's       small businesses, those least equipped to handle new       paperwork requirements. Moreover, the legislation makes it a       federal crime to fail to provide completed and updated       reports, with civil penalties of up to $10,000, criminal       penalties of up to 3 years in prison, or both.        The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) agrees       that this legislation would  [[Page H8322]]       impose a significant new regulatory burden on small       businesses. The CBO wrote, ``Because of the high volume of       businesses that must meet the new reporting requirements and       the additional administrative burden to file a new report,       CBO estimates that the total costs to comply with the mandate       would be substantial.'' The Corporate Transparency Act would       generate between 25 million to 30 million new reports       annually.        NFIB members report that the burden of federal paperwork       ranks in the top 20% of the problems they encounter as small       business owners. While large businesses and financial       institutions may have access to teams of lawyers,       accountants, and compliance experts to gather beneficial       ownership information and report it to the government, small       business owners do not. Small business owners have difficulty       affording accounting and legal experts to help them       understand and comply with federal reporting requirements.       And small business owners lack the time to track and gather       information to fill out yet more forms for the government.        When NFIB surveyed its membership concerning beneficial       ownership reporting in August 2018, 80% opposed the idea of       Congress requiring small business owners to file paperwork       with the Treasury Department each time they form or change       ownership of a business.        The Corporate Transparency Act of 2019 raises serious       privacy concerns for small businesses. This bill would allow       federal, state, tribal, local, and even foreign law       enforcement access to business owners' personally       identifiable information, via the FinCEN database, without a       subpoena or warrant. The potential for improper disclosure or       misuse of private information increases as the number of       people with access to the information increases.        The Corporate Transparency Act of 2019 establishes a first       of its kind federal registry of small business owners. While       this registry will not be publicly available initially, NFIB       has serious concerns that this legislation would be a first       step towards establishing a publicly accessible federal       registry, which can be used to name and shame small business       owners.        NFIB strongly opposes H.R. 2513, the Corporate Transparency       Act of 2019 and will consider it a Key Vote for the 116th       Congress.            Sincerely,                                              Juanita D. Duggan,                                                    President & CEO,      NFIB.                                   ____                                                   October 18, 2019.        Dear Representative: While we support the goal of       preventing wrongdoers from exploiting United States       corporations and limited liability companies (LLCs) for       criminal gain, the undersigned organizations write to express       our strong opposition to H.R. 2513, the Corporate       Transparency Act of 2019.        The Corporate Transparency Act would impose burdensome,       duplicative reporting burdens on millions of small businesses       in the United States and threatens the privacy of law-      abiding, legitimate small business owners.        The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network's (FinCEN)       Customer Due Diligence (CDD) rule became applicable on May       11, 2018. The CDD rule requires financial institutions to       collect the ``beneficial ownership'' information of legal       entities with which they conduct commerce. This legislation       would attempt to shift the reporting requirements from large       banks--those best equipped to handle reporting requirements--      to millions of small businesses--those least equipped to       handle reporting requirements.        The reporting requirements in the legislation would not       only be duplicative, they would also be burdensome. Under       this legislation, millions of small businesses would be       required to register personally identifiable information with       FinCEN upon incorporation and file annual reports with FinCEN       for the life of the business. Failure to comply with these       reporting requirements would be a federal crime with civil       penalties up to $10,000, criminal penalties up to 3 years in       prison, or both.        The Congressional Budget Office wrote, ``Because of the       high volume of businesses that must meet the new reporting       requirements and the additional administrative burden to file       a new report, CBO estimates that the total costs to comply       with the mandate would be substantial.'' The Corporate       Transparency Act would generate between 25 million to 30       million new reports annually.        This legislation contains a definition of ``beneficial       ownership'' that expands upon the current CDD rule. The CDD       rule requires disclosure of individuals with a 25 percent       ownership interest in a business and an individual with       significant responsibilities to control a business. The       Corporate Transparency Act would expand that definition,       requiring disclosure of any individual who ``receives       substantial economic benefits from the assets of'' a small       business. The legislation defers to regulators at the       Department of Treasury to determine ``substantial economic       benefits.''        In addition, this legislation would impose a ``look-      through'' reporting requirement, necessitating small business       owners to look through every layer of corporate and LLC       affiliates to identify if any individuals associated with       such entities are qualifying beneficial owners. Ownership of       an entity by one or more other corporations or LLCs is       common. Corporate and LLC shareholders would already have       their own independent reporting obligation under this bill to       disclose any beneficial owners, making this provision       excessively burdensome.        The Corporate Transparency Act raises significant privacy       concerns as the proposed FinCEN ``beneficial ownership''       database would contain the names, dates of birth, addresses,       and unexpired drivers' license numbers or passport numbers of       millions of small business owners. This information would be       accessible upon request ``through appropriate protocols'' to       any local, state, tribal, or federal law enforcement agency       or to law enforcement agencies from other countries via       requests by U.S. federal agencies. This type of regime       presents unacceptable privacy risks.        The Corporate Transparency Act also introduces serious data       breach and cybersecurity risks. Under the legislation, FinCEN       would maintain a database of private information that could       be hacked for nefarious reasons. As the 2015 breach of the       Office of Personnel Management demonstrated, the federal       government is not immune from cyber-attacks and harmful       disclosure of information. In addition, millions of American       companies would be required to maintain and distribute       information about owners and investors in the company, thus       creating another point of vulnerability for attack. This risk       is particularly acute because the Corporate Transparency Act       is focused only on small businesses and those entities are       often the least equipped to fight off cyber intrusions.        While this letter does not enumerate every concern, it       highlights fundamental problems the Corporate Transparency       Act would cause for millions of small businesses in the       United States.        Because of the new reporting requirements and privacy       concerns, the undersigned organizations urge a no vote on       H.R. 2513, the Corporate Transparency Act.            Sincerely,        Air Conditioning Contractors of America, American Business       Conference, American Farm Bureau Federation, American Foundry       Society, American Hotel and Lodging Association, American       Rental Association, Asian American Hotel Owners Association,       Associated Builders and Contractors, Associated General       Contractors of America, Auto Care Association, Family       Business Coalition, International Foodservice Distributors       Association, International Franchise Association.

Mr. Chair, I include in the Record an article on behalf  of the Due Process Institute, the American Civil Liberties Union, and  FreedomWorks in opposition to this bill.          [From the Due Process Institute, ACLU, and FreedomWorks]   No Benefit to a Beneficial Ownership Reporting System That Increases   America's Over-Incarceration Problem and Fails To Adequately Protect                                  Privacy         H.R. 2513 would require people who form or already own       businesses, particularly small businesses, to submit       extensive personal, financial, and business-related       information to the government's Financial Crimes Enforcement       Network (FinCEN). Legislative efforts to stop international       crime by trying to ``follow the money'' such as H.R. 2513       likely have the best intentions in mind. However, the Due       Process Institute, the American Civil Liberties Union, and       FreedomWorks have serious concerns with several provisions of       the Corporate Transparency Act of 2019 and believe the House       should vote no TODAY on H.R. 2513 until these issues are       fully addressed.        In sum, the creation of at least 5 new federal crimes for       first-time ``paperwork'' violations that are felony criminal       offenses calling for prison time is a dramatic step in the       wrong direction. No matter how well-intentioned, this bill       bears no real relation to combatting terrorism or money       laundering and instead eliminates a significant amount of       personal and financial privacy. On that score, the bill fails       to adequately address how all of the personal and financial       information disclosed to, and collected by, the government       will be used solely for legitimate purposes or specifically       address how privacy interests will be protected.                           Key Terms are Too Vague         Importantly, numerous key terms and phrases in the bill are       poorly defined. For example, the current definition of       ``beneficial owner'' includes anyone who ``directly or       indirectly'' exercises substantial control or receives       substantial economic benefit from an  [[Page H8323]]       entity. What does it mean to indirectly control an entity?       The bill does not explain. We also cannot look to current       FinCEN regulations to divine meaning. The bill does not       replicate current FinCEN definitions of beneficial ownership       and broadens the current definition to include an individual       that ``receives substantial economic benefits from the assets       of a corporation.'' Again, the bill does not explain the       term. This lack of clarity has very serious consequences when       a bill creates at least 5 new federal criminal laws that do       nothing but increase this nation's overreliance on       criminalization as a cure for every problem. Vague or overly       broad statutory text leaves people vulnerable to unfair       criminal investigations and prosecutions.     Complex Criminal Compliance Laws Unfairly Burden Small Businesses &                                 Nonprofits         Furthermore, this bill exempts most large entities with the       compliance teams necessary to help them navigate new and       burdensome requirements. Determining what is to be reported,       when, and by whom, in a complex regulatory scheme is       difficult. Large corporations are exempt--leaving the       reporting burdens solely to small or independent       businessowners as well as many nonprofits. Compounding this       problem, these new disclosure requirements would apply not       only to newly formed entities but also to those that have       already been in existence--yet a businessowner (even a first-      time offender) who fails to comply with any aspect of the       requirements could face a prison sentence, as might a non-      profit organization that inadvertently fails to meet all of       the requirements to qualify for an exemption in the bill.       These kinds of requirements easily set traps for honest       people trying to faithfully comply with complex laws,       particularly owners who lack experience or significant funds       and volunteer-based nonprofits also lacking in funds and       expertise to retain sophisticated business lawyers who can       help them.       Beneficial Ownership Information Would Lack Sufficient Privacy                                 Protection         The bill currently would permit beneficial ownership       information to be shared with local, Tribal, State, or       Federal law enforcement under nearly any circumstances where       they may assert an existing investigatory basis and agree to       abide by vague privacy standards. The receiving agency may       then use that information, without meaningful limitation, for       any other law enforcement, national security, or intelligence       purpose. These standards are entirely too broad and leave far       too much personal information vulnerable to disclosure. The       bill should permit FinCEN to disclose beneficial ownership       information only when presented with a warrant based on       probable cause. Without a clear standard limiting information       disclosure, there would be few if any limits on the sharing       of this information. Search warrants based on probable cause       are the standard for obtaining information in criminal       investigations and it would be reasonable to require them in       this context. Moreover, the bill contains inadequate       safeguards for protecting against the improper disclosure of       information or for appropriately limiting the use of the       information disclosed. At a minimum, the bill should limit       use of the information to the investigative purposes for       which it was collected and require the deletion of       information after it is no longer useful for its       investigative purpose. And it fails to provide either.        The truth is: there are already hundreds of federal       criminal laws on the books, along with a wide swath of       powerful investigative tools and authorities, that the       government can use to adequately address or prevent money       laundering and this bill is an unnecessary step in the wrong       direction.        We hope you share our bipartisan concerns and oppose this       legislation when voting today unless serious amendments are       made.     And, Mr. Chair, I include in the Record two newspaper  pieces, or news articles, if you will, from The Wall Street Journal and  from The Verge.   From The Verge, it says: ``FBI violated Americans' privacy by abusing  access to NSA surveillance data, court rules.'' And the second, from  The Wall Street Journal, says: ``FBI's Use of Surveillance Database  Violated Americans' Privacy Rights, Court Found.'' These are two recent  articles that have been published in the last 10 days.                       [From The Verge, Oct. 8, 2019]   FBI Violated Americans' Privacy by Abusing Access to NSA Surveillance                             Data, Court Rules                              (By Nick Statt)   FBI Agents made tens of thousands of unauthorized searches on American                                  Citizens         The Federal Bureau of Investigation made tens of thousands       of unauthorized searches related to US citizens between 2017       and 2018, a court ruled. The agency violated both the law       that authorized the surveillance program they used and the       Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution.        The ruling was made in October 2018 by the Foreign       Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), a secret government       court responsible for reviewing and authorizing searches of       foreign individuals inside and outside the US. It was just       made public today.   THE FBI MADE UNAUTHORIZED, WARRANTLESS ELECTRONIC SEARCHES ON AMERICAN                                  CITIZENS         The program itself, called Section 702 and part of the       broad and aggressive expansion of US spy programs in the       years after 9/11, granted FBI agents the ability to search a       database of electronic intelligence, including phone numbers,       emails, and other identifying data. It's intended for use       primarily by the National Security Agency.        There's a key limitation on Section 702: it can only be       used to search for evidence of a crime or as part of an       investigation into a foreign target. The idea is to monitor       terrorism suspects and cyberthreats.        Yet the FBI vetted American sources using the database,       according to The Wall Street Journal. The agents also used       the database to search for information about themselves. Less       amusingly, they also looked up friends, family, and       coworkers. The court deemed this a clear violation of the       Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable search       and seizure, because none of the searches of US citizens had       proper warrants attached.        The FISC is responsible for evaluating the use of these spy       tools in secret as part of the Foreign Intelligence       Surveillance Act of 1978, which pushed these governmental       deliberations behind closed doors under the guise of       protecting national security. That's why this ruling went a       full year before seeing the light of day.        It's public now because the government lost an appeal in a       separate, secret appeals court, the WSJ says. The FBI must       now create new oversight procedures and a compliance review       team to protect against further surveillance abuse.                                   ____                         [From WSJ, October 8, 2019]  FBI's Use of Surveillance Database Violated Americans' Privacy Rights,                                Court Found                       (By Dustin Volz and Byron Tau)    U.S. discloses ruling last year by Foreign Intelligence Surveillance    Court that FBI's data queries of U.S. citizens were unconstitutional         Washington--Some of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's       electronic surveillance activities violated the       constitutional privacy rights of Americans swept up in a       controversial foreign intelligence program, a secretive       surveillance court has ruled.        The ruling deals a rare rebuke to U.S. spying programs that       have generally withstood legal challenge and review since       they were dramatically expanded after the Sept. 11, 2001,       attacks. The opinion resulted in the FBI agreeing to better       safeguard privacy and apply new procedures, including       recording how the database is searched to detect possible       future compliance issues.        The intelligence community disclosed Tuesday that the       Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court last year found that       the FBI's efforts to search data about Americans ensnared in       a warrantless internet-surveillance program intended to       target foreign suspects have violated the law authorizing the       program, as well as the Constitution's Fourth Amendment       protections against unreasonable searches. The issue was made       public by the government only after it lost an appeal of the       judgment earlier this year before another secret court.        The court concluded that in at least a handful of cases,       the FBI had been improperly searching a database of raw       intelligence for information on Americans--raising concerns       about oversight of the program, which as a spy program       operates in near total secrecy.        The October 2018 court ruling identifies improper searches       of raw intelligence databases by the bureau in 2017 and 2018       that were deemed problematic in part because of their       breadth, which sometimes involved queries related to       thousands or tens of thousands of pieces of data, such as       emails or telephone numbers. In one case, the ruling       suggested, the FBI was using the intelligence information to       vet its personnel and cooperating sources. Federal law       requires that the database only be searched by the FBI as       part of seeking evidence of a crime or for foreign       intelligence information.        In other instances, the court ruled that the database had       been improperly used by individuals. In one case, an FBI       contractor ran a query of an intelligence database--searching       information on himself, other FBI personnel and his       relatives, the court revealed.        The Trump administration failed to make a persuasive       argument that modifying the program to better protect the       privacy of Americans would hinder the FBI's ability to       address national security threats, wrote U.S. District Judge       James Boasberg, who serves on the PISA Court, in the       partially redacted 138-page opinion released Tuesday.        In one case central to the court's opinion, the FBI in       March 2017 conducted a broad search for information related       to more than 70,000 emails, phone numbers and other digital       identifiers. The bureau appeared to be looking for data to       conduct a security review of people with access to its       buildings and computers--meaning the FBI was searching for       data linked to its own employees.        Judge Boasberg wrote that the case demonstrated how a       ``single improper decision or assessment'' resulted in a       search of data belonging to a large number of individuals. He       said the government had reported since April 2017 ``a large       number of FBI queries that  [[Page H8324]]       were not reasonably likely to return foreign-intelligence       information or evidence of a crime,'' the standard required       for such searches.        ``The court accordingly finds that the FBI's querying       procedures and minimization procedures are not consistent       with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment,'' Judge       Boasberg concluded.        The legal fight over the FBI's use of the surveillance tool       has played out in secret since the courts that adjudicate       these issues under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act       of 1978 rarely publicize their work. It was resolved last       month after the government created new procedures in the wake       of losing an appeal to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence       Surveillance Court of Review--a secret appeals court that is       rarely consulted and seldom releases opinions publicly. That       resolution cleared the way for the disclosure Tuesday.        Additionally, FBI Director Chris Wray ordered the creation       of a compliance review team following the October decision, a       bureau official said.        The program in question, known as Section 702 surveillance,       has roots in the national-security tools set up by the George       W. Bush administration following the Sept. 11, 2001,       terrorist attacks. It was later enshrined in law by Congress       to target the electronic communications of nonAmericans       located overseas. The program is principally used by the       National Security Agency to collect certain categories of       foreign intelligence from international phone calls and       emails about terrorism suspects, cyber threats and other       security risks.        Information from that surveillance is often shared with       relevant federal government agencies with the names of any       U.S. persons redacted to protect their privacy, unless an       agency requests that identities be unmasked.        Privacy advocates have long criticized the Section 702 law       for allowing broad surveillance that can implicate Americans       and doesn't require individualized warrants. U.S.       intelligence officials have defended it as among the most       valuable national-security tools at their disposal, even as       intelligence agencies have acknowledged that some       communications from Americans are swept up in the process.        The court documents released Tuesday reveal unprecedented       detail about how communications from Americans were ensnared       and searched by intelligence collection programs that U.S.       officials have publicly said are aimed mainly at foreigners.       They cast doubt on whether law-enforcement and intelligence       agencies are carefully complying with privacy procedures       Congress has mandated.        Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), a critic of U.S. surveillance       programs, said the disclosure ``reveals serious failings in       the FBI's backdoor searches, underscoring the need for the       government to seek a warrant before searching through       mountains of private data on Americans.''        President Trump signed into law a six-year renewal of the       Section 702 program in early 2018. Changes to the law allowed       the court to review the FBI's data handling ultimately led to       the October ruling.        The surveillance court opinions are the latest setback for       U.S. surveillance practices during the Trump administration.       The NSA last year turned off a program that collects domestic       phone metadata--the time and duration of a call but not its       content--amid at least two compliance issues involving the       overcollection of data the spy agency wasn't authorized to       obtain.        The FBI has also been under intense political pressure from       Mr. Trump and his allies, who allege that the bureau's       surveillance of a Trump campaign associate was improper. That       surveillance of the aide, Carter Page, fell under a different       provision of the foreign intelligence law but has       nevertheless sparked a major debate about the scope of the       bureau's authorities.                         Corrections & Amplifications         U.S District Judge James Boasberg's opinion on FBI       surveillance was 138 pages long. An earlier version of this       article incorrectly called it a 167-page opinion. (Oct. 8,       2019)     Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. John W. Rose), from Temperance Hall.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the remainder of my time.  [[Page H8325]]    Mr. Chair, this is a disappointing bill. According to the National  Federation of Independent Businesses, this will create $5.7 billion in  new regulatory costs for America's smallest businesses.   My friend and colleague just said one or two employees, but the bill  before us today says 20 or fewer employees. Traditionally, Congress has  exempted small businesses from onerous government regulation, and  Congress, in its wisdom, has set a threshold of small businesses that  is 50 and above for most regulations that are of national import.   This bill turns all that on its head. It turns it all on its head and  says: No, no, no. We are going to have a special carve-out for all  small businesses, $5 billion and under of revenue and 20 employees and  fewer.    The whole mindset here is absolutely wrong. We are putting a new  small business mandate on America's smallest businesses, and we have an  intelligence bureau that is going to go out to the public and request  information directly from the public.   We don't do that with NSA to look at your cell phone records. In  fact, we require the NSA to go before a court in order to look at a  cell phone database, and there is an enormous amount of litigation  around that.   What we have here is a new Federal Government database by an  intelligence bureau most people haven't heard of, and it is a mandate  on small businesses.   There are no due process protections here. You don't have to go  before a court in order to look at this. In fact, they can just peruse  it at will.   You have no data security standards, so we don't even know if this  will be held to the same standard of data breaches that have already  occurred in our intelligence bureaus and for Federal employees, nor the  same liability standards for Federal users as the private sector has to  protect personally identifiable information.   Again, there is not regulatory relief. Our friends in the banks want  this because they want to be relieved of the burden of collecting this  information. I certainly understand that. But they are still going to  have to collect that information.   There is no repeal of the underlying rule that requires the banks to  collect that type of information in order to transact business with  those small businesses and businesses of other sizes.                                time  1500    So there is no regulatory relief, with few civil liberty protections.  We don't have a cybersecurity standard in the database. And it is a new  mandate on small businesses.   But if you are content with that, vote ``yes,'' and if you don't  think that is sufficient, vote ``no.''   I am going to stand with the NFIB, the American Farm Bureau, the  National Association of Home Builders, National Association of General  Contractors of America, the National Retail Federation, the Real Estate  Roundtable, and other organizations here in Washington, like the ACLU,  Heritage Action for America, the FreedomWorks Foundation, and the  American Civil Liberties Union, as I mentioned, but I want to mention  them twice so that people hear that clearly.   There is bipartisan opposition to this, and so I encourage my  colleagues to vote ``no'' against this new mandate. Stand with your  small business folks, and we will come to a better compromise than what  we have here before us today. Please vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague for yielding.   I do believe, notwithstanding the lack of warrant or subpoena, the  gentleman's amendment gives us greater confidence that the agency and  law enforcement officials will be using this database more  appropriately. I think this is a necessary amendment for this bill to  move forward, though we still have greater issues to contend with.   I appreciate the gentleman working in such a constructive way and  bipartisan way.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    The gentleman's amendment would ensure that law  enforcement professionals who access the beneficial ownership's  database understand the importance of protecting the privacy of  beneficial owners. I think this is a necessary and proper addition to  the bill. I think this highlights the fact that we don't have the basic  due process rights or constitutional protections that we have under the  FISA court or under the Patriot Act.   The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the FISA ``court  concluded that in at least a handful of cases, the FBI had been  improperly searching a database of raw intelligence for information on  Americans--raising concerns about oversight of the program.''   This refresher training is an important step to ensure individuals  who have access to highly sensitive and private information of millions  of Americans are properly trained. Authorized users should only be able  to access information for officially sanctioned uses.   I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment. And while this  amendment is not a sufficient replacement for a warrant or subpoena, it  recognizes that law enforcement must know how to handle personal  information and the need to protect that information. I urge its  adoption.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment exposes the very problem I have with  this new governmental database. We put enormous protections into the  collection of foreigners into our database and intelligence bureaus. We  have granted rights to special courts and that is for information that  is less specific than the information that will be a part of this  beneficial owner or ownership database of America's small businesses.  The amendment here says that basically you redact the specific  personally identifiable information of the beneficial owners of the  small business.   Now, it doesn't have provision for small areas. Let's say that you  are from my hometown or you are from the town I lived in for nearly a  decade, a small town that only has a handful of businesses, and so, you  aggregate the data, but you can still expose people to enormous amounts  of unwanted targeting.   It also exposes to me the additional issues that we have with another  government database, that a future Congress could then take this data  and make it public or some congressional investigator could just want  this for partisan political reasons and try to seek it out of the  executive branch.   This amendment highlights to me the grave concerns I have with a mass  collection of this type of data, no matter how justified the anecdotes  are from law enforcement.   The amendment specifically allows FinCEN to ``issue guidance and  otherwise make materials available to financial institutions and the  public using beneficial ownership information.'' That is deeply  problematic, and I do not believe appropriate protections are in place  for an amendment like this to be made reasonable. I think if you have  civil liberties concerns, I would say that this amendment highlights  the very civil liberties concerns you would have with the new Federal  Government database.   I would like to ask the bill's sponsor, though he is not here, about  the intent of creating this type of information, but he is not here. I  don't think this is a wise amendment. I think it should be rejected for  a number of different counts. I would urge my colleagues to vote  ``no,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. I  include in the Record a letter in opposition to this very amendment  from the National Federation of Independent Business opposing this  amendment.                                [From NFIB]   House Makes Last Minute Bait-and-Switch on Corporate Transparency Act         In advance of today's vote, an amendment filed last night       shows the true motivations of those pushing the Corporate       Transparency Act of 2019 (H.R. 2513).        Despite months of rhetoric about protecting the privacy of       small business owners, this last-minute amendment would allow       the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement       Network to make public the individual names, addresses, birth       dates, and even the driver's license numbers of small       business owners. This is a complete reversal of what       promoters of this bill have been saying over the last several       months.        Purportedly about national security, in reality, this bill       shifts a burden from big  [[Page H8338]]       banks, something they said today is merely ``a client pain       point,'' to small businesses who simply cannot absorb an       additional 131.7 million hours of paperwork over the first 10       years at a cost of $5.7 billion. And, with the last-minute       amendment, it allows for the creation a public registry.        ``Supporters of this bill have revealed their cards       today,'' said Brad Close, NFIB's Senior Vice President,       Public Policy. ``This amendment confirms one of small       business owners' greatest fears--that the true intention of       those pushing this bill is to establish a public registry of       every small business owner--something that can be used to       shame law-abiding small business owners for free speech       activities or political purposes. This is a serious breach of       the privacy and first amendment rights, and we urge members       of the United States House of Representatives to defeat this       amendment today.''        The amendment filed last night would prohibit FinCEN from       making public the names of specific businesses but would not       prohibit FinCEN from listing the names of business owners or       the personally identifiable information of business owners       such as home addresses.        This morning, The Hill published an op-ed by NFIB President       and CEO Juanita D. Duggan on the significant risks and       penalties the Corporate Transparency Act imposes on small       business owners. This followed on the heels of an       announcement by NFIB of a coalition of 38 business groups,       including NFIB, who joined together in strong oppositior of       this legislation.        To read more on NFIB's efforts to protect small business       privacy, visit https://nfib.com/protectprivacy.    Mr. Chair, again, I would highlight that the civil  liberties concerns here are enormous. When you do minimal redaction of  specific personally identifiable information, you could still expose  data in certain jurisdictions of small business owners in a way that I  don't think is warranted, nor do I think the bill's sponsor would like  to seek, and I think this is deeply problematic.   I would urge my colleagues to look at the contents of this amendment  and then to think through the concerns that they would have if it were  their information exposed in a minimally redacted way. I don't think  they would be quite comfortable with it.   Now, think of asking every small business owner in your district to  submit this information to another Federal database and then explain to  them that they will minimally redact their information, maybe not their  name, maybe their address, right, and then otherwise the explanation of  their business would be exposed to the public.   I don't think it is a smart way to go here. I don't think this is the  way we should be legislating. I do think it outlines the underlying  concerns I have with this type of database, in not being required to  get a subpoena in order to access it. And then an amendment that says  that we are going to basically, I don't know, outline in Cherryville,  North Carolina, every small business ownership structure in our little  town or in Denver, North Carolina, which is an unincorporated area that  I live in, likewise, taking a small population with a few small  businesses and exposing the ownership structure of small businesses.   I don't think this is a smart amendment. I don't think it is what we  should be intending as Members of Congress, and I think both folks on  the left and the right and in the middle can look at this and think  this is not the way to go. So I urge you to vote against this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague for yielding.   I think this highlights the very fact that this bill provides no  regulatory relief for financial institutions to collect information  under the customer due diligence rule. It highlights the nature of this  obligation, especially on small businesses, and the paperwork burden on  small businesses and, on top of that, the paperwork burden on financial  institutions to collect enormous amounts of information.   The very nature of this amendment highlights the missing elements of  the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague for yielding.
