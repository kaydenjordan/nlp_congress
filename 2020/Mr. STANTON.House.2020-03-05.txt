 Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House fulfilled a critical  duty. We passed an emergency funding bill to address the coronavirus to  make sure that we give public health officials across America the tools  to help keep Americans healthy.   My State, Arizona, had the fifth confirmed case of COVID-19 and  recently has another presumptive positive case.   Since the first U.S. case was identified, State and local public  health officials have had to carry the heavy burden of responding to  this outbreak and preventing it from getting worse.   Our local communities should not take this on alone. The spread of  the deadly coronavirus demands a coordinated, comprehensive,  government-wide response. In our emergency funding package, we  specifically allocated almost $1 billion to go directly to State and  local communities   In Arizona, our public health officials and our Governor have  indicated a need for upwards of $13 million to effectively meet the  demand that the coronavirus outbreak merits. It is time we get our  State and local agencies the support they need.   Congress must always do all that we can to lift up our local health  officials, and our funding bill does exactly that.                            ____________________
