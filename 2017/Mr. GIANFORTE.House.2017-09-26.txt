 Mr. Speaker, imagine if the entire State of Delaware  burned. That is the scope of what has burned in Montana this year--1.25  million acres of our beautiful State.   I have been on the ground at five fires this summer and I have seen  firsthand the result of failing to manage our forests--over 1 million  acres have burned, livelihoods threatened, wildlife habitats destroyed,  and dangerous air quality in our communities.   I have also seen effective forest management. Last week, I went into  the field with BLM officials to see a forest they manage. When BLM  treated a forest, an approaching fire dropped into the underbrush and  was quickly extinguished. All trees in the treated forest lived, but  trees in the untreated forest died and it won't recover in our  lifetime.   We need to be proactive and start managing our forests again. Well- managed forests are healthier forests with more wildlife, more hunting,  more good-paying jobs for Montanans, and, importantly, our wildfires  are less severe.   On the heels of the catastrophic fires this summer, now is the time  to enact real reform and start managing our forests again.                            ____________________
