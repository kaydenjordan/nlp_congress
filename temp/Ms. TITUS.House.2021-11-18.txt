 Madam Speaker, Democrats know that genuine recovery from  this pandemic means more than returning to the status quo ante.   Earlier this week, we made long overdue investments in our  infrastructure. Now with the Build Back Better Act, we can expand  healthcare coverage and lower costs. We can provide families with  access to affordable childcare and universal preschool. We can reduce  housing costs. We can cut taxes for working people while making the  wealthiest pay their fair share; and we can make the grandest effort in  American history towards combating climate change.   How we choose to invest our resources is a reflection of our values.  The previous administration prioritized handing $2 trillion to  billionaires and big corporations.   Let us instead invest in American workers and families and pass this  Build Back Better Act now.
