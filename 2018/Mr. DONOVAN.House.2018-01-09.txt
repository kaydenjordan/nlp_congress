Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Donovan) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) each  will control 20 minutes.

General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H39]]  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the bill that is under consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H39]]  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on the bill that is under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1486, the Securing American  Non-Profit Organizations Against Terrorism Act of 2017. This bill  authorizes the Nonprofit Security Grant Program within the Department  of Homeland Security.   Administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, this program  provides critical support to help protect at-risk nonprofit  institutions, including Jewish community centers, houses of worship,  and other cultural and community institutions, against threats and  attacks.   Security enhancements covered by the program include the installation  of cameras, physical barriers or controlled entry systems, along with  training for active-shooter scenarios.   Nonprofit organizations in my district have told me about the  positive impact this program has had on their security. In fact, the  Jewish Community Center of Staten Island recently received a $75,000  grant through this program for their facility located on Arthur Kill  Road in order to adequately respond to an increase in threats.   I have also led letters to appropriators advocating for $50 million  for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program and was so glad to see that  the funding level was included in the Make America Secure and  Prosperous Appropriations Act, which passed the House last September.   The bill we are considering today further demonstrates our commitment  to the program by authorizing it for the first time. I was pleased to  work with the ranking member on this language as part of the DHS  Authorization Act that we approved this summer, and I am pleased to  once again support it today.   Nonprofit organizations provide vital services to our communities  every day. The program authorized by the bill we are considering here  today will help provide peace of mind that they will be secure as they  continue to serve their neighbors.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 1486, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCaul. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the cost estimate  from the Congressional Budget Office regarding H.R. 1486. The cost  estimate was not available at the time of the filing of the Committee  report.     =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 9, 2018, on page H39, the following copy was typeset in  Ionic font:
