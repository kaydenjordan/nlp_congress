 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Affordable Insulin  Now Act and the underlying rule.   It is unconscionable that in the richest country the planet has ever  seen, millions of Americans, our neighbors, are forced to choose  between buying medicine and paying their gas bill. Americans pay more  than 10 times the price of insulin compared to other similar countries;  10 times.   In fact, one in four of our neighbors who rely on insulin have  rationed or skipped doses due to costs. I want folks to think about  that. A quarter of the people prescribed insulin for their medical  condition have risked their life to be able to afford another month's  worth of insulin. This is shameful.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6833 caps out-of-pocket costs for insulin at no  more than $35 per month in Medicare and commercial health insurance.  This cap will be a lifesaver for millions of our neighbors who  currently pay 10 times more the price of insulin compared to similar  wealthy nations.   How can these companies sell the exact same drug here for 10 times  the  [[Page H4028]]  price of other nations? Because corporate greed and price gouging are  not just permitted in our country, but encouraged. The bill is not the  complete fix, Mr. Speaker, and we must do more to help our uninsured.  So many are hurt and getting sicker and even dying because of corporate  greed and monopolies of Big Pharma.   This bill is the beginning in reining in corporate greed and putting  people over profits. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
