 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  5363, the FUTURE Act.   I thank all the Members of Congress, the Members of the Senate, the  educational institutions, and the advocates who helped shepherd this  legislation.   Under the FUTURE Act, MSIs will permanently receive the $255 million  they need for the next 10 years. Without this funding, schools would  miss out on funding for STEM programs, academic counseling, and  financial support for students in need.   This funding can be the difference between millions of students being  able to afford college or attend college at all. This funding provides  many students of color with the only opportunity they have ever had to  enter fields where they are so often sorely underrepresented.   We must support these critical efforts by MSIs to help students  complete their college degrees and diversify STEM careers.   Today, many students continue to leave STEM fields while in college,  especially minority students. About 37 percent of Latino STEM students  and 40 percent of Black STEM students will switch majors during  college, compared to 29 percent of White STEM students. About 20  percent of Latino students and 26 percent of Black students will drop  out before completing their STEM degrees.   By providing schools with a means to support their students, we can  prevent these trends from continuing and help diversify all fields of  study. It will help dismantle the lingering discrimination found in  some career fields that these folks want to pursue.   When we diversify, we develop different perspectives, gather better  talent, and become more competitive globally, and I urge my colleagues  to support this piece of legislation.
