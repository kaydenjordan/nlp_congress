 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Giana  Hutton, one of my constituents and a passionate advocate for education  and equity. She was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority,  Incorporated.   Giana grew up in Flossmoor, Illinois, and attended Parker Junior High  School and Homewood-Flossmoor High School. She obtained her BA in  history from Williams College in 2010 at just 18 years of age. Later,  she completed a master's of science in public policy and management  from Carnegie Mellon University, one of our Nation's most prestigious  programs.   Between her studies, she interned for Illinois Senator Roland Burris,  supporting staff working on education and judiciary policy.   Most recently, she was working as a program analyst for the Office of  the State Superintendent of Education in Washington, D.C. In this role,  she directly supported the educational success of District students by  helping programs work better and be more effective.   She had recently been accepted in the District's Certified Public  Manager Program Cohort at GW University.   Giana is survived by her fiance, parents, and sister. Giana will be  greatly missed by all, especially the young people whose lives she  positively impacted through her work.   As we remember her life and legacy, we must recommit to her passion:  educational equity and the opportunity for every young American to  receive a quality education.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 8247, the Veterans COMPACT Act. This important package  will help veterans struggling with mental health and slow the alarming  rate of veteran suicides in this country.   This package includes my bipartisan bill, H.R. 7747, which implements  reporting requirements for the VA Solid Start program. The Solid Start  program is a new transitional program designed to contact veterans  three times during the first year after departing military service.   Veterans are often at their most vulnerable as they transition to  civilian life. From waking up to a less structured day to having to  navigate the  [[Page H4769]]  often-frustrating VA benefits system, veterans can feel alone or  overwhelmed. But we can change that.   The proactive engagement from this program has already produced  positive results. In its first year, VA representatives have helped  more than 750 veterans apply for disability benefits, and several  veterans in crisis were immediately connected to suicide prevention  services.   We need to build on that success. Sometimes all it takes is a  friendly voice on the other end of the line to make a difference.   I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting the Veterans  COMPACT Act so we can give our veterans the support they deserve.
