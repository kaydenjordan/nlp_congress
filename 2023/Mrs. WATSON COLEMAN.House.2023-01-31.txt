 Mr. Speaker, I rise today appalled and disgusted  and brokenhearted. Like so many others, I am still struggling to  process the sheer inhumanity on display in the murder of Tyre Nichols.   Last week, our Nation watched helplessly as another innocent Black  man was beaten to death by men sworn to serve and protect. In the final  moments of his life, Tyre Nichols cried out for help as he struggled to  understand what he possibly could have done to deserve such a fate.   As a mother, seeing Tyre cry out for his mom deeply pains me. As a  Black woman, I am furious at the injustice that Black Americans face  every day. As a human being, the vicious murder I have seen leaves me  shaken to my core.   Tyre Nichols was a human being with a life as beautiful as any other.  He was a photographer. He loved skateboarding. He was a son to a loving  mother and a father to a 4-year-old son.   Tyre will never get to see his son grow up, and his son will never  get another hug from his father.   I mourn Tyre, and I pray for his loved ones. I mourn Keenan Anderson,  who invoked George Floyd's name when he, too, was killed by police this  month. I mourn Elijah McClain, Philando Castile, Tamir Rice, and every  other Black life stolen from us by police.   I have grown weary of my mourning, though, Mr. Speaker, because  history has repeated itself once again.   The murder of Tyre Nichols comes 3 years after the murder of Breonna  Taylor. It comes 9 years after the murder of Michael Brown. It comes 14  years after the murder of Oscar Grant. It comes 153 years after the  murder of Henry Truman in 1870.   Nothing we can do will ever bring back Tyre Nichols, Daunte Wright,  Eric Garner, or any Black American killed by a system that did not  value their lives. We can, however, demand accountability and sweeping  reforms from police departments that have built, maintained, and even  encouraged a culture of brutality and even racism.   The time is now to reevaluate and reimagine the role of police in our  community. We must stop waiting for justice and start doing our jobs.   As public servants, we have a duty to do right by our communities,  even if that means starting the long, difficult process of reforming  and restructuring our justice system. It is the duty of the Federal  Government to ensure that law enforcement is used to protect  communities, not tear them apart.   Last Congress, the House passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing  Act, but the Senate blocked it from becoming law. That was a  disappointment, but it cannot be a defeat.   This Congress, we have a new opportunity to end qualified immunity  and protect our communities. However, that opportunity will not seize  itself.   House Republicans have spent endless time and resources establishing  committees for conspiracy theories but have offered zero solutions to  the rising tide of police brutality. I call on all of my colleagues to  commit or recommit themselves to fixing the fundamental flaws in the  fabric of our justice system. If we fail to do so, our society will  forever be one in which police are seen as an occupying force instead  of a force for good.                            ____________________
