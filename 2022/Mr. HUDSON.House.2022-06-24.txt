 Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so  that we can immediately consider my bill, H.R. 7966, the STOP II,  Secure Every School and Protect our Nation's Children Act.   It is an honor to be here today. In fact, what an honor that the  people of North Carolina's Eighth Congressional District have bestowed  upon me to allow me to be their Representative here in the United  States Congress.   As I walked the Halls of this Capitol building this morning, I  couldn't help but think of the great American patriots who have served  here before us.   I think about the patriots who came before, who pledged their lives,  their property, and their sacred honor so that we could live in the  freedom and prosperity we enjoy today. People like Patrick Henry, who  famously said: ``Give me liberty or give me death.''   The courage of our Founders, the faith, the strength of their  convictions, the belief in an ideal--indeed, an idea--that all people  are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. And they  devised a Constitution that protects and guarantees these rights. It is  an incredible thing to think about, the legacy they have left in the  hands of this, the 117th Congress. Each one of us swore an oath when we  accepted this office. It wasn't an oath to a person or a political  party. It was an oath to defend the Constitution.   The issue before us today is what can we do--no, what should we do  when faced with the challenge before us, this epidemic of children  taking the lives of other children in our schools?   Every single one of us grieves for the lives taken. As the father of  an elementary school child, my heart aches for the lives lost and the  unimaginable pain and grief felt by those who love them. Neither party  cares more about this. Neither political party has a monopoly on  wanting to do something.    That is why Republicans have come to the table with ideas that will  actually get to some of the root causes of this violence. More than 12  pieces of legislation have been introduced by Republican Members of  this House to strengthen background checks, to improve law enforcement  coordination and response, to address the mental health needs of our  children, to make schools safer, and to prevent this violence.   To date, my colleagues across the aisle have been unwilling to engage  with us, to seek consensus, to work together to solve this problem.   Just a few weeks ago, the majority party brought forth a package of  gun control measures. This legislation targeted the constitutional  rights of law-abiding citizens. This legislation did nothing to address  the security in our schools. It did nothing to provide better mental  health resources to improve the ability of school officials and law  enforcement to intervene with these children in crisis. But it did let  a lot of people around here feel better, because they could go home and  say: We did something.   Over in the Senate, they aren't even considering this reckless  package of bills. But Republicans and Democrats in the Senate did  attempt to work together to find a solution, and there are many things  that I like about this Senate legislation. In fact, I am flattered that  they use much of the mental health and school safety provisions from my  legislation. But as much as we feel the need to do something to tackle  this problem, we cannot forget that oath that we all took on the first  day of this Congress.                                time  0945    Our highest calling as a Member of Congress is to defend the  Constitution. And that is where this legislation sent to us by the  Senate falls short. This open-ended gun control legislation opens the  door to Federal funding of State red flag laws. First of all, these  laws don't work.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a list of 12 mass shootings  that have taken place in States that already have red flag laws.                           ``Red Flag'' Failures         May 14, 2022, Buffalo, N.Y.

Kevin Janson Neal, 5 fatalities        California's ``Red Flag'' law was enacted in 2016     Madam Speaker, the State with the most mass shootings is  California. California has the most restrictive gun laws in America.  California already has a red flag law. But more important to this  debate, red flag laws subvert due process protections and threaten the  constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.   Why would we agree to borrow more money that we don't have so the  Federal Government can give it to States to enact laws that don't work  and that actually threaten the rights of our citizens?   Why would we do that?   Second, this legislation singles out law-abiding citizens under the  age of 21 by giving the government discretion to delay, for any reason,  their constitutionally protected right to a firearm--a right, by the  way, affirmed, yet again, by the Supreme Court just yesterday.   We all want to keep firearms out of the hands of people that  shouldn't have them, and I am willing to consider ways to better  identify people with mental health challenges, but I can't help but  think about that 20-year-old paratrooper stationed in Fort Bragg, North  Carolina.   Our Nation entrusted him to defend us with an automatic weapon or a  multimillion-dollar-weapon system, but we can't trust him with a  semiautomatic weapon to defend themselves in their own home?   What about the 20-year-old spouse back home in Spring Lake, North  Carolina, alone because our paratrooper has deployed in service of our  Nation. Are we to tell this spouse that the government doesn't trust  you to defend your home?   Instead, we are going to delay your purchase for 10 days. At the end  of the 10 days, the government doesn't even have to get back to the gun  owner or the gun store. Let that gun dealer decide if they want to take  a risk on selling you this firearm while an FBI investigation is still  open.   No, this is a de facto ban on gun sales to law-abiding citizens under  the age of 21.  [[Page H5887]]    Third, this legislation also broadens firearm prohibitions for  misdemeanors and nonviolent offenders. I think most of us can agree,  someone convicted of beating up their spouse ought to be put on the  background check system. The law extends this to misdemeanor assault on  a spouse or someone with whom you share a child. But we have to be  careful when we are talking about taking away a constitutionally  protected right over other misdemeanors.   The language of this bill is so broad it can include nonviolent  offenders, and I am concerned that the due process protections are  simply not there.   So what are we proposing today? Let's set aside these controversial  unconstitutional provisions that divide us. Let's unite around the idea  that we are going to tackle the real causes of this violence. These  school shootings are almost always done by a young male, often from a  single-parent or no-parent home. They have experienced some trauma in  their life. Most are likely on some behavioral medication, and they  have shown plenty of signs of being in crisis. Yet, effective  intervention and mental health treatment did not happen.   So let's start there. Today, I rise to propose we defeat this  previous question and replace the Senate language with H.R. 7966.   This legislation builds on the STOP School Violence Act signed into  law in 2018 by providing a billion dollars in grants to hire more  school resource officers. It provides $1 billion to hire mental health  guidance counselors so that schools have the resources to intervene  with these children in crisis.   Imagine, if we had been able to intervene with the shooter in Uvalde  before he dropped out of high school.   This legislation includes $5 billion to fund STOP School Violence  programs to make schools safer, to provide active shooter training to  law enforcement, and to better equip school officials and students and  law enforcement to intervene before one of these students reaches the  breaking point. This $7 billion is paid for by redirecting unspent  COVID-19 funds that have already been approved.   Also, under my legislation, schools can apply for a threat assessment  to identify weaknesses in their security and to assess the mental  health services at the school. We would also codify a clearinghouse at  Homeland Security to collect and share best practices for school  safety. These are practical, commonsense solutions that we should all  be able to agree will have a real impact.   Madam Speaker, I agree with my friend. Now is our moment. Today, we  can come together--Republicans and Democrats--and really address these  issues in a meaningful way. We can do this while at the same time  keeping the promise made by the sacrifice and the courage of our  Founders by upholding our pledge on the first day in office to defend  this Constitution.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against the previous  question so we can immediately consider this important legislation. God  bless you.
