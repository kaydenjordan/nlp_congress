 Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Mitch and  Lilly Zimmerman, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming's 2023  honorees.  [[Page S2455]]    The Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming began in 1969 as an  organization to promote character development in young boys. Today,  both boys and girls participate in the clubs to develop leadership  skills and athletic abilities. They learn about a healthy lifestyle  while focusing on character development and personal growth.   The mission of the club is to ``enable all young people, especially  those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive,  caring, responsible citizens.'' The hundreds of adult mentors and  volunteers who dedicate their time and passion make the success of this  organization possible. Each year, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central  Wyoming honors one or more individuals for their nonstop support and  guidance of Wyoming's youth.   On the morning of September 13, 2023, the Boys and Girls Clubs of  Central Wyoming will host their 25th annual awards and recognition  breakfast in Casper. They will honor Mitch and Lilly Zimmerman for  their resolute dedication to Casper's youth. The Zimmermans' reputable  character and commitment to Wyoming's youth is commendable. With this  award, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming affirms their  appreciation for these community leaders.   Raised in Wyoming, Mitch and Lilly graduated from Natrona County High  School. They married shortly after Mitch's graduation from college.  Their Wyoming roots continued to grow. They both started their own  businesses in Casper and engaged in charitable outreach. Mitch's  entrepreneurial journey began in 1996 when he opened Computer  Associates, a system network integration and software design company  that still operates in Casper today. His devotion to bettering the  community does not stop there. Mitch has served on the board of  directors, including president, for the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central  Wyoming for 20 years. In addition, he has coached youth swimming and  soccer for over 20 years. Lilly serves as the director of advancement  at the True Care Women's Resource Center. She coordinates fundraisers  and oversees the organization's volunteers. Prior to serving at True  Care, Lilly owned a children's clothing store. Along with serving the  women of the community, Lilly dedicates her time helping youth. She  served on the board of directors, including president, for the Youth  for Christ Organization for over 10 years. She has gone on several  international mission trips. The Zimmermans raised two sons in Casper,  Collin and Austin. Collin, married to Taryn, has two children, Beau and  Emory.   Mitch and Lilly's community service and business ventures are guided  by one important question they ask themselves every day, ``How can I be  a servant and a role model today?'' It is with that commitment that  they have touched the lives of so many children in Casper.   The Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming are essential in helping  young people reach their full potential as productive, responsible, and  caring citizens. These services would not be possible without the  passion and care of volunteers like Mitch and Lilly. They are  extraordinary role models.   It is with great honor that I recognize and celebrate this incredible  couple and their steady commitment to Casper's youth. They are  incredibly dedicated members of the community. They represent the best  of Wyoming. Bobbi joins me in extending our congratulations to Mitch  and Lilly Zimmerman for their selection for this special award.                            ____________________
