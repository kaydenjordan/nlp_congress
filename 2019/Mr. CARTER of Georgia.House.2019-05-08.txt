 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Command  Sergeant Major Carol Warren-Clark on her retirement after serving over  30 years in our United States Armed Forces.   She has dedicated her time in the military to healthcare,  administering it in nearly every capacity imaginable to keep our  soldiers healthy.   In Afghanistan, she was responsible for medical evacuation plans. At  Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, CMS Warren-Clark directed  all inpatient services.   She also led a medical team for the 57th Presidential inauguration.   Her latest position has been as command sergeant major for the Winn  Army Community Hospital located in the First Congressional District of  Georgia, where her ability to increase efficiency and readiness has  shined. By decreasing administrative costs 5 percent at the hospital  and boosting soldier deployment readiness 5 percent, she has made  significant contributions to every soldier and our military as a whole.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Command Sergeant Major Warren-Clark for her  commitment and her service to our Nation.   Enjoy your retirement, and congratulations.                            ____________________
