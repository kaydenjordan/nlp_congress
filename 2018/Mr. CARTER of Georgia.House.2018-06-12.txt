 Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5327) to amend title V of the Public Health Service  Act to establish a grant program to create comprehensive opioid  recovery centers, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5327         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R. 5327,  the Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act. This legislation will  help support the establishment of Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers  to serve as models for comprehensive treatment and recovery. These  centers will provide substance use disorder patients with a wide range  of treatment options for integrated care. By treating the whole person  and utilizing the full range of FDA-approved medications and evidence- based treatments, these centers will dramatically improve the outcomes  for individuals with substance use disorder and serve as models for  evidence-based treatment across the country.   I would like to thank the vice chairman of the Health Subcommittee  Vice Chairman Brett Guthrie, Health Subcommittee Ranking Member Gene  Green, and Representatives Larry Bucshon and Ben Ray Lujan for leading  this important initiative.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, in 2008 Congress strengthened prohibitions against  inappropriately distributing and dispensing controlled substances  online by passing the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection  Act.   The Ryan Haight Act made it illegal for a practitioner to dispense  controlled substances through the Internet without at least one in- person patient evaluation. The law included the ability for the  Attorney General to issue a special registration to healthcare  providers detailing in what circumstances they could prescribe  controlled substances via telemedicine in legitimate emergency  situations, such as a lack of access to an in-person specialist.   However, the waiver process has never been implemented through  regulation. Thus, some patients still do not have access to care that  they need.   The Special Registration for Telemedicine Clarification Act directs  the Attorney General to promulgate interim final regulations within 1  year after passage of the law. The 62 million Americans living in rural  communities are more likely to be older, poorer, and suffer higher  rates of chronic disease than their urban counterparts.   Furthermore, a disproportionate number of Americans living in rural  communities are struggling with prescription opioid abuse. We must  ensure that these individuals are able to access the care that they  need.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bipartisan legislation  co-led by my colleague across the aisle, Representative Bustos, to  connect patients with the substance use disorder treatment they need  without jeopardizing important safeguards to prevent misuse or  diversion.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, each year, approximately 4\1/2\ million Americans use  prescription pain medications for nonmedical purposes, contributing to  89 deaths per day. Of those who misuse prescription pain relievers, 53  percent reported obtaining them from friends or relatives.   Although past legislative efforts have encouraged innovation in  prescription drug regulation, law enforcement, and education, there are  still individuals who have severe, legitimate chronic pain and need  access to opioids.   Abuse-deterrent formulations, ADFs, represent a breakthrough  technology for these individuals that helps prevent the crushing, the  snorting, and the injection of painkillers. Currently, many  prescription drug plans present barriers to ADFs, including cost- sharing tiers, fail-first requirements, pricing, and prior  authorization requirements, all limiting patient access to abuse- deterrent formulations.   This legislation directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to conduct a study on barriers to accessing abuse-deterrent  formulations for chronic pain patients enrolled in Medicare. Solutions  to this public health crisis must balance the need to preserve access  to effective pain medications for legitimate patients living with pain  while minimizing the risk of  [[Page H5063]]  opioid misuse and abuse that occurs in our communities.   I am proud to introduce this legislation with my colleague across the  aisle, Representative Loebsack, and my Ways and Means colleague,  Representative Reed. I urge Members' support.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, deaths from drug overdoses have risen in nearly every  county across the United States, with 47,055 Americans being lost each  year due to overdose, the equivalent of about 115 people every day.   Pharmacists are the last line of defense in the fight against  prescription drug abuse.   Under current law, pharmacists are required to exercise sound  professional judgment when making a determination about the legitimacy  of a controlled substance prescription. While the proper prescribing of  controlled substances is a responsibility of the prescribing  practitioner, pharmacists have a corresponding responsibility to ensure  that controlled substances are only dispensed pursuant to a valid  prescription issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a practitioner  acting in the usual course of his professional practice.   Even though pharmacists are not law enforcement officers, they play  an important role in preventing the use of fraudulent prescriptions at  the pharmacy counter.   The Empowering Pharmacists in the Fight Against Opioid Abuse Act  would require the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug  Enforcement Administration, and other Federal agencies responsible for  combating the opioid epidemic to produce and disseminate materials to  pharmacists that provide guidance on when and how to refuse to fill a  prescription that the pharmacist believes to be fraudulent.   I urge Members to support this commonsense legislation led by my  colleague across the aisle, Representative DeSaulnier, and myself that  will help improve the last line of defense against prescription drug  abuse in our communities.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I would also like to thank my colleague, Mr. Griffith, for all his  work on this very important legislation. I would also like to thank him  for including language that requires a report on the impact of PDMPs on  patient access to appropriate care. This is critical for epilepsy  patients that can face barriers to accessing their Schedule V non- narcotic drugs necessary to control their seizures.   Several epilepsy medications are classified as Schedule V and,  therefore, fall under monitoring requirements, despite the fact that  they are non-opioid, non-narcotic, and there is no evidence to indicate  that these medications are being abused by people with epilepsy. This  has led to unnecessary delays in access to their prescribed therapy.   A handful of States have passed legislation that removes non-narcotic  drugs from reporting requirements. As we work through legislation  intended to combat the opioid crisis, we need to ensure that we do not  limit access to legitimate care, especially to non-narcotic drugs.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  life of my friend, Mr. Jerry Lee Loupee, who passed away on May 28 at  the age of 83.   During my time being involved in politics in Chatham County, I got to  know Jerry Loupee. I got to know him and his wife, Bonnie, because they  were stalwarts. They were strong supporters of the Republican Party.   Jerry was an integral part of the Skidaway Island Republican Club,  the Chatham County Republican Party, and many charitable organizations  around the world, always striving to make the world a better place to  live.   Jerry said: ``If you teach your children compassion, you have done  half the job of raising them right.''   At home, he served to protect Georgia through the Georgia State  Defense Force. Abroad, he worked for 31 years for Hercules Inc. in  Pakistan, Taiwan, and Thailand, before coming back to his home in  Savannah.   Recently, Jerry and Bonnie had moved back to their home in Iowa. My  wife, Amy, and I had the opportunity to visit with them before they  moved. I am glad we had that final opportunity to be with Jerry.   Bonnie, please know that we love you very much, and we share with you  in the celebration of Jerry's life. Jerry was a true friend to many in  Savannah and around the world, and he truly will be missed.                            ____________________
