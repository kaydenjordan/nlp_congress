 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, it was my privilege to  welcome a distinguished group of Kentucky veterans from all across the  Commonwealth to our Nation's Capital. Representing every branch of the  military, more than 60 Kentuckians who served in World War II, Korea,  and Vietnam traveled to Washington to visit the memorials built in  their honor.   The Honor Flight program, which coordinates these trips, is finally  back up and running after the COVID-19 pandemic shut down their  operations last year. I couldn't be more thankful for this  organization's seamless planning and execution, especially in light of  this year's added complications.   The Honor Flight Bluegrass chapter has brought hundreds of veterans  to Washington over the years, mirroring the important work of their  peer organizations all across the country. Despite the significant  logistical and financial hurdles, the Honor Flight program ensures  every veteran can travel at no cost to themselves.   I had the opportunity to meet with some of these Kentucky heroes and  listen to their incredible stories. Their service spanned generations,  continents, and conflicts. But one thread unites them all: a complete  dedication to the cause of freedom and a deep love for our great  Nation.   As the son of a World War II veteran, I have a special appreciation  for these men and women. It was a great honor to stand by their side as  they visited the solemn monuments constructed to commemorate their  sacrifice. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to those brave  servicemembers and to the hard-working Honor Flight organizers and  volunteers who made their visit possible.
