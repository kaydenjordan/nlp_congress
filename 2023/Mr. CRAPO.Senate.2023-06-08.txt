 Mr. President, with my colleagues Senator Jim Risch  and Representative Russ Fulcher, we congratulate Dworshak staff on the  dam's 50-year anniversary.   Dedicated on June 15, 1973, the Dworshak Dam, located on the North  Fork Clearwater River, has been an important flood control and power  generator for 50 years. Following its congressional authorization in  1962 and construction that began in 1966, the dam's flood damage  reduction became operational in June 1972, with power generation coming  online in March 1973. In addition to the dam, the project also includes  Dworshak Reservoir lands, powerhouse, recreation facilities, wildlife  mitigation and Dworshak National Fish Hatchery, which is considered to  be the world's largest steelhead hatchery.  [[Page S2026]]    The USACE Walla Walla District notes the dam is the highest straight- axis concrete dam in the Western Hemisphere, with only two other dams  in the U.S. exceeding its height. USACE credits the project with  preventing millions of dollars in flood damage since the project became  operational, while generating 1.35 billion kilowatt hours of  electricity in fiscal year 2017 alone, and providing substantial  recreational and wildlife benefits.   Dworshak staff are recognizing the 50th anniversary of the dedication  of the dam with a celebration and public tours. We join in commending  the hard work of both current and past Dworshak staff in operating this  remarkable part of our great State and country's infrastructure.  Congratulations to all Dworshak staff and surrounding communities on  this outstanding milestone.                            ____________________
