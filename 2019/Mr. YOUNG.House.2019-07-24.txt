 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this is about fairness, and when you have been in this  office as long as I have been--I was here when we passed the 1984, the  1985, and the 1986 gaming laws--we tried and expected to do the right  thing for all Tribes. I say I have been involved with this. When I was  chairman, we tried to do the same thing. It is the right thing to do.  It is the fair thing to do. The most important thing is it is a simple  matter of fairness.   I will say it again. These two Tribes have been denied the same  opportunity of every other federally recognized Tribe, including the  Kickapoo Tribe, to engage in Class II gaming on their reservation.  Class II is bingo.   This legislation opens no new door to gaming in Texas. The Kickapoo  Tribe has been offering bingo on their reservation for the better part  of two decades with no interference from the State of Texas.   Second, it should be noted that virtually all communities surrounding  the Alabama-Coushatta reservation have passed a resolution endorsing  this legislation. In fact, over 30 resolutions in favor of H.R. 759  show that support for the bill runs from the Gulf of Mexico to the Red  River border on Oklahoma.   This represents genuine grassroots support for the people who will be  most impacted. Far from thwarting the will of the people of Texas, this  legislation enables it.   Mr. Speaker, from someone who has worked on this legislation a long  time, I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation to  solve an unfair state.
