 Mr. President, section 3005 of H. Con. Res. 71, 115th  Congress, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018,  allows the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the  allocations, aggregates and levels in the budget resolution for  legislation related to the extension of certain healthcare policies.  This adjustment authority, which was updated by the Bipartisan Budget  Act of 2019, is contingent on the legislation not increasing the  deficit over either the period of fiscal years 2020-2024 or the period  of fiscal years 2020-2029.   I find that H.R. 4378, the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and  Health Extenders Act of 2019, meets the conditions of deficit  neutrality found in section 3005 of H. Con. Res 71. This determination  has been made by looking at the deficit effects of the revenue and  direct spending provisions of both Division A and Division B of H.R.  4378. Accordingly, I am revising the allocations to the Committee on  Finance and the budgetary aggregates to account for the direct spending  and revenue effects of the bill. Further, I am temporarily adjusting  the Senate's PAYGO scorecard to reflect the $667 million deficit  increase in Fiscal Year 2020 and deficit decreases of $477 million and  $1 million over the 5- and 10-year periods, respectively. In  recognition of the instruction to exclude the budgetary effects of  division B from the PAYGO scorecard in title VII, the table  accompanying this statement reflects only the prorated revenue effects  of division A, which are not covered by the exception and whose  adjustments will remain for PAYGO scorecard purposes.   Section 124 of division A provides for additional budgetary resources  for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and designates those  resources as being for overseas contingency operations/global war on  terrorism, OCO, pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced  Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. This  designation makes this spending qualify for a discretionary cap  adjustment under current statute. This provision has no effect on  budget authority but would increase outlays by $128 million in Fiscal  Year 2020. Therefore, I am revising the allocation to the Committee on  Appropriations and further modifying the spending aggregate for Fiscal  Year 2020 to accommodate these outlays.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               BUDGET AGGREGATES--BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS  (Pursuant to Sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of  1974 and Section 3005 of H.
