 Madam Speaker, I rise today to advocate for an  appropriation request I have put forward to provide adequate funding to  the Social Security Administration.  [[Page H2840]]    Social Security enables millions of Americans to make ends meet,  including retired and disabled workers, and the families of deceased  workers. It is a program that working folks have been paying into their  entire working lives.   Despite the agency's effectiveness, funding cuts have created a  massive, and in some cases life-threatening, backlog.   The national average wait time for a Social Security Disability  Insurance benefits hearing is 535 days. And last year, Philadelphia, in  my State, had the longest average wait time in the country: 26 months.  One West Philadelphia woman with multiple sclerosis waited 878 days  before getting a favorable ruling.   Given this reality, I am truly alarmed that, rather than fully  funding Social Security, the President's budget is consistently  hundreds of millions of dollars less than what Congress enacted the  previous year.   This sums up why people are fed up with Washington: powerful  politicians keeping everyday Americans from the benefits they have  earned. The injustice needs to stop. We must stand with working  families and help them obtain their benefits.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the Byrne amendment.    Madam Chair, don't be mistaken. This amendment is a clear  attempt to undermine the fundamental objectives of the Paycheck  Fairness Act, which are to engender pay disparity by, in part, further  clarifying congressional intent so that courts can no longer dismiss  meritorious claims.   The Paycheck Fairness Act fixes current employment discrimination and  pay discrimination laws, laws that have proven insufficient, given that  women still earn 80 cents on the dollar compared to similarly situated  White men. And, of course, the disparity for women of color is even  greater.   Under the current Equal Pay Act, an employer is not liable for gender  pay disparity if the disparity is due to merit, seniority, quality of  production or ``a factor other than sex.'' Some courts have interpreted  the ``factor other than sex'' criteria so broadly that it frustrates  the codified intent of the Equal Pay Act.   For instance, some courts have found that the ``factor other than  sex'' need not be business related or even related to the particular  job in question. Some courts have interpreted the ``factor other than  sex'' defense to include ``market forces,'' or worse, accepted the  argument that pay disparity can be explained by an employer's ``random  decision.''   Those interpretations are nothing more than a lifesaver for  pretextual discrimination. This amendment does the same thing.   My Republican colleagues' suggestion that the Paycheck Fairness Act  eliminates the ``factor other than sex'' defense is contradicted by the  text of this bill. An employer may still raise a ``factor other than  sex'' defense provided that the ``factor other than sex'' be bona fide,  job related, and required by business necessity.   This amendment's attempt to strike section (3)(a)(3), which explains  what constitutes a bona fide factor, is an attempt to create ambiguity  so that courts continue to interpret the act's protection in a narrow  way.   This bill provides necessary clarity that this bona fide factor  defense is only available when there is a real business necessity. This  bill ensures that there is a connection between the pay disparity and  the specific job in question. This amendment is contrary to the  congressional intent of the underlying bill, and I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this bill clarifies that the ``factor other  than sex'' is only available on a bona fide job-related and business  necessary reason.   It clarifies that this defense is not available where the employee  demonstrates that a reasonable alternative employment practice would  serve the same business purpose without producing a pay disparity and  that the employer refused to adopt such an alternative practice.   Carefully consider those words. This is a burden-shifting provision  that would simply allow an employee to show a reasonable alternative.  It adds nothing to an employer's existing burden. It only allows an  employee to rebut that defense with evidence.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think it is important, given that we are  having a discussion here over who understands the text of the bill, to  read it directly into the Record.   ``The bona fide factor defense, described in subparagraph (A)(iv)  shall apply only if the employer demonstrates that such factor (i) is  not based upon or derived from a sex-based differential in  compensation; (ii) is job related with respect to the position in  question; (iii) is consistent with business necessity; and, (iv)  accounts for the entire differential in compensation at issue.''   It is very clearly set forth in the text.   Mr. Chairman, I, therefore, continue to urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on the Byrne amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think it is my colleague from Alabama who  is confused about the wording of this text. His amendment would  specifically eliminate the wording that I just read into the Record.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment eliminates clarity. It simply  replaces it with the words ``bona fide,'' with no additional definition  or guidance, thereby ensuring that this defense will continue to be  misunderstood, misused, and incorrectly applied by the courts.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, I am opposed to all caps on attorney's fees  in this type of case.   The only criteria for the amount of attorney's fees charged should be  reasonableness in the context of the case itself.   I have spent more than 30 years in courtrooms, most of that time  representing the defense in civil matters, almost always for companies;  in other words, against the very trial lawyers we speak of.   So I have no bias in favor of those lawyers, but let me tell you  this: representing plaintiffs in employment cases is a very hard job.  These lawyers work for every penny they earn. They take cases that put  their own livelihood at risk.   Many employment cases take years to resolve. Often they have to go to  court over and over to litigate discovery and pretrial matters, and all  the while, they are not collecting a paycheck from that case, because  they have taken it on a contingent fee basis.   Without an award at the end of the case, they receive nothing, and  they advance out-of-pocket expenses.   But even more important, without these lawyers, low-income female  employees with legitimate grievances would have no recourse. Only with  a competent lawyer's help can they proceed.   This motion, if passed, would discourage lawyers from taking these  cases. And if they don't take these cases, employees, workers, families  lose out.   The only test for attorney's fees should be reasonableness. Courts  and judges are well equipped to determine whether a fee is reasonable,  far better equipped than Congress is.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms.  Sherrill).                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
