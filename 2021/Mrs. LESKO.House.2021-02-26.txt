 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule.   Only 9 percent of the underlying bill goes to combating COVID-19  through public health spending. The other 91  [[Page H769]]  percent is a partisan wish list being pushed by my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle. Union pensions, blue State bailouts, Planned  Parenthood, and even a bridge and a tunnel. That is what most of this  bill is about, not COVID-19 relief.   We need targeted, tailored relief that actually helps the American  people, not this $2 trillion boondoggle.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule and the  underlying bill.
