 Mr. Speaker, I stand in steadfast opposition to both S.J.  Res. 9 and S.J. Res. 24. These resolutions represent a deeply  concerning, misguided attempt to undermine the Endangered Species Act.  These partisan resolutions are also out of step with what Americans  care about.   Our constituents are looking for us to lead, to take action to  restore a healthy, biodiverse, and climate-stable planet. We took  important actions in the last Congress, and we are seeing the results  now--funding for cities like Alexandria to transition to electric  schoolbuses that are healthier for kids, creating jobs for climate- ready coasts so these communities are resilient to extreme weather, new  clean energy manufacturing so that people have jobs and healthier  workspaces for a healthier planet for us all.   These resolutions are part of an agenda that puts polluters over  people. Americans don't want to see politicians interfering to reverse  science-based endangered species protections, cementing a species' path  to extinction, just like they don't want to see us cementing the  country on a path of more fossil fuel pollution, causing extreme  weather and the overheating that is destroying the country right now.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle spent 2 years shouting  about things like inflation and public safety, but now, in power, they  are heading into a 6-week recess focused on stripping protections from  bats and lesser prairie-chickens.   How does this help inflation? How does it help make people safer? It  doesn't.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to see that these resolutions are  misguided, even silly, and vote ``no.''                                time  1245
