 Madam President, everything we are doing to lead our  country to build back better from this pandemic is about putting  workers at the center of our economy. It is about raising wages and  bringing down costs.   We know what has happened in this country in the last decade. We have  seen profits go up. We have seen the stock market go skyward. We have  seen executive compensation explode upward. Yet wages in Nevada and  Ohio and all over this country have essentially been flat. That is why  this Build Back Better plan is about raising wages and bringing down  costs.   We know what is wrong with our country. I said 20 years. It has been  30 years, 40 years where productivity has gone up. Workers are earning  more and more for their companies and for their bosses, but they simply  aren't sharing in the wealth that they have created. They have simply  seen their wages flat.   It has gotten more and more expensive for families to raise a family  and build a middle-class life. Healthcare, childcare, prescription  drugs, higher education, housing are things the Presiding Officer and I  have worked on in the Banking and Housing Committee.   Costs have doubled, tripled, quadrupled since people my age were  trying to go to school and start a family. Meanwhile, people's hard  work isn't paying off.   I remember in our Banking Committee, we did a hearing. It was more of  a listening session. It was one where Senators were not asking  questions. It was listening to people, which we should probably do more  often. It was called the ``Dignity of Work'' session.   One woman was from southern West Virginia, who struggled her whole  life and, clearly, was working hard. She said the words ``working'' and  ``poor'' should not be in the same sentence. Think about that. She has  worked all her life. She is making $13--she didn't go to Harvard. She  didn't go to Ohio State. She worked all her life. She worked to raise  kids. She is still making $12, $13, $14 an hour--and that, Madam  President, as costs only ever seem to go up. Even middle-class families  don't feel stable. That was before the pandemic.   We know that in this country, before the pandemic, a quarter of  people paid more than half their income--more than half their income-- in housing, in rent. That means if one thing happens in their lives-- their car breaks down; their child gets sick, has to stay home from  school; they maybe have a minor workplace injury and miss a week of  work--everything can go wrong. Their lives can turn upside down because  they can be evicted.   Then what happens?   We know this pandemic has upended the global economy. Supply chains  are struggling. People feel their budget squeezed. They are anxious  about whether prices that have gone up will ever go back down.   We heard a lot of politicians, particularly in this body, try to  stoke families' anxiety for their own political gain, but they don't  offer solutions. Their only answer is: Let's take power away from  workers.   They think the only way to keep prices low is to keep wages even  lower. That is a false choice.   We work on real solutions to bring down the biggest cost Americans  face for the long term and to help families keep up with the cost of  living.   Housing, childcare, healthcare--those are three of the biggest items  in any family's budget. Build Back Better tackles all of them.   On the Banking and Housing Committee, everything we are doing is  about making housing more affordable, whether you pay a mortgage or  whether you pay rent. Housing is just way too expensive and not  available to enough people, plain and simple. We need to build more  homes people can afford. We need to make the houses and the townhouses  and the apartments we already have more affordable, and we need to make  it affordable to buy a home.    I visit communities in Ohio all the time with houses that look  affordable. They are listed, maybe, at even $50,000 or $75,000, but  families can't come up with a down payment or sometimes they can't find  lenders to make the loans. Sometimes we see these lower cost properties  snapped up by private equity--by investors paying cash. We are working  to fix that with plans like targeted down payment assistance, expanding  access to lower cost mortgages.   Look at healthcare for a moment. Monthly premiums, deductibles, and  [[Page S7781]]  prescription drug prices still eat away at people's budgets. In the  American Rescue Plan, we strengthen the Affordable Care Act to make ACA  insurance plans more affordable. Customers are saving an average of 40  percent on their monthly premiums on ACA plans because of the American  Rescue Plan we passed in March. We will make sure those cost savings  continue so Americans can save on their coverage.   We will make it more affordable for seniors and Americans with  disabilities to get the care they need at home from a workforce that  actually makes a living wage.   I was with a number of home care workers in Cleveland the other day.  These are people who take care of people we love. They take care of  aging parents; they take care of workers injured on the job; they take  care of families. They make $11, $12, $13 an hour. Some of them have  been doing this for 20 years, and they still don't make a living wage.   As I said earlier, as the lady from West Virginia said, the words  ``working'' and ``poor'' should not be in the same sentence.   We know how powerful the Big Pharma lobbyists are. For years-- decades--many of us have fought to allow Medicare to negotiate prices  with drug companies, just like private insurance companies and the  Veterans Health Administration do.   I used to, as a Member of Congress, take busloads to Canada--about 3  hours away--so that seniors could buy prescription drugs in Windsor,  Ontario, because it cost half as much. It was the same brand name, same  dosage, same packaging, but the Canadian Government negotiates prices  directly with the drug companies. The American Government doesn't.   Why?   Well, you know why. Look down the hall at Mitch McConnell's office,  who has been the Republican leader of the Senate for many years. Look  at the lobbyists from the drug companies who line up outside his  office. He is always telling people: No, we are going to do whatever  the drug companies want. We know that the entire minority, the entire  Republican Party here, is in the pockets of the drug companies. We know  that.   The problem is we have got to get all 50 Democrats to stand up and  say: No. We are going to negotiate. We are going to stand with Medicare  beneficiaries. We are going to stand with people who need prescription  drugs--of all ages--and we are going to negotiate on their behalf  directly with the drug companies, cutting the price.   We do that with the VA. Whether it is in Reno or in Cleveland,  whether it is in Las Vegas or in Columbus, the VA pays significantly  less for prescription drugs than do the rest of us.   In this bill, we are finally standing up to the drug companies. We  are going to start bringing down seniors' prescription costs. For the  first time ever, we are empowering Medicaid to negotiate directly. It  is going to make a difference for seniors--a huge difference for  seniors--who are living on fixed incomes.   Of course, we know, for young families, they face, generally,  different costs. The children of working parents often get their health  insurance through Medicaid or through CHIP. Right now, if a mom takes  on an extra shift, or if a dad takes a bonus for a job well done, that  tiny change--that small change in their monthly income--could cause  their kids to lose their insurance for the month.   What kind of policy is that?   So Dad works really hard and is really good at his job, so he gets a  raise; and Mom wants to work an extra shift, so she brings a little  more money home.   And then we take the benefit away?   So we are saying to them: Yes, we believe in working hard, and we  believe in family values, but if you work too hard and you make too  much money, we are going to take away the benefit.   That kind of policy is just stupid. That is why we are including my  legislation that will keep kids insured all year. It means parents  won't have to worry they will get hit with a huge medical bill if their  child gets sick in the same month they work some extra hours.   Of course, the biggest cost for so many families is childcare. The  Build Back Better plan will ensure that middle-class families pay no  more than 7 percent of their income on childcare. What a relief that is  going to be.    Again, the point of this bill is job creation. Build Back Better is  job creation; it is the biggest tax cut in American history for  families with children; and it is to bring costs down.   One of the most oppressive, most burdensome, most difficult costs for  families is childcare. For a family with one toddler and two parents  who earn $50,000 a year, our plan will save them $5,000--$5,000--in  childcare costs. Some families will save up to $6,500.   Think of what that means. On top of this, as I said, is the biggest  tax cut for working families in American history.   In my State and in Nevada--the Presiding Officer's State that Senator  Cortez Masto represents--it is not much different from the rest of the  country.   More than 90 percent of the families in Ohio who have children under  18 will, at a minimum, get a $3,000 tax cut--at a minimum, $3,000 a  year. That is a real tax cut. That is not like a deduction. Those are  real dollars in their pockets. Think about that: more than 90 percent  of families in this country.   In my State, it is families with 2.2 million children. That many  kids, that many families, will get at least a $3,000 tax cut. If they  have three children, they will get an $8,000 or a $9,000 tax cut in the  course of a year, and that is one of the most important parts of this  bill. It will help them keep up with the costs of diapers and childcare  and clothes and all of the other expenses.   One of the joys of this job is going online where we have a website.  We have a ``tell your story'' about the biggest tax cut in American  history for working families and what that means to you.   One woman wrote in and said: For the first time in my life, I can  send my son to summer camp for a week.   A man wrote in from Cincinnati and said: For the first time ever, I  can, finally, now afford fast-pitch softball equipment for my daughter.   Others have said: You know, now I can put aside $100 a month for my  child to go to Eastern Gateway or to Stark State or to North Central  Ohio's technical or community college.   Others have said--and this is the one we hear the most. You have  heard so many families talk about the last week of the month. For the  people around here who make more money than this, you don't think of it  much; but in the last week of the month, so many families face the  anxiety of: How do I put together enough money to pay my rent this  month?   Well, the child tax credit has relieved that anxiety for millions of  families because they get that $300 or that $250 or, maybe, with two  children, they get $600 on the 15th of the month that can ease the  making of their rent that time.   But it comes down to: Whose side are you on?   It comes down to Mitch McConnell and the lobbyists in his office and  the politicians who always do his bidding and pass their tax cuts for  the wealthy and the corporations that outsource jobs, and you know  that. It was 4 years ago that there was the biggest tax cut, and 70  percent of that tax cut went to the wealthiest 1 percent of people.  Contrast that with our tax cut whereby 90 percent of Ohio families will  get at least a $3,000-a-year tax cut.   It is pretty simple. If you want tax cuts for billionaires, then vote  against this bill. If you want tax cuts for working families, that is  why you will support Build Back Better.   Do you want tax cuts for drug companies, or do you want to bring down  prescription drug prices? Do you want tax cuts for big banks that won't  give your family a mortgage, or do you want to bring down the cost of  housing?   When you love this country, you fight for the people who make it  work. You fight for their jobs. You fight for their higher wages. You  fight to bring down their cost of living. That is what we are doing.   I yield the floor to my colleague from Ohio.    Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring an Ohio trailblazer who we lost last month, the first woman to  serve as deputy mayor for the city of Akron, Dorothy Ola Jackson.   Former Akron mayor Tom Sayer, who nominated her to become deputy  mayor, called her an ``urbanist saint.'' And she was. Born in Akron,  OH, in 1933, Dorothy Ola Jackson's life of service was molded by the  loss of her brother and parents before the age of 24. She became a  fierce advocate for families and for her community.   For 12 years, she worked at Goodwill, starting as a secretary and  rising to serve as assistant public relations director. She helped  organize special projects and volunteer efforts. Knowing American Sign  Language and as a person of deep faith, she would sign a Bible reading  to the company's 30 deaf employees every morning.   She went on to work as a human services administrator for Akron  Metropolitan Housing Authority for 16 years, where she helped transform  the agency.   In 1984, Dorothy Ola Jackson became deputy mayor of intergovernmental  relations, where she continued advocating for those who often had no  other voice in the city. During her first year in office, she helped  organize the city's first day camp for disabled children.   She said, ``People who have never had a voice in government can now  get a little closer.''   Deputy Mayor Jackson has received many awards and accolades  throughout her life, including the United Way Distinguished Service  Award, the Bert A. Polsky Humanitarian Award, the Akron Urban League's  Community Service Award, and in 1984, she was named Woman of the Year  by Akron Business and Professional Women-USA.   But she often said the most meaningful honor came when the Akron  Metropolitan Housing Authority named a property that houses disabled  residents, the Dorothy O. Jackson Terrace Apartments in downtown Akron.   Dorothy dedicated her life to serving and helping others and to  making Akron a better place for all its residents. The legacy of Deputy  Mayor Jackson will live on through her far-reaching work and through  the many lives she touched.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask my Senate colleagues to join  me in honoring Dr. Kristina M. Johnson and celebrating her investiture  as the 16th president of The Ohio State University. As an alum of the  university and longtime friend of the Ohio State community, I know the  investiture of a president is a significant milestone in the life of  this land-grant university.   Since The Ohio State University was founded in 1870, the institution  has been guided by 16 presidents, each of whom has left a lasting mark  on the history of the university. Since taking office as president on  August 24, 2020, Dr. Johnson has already begun to make an impact at  Ohio State. She has worked to be an inclusive leader and advance the  university's mission to uplift lives through academic and research  excellence.   Dr. Johnson has close family ties to Ohio State and Ohio. Her  grandfather graduated from Ohio State in 1896, played right guard on  one of the early football teams, and was a member of the Tesla Club.  Dr. Johnson brings a wealth of experience to this role, having served  in numerous leadership roles at prestigious institutions for higher  education, most recently as chancellor of the State University of New  York. And she has been a public servant, serving as Under Secretary of  Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy. Dr. Johnson is married to  Veronica Meinhard, and it has been a pleasure to get to know them and  discuss the work we can do together to support Ohio students.   With Dr. Johnson's more than 30 years of experience and leadership,  the future of Ohio State is indeed bright. I ask my colleagues to join  me in recognizing and celebrating this momentous occasion for this  university, which is so important to the central Ohio community and to  our State. Connie and I wish Dr. Johnson, Veronica, and the entire  Buckeye Community well as they embark on this journey together.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Aarti Iyer, a  legislative fellow in my office; Ben Ashman, another legislative fellow  in my office; and Danny Carlson, who is joining us today on the floor  from my office, all be granted floor privileges for the remainder of  the 117th Congress.
