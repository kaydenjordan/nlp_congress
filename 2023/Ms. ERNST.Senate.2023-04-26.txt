 Madam President, I would like to thank the Senator from  Alabama for leading this effort.   Iowa has a celebrated history of exceptional girls' sports programs.  We recently saw the Iowa Hawkeyes women's basketball team make it to  the national championship after taking home their fifth Big Ten  Tournament title just days after cheering on the high school girls  competing in the State tournament. Last year, the Iowa High School  Girls Athletic Union proudly sanctioned girls wrestling, opening up new  opportunities for girls to be part of a team and recognized for their  achievements.   Title IX not only makes these events possible; it guarantees an  opportunity for our female athletes. Whether it is growing as a leader,  winning a championship, or securing a scholarship to college, sports  opens doors for young women. But right now, President Biden is working  overtime to force institutions to allow biological males to share  spaces with females and compete in women's sports. Doors that were  opened over 50 years ago are being slammed in the faces of girls across  the country because of the progressive left's gender ideology. Girls'  locker rooms have now become a battleground for the Democratic Party,  and parents continue to be iced out of the issue.   Thankfully, last year, Governor Reynolds protected girls' sports  across Iowa, from elementary school all the way up to the collegiate  level.   Here in the Senate, I am proud to join my friend from Alabama and our  colleagues in supporting the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports  Act. Under this legislation, any athletic program that receives Federal  funds and permits a biological male to participate in competitions  designated for women or girls would be in violation of Federal law. The  House just passed this commonsense bill last week, and we should not  waste any more time in passing it here in the Senate.   Payton McNabb is a senior in high school. She loves volleyball but  was severely injured last fall because a biological male spiked the  ball into her face.   Riley Gaines Barker, a 12-time NCAA All-American athlete, was forced  to compete against a biological male, Lia Thomas, in the 200 freestyle.  The two tied--they tied--for fifth place, with Thomas taking home the  trophy. No kidding. Thomas took home the trophy. The NCAA told Riley it  was necessary for photo purposes.  [[Page S1367]]    Lia Thomas is a 6-foot-4-inch biological male who swam on the men's  team at the University of Pennsylvania for 3 years before switching to  the women's team for his final year. Thomas beat female 2020 Olympic  silver medalists and American record holders to win an NCAA Division I  title.   Man, you might feel like a woman, but you aren't one.   We must protect our young girls and make sure they aren't pushed off  the podium. Title IX is the law of the land whether the far left likes  it or not. The law was created to offer the same playing field to  female athletes as their male counterparts, not to subject women to  second place and the sidelines.   In defense of our Iowa daughters and female athletes across the  Nation, I am standing with Riley Gaines--who was recently attacked by  radical activists on a college campus--and her message: Biological men  should not be allowed to compete in women's sports.   Our female athletes deserve fairness, safety, and the ability to win  those top scholarships and titles, as title IX intended. No amount of  harassment from the radical left will stop strong women from standing  up for the truth and for what is right.   If Senate Democrats pushing the so-called Equal Rights Amendment were  really interested in equal rights for women, they would protect women's  sports and spaces from biological men.   Madam President, every time a girl steps onto the mat, onto the  court, the field, or the track, she should know that she has every  opportunity to compete and win.   I am proud to work with my friend Senator Tuberville and my  colleagues in fighting to pass the Protection of Women and Girls in  Sports Act.   With that, I will yield the floor to Senator Tuberville.    Madam President, today I honor an exemplary leader,  liaison, and soldier. After a year of service in the U.S. Senate, MAJ  Brian Focareto will continue his service to the Nation in the 101st  Airborne Division at Fort Campbell.   On this occasion, I believe it fitting to recognize Major Focareto's  distinguished service, leadership, and dedication to fostering the  relationship between the U.S. Army and this Chamber. Over the past  year, Major Focareto served in the Army Senate Liaison Division. He was  invaluable in educating Senators and staff on Army priorities and  policy initiatives. He also supported multiple congressional  delegations within the United States and to many countries abroad. He  became a trusted adviser and friend to many of us.   Prior to his time on the Hill, Major Focareto served our Army in  multiple operational assignments over the last 10 years. He  commissioned out of the University of Dayton as an armor officer and  began his career as a platoon leader, executive officer, and operations  officer in the 101st Airborne Division. He deployed to Afghanistan in  support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Following Maneuver Captains  Career Course, Major Focareto served as a staff officer in the 2d  Cavalry Regiment in Vilseck, Germany, where he planned and executed  numerous multinational training exercises with NATO and partner nations  across Europe. Major Focareto then commanded a reconnaissance troop and  the regimental weapons troop in 2CR. Following troop command, Major  Focareto completed a master of policy management from Georgetown  University and served as a deputy legislative assistant for the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, we thank  Major Brian Focareto, his wife, and their children for their continued  commitment, sacrifice, and contributions to this great Nation. We join  our colleagues in wishing him future successes as he continues to serve  our great Army and Nation.                            ____________________
