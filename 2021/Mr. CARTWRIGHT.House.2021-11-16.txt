 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special  Order.    Madam Speaker, to honor the memory of a 104-year-old  hero of World War II and a survivor of the infamous Bataan Death March,  I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).           Moment of Silence Honoring Brigadier General Ben Skardon     Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Duncan for that  fine tribute, and I ask, in harmony with Congressman Duncan, that this  House observe a moment of silence in honor of the memory of this World  War II hero, Colonel Ben Skardon.   Madam Speaker, this week, Democrats delivered on infrastructure.   Over the past number of years, we have had infrastructure week after  infrastructure week. Eventually, infrastructure week became a joke.    Now, under the current administration, we have made good on our  promise to rebuild the arteries of America. We have delivered a once- in-a-century investment in all the infrastructure that makes our Nation  run.  [[Page H6302]]    It is the kind of investment that will create millions of good-paying  jobs and make our Nation more competitive with every other country in  the world.   When President Biden signed into law this bill, this act, yesterday,  it was the largest investment in rebuilding bridges since the  construction of the Interstate Highway System, the largest Federal  investment in passenger rail since the original establishment of  Amtrak, and the largest investment in clean drinking water in American  history.   So important for my district in northeastern Pennsylvania, this will  put northeastern Pennsylvania back on the passenger rail map, bring  broadband internet to every rural area in my district, and support our  efforts to reclaim all the abandoned mine land sites that have scarred  our landscape for decades and fouled our watercourses for that length  of time as well.   It will create millions of jobs, good-paying jobs, American jobs,  union jobs, jobs that cannot be outsourced across the ocean.   This is truly a transformative law that will help us build a stronger  middle class and a brighter future for our entire Nation.   What we are here to talk about this evening is what it means to us,  this kind of investment, this kind of belief in our future here in  America, what it means to us individually, in our particular districts.   I have here this evening my fellow Pennsylvanian from the Second  Congressional District of Pennsylvania, Representative Brendan Boyle.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Brendan F. Boyle) so he can tell us what it means to him that we have  made this historic investment in America.    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    You mentioned being number one and competing. What  are you talking about, being number one, on what list? And who do we  have to compete with?    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Boyle for his  insights about the competition aspect.   By delivering this infrastructure bill yesterday afternoon, as we  did, Democrats are delivering millions of good-paying union jobs, jobs  that will put pipefitters and plumbers to work replacing lead water  pipes so every child in America can drink clean water. No more will we  have the Flint, Michigans where little kids get poisoned by lead in  their drinking water, because we are going to rip out all that 100- year-old piping with the lead in it so that won't happen again.   We will transform roads, rail, bridges, public transit, modernize our  ports and airports and freight rail, manufacture solar panels, wind  farms, batteries, electric vehicles to grow clean energy supply chains  that we can export to the rest of the world.   This is a transformational moment not only for the American economy  but for the American future and the American people.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the 4th Congressional  District of Pennsylvania, Congresswoman Madeleine Dean, to elucidate  further on what it means that we enacted this law yesterday afternoon.  So far it is all Pennsylvanians.    Will the gentlewoman yield for a question?    It is a sad question, I have to say, because we call  it the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, but the truth  is, despite their best efforts to claim credit in local news across the  country, 206 House Republicans voted against this bill. They voted  against good-paying American jobs, they voted against roads, bridges,  and rail systems, water systems and sewer systems, against broadband,  and clean drinking water. They voted against the tools that we need to  compete and win in the global economy as Representative Boyle pointed  out.   My question is why? Why would they vote against this belief in our  country, this investment in our future? Why would they vote against it?    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Madeleine Dean  of the 4th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.   This bill does so much, and we are so proud here tonight to talk  about it. It is a win for the American people no matter which way you  slice it.   Building out our first ever national network of charging stations so  families can travel coast to coast in electric vehicles, making high- speed internet available and affordable for every household in America,  especially those rural, hard-to-get-to places, cleaning up brownfields  and Superfund sites, as well as plugging, as I said before, abandoned  mine lands and orphan wells to stop pollution and protect public health  and to build up our resistance to superstorms, droughts, wildfires, and  hurricanes that cost us billions of dollars in damage, $99 billion last  year alone.   This bipartisan infrastructure deal is a blue-collar blueprint to  rebuild America, and a majority of these jobs, as Representative Boyle  pointed out, do not require a college degree.   So the question is, what does it mean to us? What does it mean to us  that we have passed this magnificent, enormous investment in American  infrastructure, this belief in our Nation's future?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline) to describe what it means to him and his 1st District  constituents.    You also mentioned competition, and Congressman Boyle  brought that up. And you also mentioned how much is going into  broadband internet availability in Rhode Island.   How does that affect competition and the ability of Rhode Islanders  to compete?    I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Madam Speaker, I think Mr. Cicilline is right. I  think competition is maybe the biggest point of the bipartisan  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Competition that will not only  grease the skids for our companies to bring their products to market  and to innovate and to compete with companies all over the world, but  maybe more importantly, to allow our individuals--as Mr. Cicilline just  pointed out--to make the most of themselves.   It was about 80 years ago that we had the Rural Electrification Act  in the United States, and it did pretty much the same thing with  electricity because you had pockets, little corners of America, rural  places mostly, that didn't have electric power. And to think how far  they would have been left behind if 80 years ago the government didn't  make the effort to include all of America as we moved forward into the  modern age of electricity; it is the same thing with internet  connectivity, isn't it?    Madam Speaker, another thing we did in the past to  invest in ourselves was the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System. This  was something that the greatest generation did, Madam Speaker. They  came back from World War II--we just honored a World War II hero of the  Bataan Death March--but these folks came home from all of the  privations and sacrifices and suffering that they went through in the  war, and what did they do? They sacrificed more for us for the future,  what was then the future, what is now us. They sacrificed for us. They  built the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System.    What did it do? It greased the skids for American companies, enabled  companies to bring their products to market faster and more cheaply and  in a way that enabled them to compete with every other country in the  world.   This is the kind of investment that makes America win in competitions  all over the world.   You don't have to be an engineer to understand these things. You  don't have to be a mechanical engineer to know that this is exactly  what we need to be doing in the United States of America these days. It  was a wonder that it took until now.   Certainly, my entire time in Congress I have been waiting for a major  infrastructure bill to come through to beef up our roads and our  bridges; our water systems and our sewer systems; our broadband  internet; and move us into the next century to compete with China,  Europe, Russia, and all of the places that would do away with us if  they could beat us.   It was just yesterday afternoon that this bill, the bipartisan  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, was signed into law on the  south lawn of the White House. And who was sitting next to me in the  chair to my left, but Representative Paul Tonko of the 20th District of  New York, who happens to be a mechanical engineer, and he knows one or  two things about making things work; making them work better, more  efficiently, faster, and cheaper.   What does it mean to you, Representative Tonko, that we pass this  bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).    It was chilly.    It is an afternoon we won't soon forget.    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Well now, of course, the press has noted with  interest that it took us weeks and months to sort out all the details  and finally get it to the White House for signature.   Here is my question: Contrast those weeks and months with how long  will this country benefit from the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment  and Jobs Act? How long?    Will the gentleman yield for another question?    So we have all been seeing these images of 75, 80  cargo ships off the coast of California, Long Beach, Los Angeles,  waiting to get in because we are starting up our economy after the  pandemic was shut down. Obviously, it is not something we went to  school for--shutting down an American economy and starting it back up-- but that is what we are doing, and we are muddling through it. And  there are some painful price hikes here and there because of it--hard  to say how long they will go on.   But the one thing that struck me was all of those containerships  full, they told me that it takes 7,000 tractor-trailers to unload a  containership. That is 7,000 containers on a ship, and over 70 or 80  ships out there in the harbor. All of these manufactured goods coming  from China.    And it said to me, we read about the trade imbalance, we learn about  the trade imbalance, we learn that China is out-manufacturing us and we  are buying their goods. But, man, until you see those ships out in the  harbor offshore, it doesn't really hit home how much they are beating  us at manufacturing. What does this bill do to address that?    And I like the point about how shutting down for the  pandemic, it kind of taught us a lot of things about our own economy,  about the pockets of, for example, the gig workers nobody was thinking  about at the outset; we had to include them in the relief money. But,  man, when we saw these ships piling up offshore, it really brought home  to me really how we are being out-manufactured and we have to pick up  our game.   Investing in our infrastructure, what do you think? Is it going to  help?    It is a victory for America that we will treasure and  favor for many years to come.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Paul Tonko from  the 20th District of New York for his insights and also for helping me  introduce our next speaker, the dynamic Representative Ross from the  Second District of North Carolina, where innovation is second nature.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Ross).    Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
