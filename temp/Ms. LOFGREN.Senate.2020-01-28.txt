 This is unfair to the American people. By       these actions you would undo the free election that expressed       the will of the American people in 1996. In so doing, you       will damage the faith the American people have in this       institution and in the American democracy. You will set the       dangerous precedent that the certainty of Presidential terms,       which has so benefited our wonderful America, will be       replaced by the partisan use of impeachment. Future       Presidents will face election, then litigation, then       impeachment. The power of the President will diminish in the       face of the Congress, a phenomena much feared by the Founding       Fathers.
