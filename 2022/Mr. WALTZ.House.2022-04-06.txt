 Madam Speaker, on December 25, Volusia County, Florida,  lost a great businessman and valued community leader, Mike Jiloty.  Through Mike's hard work and personal approach to business, he received  hundreds of industry awards. Serving as the president of United Way of  Volusia and Flagler Counties, Mike fought for the health, education,  and stability of every person in his community. He dedicated his time  to the FUTURES Foundation for Volusia County Schools to better prepare  students for their careers.   As a graduate of the Leadership Florida Class XIV, Mike used his  skills as a leader to serve his community and was honored by several  organizations, including the Volusia Association of School  Administrators, the Daytona Beach Community College Foundation, the  Conklin Center for the Blind, and the Lodging and Hospitality  Association of Volusia County.   Madam Speaker, Mike Jiloty is a true example of a servant leader. He  sought to inspire others, to make his community a better place, and he  is missed dearly. It is my honor to recognize him on the floor of the  House of Representatives today.    Honoring the 75th Anniversary of Jackie Robinson Integrating Baseball     Madam Speaker, Jackie Robinson once said, ``A life is not  important except in the impact it has on other lives.'' On April 15,  1947, Jackie Robinson created a lasting impact on the lives of  generations of Americans when he stepped out of the dugout at Ebbets  Field before a crowd of more than 26,000 spectators. This moment would  change the course of history and have a lasting impact for generations  as he broke the color barrier as the first African-American player in  professional baseball history.   Jackie Robinson is a true servant leader, and his life and legacy has  had a major impact across the country, including in my own  congressional district, where I am honored to have a piece of his  legacy at the Daytona City Island Ballpark where, in 1946, Jackie  Robinson played in the very first integrated major league baseball  spring training game. In 1990, in honor of the life and legacy of  Jackie Robinson, the Daytona City Island Ballpark would be renamed the  Jackie Robinson Memorial Ballpark.   Jackie Robinson's impact was felt across the Nation. It was the first  time a Black player competed with a minor league team against a major  league team since the color line was implemented in baseball in the  1880s. As we observe the 75th anniversary of his courageous act, it is  clear the impact and legacy of Jackie Robinson on the advancement of  human rights will be everlasting.                     A1A Designated an All-American Road     Madam Speaker, of the approximately 4 million miles of  byways and highways that stretch in all directions across the United  States, there are very few that come close to the beauty, history, and  serenity that encompasses the 72-mile stretch of A1A that runs from St.  Johns County, Florida, to Flagler County. Flanked by the Atlantic Ocean  and crisscrossing the St. Johns River and Intracoastal Waterway, for  more than 75 years the A1A  [[Page H4195]]  has provided motorists with breathtaking views as it seamlessly  intertwines Florida's most remarkable coastal landscapes and deep- rooted history.   As a kid growing up in northeast Florida, any drive along the A1A  scenic and historic coastal byway was a reminder of how lucky we were  to live in such a beautiful place.   Now, as the Representative of Florida's north central region, home to  beautiful segments of A1A, I was proud to cast one of my very first  votes in support of the Reviving America's Scenic Byways Act in  February of 2019. This act requires the Department of Transportation to  issue a request for nominations to be designated under the National  Scenic Byways Program and make publicly available a list specifying the  roads designated. President Trump signed the bill into law in September  of 2019.   I am pleased to announce in the Congressional Record that on March 29  of 2022, the ribbon-cutting ceremony occurred for the Federal Highway  Administration's designation of this beautiful stretch of A1A as an  All-American Road.                            ____________________
