 Mr. Speaker, America's small business community is near  and dear to my heart, and one of the closest partners that I have had  in our congressional district has been the Warren County Small Business  Development Center.   Having served on the House Committee on Small Business as both the  chairman and ranking member, I am very familiar with their work and the  local impact that they have had on so many small businesses throughout  the greater Cincinnati area, particularly, obviously, in Warren County.   And since 2018, the Warren County SBDC has been recognized twice as  the best performing SBDC in southwest Ohio. They were also selected as  the SBA Columbus District winner of the Excellence and Innovation  Award, and their executive director, Mike Stater, was chosen by 70 of  his peers as the Ohio SBDC State Star.   I have relied on and enjoyed working with the Warren County SBDC for  the last decade, for 10 years now, and I thank them for their terrific  work on behalf of the many small businesses throughout our community.                            ____________________
