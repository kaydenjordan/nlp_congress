 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the  gentlewoman allowing me to talk about my friend, Alcee Hastings.   Madam Speaker, Alcee Hastings to a lot of us, is what we call a  Renaissance man. When you knew Alcee, you knew somebody who knew  exactly what he was talking about at all times. I carried Alcee  Hastings to the Second District of Mississippi a number of times. You  know, for a Florida boy, he could have been a Mississippi boy. He knew  Bobby Rush, the blues singer. He knew how to go to catfish fries. He  could just about adapt to any situation. But Alcee Hastings, more  importantly, provided significant direction and guidance to a number of  us who came to this body.   Madam Speaker, so today I rise to pay a special tribute to a close  and dear friend that I shared many memories with: The Honorable  Congressman Alcee Hastings.   Alcee was a champion civil rights legend, who served the people of  Florida and this country for over 28 years as a Member of Congress. He  dedicated his life to uplifting and empowering his constituents,  colleagues, and our Nation. All of us have at least one Alcee Hastings  story. Some of us have two or three or more Alcee Hastings stories, and  they all are memorable.   All through my district, he was one of those individuals who people  wanted to know what was Alcee Hastings like. And the only thing I can  tell you is you have to meet him because you really can't describe him.  The dictionary doesn't provide enough adjectives to give you who he is,  but that is the kind of person Alcee Hastings was.   To Patricia and the kids: We all miss him. Absolutely, I know that  all of you will miss him, too.   You know, I wonder what Alcee would be saying to us right now. I have  a good idea. And he probably would say: ``Look, I don't have time for  all that noise. Get on with the business of helping our people.''
