 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the full  committee for yielding time.   Today, the House is going to vote on my legislation, H.R. 3226, the  PREEMIE Reauthorization Act. I thank the co-leads of this legislation:  Representatives Miller-Meeks, Kelly of Illinois, Burgess, Blunt  Rochester, and Kiggans for their work on this important effort.   I first introduced the PREEMIE Act in 2005. It is the first and  remains the only law to focus solely on the prevention of preterm  births.   H.R. 3226 will improve future policy by studying the current gaps in  our healthcare system that have kept rates of preterm births high and  by crafting recommendations for how to address them.   Every day in the United States, 1 in 10 infants are born prematurely,  placing them and their mothers at an increased risk of complicated  health problems.   America's prematurity rate is one of the highest in the developed  world, and it is the leading cause of newborn death.   Even babies born just a few weeks prematurely can face serious health  challenges. We saw a significant 4 percent increase in preterm births  in 2021, the highest recorded rate since 2007.   This bill was advanced by the Subcommittee on Health and the full  Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously and enjoys bipartisan  cosponsorship.   The PREEMIE Act will help prevent newborn death and disability,  expand research into the causes of preterm birth, and promote the  development, availability, and uses of evidence-based standards of care  for pregnant women. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support  it.
