 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8, the  Bipartisan Background Checks Act. This bill is among the most  commonsense gun violence prevention reforms, requiring background  checks for unlicensed sellers.   Mr. Speaker, this is not complicated. This is simple. Under H.R. 8,  people who wish to transfer a firearm would have to visit a licensed  firearm dealer to run a background check before the transfer could be  finalized.   Most of these checks take 90 seconds, 90 seconds to prevent firearms  from ending up in the wrong hands, 90 seconds to prevent more of our  loved ones from being killed by gun violence.   I am proud to be from Washington State, where voters have  consistently tackled gun violence with commonsense reforms, passing one  of the first, most comprehensive background check laws in 2014 and  raising the legal age to purchase a semiautomatic rifle to 21 in 2018.   Mr. Speaker, let's do this. To save lives, vote ``aye.''
