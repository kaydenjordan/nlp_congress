 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the HEROES Act because it  recognizes the human sacrifice of our families, our teachers, our  postal workers, our police. It recognizes the human suffering.   In my own counties of Berks County, 207 are dead, and in Montgomery  Country, 608 are dead. Included in that number is my own mother-in-law,  dead of COVID earlier this month in a local nursing home without the  ability of her family to be at her side.   And it recognizes the heroes all around us, like the staff at that  nursing home who stood by and took care of Joan in a loving way.    I will be voting ``yes'' on this bill to send nearly $40  billion to my hard-hit State of Pennsylvania. I urge all of our  colleagues to do the same.
