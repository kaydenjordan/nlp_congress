 I thank Chairman Grassley for that question and the  invitation to join him in the colloquy. As two of the only non- attorneys on the Judiciary Committee, it is important that we, on  behalf of the majority of Americans, who are non-lawyers, do reclaim  the separation of powers as a basic American inheritance. So I thank  the Senator for the chance to discuss it here today.   Starting the morning after President Trump's victory last November,  there has actually been something of a renaissance of separation of  powers talk among many folks around this body, and that is a good  thing. After 8 years of legislative atrophy, many on the other side of  the aisle are now remembering the old ``Schoolhouse Rock'' distinction  among the three separate and coequal branches, and this is good news  for Americans' civic health.   If Democrats are serious--frankly, if all of us are serious, for we  in this body have taken an oath not to a political party but to a  constitutional structure of limits where power is intentionally  separated and divided because our forefathers and foremothers were  skeptical of the consolidation of power--if we take this seriously and  we would like to reclaim some of the Congress's responsibility and  ability and authority to check and balance the other two branches, the  debate around Judge Gorsuch's nomination and the hearings we will have  beginning in the chairman's committee next month are a great place to  start. So I wish to offer a little bit of what I think is an important  historical backdrop for this debate.   Any discussion of the separation of powers must be rooted in a solid  understanding of what we mean and what the Founders meant by the phrase  ``the consent of the governed.'' Historically speaking, this is still a  bold idea which must be constantly defined, reclaimed, renewed, and  passed on to the next generation, for over the course of human history,  we can put every form of government into one of two categories: You are  ruled either by people you didn't choose or by people you did choose.   One of these groups has taken many forms through the centuries-- Kings, elites, political parties, and technocrats. Indeed, most  governments throughout human history fit this mold, where the people  were ruled by a form of government that they had no say in and that  they didn't choose. But there is another group, and these are people  who rule themselves through the leaders they have chosen and  continually get to choose. When the leaders fail to serve the will of  the people, those leaders can be removed. This describes our form of  government and its historical anomaly. We should recognize that, and  our kids should understand what a special blessing it is to live under  this form of government.   The point is elegantly simple: Either people are ruled, or the people  are ultimately and fundamentally the rulers. Why does this matter? This  isn't a question to take flippantly but, rather, each generation of  Americans should reexamine and reclaim and reteach it. So why is it so  important that ``the people'' are actually the rulers in their  government? It comes down to a profound truth about human dignity.  Human beings cannot thrive when they are stripped of basic liberties.  Human flourishing requires the freedom to make basic choices about how  you will live your life in community: Who are your friends? Whom will  you marry? Where will you work? What do you believe? Whom do you  worship? How do you worship? These are the things the Founders meant  when they said that we are all born with the right to life, to liberty,  and to the pursuit of happiness.   Notice that the Founders were not referring to life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness as a bunch of vague platitudes or as aspirational  pleasantries for a bumper sticker; they were talking about rights.  These are not given to us by any other man or woman. They are rights we  have from God via nature, and so they can't be taken away from us by  some other mere man or woman.   Here is what is great about this idea: We are all born equals in the  eyes of God and history, and we have certain rights. As a group of  equals, it requires people to get permission to serve for a time--for a  limited time--as our rulers. This equality is what the Founders called  the self-evident truth--something so obvious that it didn't need to be  proven; a truth so true that denying it would be denying something  essential and true about human nature itself. Once we understand this,  our expectations of our government begin to change. We expect  responsiveness and transparency. We expect equality before the law.   Government's primary purpose is not to solve every human problem,  like a King or some all-powerful technocrat; rather, the government's  job is to provide a framework for ordered liberty so that we can live  our lives in our communities, in our families, in our businesses, and  in our places of worship. Government's job is to secure the rights of a  free and sovereign people.   But what does this have to do with Judge Gorsuch? What does this have  to do with the confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court next week?  What does this have to do with separation of powers?    As Americans, we secure our rights by separating the functions of  government into what our Founders called the three different  departments: There is a Congress to write the laws, and this is article  I of the Constitution; there is a President--or Presiding Officer, as  he was first called--to execute the laws; and there is a court to  decide the controversies under the law. This system of checks and  balances keeps too much power from falling into any one set of hands,  and it keeps the American people in charge.   We sometimes talk euphemistically about judicial activism, and that  is a big problem, but we don't attack it enough. A judge who takes it  as his or her job to do anything other than settle cases is not just  being an activist, they are becoming an untouchable, unfireable ruler.  They are becoming a lawmaker who is not accountable to the people  because our judges have lifetime tenure. A judge who uses his or her  position to write the law fundamentally undermines the foundation of  government, which is that the will of the people should rule.   That is why I am so strongly supporting Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the  next Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. He fully understands the place  in the government and his place in the government as a servant of the  people, not as some unchosen ruler with lifetime tenure.   When you listen to Judge Gorsuch, when you read his speeches, when  you read his opinions, it is clear that he is not interested in making  laws. He knows that is not his calling. He is interested in  interpreting law. He is interested in upholding and defending the  Constitution. He is not interested, when he has his robe on, in  specific policy outcomes; he is interested in justice. He is not  interested in the laws that he as a private citizen might want; he is  focused on the laws that are actually written in the books. He is a  judge's judge, and that is exactly what the Constitution calls for.   In closing, I wish to read three quotes from Judge Gorsuch into the  Record to demonstrate how he conceives of his job. Again, this is Judge  Gorsuch paying tribute to Justice Scalia:         Tonight I want to . . . suggest that perhaps the great       project of Justice Scalia's career was to remind us of the       differences between judges and legislators. To remind us that       legislators may appeal to their own moral convictions and to       claims about social utility to reshape the law as they think       it should be in the future. But that judges should do none of       these things in a democratic society. That judges should       strive (if humanly and so imperfectly) to apply the law as it       is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to the text,       structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at       the time of the events in question would have understood the       law to be--not to decide cases based on [a judge's] own moral       convictions or the policy consequences they believe might       serve society best.    Again, he is saying a judge is not a superlegislator. If a judge  wants to be a legislator, that is a completely fine thing to do. Take  off your robe, resign your position, and run for office so the  [[Page S1789]]  people can decide whether to hire you or fire you. But a judge who has  lifetime tenure doesn't get to make their policy preferences the will  of the people somehow.   The second quote:         When the political branches disagree with a judicial       interpretation of existing law, the Constitution prescribes       the appropriate remedial process. It's called legislation.       Admittedly, the legislative process can be an arduous one.       But that's no bug in the constitutional design: It is the       very point of the design.    Third and finally:         To the founders, the legislative and judicial powers were       distinct by nature and their separation was among the most       important liberty-protecting devices of the constitutional       design, an independent right of the people essential to the       preservation of all other rights later enumerated in the       Constitution and its amendments.    If my colleagues in this body are serious, if the hundred of us are  serious, if we want to defend our role as legislators, if we are  serious about doing our job as lawmakers, if we are concerned about  overreaching Executives, if we are concerned about the lack of  accountability in the administrative bureaucracies of the government,  if we honestly want to make Congress great again, we should start by  confirming Judge Neil Gorsuch.
