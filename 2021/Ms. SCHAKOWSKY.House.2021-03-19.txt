 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 1868 to  prevent arbitrary cuts to Medicare and to ensure that the American  Rescue Plan is treated in the same way as previous coronavirus bills  have been treated, including the CARES Act.   This legislation, as we all know, this fix is needed to avoid painful  cuts to our mandatory spending programs. And let's remember--the  hypocrisy is overwhelming here--that the Democrats voted with  Republicans in 2017 to avoid Medicare cuts as a result of the  Republican's tax scam, a $2 trillion tax cut, that went mostly to the  wealthy.   Our healthcare workers have been working nonstop for over a year  fighting this pandemic. They do not deserve a cut in Medicare payments  for taking care of seniors and people with disabilities.   By removing the sequester, we can ensure that providers keep their  doors open and they can continue to treat their patients.    Though Republicans voted against the American Rescue Plan, which they  shouldn't have, I sincerely hope that today they will join us and vote  to protect these programs that enjoy broad bipartisan public support  and ensure that our commitment to our Nation's seniors and people with  disabilities are met during this public health crisis.   Especially now, we need to be working together, as we did for the  Republicans. When the Republicans were giving tax cuts to the  wealthiest Americans, we were not going to let Medicare suffer.
