 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity.   Madam Speaker, it is time to put our kids first in education. Far- left Democrats who want the government and teachers unions in charge of  what children are taught have been working overtime to strip parents of  their rights. Within their boondoggle tax-and-spend agenda, Democrats  have slipped in a quiet government takeover of our schools. Ultimately,  this would ensure Washington bureaucrats and teachers unions have a  larger influence on shaping a child's upbringing than their parents.   Under the Democrats' monstrous multitrillion-dollar socialist  spending bill is a provision that creates universal daycare and  preschool and would allow the government to decide what children are  taught, where they will spend their time, and who can teach and care  for them.    This is simply wrong. It is not fair, and it violates the trust we  put in our schools.   When it comes to their children's education, parents and families  deserve more control, not less. We have already seen what government- controlled education looks like as government-run public schools fail  to teach children basic skills.   Worse, Democrats are using the public education system to push  leftwing ideologies and divisive curricula like critical race theory  and the historically inaccurate 1619 Project, which do  [[Page H6171]]  nothing but pollute the minds of our young children.   Parents and families deserve schools they can trust. As one of the  Representatives for Tennessee and as the father of two young children,  I am working to put power back into the hands of parents, families, and  local school leaders.   Let's make student welfare and traditional education the only special  interest we fund and promote when it comes to our children's schools,  not leftwing efforts to turn schools into far left, ideological  indoctrination centers.
