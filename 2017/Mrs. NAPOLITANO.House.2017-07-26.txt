 Mr. Speaker, I was absent during rollcall votes No.  414 and No. 415 due to my spouse's health situation in California. Had  I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on the Motion on Ordering  the Previous Question on the Rule providing for consideration of H.R.  3219. I would have also voted ``nay'' on H. Res. 473--Rule providing  for consideration of H.R. 3219--``Make America Secure Appropriations  Act, 2018.''                            ____________________
