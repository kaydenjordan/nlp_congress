 Mr. President, this month, I join the Nation in  celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month and the invaluable contributions of  the Latino community to our country. Hispanic Americans comprise an  integral part of the United States and form our Nation's largest ethnic  minority. An estimated 60 million Latinos and Latinas currently live in  the U.S., making our country home to the world's third largest Latino  population. More than half a million of my fellow Marylanders identify  as Hispanic or Latino.   Some of our Hispanic residents are recent arrivals to this country,  seeking safety and freedom unavailable in their countries of origin.  Others trace their roots to our country's founding. All play a role in  helping to shape our country for the better. Latino and Latinas form a  crucial part of our Nation's Armed Forces, dutifully serve at all  levels of government, play an active role in their local communities,  and Hispanic-owned businesses contribute an estimated $473 billion in  revenue to our economy and employ millions of people. Diversity is  America's strength, and our thriving Hispanic communities are evidence  of this.   In spite of these contributions, many in the Latina and Latino  community are suffering or being put at unnecessary risk due to the  administration's policies. Cruel immigration practices have led to  families being torn apart. Millions of Dreamers live in constant fear  that they will be removed from the only country they have ever known.  The decision to remove Temporary Protected Status, TPS, for El  Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti worsens our national security and injects  unnecessary fear and uncertainty into American families based on  politics, rather than policy. Maryland alone would lose well over $1  billion from our State's GDP without the workers who currently hold  TPS. In Puerto Rico, over 3,000 American citizens died from the effects  of Hurricane Maria, and the island still struggles to recover. Hispanic  Americans increasingly face risks from prejudice, racism, and bigotry.  Such policies and rhetoric directly undermine the values on which our  country was founded.   Hispanics and Latinos bear the disproportionate effects of these  policies, and the entire country suffers as a result. When some of our  best and brightest young students and our Nation's hardest workers fear  for their future or are forced into the shadows, it can have a lasting  and harmful effect on our communities, our economy, and our security.   Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time to address these issues with  [[Page S6809]]  meaningful action rather than empty proclamations. Congress must  finally pass a Dream Act to provide Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals, DACA, recipients with the protections they deserve, so they  can continue their contributions to this country. It is time for the  Senate to take up and pass S. 2144, legislation I introduced with  Senators Van Hollen and Feinstein, to provide a pathway to legal  permanent residency for TPS holders in the United States. We are long  overdue with respect to passing comprehensive immigration reform.   We must also address systemic issues in our healthcare, tax, and  education systems, many of which are particularly harmful to Hispanic  communities. Like all Americans, Hispanics deserve access to quality  public schools, affordable and widely available medical care, and tax  reform which reduces the burden for middle and low-income workers.   We must further provide Puerto Rico with the resources and support it  needs to recover. More than a year after Hurricane Maria, the situation  remains desperate. Our fellow American citizens on the island deserve  real support in their time of need.   Hispanic Americans are facing immense challenges, but seek the same  noble goals as all other Americans. Now is the time to stand with  Hispanic, Latina, and Latino Americans against prejudice, divisive  rhetoric, and harmful policies. In doing so, we will better uphold the  ideals of our Nation and create a better country for all Americans.
