 Mr. Speaker, what is happening at the National Labor  Relations Board, NLRB, is so rotten it stinks.   Under Democrat leadership, the NLRB has a history of bias and  overreach. President Biden fired the Senate-confirmed general counsel  on his first day in office, and now the Biden board is dodging ethics  rules.   NLRB Democrats are refusing to follow conflict of interest standards  that were weaponized by Democrats during the Trump administration. This  is blatant hypocrisy and threatens the integrity of the board.   How can NLRB members Gwynne Wilcox and David Prouty be conscientious  arbiters on the very policies they fought against as union employees?  And how can we expect board members with close ties to union activists  to be unbiased when it comes to big labor cases?   Is there anything NLRB Democrats won't do to advance the interests of  big labor at the expense of American workers? It is a shame what it is  doing.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
