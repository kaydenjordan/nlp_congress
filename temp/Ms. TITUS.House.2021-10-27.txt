 Madam Speaker, at the height of this pandemic,  unemployment in my home district of Las Vegas was over 33 percent--a  level not seen since the Great Depression. The fabulous Las Vegas Strip  shut down, and the airport was empty.   Now, thanks to Democrats, we are coming back. Vaccination rates are  up, unemployment rates are down, and travelers are returning. But it is  not enough to restore the country to where we were when COVID hit. We  need to build back better. This crisis has highlighted systemic  inequalities that must be addressed.   The Build Back Better agenda offers us an opportunity to do just that  by lifting working families, providing a pathway to citizenship, taking  historic action on climate change, and making the wealthy contribute  their fair share.   This is our moment, and we must seize it.                            ____________________
