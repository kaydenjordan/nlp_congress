 Mr. Speaker, this Labor Day week, I recognize the  achievements of a young woman from Arkansas, Ms. Sierra Holley. Ms.  Holley is a student at the Conway Area Career Center and recently  completed the SkillsUSA Championships, where she received a Skill Point  Certificate in welding sculpture.   Sierra won the gold in our State's SkillsUSA Leadership Conference  and received a travel scholarship from the MikeRoweWORKS Foundation to  attend the national competition.   SkillsUSA's programs are integrated into career and technical  education through a framework of personal, workplace, and technical  skills grounded in academics.   More than 6,300 students from every State in the Union completed this  year's championships, and Arkansas is so proud of Sierra's  accomplishments.   SkillsUSA Championship events are a great way for middle, high  school, and college students to immerse in the field of a skilled  workforce.   Conway Area Career Center is located at Conway High School. I  congratulate Sierra for her great achievement and that of her teachers  at the Conway Area Career Center.                            ____________________
