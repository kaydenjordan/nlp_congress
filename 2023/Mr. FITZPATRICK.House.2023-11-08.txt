 Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit the FTC  from bringing cases under Section 5 that deviate from traditional  antitrust statutes commonly known as the Sherman Act and the Clayton  Act.   Since the start of the administration, the FTC has taken several  steps that stray from traditional procedures and norms while pushing  the limit on statutory bounds Congress had already placed in this area.   The FTC act does not define ``unfair methods of competition.'' In  2015, the FTC issued the statement of enforcement principles that  clarified the priority of consumer welfare in the application of the  antitrust laws through the FTC Act.   In particular, it has confined its Section 5 cases to conduct that  diminishes consumer welfare by harming competition or the competitive  process as opposed to conduct that merely harms individual competitors  or poses public policy concerns unrelated to competition.   The 2015 statement was replaced by an ambiguous new statement in  November of 2022 that causes confusion and strays from the rule of law.   Rather than promoting competition, the FTC is imposing more costs on  businesses, driving up prices for consumers that simply pile onto  inflation.   If the FTC and the unaccountable bureaucrats at other agencies such  as the FDIC continue to stray from the rule of law, Americans will face  higher prices, less innovation, and reductions in quality as these  agencies seek unchecked authority to regulate and micromanage the  American economy.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my.    Mr. Chairman, I would just say that is the issue,  that there is more confusion now that the FTC has kind of wandered away  from what ultimately was legal precedent.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I simply would urge an ``aye'' vote,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
