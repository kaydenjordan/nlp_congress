 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for  yielding me this time, and I thank her for her work. I thank Mr.  Frelinghuysen, as well, for his work and my colleagues on the other  side, but I have reservations, strong reservations about this bill.   I appreciate the very real needs of those still recovering, our  American citizens and friends and family in Florida and Texas, and that  concern is genuine. I have always supported aid to other parts of the  country, even when some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  refused to help New York and left New York hanging after Superstorm  Sandy. I have never let that get in the way of my wanting to be helpful  to my fellow citizens anywhere in this country who are under duress.   But I can't, in good conscience, vote for this bill. It leaves some  of the hardest hit and most vulnerable Americans, American citizens,  without the help that they need. It treats Puerto Rico and the Virgin  Islands as second-class citizens--not second-class people, but second- class, literally, citizens--and will stall the efforts there to  rebuild.   I appreciate Mr. Culberson saying that the people of Puerto Rico and  the Virgin Islands are a long way from recovery. I am paraphrasing what  he said. I do appreciate those words. I do hope that it is an insight  for my Republican colleagues and the leadership on the other side of  the aisle that more help will be on the way for the people of Puerto  Rico, but simply not enough is being done in this bill to help the men  and women of Puerto Rico and the children of Puerto Rico today.    Our fellow citizens of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are no less  American than those in any of the 50 States.   I wonder if anyone would argue that point as to whether they are  citizens of the United States or not. I would argue they are no less  citizens of the United States than any other individuals in the rest of  the 50 States, and they should be treated the same and with the same  respect.   The people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands suffered direct hits  not from one, but from two massive hurricanes, the likes of which we  have never seen before, not in our modern history. Maybe you have to go  back to Alexander Hamilton and the hurricane that he wrote about back  in the 1700s that rocketed him to stardom.   Here we are 3 months later. Millions--not hundreds, not thousands,  but millions--of our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and in the Virgin  Islands are without power. Far too many still, because they are without  power, lack clean drinking water. Thousands are unable to receive  adequate healthcare, and earlier this week, the Governor of Puerto Rico  ordered a recount of the storm's death toll, which could number, now,  into the thousands. If that is not a sign of how neglectful the  response has been to this disaster, then I don't know what would be.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   We must provide the assistance that our territories need. We must  fully fund Medicaid as the islands recover. We must eliminate  disparities in the law that are holding back that recovery. We must  stand up for not the people of the Virgin Islands, not the people of  Puerto Rico, but the United States citizens who have fought in our  wars, who have defended our freedoms, for the United States citizens of  the Virgin Islands and the United States citizens of Puerto Rico.   They deserve no less than how any other State is being treated after  a disaster like this. They deserve no less. They deserve more than they  are getting in this bill.    Mr. Speaker, Republicans have moved on from doing  nothing to help middle-class America, to actively undoing everything  America's middle class relies on. First, they cut taxes for  corporations and the wealthy, instead of lifting up the middle class.  And they did it twice. Now they're kicking the can down the road while  millions of Americans suffer through the holidays. They've left  millions of kids in the lurch for months by letting the Children's  Health Insurance Program expire instead of protecting sick children in  need of care. They have woefully underfunded recovery efforts in Puerto  Rico, the Virgin Islands, Florida and Texas instead of guaranteeing  clean water and electricity to our fellow Americans. And the icing on  the cake: Republicans would leave 800,000 DREAMers--  [[Page H10402]]  Americans in every way but on paper--wondering whether their Christmas  gift will be deportation papers. I cannot support Republicans'  heartlessness. I cannot support Republicans' recklessness. I cannot  support this bill without a fix for DREAMers.
