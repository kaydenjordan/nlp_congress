 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the importance of  the bipartisan National Apprenticeship Act of 2021.   First, I would like to thank former Congresswoman Susan Davis for the  work that she and Brett Guthrie put in this bill and how important it  was. We had traveled the world looking at different models to see how  other countries have done it, but the answer was right here in our  backyard, the gold standard, what the national building trades have  done over the past 100 years.   Mr. Speaker, as a child growing up, you hear from teachers and  counselors that you have to go to college in order to make it in  America. Well, I was one of four boys. My three brothers went to  college. I like to say I went to the other 4-year school, a registered  IBEW apprenticeship program for electricians.                                time  0930    It allowed me to earn while I was going to school, to take what I  learned in the books at night and apply it the next day; how important  that was to help raise my young family and literally paved the way for  me to go from the construction site to the floor of Congress;  remarkable.   But we know, one size does not fit all. I like to say, some people  want to go to college, some people want to build the college, some  people want to defend the college. We need everyone to come together,  and this registered apprenticeship is the most successful training  program in the history of the United States. You heard, 94 percent of  the people who complete it go right to work and are fully employed.   And the building trades have a graduation rate of approaching 90  percent, something unheard of, and coming out making $70,000, with  little or no debt. Little or no debt. That paycheck that goes along  with it is that dignity that if you can work with your hands you also  work with your heart and your head, and how important that is.   Whether you work in a shipyard, medical technology, or you have your  Ph.D., we are all the same, adding value to this great country, and we  need all of them to succeed.   This apprenticeship act builds off of what we have done in the past.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to make sure, the standards  are so important. When there is a hurricane that hits the Gulf Coast,  literally, linemen and workers from around the country come together.  And why is that important? Because they all train on the same  standards.   Could you imagine if everybody came in learning a different way? That  is how people die. That is why standards are critically important and  proven over time.   So I encourage everybody to come together to work on and vote for the  most impressive and successful program in the history of the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the North America's Building  Trades Unions letter of support.                                                     North America's                                          Building Trades Unions,                                   Washington, DC, February 3, 2021.        Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the over 3 million       skilled craft professionals that comprise North America's       Building Trades Unions (NABTU), I write in support of H.R.       447, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021.        I first would like to commend the work of Chairman Scott       and the bipartisan cosponsors of this legislation for their       diligent efforts to maintain the integrity of the Registered       Apprenticeship system, and their continued engagement with us       on this bill, which reauthorizes the foundational law on       which our apprenticeship programs are built. In the eight       decades since the Registered Apprenticeship system was       created, our nation, the economy, our industry, and       technology have drastically changed. What has not  [[Page H410]]       changed is the need to forever protect and enshrine the       rights of those individuals who enter an apprenticeship       program, and H.R. 447 continues to protect the safety, well       being, and economic trajectory of the apprentice.        More than two-thirds of all civilian registered apprentices       in the United States are trained in the construction       industry. Among these construction apprentices, seventy-five       percent receive their training at one of the 1,900 privately       funded training centers in North America which are jointly       administered by construction contractors and building trades       unions. Investing almost $2 billion in private capital       annually in our Registered Apprenticeship programs, our joint       labor-management programs have long been considered the gold       standard of the Registered Apprenticeship system.        The affiliated unions of NABTU provide a debt-free ladder       of opportunity to those who seek a career in the construction       industry through Registered Apprenticeship. From day one,       apprentices earn while they learn on a progressively       increasing wage scale, with the added security of healthcare       and retirement benefits, and upon completion of the program       earn, on average, $60,000 annually. Furthermore, through our       ever-expanding pre-apprenticeship programs, we continue to       work with our industry partners to increase the diversity of       apprenticeship candidates by recruiting women, people of       color and veterans.        While there are other avenues one may take to be trained in       the construction crafts, for generations, the safest, most       highly skilled and productive construction craft workers in       the world have received their training through the Registered       Apprenticeship system. H.R. 447, the National Apprenticeship       Act of 2021, will ensure the Registered Apprenticeship system       not only remains the gold standard in workforce training in       the construction industry, but that it is accessible for all       industries that seek a productive and highly skilled       workforce. I urge swift passage of this bill and look forward       to working with you to strengthen economic opportunities in       every community, both large and small, across our great       nation.            Sincerely,                                                     Sean McGarvey,                                                         President.
