 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to  recognize a great man and honorable Texan, Mayor Frank Seffrood of  Copperas Cove, who passed away December 28, 2018.   Mayor Seffrood lived his life as a selfless servant for others. He  served in the U.S. Army for 23 years and later as city councilman of  6\1/2\ years before being elected mayor of Copperas Cove in 2005. He  was just recently elected to serve a second term on December 11 before  he unexpectedly passed away.   Mr. Speaker, I want to bring attention to this because last Friday at  the Copperas Cove Chamber of Commerce annual banquet, Mayor Seffrood  was awarded the Good Friend Award. This is awarded to those who inspire  others to serve and volunteer and those who show leadership and  selflessly give their time and their resources.   As a citizen of Copperas Cove for 55 years and as a compassionate  leader, I cannot think of someone better suited to be this year's  recipient. His wife, Rita, accepted the award on his behalf.   The Copperas Cove community has already felt the immense loss of  Mayor Seffrood, but his kind and noble spirit lives on through the  people's lives he has touched. I am praying for the Seffrood family and  all those who loved him during this difficult time.   In God We Trust.                            ____________________
