 Madam President, earlier this morning, Americans learned  that, thanks to the skill and bravery of our Armed Forces, we have  taken off the battlefield the world leader of ISIS. I want to thank the  incredible work of our brave military servicemembers who work day and  night to keep Americans safe. So many have suffered at the brutal hand  of ISIS.   Senators will learn more about the operation later this morning  during our classified, all-Senators briefing with Secretary Austin and  other senior administration officials.
