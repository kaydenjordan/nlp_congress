 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, Democrats on the Judiciary  Committee are holding a hearing that is ostensibly about Supreme Court  ethics reform. Really, it is just another chapter in Washington  Democrats' three-decade-long campaign to undermine the Federal  Judiciary at any cost.   There were the absurd smear campaigns aimed at jurists like Robert  Bork and Janice Rogers Brown. There were the uncorroborated accusations  held back with last-minute surprises against the nominations of Justice  Thomas and Justice Kavanaugh. There was the silly attempt at a boycott  by Democrats on the committee who didn't want to engage with Justice  Barrett.   Washington Democrats apparently find a textualist Court that upholds  our written Constitution to be a mighty unappealing proposition. They  made that clear for 30-plus years.   And in the last few years, the hostility has reached reckless new  highs: a sitting Senator stirring up crowds from the steps of the  Court, naming Justices who would pay the price; unhinged activists  marching on Justices' family homes; publishing the locations of their  children's schools; and fueling a frenzy that had one unstable person  literally--literally--plotting to assassinate a member of the Court;  and Attorney General Garland simply refusing to enforce clear Federal  law and stop illegal mob protests at judges' homes.   Now we have the next raft of silly personal attacks. This time, the  left and some of their media allies want the American people to gasp in  horror--in horror--that one Supreme Court Justice vacations with his  friends, that another one sold his house when he moved, and that Chief  Justice Roberts' wife has a career outside the home.   The Democrats even tried to pressure Chief Justice Roberts to trade  the Supreme Court for their kangaroo court and show up in person today  to hear them grandstand, a totally inappropriate request, as the  Chief's polite and fact-based reply made clear.   For goodness' sake, we now have Senate Democrats openly threatening  to defund the Court's budget by the exact amount they need for security  to protect the Justices and their families if the Justices don't  reorganize internal affairs the way some Democrats want.   Every 5 minutes, the Democratic Party wants to give lectures about  upholding our institutions and protecting democracy. But just as often,  they find a way to undertake a reckless attack against the courts and  the rule of law.   So look, I am proud of how our Nation's highest Court has weathered  these latest baseless attempts to attack its authority. I believe in  the integrity and honesty of all nine Justices--all nine of them. They  should pay the partisan grandstanding no mind at all.  [[Page S1447]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, now on entirely different matter, there  was a remarkable exchange yesterday when a Russian reporter tried to  put false words in Speaker McCarthy's mouth about alleged Republican  opposition to helping Ukraine defeat Russian aggression.   Well, the Speaker put him in his place and shut him down. He reminded  everyone of his ongoing support of aid to Ukraine and of Republicans'  commitment to help our friends win. Republicans are the party of  American strength, at home and abroad. And that includes standing up to  would-be tyrants who are invading sovereign countries, killing innocent  people, and putting the core national interests of the United States at  risk.   Equipping Ukraine to defend itself is a direct investment in  America's own national security--our national security. As brave  Ukrainians degrade the Russian military on the frontlines, a major  threat to Western security and economic prosperity gets weaker.   In the meantime, our own defense capabilities are actually getting  stronger. A large part of the security assistance appropriated for  Ukraine actually funds the production of new cutting-edge capabilities  for the U.S. military and supports good-paying jobs for skilled  American workers right here at home.   Unfortunately, it is the administration whose policies have been slow  and halting. Since the beginning of Russia's escalation, the Biden  administration had lagged several steps behind the pace of relevance in  delivering decisive aid to Ukraine. Every approval of new assistance  has required agonizing deliberations and prodding from congressional  Republicans and Democrats alike. This was the case with the Stinger and  Javelin systems the Ukrainians needed to drive back Russian convoys and  Polish fighter jets that stood waiting on the tarmac, with the HIMARS  and Harpoons and PATRIOT systems they needed to put the invaders on the  back foot and the Abrams tanks they needed to support a  counteroffensive and now with the cluster munitions, longer range  fires, and fourth-generation fighter jets our friends need to actually  turn the tide. At every single mile marker--every one--the Biden  administration has dithered--dithered--unnecessarily.   It is time for the President to get serious about victory and invest  in American strength.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
