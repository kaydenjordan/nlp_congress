 Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day in the history of the  House. Some 21 years ago, a deranged individual came through the door  that we now call the Memorial Door and took the lives of two of our  officers.   I rise to pay tribute to my constituent Officer Jacob Chestnut and  Detective John Gibson from the State of Virginia. Both of them were  shot and killed defending this Capitol 21 years ago today, July 24,  1998.   A lone gunman burst through what we now call the Memorial Door and  attacked this sacred home of American democracy. These brave officers,  whom we remember today, placed themselves in the line of fire and gave  their lives to protect Members, staff, and visitors in the building  that morning.   Memorial Door, Mr. Speaker, is right outside my office. I go through  it almost every day. Every time I pass through it, I look at the  memorial plaque and remember these two extraordinary and brave men  whose sacrifice will not be forgotten by those who serve in and work in  this House, by their brothers and sisters in the Capitol Police force  who still stand sentry and watch over it, and by their grateful fellow  Americans.   Today, America, let us pay tribute to Officer Chestnut and Detective  Gibson and give our thanks to all the men and women of the U.S. Capitol  Police and, indeed, to all law enforcement officers who, every morning,  get up and put a badge perhaps on their chest or on their belt or in  their wallet and go out to protect us, their neighbors, their friends.   Let us thank all law enforcement officers in communities across this  country for their service, their dedication, and their sacrifices,  which make the exercise of democracy possible.      Honoring Melinda Walker Upon Her Retirement as Chief Reporter of                                  Debates     Mr. Speaker, I just spoke about two who served our Capitol  and our country. Unhappily, they lost their lives.   I now speak about one who has served our House of Representatives as  an institution much more happily, because she has served so well and so  faithfully and so long and is now retiring, hopefully, to a very happy  retirement.   We could not do our job representing the American people without the  tireless and sometimes thankless labors of the men and women who make  this House function behind the scenes.   They sit at the desk behind us. They sit at the upper rostrum. They  make a difference. And they record what we have to say.   From the Clerk's Office to the Parliamentarian staff, from the C-SPAN  crew to the stenographers, the nonpartisan, professional staff who  enable the work of the House and its Members are central to the success  of our constitutional mission.   The House has relied on the services of shorthand reporters of  debates for almost 200 years, and the verbatim proceedings of House  business have been published as the Congressional Record since 1873.   We have a young woman who is now taking down my remarks, which may or  may not be profound, but somebody will be able to say: ``What did Hoyer  say?'' ``What did my Representative say?''   A division of the Office of the Clerk, the Office of Official  Reporters is charged with providing nonpartisan, professional  stenographic services for the House floor, committees, and leadership.   It has grown from a 5-person shop in the 19th century to a diverse  43-person operation today. They work extraordinarily long hours; they  work very hard; and they are extraordinarily competent.   Today, I join all my colleagues in thanking one of those outstanding,  wonderful individuals who is retiring as the Chief Reporter of Debates,  Melinda Walker.   Melinda is with us on the floor today.   Melinda, thank you very much.   And I know, Mr. Speaker, if it weren't out of order, I would mention  that her family is in the gallery, but because that is not in order, I  won't do that.   Melinda will step down in August, after more than 20 years of service  to the House of Representatives.   A proud native of Texas, Melinda came to the House in 1999, after  serving as a court reporter for the U.N. International Criminal  Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania.   Her career began after graduating from the Stenograph Institute of  Texas in 1989, and her work took her around the country and across the  world, with positions in the United Kingdom, the Caribbean, and South  Africa.   Melinda has reported both House committee hearings and floor  proceedings. She has taken down committee testimony from two Chief  Justices of the Supreme Court and three Secretaries of State, among  many others.   On the floor, Melinda has reported the State of the Union messages  for three Presidents, as well as the remarks of numerous foreign  dignitaries during joint meetings of Congress.   Upon Melinda's promotion to Chief Reporter in 2015, she led the team  of reporters and staff in charge of the production of the Congressional  Record. Under her watch, the office has been successful in meeting its  daily production deadlines, while capturing the intricate parliamentary  nuances of House proceedings.   Melinda has contributed a fully revised and updated style and  formatting manual, more than 200 pages long, for the Office of Official  Reporters. Americans will be advantaged by that work for decades to  come.   She has been recognized by the National Court Reporters Association  as a Registered Professional Reporter and a Certified Manager of  Reporting Services, and she remains a certified shorthand reporter in  her native Texas.   Melinda plans to return to her hometown of San Saba, Texas, and spend  more time with her family and faithful dog, Bleu.   Lucky dog to have Melinda back.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Melinda  Walker for her many years of distinguished and dedicated service to the  House and in wishing her the very best in retirement.   Melinda, we owe you and your colleagues a debt of gratitude. You  silently serve and sit and listen to verb after noun after adjective  after word after word after word--and you stay awake. It is amazing.  And you do it so well, to the advantage of all of us who serve here,  but, much more importantly, to the advantage of the people of the  United States, who will know what their Representatives say on their  behalf and will be, therefore, able, in a democracy, to make a sound  judgment as to whether those words are the words they want intoned on  this floor on their behalf.   So, Melinda, to you and to all of your colleagues, we say thank you.  Godspeed. Be well.                            ____________________
