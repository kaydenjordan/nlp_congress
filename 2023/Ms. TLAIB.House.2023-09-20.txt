 Madam Speaker, in his 22 years of service as the president  of the American Federation of Teachers of Michigan, David Hecker has  been consistent in his commitment to working families, our teachers,  and our education system, especially public education.

Honoring the Memory of Rocio Ocampo     Madam Speaker, today I recognize a dear friend, Rocio  Ocampo, a community mother, whose contributions had an enormous impact  on the families of southwest Detroit, as we honor her memory.   I first met Rocio when I served in Michigan's State Legislature at a  parent advocacy meeting at Phoenix Elementary School. I was instantly  impressed by Rocio. She was tenacious, and she had a drive to pursue a  better quality of life and future for all children.   She was involved in numerous community organizations, serving on the  board of Urban Neighborhood Initiatives as well as the City of  Detroit's Property Assessment Board of Review, as well as a Parent  Teacher Association member at her children's school. Rocio's active  involvement in our community was marked by her dedication not only to  making it a safer and healthier place to live, but to making it a more  beautiful place to thrive.   Above all, Rocio loved her children and her grandchildren deeply. Her  love extended out to the children of the neighborhood where she lived.  She could always be counted on for a kind word, warmth, and generosity  of spirit.   Rocio Ocampo's vibrant presence will be sorely missed. Please join me  in recognizing her contributions and services as we honor her memory.                           Recognizing Marsha Bruhn     Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of Marsha Bruhn, a  public servant and longtime resident of Detroit, Michigan's 12th  Congressional District, for her numerous outstanding contributions to  the city as well as the Grandmont Rosedale community she calls home.   Madam Speaker, before settling in Detroit's Grandmont Rosedale  community, Ms. Bruhn lived all over the country. She developed her  passion for community development when she volunteered with the Staten  Island Citizens Planning Commission. The community engagement work she  witnessed while later living in Los Angeles spurred her to return to  school to complete her master's degree in urban planning. She used that  experience and education over 22 years of service as the director of  the Detroit Planning Commission.   We were really, really blessed that she chose to live in our  community in Detroit's North Rosedale Park neighborhood. She quickly  became a champion of North Rosedale Park and the entire neighborhood  area that comprises Grandmont Rosedale.   Ms. Bruhn has contributed immensely to strengthening housing and  retaining and attracting small businesses that are the backbone of our  community's corridor. She spearheaded the capital campaign to  revitalize the North Rosedale Park Community House. I thank Ms. Bruhn  and recognize her dedication and thank her for her commitment.                            ____________________
