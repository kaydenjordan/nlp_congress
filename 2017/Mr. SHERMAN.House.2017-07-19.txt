 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my good  friend of 30 years, Nadadur Vardhan, a leader in the Indian-American  community, who passed away on July 3 of this year at age 70 in Los  Angeles, surrounded by his extended family.   Nadadur Vardhan was born in India and immigrated to the United States  in 1978. Arriving in America with just the clothes on his back, he  poured his energy into building a career as an international tax  consultant. Over four decades, he grew his Santa Monica-based  accounting practice to a thriving firm.   Nadadur served as President of the Malibu Hindu Temple, one of the  largest Hindu temples in the United States, and invited me to speak  there and to be there on many occasions. As president of the temple, he  was regularly invited to speak to political, cultural, and religious  groups across the world. Nadadur also founded the Indo-American Vision  Foundation, a pioneering independent think tank that empowered Indian- American political activism.   For his work in promoting the Indo-American community, he received  the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. A passionate community leader, he  personally met with many U.S. Presidents, Prime Ministers of India, and  other elected officials. Nadadur was responsible for organizing several  major cultural and political events, many of which I was honored to  attend, including the World Hindu Economic Forum, forums with Indian  Ambassadors to the United States, and events with a wide range of  public figures.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that all of my colleagues join me in honoring his  many contributions to our Nation and to extend condolences to his wife,  Dr. Indubala Nadadur Vardhan; his daughters, Dr. Malini Nadadur and  Anjani Nadadur; his brother, Nadadur Kumar; his sisters, Dr. Pushpa  Kasturi and Alamelu Krishnamachary; his extended family; and to all  whose lives he touched.
