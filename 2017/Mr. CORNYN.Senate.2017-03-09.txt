Res. 57) was passed.                            ____________________     Madam President, this week the Senate continues to press  forward on a number of congressional review actions; in this case, a  disapproval that will roll back and repeal many Obama-era regulations  that have hurt people across the country and strangled our economic  growth.   By doing away with excessively burdensome rules and regulations, we  are delivering on our promise to the American people to actually do  what we can to help the economy, to grow the economy, to create jobs  and not hurt it with unnecessary, expensive, and burdensome redtape.   Earlier this year, we began the legislative process to deliver on our  biggest promise: repealing and replacing ObamaCare with more affordable  and more accessible healthcare options, options that will work for all  American families. The American Health Care Act, introduced in the  House on Monday, is the first step in fulfilling that promise.   ObamaCare is collapsing. It has already failed countless families  across the country, and it has forced people off good insurance plans  they liked and strong-armed them to sign up for plans that were more  expensive, offered less care, and didn't even let them use the doctor  of their choice. So we would be revisiting healthcare even if Hillary  Clinton had been elected President of the United States because  ObamaCare is in a meltdown mode.   ObamaCare has also saddled our economy with more than a trillion  dollars in new taxes. Most of those taxes are so hidden that most  Americans are probably not aware of the fact that there is even a tax  charged on the premium for their health insurance policy, for example.  Well, all of these taxes end up being absorbed and have to be paid by  American families.   At its very core, the individual mandate of ObamaCare was a major  power play and overreach by the Federal Government. Basically, what it  said was, if you don't buy the government-prescribed health insurance  plan, we are going to fine you; we are going to penalize you.   The government should not be able to force anyone to spend their own  hard-earned money for something they don't want but have to buy under a  threat of financial penalty. The American people have spoken up loudly  and clearly and rightfully demanded that Congress do better, and we  will.   Since the 2010 timeframe--when our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle passed ObamaCare with 60 votes in the Senate, a majority in  the House, and with the White House--they have lost the majority in the  Senate, they have lost the majority in the House, and they have lost  the White House. I think ObamaCare has been one of the major reasons  why, because people, the more they learn about it, the less they like  it, and they don't appreciate Washington forcing them to do things they  don't want to do with their own money.   About 2 months ago, one of my constituents in Texas wrote me about  her skyrocketing healthcare costs. Before last year, her premium was  about $325 a month. A short time later, that was revised to $436 a  month. This same Texan later moved from one city to another and,  because of her change of address, her premium jumped to $625 a month.  It started at $325 and is now $625. In 2017, thanks to ObamaCare, her  premium went up again to an astronomical $820 a month. It started at  $325 before ObamaCare and is now $820 a month. I don't know many people  who could absorb that kind of increase in their healthcare insurance  premium.   In about a year, her monthly healthcare payment jumped by more  [[Page S1715]]  than 150 percent--150 percent. That is hardly what I would call  affordable; thus, the misnamed Affordable Care Act should be the un- Affordable Care Act.   To make matters worse, she then found that her provider would be  putting a halt to individual plans in Texas, something that has been a  recurring theme in my State and across the country. So while President  Obama said: If you like your plan, you can keep your plan, as a result  of ObamaCare, she was not able to keep her plan so she had to find a  new plan and a new doctor, a plan ultimately with less care, less  flexibility, and even a higher price.   Suffice it to say, for this constituent of mine and for millions more  like her, ObamaCare is not working. ObamaCare is not affordable, and it  is hurting Texans. It is time for Congress to keep its promise that we  have made in every election since that given the privilege of  governing--of being in the majority, being in a position to change  things--we would repeal and replace ObamaCare with options that fit the  needs of all Americans and their families at a price they can afford.    I will not, not at this time.   Fortunately, we now have a President in the White House who clearly  sees the failure of ObamaCare and wants to do something about it.  Republicans in Congress have introduced a bill, which is now being  marked up in the House, that the President can actually sign, once it  is passed, to get us out of this mess. The American Health Care Act is  the vehicle to do just that, and I am glad President Trump endorsed the  plan earlier this week.   It is a work in progress. The House committees are marking it up as  we speak. There will be changes along the way, but, ultimately, the  House will pass the bill and send it to the Senate. Then we will have  an opportunity to offer our amendments during the course of its  passage. The important point to make, though, is that this legislation  will actually put patients first so they are not forced into a plan  that they don't want or that provides coverage they can't afford. It  does away with the outrageous new taxes and the penalties that have  made the economy worse off and have made life harder for American  families.    The legislation will also give families more flexibility so they can  get the healthcare specific to their needs that actually works for  them. If they decide, for example, to get a major medical policy that  is relatively inexpensive and then use a health savings account to use  pretax dollars to pay for their regular doctors' visits, they will have  the flexibility to do that. So this legislation promotes sensible  reforms to ensure that big ticket items like Medicaid are put on a more  sustainable fiscal path.   I have heard some suggestions that this legislation actually guts  Medicaid. That is false. That is not true. It actually continues at  current levels in this shared State and Federal program, but it is  subject to a cost-of-living index that will actually put Medicaid on a  more sustainable path. Just as importantly, it will also return the  authority back to the States to come up with the flexible programs they  need to deal with the specific healthcare needs of the people of their  State.   This legislation makes sure that Medicaid doesn't lose sight of its  design, which is to serve the most vulnerable among us who can't afford  access to quality healthcare. It provides them that access--and better  access--by providing flexibility to the States.   We know that the States and the Federal Government spend an awful lot  of money on Medicaid. In Texas, for example, my State spent close to  one-third of its budget on Medicaid last year--one-third of all State  spending--and it is uncapped, so it goes up every year by leaps and  bounds. Under the American Health Care Act, Medicaid will be tied to  the number of people in the State using it, a per capita rate, which  makes sense, and it represents the first major overhaul of the program  in decades.   ObamaCare left us with unchecked government spending, more taxes, and  fewer healthcare options. This bill is the opposite of ObamaCare in  every way. It will control spending in a commonsense way, it will  repeal ObamaCare's taxes and the individual and employer mandate, and  it will provide more flexible free market options for families across  the country. That is not just a bumper sticker or advertisement; that  is actually what is contained in the legislation.   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House, in the  Senate, and in the Trump administration to get this done in the next  few weeks.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
