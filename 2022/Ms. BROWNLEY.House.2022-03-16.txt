 Madam Speaker, last week marked the 1-year anniversary  of the passage of the American Rescue Plan.   The American Rescue Plan was the bold and necessary action we needed  to take to put us on the path of economic recovery. This was the boost  our country needed to get shots in arms, Americans back to work, and  money back in the pockets of working families.   Despite unprecedented challenges, the Biden administration has led  our Nation to record economic growth, including the largest job  creation in American history. In President Biden's first year, over 7.4  million jobs were added to the economy. Also, growth is up, wages are  up, and unemployment is down. But we know we still face inflationary  times.   President Biden and Democrats are also acting to fix supply chains  and taking strong steps to boost competition, strengthen U.S.  manufacturing, create good-paying jobs, and lower everyday costs. We  are working towards building a better America and delivering for  America's working families.                            ____________________
