 Madam Speaker, earlier tonight, the Democrat leadership  of this House put to the floor a resolution, H. Res. 546, to state that  Russia should not be allowed to officially rejoin the G7. That  resolution calls out the President's desire to reengage with Russia in  the G7 in an attempt to put Republican Members in the House in a false  debate between supporting the President and supporting Ukraine's  sovereignty.   Madam Speaker, there is no debate, at least not in the Republican  Conference. As we all have voted before:   Russia must restore Ukraine's borders;   The United States must continue to provide military aid to Ukraine to  withstand Russian aggression;   The United States must continue to assist our European allies in  resisting Russian influence; and   The United States must continue to sanction the irresponsible regime  of Vladimir Putin.   In all these policies, President Trump has actually gone further than  President Obama: sanctions have increased; military aid has been  elevated to include lethal weapons.   I strongly support the President's policies to continue to support  Ukraine and counter the Russian bear.   Madam Speaker, NATO--where the President is over, today, working in  London and remarked that NATO has become stronger--did not become a  strong alliance by having the House of Representatives constantly  undercut the Commander in Chief.                            ____________________
