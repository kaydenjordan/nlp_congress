 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  up to 15 minutes as in morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I am here today for the 158th time to  ask this Chamber to wake up to the mounting evidence of climate change.  The sad truth is that, in Congress anyway, this issue has turned  starkly partisan thanks to a torrent of dark political money that the  fossil fuel industry uses to both threaten and reward the Republican  Party in a dirty, dark money game of stick-and-carrot. Republicans in  Congress ignore climate change for the simple reason that the fossil  fuel industry has become their political life support system. It does  not have to be this way.   Outside this Chamber, even Republicans see things very differently.  In the investment sector, where people have to make decisions based on  real facts and where duties to shareholders limit overly creative  accounting, the Republican signal is clear.   An impressive group of Republican former Treasury Secretaries and  Republican former Presidential economic advisers recently proposed a  conservative, market-based climate solution. Republican Presidents  trusted these folks with the conduct of the U.S. economy. Jim Baker was  Secretary of the Treasury under President Reagan, Hank Paulson was  Secretary of the Treasury under President George W. Bush, and George  Shultz was Secretary of the Treasury under President Nixon, in addition  to other distinguished offices that they held. Joining those three were  Martin Feldstein, Chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic  Advisers, and Greg Mankiw, who held that position for President George  W. Bush; Rob Walton, the former chairman of the board of Walmart, the  world's largest retailer and employer; and Tom Stephenson from Sequoia  Capital, the venture capital firm out in Silicon Valley. This  Republican group proposed a ``carbon dividends'' plan. It combines a  carbon tax on fossil fuels--which reflects harm from carbon emissions  which market economics ordinarily requires to be built into the price  of the product--with a big dividend returning all of the revenues to  the American people, and a reduction of regulations, which may be  mooted by a good enough carbon fee. This idea is actually not so  different from my own American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act.   In their report, they all note that the ``mounting evidence of  climate change is growing too strong to ignore.'' Many would say that  it grew too strong to ignore a good decade ago, but it is important  that these Republican leaders have acknowledged this.   They also said: ``Economists are nearly unanimous in their belief  that a carbon tax is the most efficient and effective way to reduce  carbon emissions.''   This report lines up with many other Republicans outside Congress who  support a revenue-neutral carbon fee. It is the favorite climate  solution in conservative economic circles. Indeed, it is the only  widely accepted climate solution among Republicans.   The Niskanen Center, a Libertarian think tank that spun off from the  Cato Institute, last month wrote this:         The case for climate action is now so strong that one would       be hard-pressed to find a serious academic economist who       opposes using market forces to manage the damage done by       greenhouse emissions.    Like the Treasury Secretaries, economists and investors throughout  the financial community are saying loud and clear: We can no longer  ignore climate change.   Goldman Sachs, for instance, in 2015 did a report on the low-carbon  economy. It was called: ``Goldman Sachs equity investor's guide to a  low carbon world, 2015-2025.'' So unless somebody here is going to say  that Goldman Sachs is in on the hoax, Goldman Sachs is taking this  pretty seriously.   Last year, the investment firm BlackRock, with more than $1 trillion  in assets under management, issued a report titled: ``Adapting  Portfolios to Climate Change.''   I don't think investors trust $1 trillion to a firm that falls for  hoaxes. BlackRock, like Goldman, knows that climate change is real and  is helping its investors plan for the economic fallout.   BlackRock warns in its report: ``Investors can no longer ignore  climate  [[Page S1530]]  change. . . .'' Parenthetical editorial comment: That is the job of  Republicans in Congress.   BlackRock also had something to say about a price on carbon. They  said this: ``Higher carbon pricing would help address [externalities  from fossil fuels] and would be the most cost-effective way for  countries to meet their Paris agreement pledges.''   So in the real world, where real decisions are being made by very  smart people backed by real money, they are telling their clients: You  must take climate change seriously, and you must take carbon pricing  seriously.   The BlackRock report had this data on prices that companies are  setting on carbon internally--in their own internal accounting--across  sectors, including healthcare and energy and utilities. As we can see,  the price per metric ton ranges from a low of about $10 in information  technology, up to over $350 per metric ton--internal costs of carbon  accounting in these industries.   The point ought to be pretty clear. The business community is acting,  investors are insisting on it, and a price on carbon is a key part of  the program.   The legendary Wayne Gretsky's rule was to ``skate to where the puck  is going to be.'' These major firms recognize where the carbon economy  is heading. We should too. We would, if it weren't for the political  mischief wreaked in Congress by the fossil fuel industry.   BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are not alone. The insurance and  reinsurance industry is one of the world's biggest investors, as well  as one of the world's best analyzers of risk. Munich Re and Swiss Re,  and others in property casualty and reinsurance, warn us that climate  change is real and portends huge costs for society. Munich Re's head of  risk accumulation in the United States said in 2015: ``As a nation, we  need to take steps to reduce the societal impact of weather events as  we see greater variability and volatility in our climate.''   One of the biggest investors in the housing market is the Federal  Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac has warned  about climate change impact on the real estate sector: ``The economic  losses and social disruption may happen gradually, but they are likely  to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis of  the great recession.''   When we think of what we went through in the housing crisis of the  great recession, wow, Freddie Mac is warning that the economic losses  and social disruption from climate change in our housing markets are  likely to be worse.   These are all serious investors and they have serious warnings for  us, and ignoring all of them just to please fossil fuel industry  patrons is a big, big mistake.   Even President Trump's nominee to head the Securities and Exchange  Commission, Jay Clayton, thinks we need action. For years, his law firm  has encouraged clients, including ExxonMobil, to disclose climate  change-related risks to the SEC and to investors. If he is confirmed, I  hope he will enforce the SEC's existing disclosure requirements for  climate risk and clarify that public disclosures should include asset  valuations based on global compliance with international treaties.  Investors need climate change risks disclosed against a ``reality  check'' baseline that assumes international compliance with the Paris  climate commitments. An assumption that we fail should not be  acceptable.   Slowly, investor disclosures are improving. Last year, New York  attorney general Eric Schneiderman forced Peabody Energy to restate its  disclosures. Just last week, Chevron acknowledged to its investors in  an SEC filing that, lo and behold, some of its products ``may be  considered pollutants,'' noted ``new conclusions about the effects of  the company's operations on human health or the environment,'' and they  acknowledged ``an increased possibility of governmental investigations  and, potentially, private litigation against the company.''   It is better late than never, I suppose. Now it is time for the rest  of the industry to report fully and fairly, first on the risks that  shareholders bear from assets that are wrongly valued now--that are  falsely valued in their reports--and, second, on the company's  potentially culpable behavior in climate denial.   Institutional investors are joining in those efforts. Our Rhode  Island pension fund, managed by our treasurer, Seth Magaziner, is  pushing for greater transparency on political and lobbying spending at  large energy companies like Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Devon.  For the resolution filed at ConocoPhillips, Rhode Island was joined by  over 20 other cofilers, including the State of Connecticut, Senator  Murphy's home State, whom I see here on the floor.   Just recently, the G20 nations--the 20 biggest economies in the  world--set up a group called the Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures. It is made up of 32 members from large banks,  insurance companies, asset management companies, pension funds, credit  rating agencies, and accounting and consulting firms--you know, liberal  extremists. And they are saying: Here it comes; let's get ready. They  have asked that companies begin to come clean on the climate risk they  face.   The big energy companies need to come clean on how much they are  spending to deny climate science and where they are spending it,  because, ultimately, it is their own investors who will be hurt by  their irresponsibility. Ultimately, all the phony climate denial they  pay for is a fool's errand because the laws of physics, chemistry, and  biology aren't going away, and a day of reckoning for all this mischief  and nonsense they have paid for inevitably will come.   We in the Senate have a duty to the American people to find a way to  combat climate change. I realize this body will need help in that task.  We will need help from the business community, which can apply its  understanding of market forces and risk analysis to this challenge. It  would help if the fossil fuel industry would focus on the long term  health of its shareholders rather than on short-term gain. The fossil  fuel industry should stand down the relentless political opposition it  has maintained to any climate solution, and it should stand down the  phony climate denial operation it continues to support.   It will take all of us coming together--companies, investors,  regulators, governments, citizens, Republicans and Democrats--to  achieve Donald Trump's once-stated goal of combating the ``catastrophic  and irreversible effects of climate change''--his quote: ``catastrophic  and irreversible effects of climate change.''   I did not misquote President Trump, although he was Donald Trump  then. It was 2009, and this full page advertisement was taken out in  the New York Times declaring that the science of climate change was  ``irrefutable'' and the consequences of climate change would be  ``catastrophic and irreversible.'' It was signed by none other than  Donald J. Trump, as well as his children, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric  Trump, and Ivanka Trump. They were right then. If they get back to  this, they will be right now.   The evidence and the science have only piled up since 2009. It is  time for all of us to heed the advice of our universities, our  scientists, and the people who actually know what they are talking  about, and put the arguments of the fossil fuel industry where they  belong--in the trash bin of history. We need to wake up before it is  too late.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.
