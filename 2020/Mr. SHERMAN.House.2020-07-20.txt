 Mr. Speaker, four amendments, the first delists from  U.S. stock exchanges companies where a substantial portion of the audit  is not subject to normal oversight by the PCAOB. This is not an anti- China amendment, though it will affect companies in China and Belgium.   As chair of the Investor Protection Subcommittee and co-chair of the  CPA and Accountants Caucus, it is critical that investors on U.S. stock  exchanges have the additional protection that is provided by the PCAOB,  and that should apply to companies in China just as it does to  companies in Britain, the United States, Canada, et cetera.   The second amendment is to prevent a nuclear cooperation agreement  from being entered into with a country that fails to sign the  additional protocol, which is designed to make sure that their nuclear  technology is used only for peaceful purposes. This is aimed at Saudi  Arabia, whose Crown Prince has broadly hinted a desire for nuclear  weapons.   I join with Mr. Pallone in an amendment that is aimed at Azerbaijani  military units that have committed gross human rights violations, and I  join with Mr. Malinowski in an amendment that is language from my  manager's amendment to the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, which passed  this House, and that language would prevent U.S. technology from being  used to imprison over a million Uighurs.
