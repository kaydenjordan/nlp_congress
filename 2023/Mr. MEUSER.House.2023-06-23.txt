 Mr. Speaker, I have been to the border several times now.  When I visited in 2019 under President Trump, it was orderly, and the  situation was contained. It brings me no pleasure to say when I visited  last time, under the Joe Biden administration, it was an unmitigated  disaster.   We watched migrants flow over the border and saw holding facilities  far past capacity. We saw guardsmen pulled away from their border posts  to go buy diapers and other supplies. We saw mountains of drugs that  had been confiscated, which left everyone wondering how many had gone  through undetected.   On any visit to the border, CBP will inform you that where there is a  barrier, the border is secure, and the portions without are not.   Yet, sadly, this administration has done nothing over the past 2\1/2\  years to curb illegal immigration. Inversely, they have actually  encouraged it, which has strengthened the cartels. It has gotten so bad  we are having illegals fill up school gymnasiums.   Yes, we need comprehensive immigration reform, but we need to stop  the bleeding first by securing the border. We know how to do it.                            ____________________
