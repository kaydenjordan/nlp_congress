 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Wenstrup), my dear friend, for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8876, the Jackie  Walorski Maternal and Child Home Visiting Reauthorization Act.   I would commend Chairman Neal, Chairman Davis, Ranking Member Brady,  and all the members of the Committee on Ways and Means for bringing  this legislation to the floor and honoring our late colleague and my  dearest friend, a selfless servant, Jackie Walorski.   The MIECHV program is backed by decades of research that proves home  visits by a nurse, social worker, or other trained professional during  pregnancy, and in the first year of a child's life supports positive  parenting, improves maternal and child health, and promotes child  development and school readiness. This program has proven vital to  families in underserved communities, especially in my home State of  Missouri.   Life is a beautiful and precious gift, and all babies deserve the  opportunity to thrive. Women need a strong support system as they  navigate the miracles and the challenges of motherhood.   This legislation that embodies my dear friend, Jackie Walorski, was  very close to her heart. It will give women, especially the most  vulnerable, the support they need to build a happy, healthy future for  their children.   Right now, Jackie Walorski's light is shining down on this  institution and on the people of Indiana's Second District. All our  love to her dear husband, Dean; her mother, Martha; and all of those  that served with her.
