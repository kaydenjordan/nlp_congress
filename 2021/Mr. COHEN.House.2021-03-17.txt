 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his time,  and I want to thank Mrs. Maloney and Ms. Speier for their long work on  this, and the many women before them who have worked hard on this  effort.   Congress created the limitation on years on the passage of the ERA,  and Congress can change it, and Congress should change it.   I am the product of the work of a woman, my mother, and her mother  produced her. We should not forget women and their commitment and  invaluable contributions at our birth.   Every woman should have the same rights as a man. They don't get paid  the same, they are discriminated in the workplace, they are harassed,  they are abused. They should have equal rights. That has not occurred  in America, and it won't happen until we pass this bill.   I favor the passage and I appreciate the spirit in which it is  offered.    Unlike Alexander Haig, I am only here temporarily.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), who is from the East Side and who, as  chairperson, brought us the great hearing last year on the ERA.    Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), who is the chairman of the  committee, that he may control that time.
