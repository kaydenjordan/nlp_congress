 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Library Week  to recognize the importance of our Nation's libraries to local  communities.   Our local libraries cultivate lifelong learning and reading and a  profound sense of community across south and west Texas. They serve as  community gathering places and local epicenters of educational  innovation.   At our libraries, folks of all ages can learn about their community's  history, while accessing technological tools that lead us into the  future.   In many towns in the 23rd District of Texas, our public libraries go  far beyond providing books and serve as the primary provider of  literacy programming, especially in underserved rural areas. This is  why I have taken advantage of an important program within the Library  of Congress that allows Members of Congress to donate books to local  libraries across their districts.   For National Library Week, I would like to express gratitude for all  the local librarians who provide these priceless services.                            ____________________
