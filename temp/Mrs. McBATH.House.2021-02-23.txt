 Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Black History Month, I  rise today in honor of a trailblazer in Black history, Cobb County  Sheriff Craig Owens.   This past November, Sheriff Owens made history as the first African  American to be elected sheriff in Cobb County, in my district.   Born and raised in Atlanta, Sheriff Owens has served over 30 years in  the Army, Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and Cobb County Police  Department. His career in law enforcement utilizes the leadership  skills that he gained from his experience serving in our Armed Forces.  [[Page H565]]    Sheriff Owens leads by putting people first, and I am so proud of the  work he is doing to unite Cobb County and instill faith and trust in  its police department. As one of his constituents and as a partner in  service to Cobb County, it is my honor and privilege to recognize  Sheriff Owens today.                            ____________________
