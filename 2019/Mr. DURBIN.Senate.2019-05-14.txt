President Trump decided to withdraw from that agreement. It is not  clear to me why President Trump further undermined our country's  international reputation by backing out of this agreement reached by  key global powers.   To think that we had a consensus, including Russia and China and our  traditional allies of the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, and the  President decided to walk away from it is beyond me.   As with so many issues, he seems motivated to reverse anything ever  done by President Barack Obama, regardless of the facts or by his naive  belief that he can always strike a better deal.   Sadly, I have yet to see any evidence of that dealmaking acumen. In  fact, I have only seen alienated allies, giveaways to dictators, and a  loss of American standing and influence in the world.   It is important to step back and recall where we were when President  Obama took office. Our intelligence community assessed that until 2003,  Iran was working toward a nuclear bomb. Among the many calamities of  the disastrous war in Iraq was that it further empowered Iran. The  country's hard-liners moved forward at great speed, building suspicious  nuclear infrastructure. These efforts produced large and unsettling  quantities of highly enriched uranium that could have been used for a  nuclear weapon.   Such a weapon in the hands of the Iranian regime would have been an  unacceptable risk to the region, to Israel, and to the world.   This is the mess that President Obama inherited when he came to  office. He pledged that Iran would not be able to obtain a nuclear bomb  on his watch, and he kept his word. You see, just as President Kennedy  negotiated with the Soviets when they were threatening possible nuclear  war with missiles in Cuba, just as President Nixon began to establish  ties with China while it was supplying weapons to the North Koreans,  who were fighting Americans, and just as President Reagan negotiated  with the Soviet Union, even though it was occupying Eastern Europe and  fomenting violent revolution, there are times when such agreements  serve our national interest and make the world a safer place.   Similarly, President Obama negotiated a comprehensive deal that  prevented Iran from being able to build a nuclear bomb and held it to  stringent, invasive inspections to ensure that Iran kept its pledge.   Notably, this historic agreement was accomplished without drawing the  United States into war in the Middle East. Let me be clear. The nuclear  agreement was never about all the other genuinely troubling Iranian  behavior in the world, but, instead, it was designed to ensure that  Iran didn't pursue activities with a nuclear weapon. That is what it  did.   The International Atomic Energy Agency continues to verify that on  the ground in Iran the agreement still holds. For the last 4 years,  this Agency has performed an average of four surprise inspections every  month--8,000 inspection hours--and they have found no evidence of  noncompliance on the Iranian side.   Now, today, President Trump is pursuing an incomprehensible policy of  regime change, trying to flatter and meet with Iranian President Ruhani  to negotiate a supposedly better deal and threatening Iran militarily  and tightening sanctions. The end result of this dangerous incoherence  is that our allies are united against us, sadly to say, and Iran may  restart nuclear activities which had been frozen for the last 4 years  because of the agreement that President Trump walked away from.   So the only thing our President's policies have done is to make a  potential restart of Iran's nuclear program a reality. I fear that  President Trump, with the goading of many around him, is trying to  foment a pretext for another war in the Middle East--the last thing  America or the world needs.   So let me be clear on something that I have said regardless of who is  in the White House, a Republican President or a Democratic President.  Article I, section 8 of our Constitution is clear that Congress has the  authority--the only authority--to declare war. This President--any  President--must first have the approval of the people's representatives  in Congress before asking our sons and daughters to enter into battle.   It is not too late for an off-ramp.   I am concerned that this word isn't even close to the way I actually  feel with the suggestion that Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan was  called on to create a plan using 130,000 American military to be poised  in some effort to intimidate Iran. One hundred thirty thousand--that is  the number of troops we sent into Iraq.   I was happy to be one of the 23 members of the Senate who voted  against that terrible decision, but we didn't prevail. We went into  Iraq and thousands of Americans died. It can happen on any President's  watch. This President is setting the stage for it to happen in Iran.   Sadly, the American people have not been dealt into the conversation.  They have one thing to turn to, though, our Constitution, which says  that, ultimately, the American people will make the decision when it  comes to war through their elected representatives.   This administration should return to the only reasonable, smart, and  effective option on the table for countering Iran: Rejoin the nuclear  agreement immediately, repair our strained relationship with our own  allies, and use that unity to push back on Iran's destabilizing actions  across the region which exist outside the nuclear realm. Anything else  is reckless.   I yield the floor.
