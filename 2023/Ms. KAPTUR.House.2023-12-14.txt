 Mr. Speaker, I have two issues to address in a minute.   One, is to bring attention to an excellent editorial which appeared  yesterday in The Wall Street Journal titled: ``Biden and Ukraine Need a  Senate Deal.''   The author, William A. Galston, states: ``Though Speaker   Mike  Johnson has reiterated his support for Ukraine aid, anti-Ukraine  Republicans will likely pressure him to adjourn for the year without  taking up the Senate bill.''   In fact, that has happened in real-time today.   The editorial goes on to say: `` . . . Mr. Biden should make clear  that he is prepared to use his constitutional authority to call the  House back into session.''   We take an oath to protect America against all enemies, foreign and  domestic. Putin's Russia is a real enemy to liberty. We do not want to  be drawn into a greater war in Europe. We need to do our duty and pass  assistance for Ukraine and strengthen our NATO allies.   The second reason I rise today is to talk about the introduction of  the bipartisan Healthy Farms Healthy Watershed Act of 2023, which  encourages volunteer USDA programs to apply to watersheds that are  trying to bear the load of toxic algal blooms largely caused by  dissolved reactive phosphorus and other pollutants.   Mr. Speaker, water is life. Please sponsor the bipartisan Healthy  Farms Healthy Watersheds Act of 2023.   Mr. Speaker, fresh water is life. Today, I introduce the bipartisan  ``Healthy Farms Healthy Watersheds Act of 2023.'' This Bill encourages  voluntary USDA programs to strategically apply resources to maximize  watershed health with existing dollars.   Increasingly harmful algal bloom (HAB) compromise water quality in  all 50 states. These toxic blooms adversely impact human health, sink  property values, damp tourism, waterfront business, and regional  economies. Impacted areas are estimated to have spent over $1 Billion  since 2010 to address and prevent HABs, this creeping green invasion.   A major cause of the harmful bloom is the loading of excessive levels  of dissolved reactive phosphorus into lakes, rivers, and bays  maliciously from megafarms and animal feeding operations and other  pollution.   Despite federal agencies spending Billions to help farmers adopt  management practices to improve water quality, the problem persists  across America. Significant bodies of water like the Great Lakes and  Chesapeake Bay are weighted down with this creeping green invasion.   A new strategy is needed to make current federal investments more  efficient, and more effective. The Healthy Farms Healthy Watersheds Act  focuses on troubled watersheds by directing Natural Resources  Conservation Service resources toward the exact substances and sources  that are contributing most to HABs.   I encourage my colleagues to support this important, budget-neutral,  bipartisan, commonsense legislation.                            ____________________
