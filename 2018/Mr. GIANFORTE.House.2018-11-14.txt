 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time.   Mr. Speaker, like many Montanans, I have a deep respect for our  environment. I support protecting our rich and diverse wildlife and  believe we can support multiple uses of land while conserving species.  Unfortunately, we have seen environmental groups use misinformation and  litigation to keep species listed that have already recovered.   In 2013, the Obama administration's Fish and Wildlife Service  evaluated the gray wolf populations across the United States. It found  that the species no longer warranted protection under the Endangered  Species Act.   Rather than celebrating the recovery, serial litigants and extremists  filed lawsuits to stop the process. Montana has been fortunate. Through  Federal legislation, the wolf has been delisted in Montana since 2011.  Even without ESA protection, the species has continued to recover to a  point nearing overpopulation.   While the focus of this legislation is wolves, a similar issue is  playing out in Montana over the grizzly bear in the greater Yellowstone  ecosystem. Just last year, the grizzly bear was delisted there. I  celebrate the recovery of the species, but it had recovered more than a  decade ago, according to scientists who have spent their lives studying  the grizzly.                                time  1615    Using sound science and reliable data, they found the ecosystem  reached maximum carrying capacity of the grizzly bear 16 years ago, but  serial litigants have repeatedly thwarted the delisting efforts of the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.   The unnecessary delay in delisting species has created unnecessary  stress on the bears and impacted our communities. The overpopulation of  the grizzly pushes them into our communities and increases the  opportunities for attacks.   We must address the flaws in the Endangered Species Act to ensure  species are delisted when they have recovered, and to prevent the law  from being used as a bludgeoning tool for special interest groups to  block critical projects.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 6784 and the rule that we are  considering, the Manage Our Wolves Act, and I urge passage of the bill.
