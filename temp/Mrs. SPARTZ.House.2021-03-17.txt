 Madam Speaker, I think it is a good discussion to have,  but I would suggest to my colleagues from the other side, if they do  believe this issue is still valid and necessary, to actually restart  this process from the beginning, because we are wasting our time right  here. A 1972 amendment cannot be ratified, it doesn't exist. It has  expired. It is unconstitutional. A lot of things have changed.   We can debate if it is necessary or not, but if we want to have a  real debate, we need to restart this from the beginning and not waste  time debating something that doesn't exist. So I would ask not to  support this amendment, and it is unconstitutional.
