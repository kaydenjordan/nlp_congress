 Mr. President, the national debt is what actually pulled  me and you and others, to some degree, into this political process. I  have come to this floor many times over the last 4\1/2\ years to talk  about this. Today, again, it is very timely. It is why I ran for the  U.S. Senate. Today, we have--I just checked--$22.3 trillion, and it is  going up $100,000 a second, as we speak. I have a debt clock in the  reception area of my office, in the Russell Senate Office Building, and  that thing spins all day long, 24 hours a day.   Even more concerning, we have more than $130 trillion of future  unfunded liabilities coming at us like a freight train over the next 30  years. That is $1 million for every household for every American.   What we have learned is that we can't cut our way out of it, we can't  tax our way out of it, and we can't grow our way out of it alone. Any  one of these three will fall short. It has to be a combination. We have  to have a balanced approach over the long haul to solve this $22  trillion of debt problem.   I believe we will not solve this debt crisis unless and until we fix  the way Congress funds the Federal Government. The current funding  process is designed to fail. It really is. It doesn't work. It hasn't  worked. It will never work.   Since the Budget Act of 1974 was put in place, Congress has only  funded the Federal Government on time four times. That means that by  the end of the fiscal year, Congress has only funded the Federal  Government four times by the end of that fiscal year. Let me say that  again. It has been four times in 45 years since the 1974 Budget Act was  put in place. The last time it was actually done was in 1996, some 23  years ago, under President Clinton.   Congress is supposed to pass 12 appropriations bills to fund the  government. Over the last 45 years, we have averaged just 2\1/2\ per  year. Because of that, Congress has used a little known tool up here  called a continuing resolution. In the last 45 years, Congress has used  a continuing resolution 186 times. It is a release valve that lets the  government continue to operate and on the surface doesn't really sound  that onerous. You just keep spending at the same level you did last  year. The problem with that is that it is devastating to some Agencies  and, particularly, the Department of Defense, with regard to long-term  contracts, long-term training, purchases, and maintenance over the end  of the fiscal year, and so forth. They are devastating to our military.  They create inefficiencies and uncertainty that hurt the bottom line  and increase our procurement costs by dramatic amounts. The end result  of that is that it lowers our readiness, and it causes the ability to  fight to be reduced.   In addition, Congress has shut down the government, over the last 45  years, 21 times because they couldn't get together and agree on how to  fund the government that year--21 times.   This funding process, in my opinion, is an unmitigated disaster,  based on the actual results that have led to $22 trillion of debt  today, which, in my view, is indeed a crisis. Over the last 4\1/2\  years alone, we have looked at practices in States, other countries,  and businesses to find best practices. No one else in the world funds  their operation the way the U.S. Congress funds our government.   The problem is, we have a three-step process. We do a budget, an  authorization, and then an appropriation. There simply are not enough  days in the year to get all of those done. It is a 14-week budget  process. We have 16 authorizing committees. If you did one a week, that  is 16 weeks. And then you have 12 appropriating bills. Even if you did  one a week, which is very hard to do, that is not enough time in the  calendar year to do that.   Right now, Congress has yet to pass this year a single appropriations  bill for the next year. This is not the appropriators' problem. They do  their jobs. They proved that last year and the year before that. If  given enough time and information, they can get their job done. The  problem is that this year we have not even agreed with the House and  with the White House on what the top-line spending should be.   As I stand here today, there are 17 working days until 31 July, when  Congress leaves for a State work period called the August recess. When  we get back, there are only 10 working days until the end of the fiscal  year. That means we have 27 working days to reach a budget deal, pass  12 appropriations bills, and bring them to conference and get this  government funded.   If we started today, we would need to pass an appropriations bill  about every 2 days in order to pass all 12 bills by the end of the  fiscal year. We are already behind, and I am afraid we are staring down  the barrel of another CR unless we start taking these bills up  immediately.   The minority leader and the majority leader in the Senate have been  working diligently, along with the appropriations minority leader and  chairman of the appropriations committee. They all have been working  very well to get to a top-line number with the White House and the  House of Representatives. I am told we are very close to a deal today.  I hope we are.   Last year, when we paid attention to it, we got to 75 percent  funding. But by 31 July, we had only done 12.5 percent of total  government funding. Again, this is just for the discretionary part of  our spending, which is only about 25 percent of the total spending that  we have in the Federal Government, which includes mandatory expenses.   Last year, 16 of us wrote a letter to Leader McConnell, who agreed,  and to his credit, kept us here in August, and we went from 12 percent  to 75 percent funding by the end of August, including the Department of  Defense and HHS, two of our biggest line items. By staying here in  August, we did the people's work and did something that hadn't been  done in 22 years.    I hope it doesn't come to that this year. It shouldn't. We have time  to do what we need to do. I know the people in charge are doing  everything they can to make that happen. That is not what this  conversation is about today. I am hopeful that even this week we can  get agreement on the topline number, move past the budget cap issue,  and get to appropriating these bills so we can avoid any more CRs in  our future this year.   The unfortunate reality is we have reached this same predicament  almost every year since 1974. Einstein once said that ``insanity is  doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different  results.'' That is what this Congress has done continually over the  last 45 years, with different Members and different colleagues. We keep  doing the same thing.   I am convinced more than ever that we need a politically neutral  platform to fund the government on time every year without all of this  drama. It can be done. I think both sides want to do it. Both sides  have talked about it when they were in the minority and majority at  different times, but it is time to move on it.   Today 25 percent of our budget is discretionary. That is all. That is  defense, the Veterans' Administration, and all domestic discretionary  spending. That is 25 percent. That is what this is all about. This  debate and drama is about 25 percent of the Federal Government.   What is the rest of it? We all know that is the mandatory expense  side of our budget; 75 percent of what we spend in the Federal  Government, over $3 trillion, is for things like Social Security,  Medicare, Medicaid, pension and benefits for Federal employees, and the  interest on the debt. The interest alone has gone up $450 billion over  the last 2 years with nine Fed fund rate increases, and it is projected  that by 2023 we will be spending more on the interest alone on this  debt than we do on national defense.   If we borrow about 30 percent of what we spend, that means, by  definition, every dime we spend on discretionary spending is borrowed  money. What is discretionary again? Our defense. So every time we are  spending on defense, it is technically borrowed money.   I believe it is time to fix this, and the way forward is pretty  clear. The way I see it, there are three things we have to do to fix  this funding process. No. 1,  [[Page S3467]]  we have to change the budget process and appropriations process to make  it streamlined, as most States do.   Yesterday I introduced a bill called the Fix Funding First Act, which  I hope will start a dialogue. It is not the end result, but I am  hopeful it will start a dialogue here and that we will be able to work  through the details, take individual items one at a time, pass some  bills, and start moving toward a solution.   Second, we have to address mandatory spending. We need to save Social  Security and Medicare.   Third, we need to adjust the current committee structure so that the  same committees on both sides can both authorize and appropriate.   This is a chart of what we have today. This is reality. We have on  the left 16 authorizing committees, and on the right we have 12  appropriating committees. You can see for one appropriating committee  you may have five or six different authorizing committees that have to  provide input, in theory, to the appropriating committee.   When I came to Congress I was asked to head the Subcommittee on State  Department Oversight inside Foreign Relations. My responsibility was to  provide oversight. Interacting with the person who was the chair of the  subcommittee in appropriations--we never talked and there was very  little input, but we found out that the State Department at that time  had not been authorized in over 13 years. We changed that and got it  authorized the very next year. But this is an archaic structure that  will never work. It creates all of the confusion that we have right now  and the time delays in trying to get this done.   The Fix Funding First Act I introduced yesterday does five simple  things.   First, it changes the Federal Government fiscal year to match the  calendar year. Why is that important? Well, in the first year of a new  Congress we always start 3 months behind; we start in the fourth month.   Second, this bill establishes biennial budgeting. A lot of States do  that. It is not the end-all solution, but it is a great place to start  and will make things a lot easier here.   Third, this bill makes the budget a law. Simply put, today the budget  is a resolution.   Fourth, it creates milestones with consequences to hold us  accountable as a body when we don't do our jobs. There are 44 States,  including my State of Georgia, that have a balanced budget law, and if  they don't pass a budget by the end of their 44- or 45-day session,  they don't go home. In most States that is a law. What we are proposing  here is essentially the same thing. We have broken the appropriations  process into four tranches and set deadlines before Congress's  scheduled work break. If we don't make the deadline, we don't go home  until we get that part done. It is just that simple.   Last, our proposal requires the Budget Committee to complete a 5-year  strategic plan--something we have never done--just as people in the  real world do. This gives us a chance to start talking about the long- term debt-to-GDP ratio that my colleague Senator Whitehouse has been  talking about for the last several years, and I fully subscribe to what  he is trying to do.   That is what the bill that was introduced this week will do, and I  think it is the first step to fix the funding process.   Once we complete the first phase, we need to tackle mandatory  spending, which is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and pensions  and benefits. Right now, mandatory spending makes up about 75 percent  of what Congress spends every year, but costs are expected to explode  over the next 20 years.   The next chart shows the projection from the Congressional Budget  Office, and these are generally agreed-upon numbers based upon the baby  boomers maturing in age. What we have is the green line, total expenses  of the Federal Government, going from just above $4 trillion today to  almost $12 trillion in just 20 years. In 10 years, we are talking about  it being over $8 trillion--almost double what it is today. These are in  constant dollars, not inflated dollars. This is our crisis. What is  causing that crisis in the green line are total expenses.   The blue line is discretionary expenses, which are what we spend most  of our time arguing about here on the floor of the Senate and the  House. But look at this. This is the mandatory chart. We go from a  moderate one until we see cataclysmic geometric growth. We know that  the Social Security trust fund goes to zero in 12 years. The Medicare  trust fund goes to zero in 7 years.   We have to save these programs and turn these curves down. There is  no way the world is going to allow us to borrow that much money. Until  Congress works up the political courage to deal with the mandatory  spending issue, we should make all expenditures discretionary, bring  them under the budget process when they need to be subsidized, and that  is going to happen within a few short years.   I believe the answer is very simple. Even if we pass this bill and  the Appropriations Committee still has to write down its own defense  authorization, defense bills and so forth, we have to streamline this  process. Last year we did, and it almost worked. What we have now is  totally dysfunctional.   I hope this proposal that we are putting on the board today will help  start the dialogue about how we can fix this funding process.   America always does well in a crisis, but we are not always the first  to decide that we are in a crisis. I personally believe we have been in  a crisis for the last 15 years. Either we can wake up and face it now  or I think we will regret it later.   There are Members on both sides of the aisle who recognize this  crisis. I am encouraged by the conversations we are having together.  This is not a partisan issue. This is one of those ways that people  back home expect us to compromise and work together to solve this.   I am encouraged today. It is time we did this, and this is the time,  this year. In the next few weeks, hopefully we will get past this  impasse and make it happen this year.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
