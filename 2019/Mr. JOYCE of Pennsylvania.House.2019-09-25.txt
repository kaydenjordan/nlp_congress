 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  H.R. 2203, yet another one of the majority's messaging bills that would  do nothing to address the crisis on our southern border.   At home in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, nearly 2,000  miles away from the southern border, this crisis is taking a tangible  toll on our communities. As illicit drugs continue to pour across the  southern border and infiltrate into my district, addiction and death  are occurring.   If we continue to kick the solutions down the road, we are choosing  simply not to act.   Today, we could be voting to stop the human trafficking, to stop the  drug trafficking, to stop the cartels and the violent criminals who  permeate into our country. H.R. 2203 does not address the real  problems.   Instead of passing this do-nothing bill, I ask that we return to the  Homeland Security Committee and work on a bipartisan basis to secure  our border, to end the asylum loopholes, and to protect this great  country.
