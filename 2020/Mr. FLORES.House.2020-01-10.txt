 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 627 brave civilian  women who served as Donut Dollies for the Red Cross' Supplemental  Recreational Activities Overseas Program during the Vietnam conflict  between 1965 and 1972.   The name Donut Dollies was coined during World War II to describe the  Red Cross volunteers who passed out hot coffee and donuts from the  backs of military vehicles. While the women who volunteered in Vietnam  did so much more than hand out donuts and coffee, the name Donuts  Dollies was applied to them.   The young women of the Donut Dollies were stationed throughout  Vietnam, from Saigon up to Quang Tri. They lived in tents and abandoned  villas. They endured incoming fire, and they flew over enemy territory  just like our military personnel.   These brave women quickly became to be known as angels in a combat  zone for their bright smiles and powder blue uniforms that lifted the  spirits at every base they toured.   The Donut Dollies hosted daily recreational events at large bases,  such as pool tournaments, fashion shows, and various contests to  provide fun and relaxation for off-duty military personnel. They helped  serve food in chow lines, and they brought Kool-Aid to the night  sentries working in perimeter towers.   Others were assigned to the Clubmobile program, which toured more  remote bases, often requiring helicopter transport to reach them. They  would gather the troops, usually beside a bunker or tank, to play  competitive audience participation games.   For the hour or so that they were there, the Donut Dollies brought  laughter and a sense of lightheartedness that was deeply missed in the  war zone. Because death was so close, the laughter was healing, funny  things were funnier, and their laughter helped join everyone together.  One soldier once said it was the miracle of making the war disappear  for a little while.   The approximately 1,500 visits of the Clubmobile program logged over  2.1 million air miles. Their primary goal on these visits and at the  events at larger bases was to boost morale and to provide the men with  a sense of home before going out in the field.   Mr. Speaker, the contributions of the Donut Dollies represented a  changing role of women to serve their country at a time when women had  previously been limited to noncombat roles. Their patriotism helped  bring warmth, light, and laughter to the darkness of wartime.   My wife, Gina, and I are honored to recognize the women of the Donut  Dollies and to thank them for their important and sacrificial  contributions that they made for our country during the Vietnam  conflict.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our military men and women who protect us, and for our  first responders who keep us safe at home.       Honoring Chris and Peggy Osborne of Bryan-College Station, Texas     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 33 years  of service and ministry of Chris and Peggy Osborne to Central Baptist  Church and to the community of Bryan-College Station, Texas.   Central Baptist Church was founded in 1925 as a mission-minded  ministry dedicated to sharing a passion for God's Word. Today, Central  Baptist Church has become an integral part of the Bryan-College Station  community, where a strong sense of discipleship has led to the creation  of many outreach programs, children's ministry events, and college  ministry groups.    Even as the church has grown, Central Baptist Church remains  committed to their original mission-minded goals, and through the  efforts of the congregation, thousands of people have found the joy,  peace, and contentment that spring from a fulfilling and personal  relationship with Jesus Christ.   For the past 33 years, Pastor Chris and his wife, Peggy, have been a  source of light and encouragement and joy for the entire Central  Baptist Church community. Under the leadership of Pastor Chris, Central  has seen significant change and growth. The relocation of its church to  its current 3,500-seat worship center and the more recent addition to  the children's wing have provided members of the Central Baptist family  with ever-increasing opportunities for worship and community.   Chris's commitment to outreach and involvement have made him a pillar  of the Bryan-College Station community, serving as chaplain for the  police department, hosting cook-offs and baking competitions, and  participating in charity golf tournaments.   Pastor Chris' dedication to service has not gone unnoticed, and  hundreds of members of his congregation have experienced life change  from his encouraging and supportive approach.   On January 26, 2020, Central Baptist Church will say good-bye to  Pastor Chris and to his wife, Peggy, as they begin the next chapter of  their lives in Fort Worth, Texas, where Chris will continue to spread  the Word of God as a professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological  Seminary.   As members of the Central Baptist Church congregation, my wife, Gina,  and I have both grown in Christ because of the impact of the church  under the leadership and friendship of Chris and Peggy.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize and thank both Chris and Peggy  for their down-to-earth and positive leadership of this congregation  and for their impact of spreading the good news of Jesus Christ.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over our Nation's  Capitol to honor the lives and legacies of Chris and Peggy Osborne.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country, for our military men and women who protect us, and for our  first responders who keep us safe at home.   Recognizing the 140th Anniversary of The Association of Former Students                          of Texas A&M University     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the recent 140th  anniversary of The Association of Former Students of Texas A&M  University.   The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, now known as Texas  A&M University, was founded as a land-grant college by the State of  Texas in 1871, pursuant to the Morrill Act. The college was the first  public institution of higher education in Texas and started classes on  October 4, 1876.   On June 26, 1879, with the Agricultural and Mechanical College of  Texas still in its infancy, 11 former cadets hosted a reception in  Houston, initiating the first formal organization of A&M former  students. The persons at that meeting included:   William Sleeper, class of 1879;   William Trenckmann, class of 1878;   Pinckey Downs, class of 1879;   Edward Fitzhugh, class of 1879;   Edward Cushing, class of 1880;   George Hardy, class of 1879;   David Alexander, class of 1879;   William Small, class of 1882;   Robert Chatham, class of 1877;   William Brown, class of 1882; and   Thomas Fuller, class of 1881.   It was decided at that first meeting to endeavor to keep a record of  all  [[Page H173]]  former cadets who attended the A&M College of Texas, thus promoting and  maintaining fellowship. The Ex-Cadets Association was reorganized to  form the Alumni Association in 1888.   Developing throughout the years in tandem with the Alpha Phi  Fraternity, which was founded in the 1890s and included former students  who had not graduated, a coalition was formed in 1919 to formally  reorganize and adopt the name The Association of Former Students.   This name was written into the charter granted by the State of Texas  in 1925. In this charter, the association committed to ``support of  benevolent, charitable, and educational undertakings by extending  financial and other aid to students at Texas A&M by promoting social,  literary, and scientific pursuits; by perpetuating and strengthening  the ties of affection and esteem formed in university or college days;  by promoting the interests and welfare of Texas A&M University and  education generally in the State of Texas.''   Since its first day of class over 143 years ago, with six professors  and 40 students, the university has grown to become one of the largest  Tier 1 research and education institutions in the United States, with  almost 70,000 students, thousands of faculty and staff, and close to a  billion dollars of annual research activity.                                time  1245    Through its existence, the Association of Former Students has  continued to grow rapidly. Today it serves more than 508,000 former  students of Texas A&M University and generates an impact of almost $14  million annually for university support through scholarships, student  activities, and long-revered traditions, such as the Aggie Ring  Program.   As the university has grown and developed, the Aggie Network--as the  organization is commonly referred to today--has evolved but has always  maintained its core values and commitments to the university, its  current students and its former students. Together, the association and  the university collaborate to maintain six core values of: loyalty,  integrity, excellence, leadership, selfless service, and respect. These  are the core values that unite all Texas A&M students and by which all  Aggies strive to live.   As former chairman of the board of the Association of Former Students  during 2007, I am honored and humbled to be able to recognize the  accomplishments of the organization over the past 140 years. The Aggie  Network is truly the glue that unites our current students, former  students, and our responsibilities to live our core values every day.   Mr. Speaker, in recognition of the recent 140th anniversary of the  Association of Former Students of Texas A&M University, I applaud the  organization's ongoing commitment to all Texas Aggies and to the core  values of our beloved institution.   I have requested that the United States flag be flown over our  Nation's Capitol to honor the 140 years of legacy and the impact of the  worldwide Aggie Network.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue to pray for our  country, for our military men and women who keep us safe, and for our  first responders who protect us at home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
