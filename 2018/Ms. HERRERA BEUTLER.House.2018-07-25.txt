 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a co-chair of the  Congressional Cut Flower Caucus to recognize July as the American Grown  Flower Month.   During the month of July, every State is in the season of harvesting  a wide variety of beautiful flowers and blooms. This makes July the  perfect month to celebrate America's flower farms in all 50 States and,  specifically, Holland America Flower Gardens, located in my district.   Holland America Flower Gardens in Woodland, Washington, is owned and  operated by four generations of Dobbe family members. Their expertise  in flower bulbs allows for the harvesting of several specialty crops,  such as lilies, freesias, peonies, and tulips. Most important, all of  their vibrant cut flowers are American grown.   As a cosponsor of H. Res. 413, I support the designation of July as  American Grown Flower Month and support America's flower farmers that  range in size and economic production, but make up an ever-growing  floriculture industry. Flowers grown in the United States create almost  $42 million in economic impact daily and support hundreds of growers,  thousands of small businesses, and tens of thousands of jobs in the  United States.   In addition to the important economic impact, this industry also has  a huge cultural impact.                            ____________________
