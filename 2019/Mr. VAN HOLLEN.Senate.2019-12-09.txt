 Mr. President, on Friday, December 31, 2019,  Julliane Frazier, a lifelong resident of Maryland, will retire from  Amtrak after an extraordinary 40 years of service.   Julie joined Amtrak in December 1980 when President Jimmy Carter was  just leaving the White House and Ronald Reagan was about to be sworn  in. In May of the following year, Amtrak celebrated its 10th  anniversary. The number of current Amtrak employees with 40 or more  years of service is fewer than 20; the number of retirees is not much  more. Julie therefore joins a small but elite group of Amtrak employees  who have been the founders and builders of America's passenger  railroad.   Over the years, Julie has seen the growth and maturity of an  organization whose existence was born of great uncertainty. For most of  her career, she served as the senior executive assistant for the  Government Affairs Department, serving and assisting the vice  presidents who guided and managed Amtrak's relations with the Federal  Government and with Congress. Amtrak's CEOs, who worked in their Union  Station offices next door to government affairs, often relied on Julie  as well because she was quick to complete assignments and was loyal to  her colleagues in pursuit of Amtrak's important mission. While it would  appear at first blush that the vice president of government affairs  runs the office, it was clear to anyone who spent time there that Julie  was really the one in charge. She is the consummate professional.   Julie has said that while she will miss the pace of work, she will  miss the people she worked with most of all. Having spent 40 years in  the organization and having celebrated good times while coping with  hard times, Julie formed many close and deep friendships. She will be  truly missed by all who worked with her, but her service will be  appreciated for years to come.   I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Julliane Frazier for her  service and wishing her many happy and healthy years in retirement with  her husband Phil and her sons Zack, Max, and Austin.                            ____________________
