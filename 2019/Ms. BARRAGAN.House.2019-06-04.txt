 Mr. Speaker, this week I have the honor of travelling  to the beaches of Normandy, France, along with a congressional  delegation to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day on the exact  site where over 2,500 brave Americans were to, in the words of Abraham  Lincoln, give their last full measure of devotion.   Several among those fallen were some of the nearly 500,000 Latino  soldiers who served in World War II. By the end of that war, 17 Mexican  Americans received the Congressional Medal of Honor, a source of great  pride for the Latino community and a legacy of honor that has continued  throughout modern history, which now counts 60 Medals of Honor awarded  to soldiers of Hispanic heritage.                                time  1015    Among the military units with Hispanic representation that  participated in the D-Day invasion was the U.S. Army 79th Infantry  Division, which landed at Utah Beach.   The D-Day forces included men like Nick Alvarez from California, who  led a tank crew that broke through the German defenses that day,  helping to put the Allies on the offensive and, ultimately, helped lead  to the fall of Nazi Germany.   Those D-Day forces also included Private Andrew Ortega from Anaheim,  California, who was one of the very first Americans to land on Omaha  Beach as part of a team of engineers tasked with finding and  neutralizing land mines ahead of the infantrymen taking part in the  assault. Under relentless fire from German guns, Private Ortega  searched for and defused land mines no bigger than eggs. His heroic  efforts in the face of horrific danger no doubt saved countless  American lives.   As we make ready to honor all the troops participating in the D-Day  invasion, I would like to make special mention of Private Louis Martin,  who was a resident of my home district in Wilmington, California, and  who is pictured here in this photo provided by his family.   Private Martin was born in Deming, New Mexico, in 1914, and moved to  Wilmington as a young adult. By the time  [[Page H4223]]  Louis was drafted into the Army, he was married and had a 2-year-old  daughter.   Louis was a member of the U.S. Army 1st Infantry Division, which  landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day. It was there, on the sands of that  beach 75 years ago, that Private Martin gave his life, for the freedom  of his family, his countrymen, and for future generations of Americans.  We, as a nation, are forever indebted to him, and it gives me great  pride to have him remembered here today.   I thank those who have served, and I extend my deepest condolences to  Private Martin's family and friends. I thank Private Martin and all  members of the Armed Forces who so bravely fought and so gallantly  sacrificed their lives in the service of our Nation during the D-Day  invasion.   It is with the greatest appreciation for their courage,  determination, and fierce belief in this Nation, for which it stands,  that I pay tribute to these fallen soldiers today. It is in their honor  that I pledge to endeavor within this body to strive ever harder to  fulfill the promise of this Nation proposed by our Founders and paid  for with the blood of soldiers like those who fell 75 years ago on the  sands of Normandy.                            ____________________
