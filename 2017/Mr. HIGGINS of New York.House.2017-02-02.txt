 Mr. Speaker, as the Nation recognizes Black  History Month, I rise to pay tribute to a special history in my western  New York community.   This Friday marks the 100th anniversary of the opening of Buffalo's  historic Colored Musicians Club. The club's origin stretches back to  1917 when a group of African American musicians sought to create its  own safe haven in a then-segregated community. They banded together,  organized, and started Local 533 of the American Federation of  Musicians.   Some of the world's most prolific jazz musicians have performed at  the club. The likes of Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, and Ella  Fitzgerald all impressed crowds in the building near the corner of  Broadway and Michigan. Through the years, the Colored Musicians Club  has become an important community and cultural center, featuring a  museum to educate new generations of the club's key role in Buffalo and  our country's history.   As this landmark celebrates a century of work, we support its  continued success and celebrate the example it sets in advancing the  coming together of community and culture.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J.  Res. 40 with a message, and that is: Do not repeal this rule.   The Social Security Administration rule is intended to promote and to  preserve the integrity of gun ownership in America.   I have heard it said by gun owner advocates that a steady hand is the  best gun control. I believe that, but a steady hand requires a  rationale mind.   The Social Security Administration rule that my colleagues on the  other side want to eliminate is written carefully and narrowly,  affecting a very small group of people with a very severe, long-term  mental disorder that makes them unable to do any kind of work in the  U.S. economy, even part-time or with very low wages and, also, people  not mentally capable of managing their own benefits.   The Social Security Administration rule ensures that individuals, who  are already prohibited from having guns under existing Federal law,  have their names included on the National Instant Criminal Background  Check System.   Mr. Speaker, 93 percent of Americans support background checks and  believe that systems should be in place to ensure that guns are not in  the hands of individuals who have been determined already by Federal  law to be unable to use them safely.   I urge my colleagues to reject H.J. Res. 40.
