 Mr. President, I rise to speak about the mass murder  in Florida this month, and I rise to ask a simple question that  millions of Americans in every part of this country are asking at their  kitchen tables right now: Is Congress finally going to do anything  meaningful about gun violence? When will enough be enough? What will it  take for this body to move beyond the same talking points that we hear  after every mass shooting and actually do something to prevent more  deaths? Will Congress finally see what the vast majority of Americans  see--gun owners and non-gun owners alike--that America's gun problem  isn't going away unless Congress musters up the courage to take it  head-on, or will Congress continue to give the lipservice of thoughts  and prayers and then do absolutely nothing?   We have to act because once again there was a massacre on American  soil. Once again it was inside a school. Once again American children  were gunned down. We keep living through a nightmare of gun violence  that repeats itself in schools, movie theaters, churches, nightclubs,  concerts, and every single day on the streets of cities in every State  around this country--Sandy Hook, Aurora, Charleston, San Bernardino,  Orlando, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, and most recently, Parkland,  FL.   We can help stop this. We have the power to help stop this. The  question is whether Congress has the political will to do it, whether  this institution will finally put families first, our children first,  and stand up to the gun manufacturers and the NRA.   I urge every Member of Congress to reflect on why they first ran for  office. We are here as public servants to serve the people who sent us  here, not to serve the gun industry's profits, not to serve the  organizations and companies and lobbyists who demand political  retribution when we do the morally right thing. Does Congress have the  will to act? Does Congress have the basic courage this country needs? I  am sorry to say, I don't know, but we can put it to the test.    There has been a lot of talk--more than normal even--about our need  to act in this Chamber. So I will say this to my colleagues: Let's make  this time different. Let's listen to the children from Stoneman Douglas  High School. Let's seize this moment. Let's take action.   I implore my colleagues to listen to what the country is saying about  gun violence today, listen to the families, listen to the survivors  from Parkland and tune out all the other noise. I did. It is possible.   Ten years ago, I had an A rating from the NRA, just like many of my  colleagues today, but then I met the mother of Nyasia Pryear-Yard. Then  I met her classmates. Nyasia was an honor student from Brooklyn. She  was dancing with her friends, having fun, loving life. She was killed  by a stray bullet in her community. Now I have an F rating from the  NRA.   I don't understand how, after meeting with all of these families,  after meeting with all of these children whose lives have been  destroyed and torn apart by gun violence--I don't understand how any  public servant would not vow to do what is necessary to make sure it  never happens again.   It is what we do after a terrorist attack, rightfully so. It is what  we do as a country. We come together. We say never again, and we do  whatever it takes to protect our country. We have to have the very same  sense of urgency now.   Plain and simple, it is a lie to say we have to choose between  protecting law-abiding gun owners' rights and protecting our children  from being murdered by assault rifles. It is a false choice to say we  cannot end gun violence without violating people's constitutional  rights. It is time for Members of Congress to stand up for what is  right for America and do what is right for our communities, and say no  to the NRA.   I commend one of our colleagues in the House of Representatives--a  Republican from Florida and an Army veteran--who is seeing this crisis  differently now too. He wrote:         I know that my community, our schools, and public gathering       places, are not made safer by any person having access to the       best killing tool the Army could put in my hands. I cannot       support the primary weapon I used to defend our people, being       used to kill children I swore to defend.    That is what leadership looks like.   I implore my colleagues in the Senate to see our gun violence problem  differently. See it with your heart. See it for what it is. It is a  matter of national security, of public health, of public safety that  will never go away unless Congress does its job.   So, once and for all, let's pass laws that actually are meaningful,  that actually can do something, not just something simple so we can say  we did something and move on. I strongly agree with my colleagues that  we need to improve the mental health system. Let's make those  investments, but it should not stop there.   We have to address the fact that we have weapons of war on our  streets today. We have to address the fact that it is so easy for  people to buy a gun--people who should never have that privilege. Let's  vote to ban semiautomatic assault rifles.   Congress has already banned fully automatic weapons. Congress has  already recognized that some weapons have no place in the civilian  world, and a weapon of war that was designed for military use, that can  fire up to 100 rounds in 1 minute or 100 rounds if you just add a bump  stock, a weapon that can completely outgun a police officer has no  place in the civilian world.   Will my colleagues vote with me to ban semiautomatic assault rifles?   Then, let's vote to ban the high-capacity magazines that go with  them. They are made for wars; they are not made to be in our schools,  not in our cities. High-capacity magazines let killers fire dozens of  rounds without having to frequently stop and reload. They are designed  to let someone fire bullets at as many people as possible in the  shortest amount of time.   Let's vote to ban high-capacity magazines, and let's vote to pass  universal background checks. That is something that is so commonsense,  so obvious. Too many people who should not get their hands on these  weapons are easily able to get them, and there are so many loopholes  that allow people to buy semiautomatic assault rifles online, where  there are no background checks. They allow people to buy semiautomatic  assault rifles at gun shows, where there are no background checks.   It simply doesn't make sense that every person who buys a firearm  doesn't go through a basic background check system. Do you know who  agrees with that? Ninety-seven percent of the American people. I can't  think of any other issue where there is such near-universal agreement  across our entire population.   So let's do what our constituents are demanding from us--not what the  NRA is demanding from us--and vote to pass universal background checks.  When we do it, let's make sure the effort is actually sincere. If we  are only voting on universal background checks, when it is tied to the  issue of concealed carry reciprocity, then that is not a sincere  attempt to fix our broken background check system. If Congress is  saying we will only pass universal background checks if we pass a new  law that says a stranger from one State has to be allowed into my State  or your State when he has a gun hidden under his jacket, that is an  insult to 97 percent of the American people who want Congress to pass  universal background checks now.   Then, let's finally vote to overturn the outrageous law that has  banned the Centers for Disease Control from even studying the issue of  gun deaths. The CDC can study any other cause of death--heart disease,  cancer, car crashes, plane crashes--unless it involves a gun. Don't you  think it is strange that when we debate this issue, the two  [[Page S1303]]  things related to gun violence that Congress has actually banned in  recent years are research--research on gun violence--and a ban on the  ATF from using computers to keep records? Let's vote to allow the CDC  to conduct research on gun violence so we can finally have the  information and the data we need to fight gun violence as effectively  as possible.    Let's also pass a law that finally makes gun trafficking a Federal  crime. Over and over again, law enforcement officers keep finding  illegally obtained guns being used in crimes. Numerous NYPD officers  have been killed by guns that were illegally obtained by criminals, and  there is literally no Federal law to stop someone from loading his  truck with guns in Georgia, driving up I-95, and selling them in a  parking lot in the Bronx directly to criminals and gang members.   I have a bill that would make this illegal. It is called the Hadiya  Pendleton and Nyasia Pryear-Yard Gun Trafficking and Crime Prevention  Act. It is bipartisan, because both parties agree that gun trafficking  is a source of gun violence in our cities.   This bill is named after Nyasia, whom I mentioned earlier, and  another teenager from Chicago who was also killed by a stray bullet.  Both guns in those crimes were trafficked. So let's pass this bill and  finally make gun trafficking a Federal crime.   If we are not trying to solve this problem now, then we are failing  as elected leaders. Congress must solve America's gun violence crisis  now. It is urgent. Our country is demanding it. Americans deserve more  from Congress than just banning bump stocks, just fixing NICS, which,  while I strongly support both of them, will not do enough on their own.  So let us not fail our country again.   I would like to ask our colleagues to immediately vote to ban  semiautomatic assault rifles and bump stocks, to pass a universal  background check system and close all of the loopholes, to allow the  CDC to research gun violence as a cause of death, to close the gun show  loophole, and to finally make gun trafficking a Federal crime.   I yield the floor.
