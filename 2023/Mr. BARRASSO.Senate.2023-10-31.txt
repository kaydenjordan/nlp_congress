 Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 30th  anniversary of Wyoming Women in Agriculture. This organization is  paving the way for a better future for all Wyoming ranchers.   Ranchers Sharon Cardwell and Peggy Price of Alcova, WY, had a casual  conversation in 1993. They decided female ranchers needed an  organization that addressed their distinct challenges. The role of  women in ranching has changed over the years. Women are now actively  involved in integral management decisions, either as independent  ranchers or with their husbands. They are often isolated, far from the  closest town or another ranch. Sharon and Peggy founded Wyoming Women  in Ag to bring together a community of like-minded women. They were  assisted by Jerry Buk and Debbie Johnson, both employees with the  University of Wyoming extension office in Casper. The first board for  Wyoming Women in Ag included Chairman Sharon Cardwell, Vice Chairman  Peggy Price, Treasurer Anne Miles, and Secretary Ruth Stevenson.   In 1998, Wyoming Women in Ag was established with official nonprofit  status. They are an ``organization that provides information on current  topics important to women in the agriculture industry.'' They soon  branched out from Natrona County and included women from all over the  Cowboy State. Wyoming Women in Ag will celebrate their 30th anniversary  at their 2023 Symposium and Diversity Tour in Worland, WY. This annual  event brings women together who share a similar way of life. The event  location rotates between counties and includes a speaker who is a  featured industry professional. Women have the opportunity to connect  with their fellow ranchers to ``ensure the next generation of women are  educated, encouraged, and empowered to take on the challenges of  meeting the world's growing food, fuel, and fiber needs.'' Attendees  participate in a variety of workshops and have access to a trade show.  The 2023 Women in Ag committee members are Abbi Rodgers, president;  Julie Volker, vice president; Stacey Schmid, Secretary; Traci Faxon,  Secretary; Angela Grant, Treasurer; and committee members Madison  Trimble, Heidi Foy, and Caitlin Youngquist.   It is an honor for me to rise in recognition of this significant  milestone. Bobbi joins me in extending our congratulations to Wyoming  Women in Agriculture for their 30th anniversary.                            ____________________
