 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the life of  Hinckley Township Trustee Ray Schulte.   Serving our community as a township trustee for 12 years, Ray defined  what it means to be a public servant who always puts the community and  the people he loves first.   In addition to his service on the board, Ray was involved in many  different aspects of the township, in particular, the historical  society, among many others, including local charities. Ray truly loved  his community and  [[Page H393]]  was passionate about making it a better place.   Hinckley Township will certainly miss Ray's leadership, service, and  positive outlook on life, though his work will forever be memorialized  in our community. Ray's leadership will certainly be missed but never  forgotten.   I pray for Ray's wife of 29 years, Emma, who serves as chief deputy  recorder of Medina County and is a constant presence for so many people  in the Medina Courthouse.   May God bless their three children, Michael, Christie, and Adam, and  their four grandchildren during this challenging time. It is truly an  honor to recognize such an individual whose class and love for  community made us all better people.                            ____________________
