 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank  him for his leadership in so many ways in this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Malinowski and Mr. Raskin for bringing  this important resolution to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I come to this floor prayerfully. It is really very sad.  It was interesting to me--and I spoke out about this--that on Sunday in  Catholic Masses, and I don't know beyond that, that the gospel of the  day was the gospel of the Good Samaritan. A person asked Jesus, ``What  do I have to do to enter the kingdom of Heaven?''   And Christ replied, ``Love thy neighbor as thyself. Show mercy.''  That very same day he went on to talk and then he said, ``Well, how do  I do this?''   And Jesus gave him the example of the Good Samaritan. Everyone is  familiar with how a stranger helped another stranger, a foreigner  helped another foreigner, the Good Samaritan. Love thy neighbor as  thyself, show mercy.                                time  1500    On that very same day, coincidentally, ironically, sadly, whatever  adverb you want to use, the President was instituting raids into the  homes of families.   I went to Spanish mass this weekend and saw the dignity of those  families, the beauty of the children, and the fear that the President  had struck in their hearts, as we were listening to the Gospel of the  Good Samaritan to show mercy and love thy neighbor as thyself. That  very same day, unfortunately, there were those who were not informed by  that Gospel.   So here we are later in that day, it was stunning to hear the words  that were used, go home, to some of our colleagues, the same words that  were used to so many people in our country whether because they weren't  born here or because they didn't look like some others here: Go home.   As annoyed and as insulted as we all should be about the President  saying that about our colleagues, it is also not showing mercy for him  to say that about so many people in our country, as he wants to split  up families.   So, Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Malinowski and Mr. Raskin for the  opportunity to speak to the statements that the President made later in  the day of the Gospel of the Good Samaritan: Mr. Malinowski, who was  born abroad; Mr. Raskin for his firm leadership in advancing this  important resolution.   The House hopefully has come together standing as one to denounce the  White House's xenophobic attacks on our Members, on our people, and to  defend the values of America.   And what is America? America is many things: the land of a great  Constitution, which is under threat; a beautiful land that God has  given us, which is being degraded; values that we share that are being  undermined. But America is also a Nation largely, but not totally,  largely of immigrants.   As this resolution so beautifully states, `` . . . the Founders  conceived America as a haven for refuge for people fleeing from  religious and political persecution, and Thomas Jefferson, Alexander  Hamilton, and James Madison all emphasized that the Nation gained as it  attracted new people in search of freedom and livelihood for their  families.''   The resolution quotes our most iconic Presidents, who all recognized  that immigrants are the constant reinvigoration of America, of hope,  determination, optimism, and courage to make the future better.   Those are American values. Those are American traits: hope, optimism,  courage. Many of these immigrants, when they come here with those  values and those traits, make America more American.   Franklin Roosevelt said: ``Remember always that all of us, and you  and I especially, are descended from immigrants.''   President John F. Kennedy wrote that: ``The contribution of  immigrants can be seen in every aspect of our national life.''   President Ronald Reagan so beautifully in his last speech as  President of the United States, which is quoted in this resolution,  said: ``If we ever closed the door to new Americans, our leadership in  the world would soon be lost.''   Yet, the President's comments about our colleagues this weekend  showed that he does not share those American values. These comments  from the White House are disgraceful and disgusting, and the comments  are racist. How shameful to hear him continue to defend those offensive  words, words that we have all heard him repeat not only about our  Members, but about countless others.   Our caucus will continue to forcefully respond to those attacks on  our Members, which reflect a fundamental disrespect for the beautiful  diversity of America. There is no place anywhere for the President's  words, which are not only divisive, but dangerous, and have legitimized  and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.   It is so sad, because you would think that there would be a given  that we would universally in this body just say, of course. And there  is no excuse for any response to those words but a swift and strong,  unified condemnation.   Every single Member of this institution, Democratic and Republican,  should join us in condemning the President's racist tweets. To do  anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a  shameful abdication of our oath of office.    To protect the American people, I urge a unanimous vote.
