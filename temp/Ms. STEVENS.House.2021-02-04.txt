 Madam Speaker, I thank you so much for your dedication  to this body and your oversight this evening. I thank all of the very  hardworking professionals who help to run the floor of the House. I am  so pleased to be back on the floor of the House of Representatives this  day, February 4.   Some on the outside project fair criticism, question, demand, want of  us. Some may look at us even with a frustrated or loathing eye. We all  know how often we hear the statistic about how popular Congress is.  What pours in here through money, outside influence, the money that  circles around this building.   And when we walk onto this floor of the House of Representatives,  though, we are all but just Members. We are representatives of our  constituents, carrying a voting card, carrying a voice, representing  the values, the determinations, the wishes and the wants of our  district, and forced to come together to make a determination.   We ask ourselves: What do we demand of this institution?    I had the privilege of being here this evening as we have seen a long  debate, a long time of Special Orders ensue, those who reflected on the  events of January 6, the horrible insurrection that took place, the  desecration of this institution, this pride and joy of the United  States of America, both the House and the Senate momentarily taken  over. And I join my colleagues in those reflections.   We saw the other side of the aisle reflect on energy needs, energy  resource needs. We also saw some contributions made to constituents  back at home.   Tonight, as you look out to the Capitol--and we know this--it is not  a full Chamber right now. These are obviously also different times,  Madam Speaker. We don't have many outside guests walking through the  Congress due to the pandemic. But everyone is allowed to look at the  Capitol and see the lantern, see the tholus that supports the Statue of  Freedom, that supports Lady Freedom. That lantern is lit right now.   And what is that lantern saying?   That democracy rings out, that freedom rings out, that our future is  still within our grasp.   I am proud and grateful to be here tonight, Madam Speaker. I know  that the time is not always a given. We certainly recognize that in the  midst of this pandemic. We reflect just a month in to this 117th  session of Congress. I am very excited about this 117th session of  Congress because it is new. It is a new session.   And what do we get with new?   A month ago, January 4, the day after the swearing-in of the new  Congress, we passed our rules package, we had procedural votes. I am  very proud to say I introduced my first bill of the Congress, the  Resilient Manufacturing Task Force Act, a bipartisan bill, focused on  our domestic supply chain needs to ensure that we can withstand future  disruptions, that we can continue to test our system, that we can bring  together the best and brightest of America to get in front of  challenges and create jobs and continue to create jobs.   I come from Michigan, and I am really proud of coming from Michigan  and I am proud of what Michigan's story is, particularly coming out of  the year 2020, and what that means with regard to the first bill I  introduced in the 117th Congress, our manufacturing economy, our  innovation capabilities.   We have continued to monitor this economy. We are seeing some  ricochets, some growth in areas we weren't expecting, some job loss.  Michigan's at about a 7.5 percent unemployment. We are going to build  it back better. We are going to get people back to work with good wages  and good benefits and a dignity for what they do. You see that in  manufacturing, when people work with their hands, when they produce,  when they are part of an outcome and a productivity. And it is really  very exciting to see that Michigan will continue to be a leader.   It must be recognized, our leadership, because when those supply  chain disruptions hit almost a year ago, when we saw the PPE shortages  in our hospitals, in our healthcare system for the individual American  who was going to the grocery store looking for some hand sanitizer or a  roll of paper towels, it was the Michigan manufacturers who stood up  immediately to rework their supply chains, to rework their production  channels, to source that PPE, from the big three--from Ford, Chrysler,  GM--on down the supply chain. And it was absolutely amazing, and it was  union workers to boot.   And then the great innovation of America, the story that will also be  heralded and seen coming out of this pandemic was the creation of a  proven and tested vaccine that we invested in immediately. My  colleagues and I will reflect on that, that the first thing we did as a  body together, all of Congress, everyone who gets to stand in this body  voted to fund the research for the vaccine, the very beginning of  March. And we got that vaccine, and it got produced in a place called  Portage, Michigan. As the year began to reach its conclusion, the  trucks filled with that vaccine, and it started to get in the arms of  the people who were counting on it. Absolutely miraculous. So unique to  the place that I am privileged to call home.   As we reflected in 2019, on the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing,  the question I would ask my colleagues is: What is our moonshot of the  next 50 years?   We certainly met one in the year 2020, yet we haven't stopped  continuing to innovate. We haven't stopped continuing to keep our eyes  on a future that we are inheriting and that our next generation is  inheriting.   I am optimistic about this next generation. I am optimistic about  what they represent and about my opportunity to engage and to listen to  the students of America and to advocate for them from the Halls of  Congress. It is why I proudly sit on the Education and Labor Committee.   President John Kennedy said: ``To govern is to choose.''   To govern is to choose. And we make those choices. See, I don't get  to issue proclamations instead of voting. I take a vote. I come down,  ``yes'' or ``no.''   Which way do we decide to come down as a nation?   Are we going to agree as a people with one another every step of the  way?  [[Page H376]]    Absolutely not.                                time  2145    No union is perfect in that regard. But what makes and builds toward  a more perfect Union, as our Founders compelled, and as we compel each  other, is the constant dedication to doing the work, to standing up for  people, to calling out truth and what is right.   I certainly am not shy of doing that, Madam Speaker, and I know that  that was important for us at the beginning of the pandemic to listen to  the science, to recognize the threat and to take its seriously, and to  also be resilient. And I see that resilience all around my district,  Madam Speaker.   And I continue to be compelled to the constituents of the 11th  District, to the falling COVID rates in Michigan. We continue to pay  tribute and to recognize those who are suffering, those who are  struggling from COVID-19, families who are separated from one another  as an individual is getting their treatment. We hold them in our  hearts. We think about them and we remain dedicated to the prevention  and the cure and the effort to end this pandemic.   I am so excited to welcome President Joe Biden to the White House. We  were here for his inauguration. We were here to hear his remarks. His  invitation for unity and unity by way of delivering; unity by way of  delivering for the American people; the Buy American provisions that  will continue to invest in American manufacturers and using our Federal  dollars to identify new supply chain opportunities for us.   I see this all over my district, from Northville up to Troy and  Auburn Hills, what people are working on and how we can help them to  continue to do that.   Madam Speaker, I thank you for the time tonight and I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
