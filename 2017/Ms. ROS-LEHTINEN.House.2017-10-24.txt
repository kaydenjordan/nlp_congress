 Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight the 2017  Miami Walk to End Alzheimer's that will take place at Museum Park in  downtown Miami on Saturday, November 4.   Alzheimer's is a devastating disease that impacts over 54,000 seniors  in my county of Miami Dade and more than 500,000 individuals across the  Sunshine State. It is not just the patients who suffer. Family members  and caregivers also bear the brunt of this tragic and emotionally  draining disease.   I know this personally, having lost my mother due to complications  from Alzheimer's 6 years ago. The Miami Walk to End Alzheimer's plays  an essential role in helping advance Alzheimer's care and research in  our community and across our Nation.   This wonderful event is also important to patients, families, and  caregivers as a reminder that they have the full support of our  community as they battle this terrible disease.   I encourage everyone in our south Florida community to come out on  November 4 and support and raise awareness for Alzheimer's.                            ____________________
