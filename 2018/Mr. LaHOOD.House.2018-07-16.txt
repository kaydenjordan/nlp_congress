 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, French Hill,  for organizing tonight's Special Order on trade. I want to associate my  thoughts tonight with the comments made by Congressman Davidson and  also with Congressman French Hill.   Mr. Speaker, I would just start off and say that it is imperative  that we, as Members of Congress, come together to stress to the  President and his administration the importance of free trade.   When I look back over the last year and a half of his administration,  I applaud the President and his leadership in working with us to roll  back regulation, have reasonable regulation in place, and also once-in- a-lifetime tax reform that he was able to get passed, along with this  Congress, two accomplishments that have jump-started our stagnant  economy, and we are seeing the results.   However, I think we do ourselves a real disservice to the work that  we have already done on this economy by engaging in a trade war. I  think we go backwards in terms of the economic progress that we are  making to get in a long-term trade war.   Mr. Davidson referenced it a little, but it is frustrating and  disappointing to see several staff members with the President who are  unelected and unconfirmed who are trade protectionists. They have the  ear of the President when it comes to implementing trade policy, and  that is, again, frustrating. These protectionists are failing to take  the time and recognize the long-term costs of the recent tariff actions  and our current position as it comes to renegotiating NAFTA and other  trade agreements on our economy.   I have said this many times before when I think back to the election.  Our President wasn't elected by people on the East Coast or the West  Coast. It was people in the Midwest, people from rural America, people  from the South who helped elect him. And, unfortunately, these are the  folks who are left the worst off by these trade policies that are being  put in place currently by the administration.   As we move forward in this Congress, we need to carefully examine how  much authority the legislative branch has ceded over time to the  executive branch. I credit my colleague, Warren Davidson, for  introducing a piece of legislation that I am a cosponsor of that would  help take back a little of that authority under our Constitution, to  have more input from Congress on that. We need to talk more about that,  managing our trade policies to determine how best to restore our  constitutional authority. Our other colleague, Congressman Gallagher of  Wisconsin, has also introduced a piece of legislation that also does  the same thing.   We have no choice or alternative with the current world that we live  in. We live in a globalized world with supply chains set and  marketplaces and customers continuing to grow, but we need to be  engaged. Given that 95 percent of the world's customers live outside of  the United States, we tend to forget that we represent about 4.5  percent of the world's population.   There is no doubt that we produce the best goods; we produce the best  products; we have the best workers. But you have got to have markets.  You  [[Page H6248]]  have got to have customers around the world for those products to go to  support free and fair trade.   I think about Illinois. Illinois is the sixth largest State in the  country. Ag is the number one industry in the State of Illinois. It is  the number one in my district. When I think about Illinois, for  example, global trade supports over 1,700,000 jobs in Illinois.  Ensuring that our manufacturers and farmers have access to markets  around the world to sell their goods is vital to their ability to  remain competitive and our economic success.   The district that I represent, Illinois' 18th Congressional District,  spans central and west central Illinois. We are proud to be home to  some of the world's most respected manufacturers, including companies  like John Deere, Caterpillar, and CNH.   We are also home to some of the world's most fertile farmland. We  have the eighth largest district in the country in terms of corn and  soybean production in the country. About 40 percent of the corn and  soybeans grown in my district go somewhere else around the world.  They get put on barges on the Illinois and Mississippi River, go down  that river through New Orleans, through the Gulf, through the new  Panama Canal, and go anywhere around the world.    But when you put up tariffs and barriers, you restrict those farmers  from getting their goods all across the world. Unfortunately, these  days, manufacturing and agriculture communities like mine across the  country face uncertainty and dark days ahead. That is because of our  current trade policy.   While I applaud the President's intent to go after bad actors in the  global marketplace, his approach and the resulting retaliation has put  our American workers and products in jeopardy, with no end in sight.  The administration's reckless and frequent use of tariffs, some  premised on national security, which I think is a fallacy, threaten to  spark an all-out trade war in this country and around the world.   We have already seen retaliation on American-made products from some  of our closest allies like Canada, Mexico, and the EU. In addition,  China, which consumes a third of the world's soybeans, has also  followed suit.   In Illinois, total State exports threatened by new tariffs have  reached over $3.8 million. Instead of tariffs, which are simply taxes  passed on to consumers, our approach to address unfair trading  practices should be targeted to minimize collateral damage and should  include specific and clear end goals, which we have not seen.   Bottom line, we must pursue targeted trade enforcement policies that  minimize harm to American farmers, our rural communities, and our  manufacturers.                                time  1945    We know that our agriculture industry is typically first and hardest  hit by any trade retaliation. To make things worse, our farmers are  already at a disadvantage compared to other foreign competitors given  the lack of free trade agreements that the U.S. has compared to other  countries, especially in the Asian markets. It was referenced earlier  that TPP which, of course, is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, is going  on without us.   I look back at this administration. There was a lot of talk when they  came in about bilateral trade agreements. We are 19 months into this  administration, and we don't have one--not one--bilateral trade  agreement. There was a lot of talk about putting those in place.   Part of the reason we have not had that is they have run from us  because of our position and what we have asked for in those bilateral  trade agreements.   The loss of marketplace due to tariffs will be extremely hard to  regain and may not be possible to regain at all.   The administration's go at it alone approach is clearly not as  effective as with working with our allies to negotiate a solution to  global oversupply and technology theft perpetrated by countries like  China, and there is no doubt they have done that. The forced technology  transfers and the stealing of our technology should be addressed. But  there are better ways to do that in a strategic and a precise way,  partnering with our allies to do that, but we can't do that going at it  alone, and we can't do it premised on national security.   Lastly, let me just say that we have heard a lot about surpluses. We  have heard a lot about trade deficits. It seems like the administration  is fixated on trade deficits.   I will tell you, in agriculture we have a trade surplus with every  country in the world. Think about the collateral damage that is going  to be done to those farmers and those ag products by engaging in a  trade war. We do need to address the trade deficit, but it is a  complicated, nuanced issue that we ought to address.   There are lots of things we can do to change that instead of the path  we are heading down right now.   At the end of the day, our farmers want trade, not aid. In a free  market system, it shouldn't be based on subsidies or aid. So we need  to, again, continue to work with this administration on our proper  oversight, taking back some of our constitutional authority to make  sure that we are getting the message across that we need to have free  and open trade that is going to benefit our farmers, our manufacturers,  and working people all across this country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hill.   The gentleman laid out four different objectives which I think are  very pertinent. The gentleman mentioned state-owned enterprises. I  think about that in China, and I think about how in many ways they have  cheated the system and done things, but this is a problem that has been  going on for a long time.   One of the requirements with any trade agreement is you have to have  enforcement. I don't think we have had proper enforcement like we need  when it comes to a number of these initiatives we have had over a  series of 20, 25 years. But enforcement is important.   That means law enforcement. It means getting the Department of  Justice involved holding bad actors accountable. But I think you have  more  [[Page H6250]]  ability to do that and more leverage if you partner with the E.U., you  partner with Japan, you partner with our other allies to do that. We  simply haven't done that.   I think, again, going at it alone is not the right approach to take.   Are there things we ought to be working on to change?   Of course. There are rules we should change. We should engage on a  number of these issues. We should hold a number of the bad actors  accountable. But disengaging, putting up tariffs, and putting up  barriers are the frustrating parts to me because I have not seen what  is the ultimate goal with this strategy.   What is the endgame?   How do we land this plane eventually?   That is what is frustrating to me. What I try to explain to my  farmers and my manufacturers in the district is: How does this all end?   I have worked with the White House on a number of issues and been a  strong ally with them, but there is clearly a division in the White  House. You have the protectionist wing and you have the free-trader  wing.                                time  2000    There are many good people who have talked about the importance of  free trade--Secretary Perdue, Ambassador Branstad to China, Secretary  Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow--people who support the free enterprise system,  support trade. Gary Cohn was in that group.   On the other side, you have the more protectionist wing. Again, from  them, we have not seen how this all ends, giving us some confidence  this is going to work out. That is the frustrating part, again, for our  constituency and my farmers and manufacturers moving forward.   We have talked a lot about China and what they have engaged in and  what they have done, whether, again, it is forced technology transfers.  In a lot of ways, what they do with American companies that come over  there or foreign companies is a form of extortion: Give us your  technology, make us a part of it, and then we will let you come into  the country.   Well, we ought to be stronger in going after them. There are  mechanisms and ways, and there are success stories in doing that. But  we pulled out of TPP, and that is something the President ran on.   But what has happened since we pulled out of TPP? All those other  countries have gravitated towards China, Southeast Asia. They have  gravitated towards them without us. So we are left out, being on our  own. I don't think that is good, long term, when we need marketplaces  and we need customers to engage with.   Being isolated is not the right approach to take on this. We need to,  again, engage the White House and particularly try to understand the  path we are on and the end game here moving forward.    Mr. Speaker, on the national security issue and premising  much of this on national security, I didn't serve in the military, but  national security is not something that should be used lightly. So when  I saw that being used by this administration, I went to the experts and  talked to people in our military. I think we saw early on that General  Mattis was interviewed. He didn't think very highly that this was a  national security risk.   Talk to any of our top brass in the military and I don't think you  will find anybody that supports this. I don't think you have seen  anybody in the administration from the military that has come out to  support this as a national security threat, because it is not, in my  view. I think it is a faulty premise to go forth on this. I think,  eventually, when it gets to the WTO, I don't think it is going to stand  up.   I think that, again, gets back to our credibility in going about  this. We have got to be very careful when we put our prestige of the  United States out there and rely on national security when you can't  even find our own defense apparatus and our security folks out there  who think this is a proper basis to do this.   So that concerns me, moving forward, and I think, again, puts us in a  tough position, again, being more isolated and not having other like- minded allies to help us.
