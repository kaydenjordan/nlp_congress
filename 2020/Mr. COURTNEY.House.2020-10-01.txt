 Mr. Speaker, as we stand here on October 1, a few hours  ago the leadership of airline industries all across America announced  very sad news for their workforce. The fact of the matter is that, with  CARES Act money expiring at midnight last night, massive layoffs are  now going to be implemented over the next few days and weeks.   American Airlines and United Airlines, together, about 32,000 workers  are going to be laid off today, this morning. Again, other airlines are  doing exactly the same thing.   The impact, the ripple effect in terms of the collapse of consumer  demand because international air travel is virtually nonexistent,  domestic air travel is way down and it is going to stay down for months  to come, has resulted, again, in a ripple effect in the aerospace  industry.                                time  0930    Raytheon Technologies up in New England, which is the parent company  of Pratt & Whitney, announced 16,000 layoffs, again, because the  commercial airline industry's demand is basically drying up.   Boeing industry announced 16,000 layoffs also because of the same  reason. The commercial sector in terms of airline orders, again, has  completely dried up.   They are not the only sector that are still struggling in this COVID  recession. Talk to any restaurant owner in any district all across  America, talk to anyone who is involved in the tourism destination.   Disney announced 23,000 layoffs on Monday, again, because of the  collapse in visits because of the COVID pandemic.   In Connecticut, we have two large, Native-American casinos, Foxwoods  and Mohegan. They have started partial operations, but still, half  their workforce, again, has not been recalled, again, because it is  just not safe for people to have gatherings in large density.   Tuesday night, the President of the United States, before the  American people, made the claim that: nothing to worry about; we are in  a V-shaped recovery.   Well, tell that to the airline workers. Tell that to the people in  the restaurant and hospitality sector. Tell that to the people in the  tourism sector.   Again, all across America, 780,000 new unemployment claims yesterday  across this country.   We are not in a V-shaped recovery. We have got a lot of businesses  out there working their tails off to get back to work and to get  normalcy back. But the fact of the matter is, as Jerome Powell,  President Trump's own chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has said  repeatedly: Until we get control of COVID, we are not going to have a  sustained economic recovery that is going to bring back the jobs that,  again, we have lost in the millions.   So here we are. We are on the verge, again, of another wave of job  losses in this country. And the question of the day is whether Congress  is going to step up like it did four times previously on a bipartisan  basis to pass COVID relief? The CARES Act being, obviously, the biggest  one back in March, which, again, the American people are desperate for  us to move out on.   A couple of days ago, the Speaker released a package, which for the  first time included a COVID relief extension for airline workers,  which, again, would avoid the bloodbath that is going to happen in  terms of jobs in the next few hours in this country.   Finally, we have seen the Secretary of the Treasury show up here at  the building 130 days after we passed the Heroes Act to have a serious  conversation about getting some COVID relief out there to, again,  stabilize this economy.   We can do this. And I say that because we have done it four times  already acting on a bipartisan basis.   What we have to do, though, is just sort of drop the happy talk about  the fact that this virus, we are on the other side of it, nothing to  worry about, V-shaped recovery.   It is really just almost insulting to the American people to spin  that kind of message out there when people are struggling, having their  unemployment  [[Page H5114]]  benefits run out, their economic impact payments have long since been  spent, they have got rent due, they have got utility bills due. They  want to go back to work, but the fact of the matter is, we are still  not there yet where we can have a sustained economic recovery.   Mr. Speaker, I plead with my colleagues on the other side, who,  again, have whip notices going out to oppose any Heroes 2.0 or anything  like it, to please just think about the success that we did back in  March when we passed the CARES package, which to this day is still  providing some benefit. Those new rapid tests that the President  announced a couple of days ago, which is a wonderful development, was  paid for by the CARES Act, but we need more.   And Jerome Powell has warned us repeatedly since May that the CARES  Act was a great achievement by Congress, but we need to have more  fiscal stimulus until we get past this pandemic.   Again, the clock is now ticking.   And, again, Mr. Speaker, for the sake of all of us and our fellow  citizens, please let's come together and get a COVID relief bill passed  this week.                            ____________________
