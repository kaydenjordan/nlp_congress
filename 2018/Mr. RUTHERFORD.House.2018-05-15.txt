 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of tonight's Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor tonight to host my  colleagues from the great State of Florida to highlight the successes  we have seen since passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   With job growth, wages, and labor participation all up since the  passage of this bill, hardworking Americans and businesses are already  experiencing the many improvements that are the result of these reforms  to our Tax Code.   In its April report, the U.S. Labor Department announced that the  unemployment rate dropped to 3.9 percent, the lowest level we have  seen, Mr. Speaker, in 18 years. The tax cuts and simplification of our  Tax Code that we passed only a few months ago, along with our  President's regulatory reforms and progrowth policies, are creating  jobs and restoring confidence in America's economy.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, we celebrated National Small  Business Week to recognize the importance of small businesses across  the country. Small businesses are the backbone of the economy and  create millions of jobs to help Floridians and Americans pursue a  better future for themselves and for their families.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is working for small businesses. According  to the National Federation of Independent Business, small businesses  are the most optimistic that they have been in nearly three decades.  This is no surprise. The reforms in this bill have dramatically  improved the way that small businesses are treated under the Tax Code,  unleashing hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts.   Just last month, Mr. Speaker, I toured Magellan Transport Logistics,  a service-disabled, veteran-owned logistics company in my hometown of  Jacksonville, Florida. They are adding at least 100 new jobs in the  next 5 years and were able to acquire a new 47,000-square-foot  facility.   During the tour of the facility, we were told by the company's CEO  that this expansion is a direct result of the tax cuts that the  business received from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This is just one  example of the differences that these cuts are making to improve the  way of life for countless Americans in Florida and across the Nation.   I have heard from many small businesses throughout my district who  are thriving unlike never before because of these landmark reforms.   As the Representative of Florida's Fourth District, I am proud to  represent the historic city of St. Augustine. St. Augustine is known  around the world, Mr. Speaker, as the oldest city in America. It is  full of unique family and community-owned businesses, including the St.  Augustine Distillery.   Located in the site of Florida's oldest ice plant, the St. Augustine  Distillery's opening in 2014 marked the first time that spirits have  been distilled and created in northeast Florida since Prohibition.   As a young business facing more than their share of regulatory  challenges, the St. Augustine Distillery was relieved, to say the  least, when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. The  distillery announced shortly after the bill's passage that they would  be using their savings to make further investments in their employees  and increase their equipment and inventory, creating new local jobs and  hiring additional staff to manufacture, market, and sell their  products.   Small businesses are an important part of my community and our  economy, but they aren't the only ones that have been given relief  under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   Mr. Speaker, last September, northeast Florida was devastated by  Hurricane Irma. The storm surge was over 5 feet and dropped more than a  foot of rainfall. Our community saw some of the worst flooding in over  100 years along the St. Johns River, and many areas are only now  recovering.   Because of the Federal tax savings that they received, Tampa  Electric, Florida Power & Light, and Duke Energy Florida all announced  that their customers would not receive a rate increase for power  restoration costs associated with these companies' response to the  hurricane damage. With the money that they would have paid in corporate  income taxes, these companies were able to recover the cost of  restoring power and repairing the damage after Hurricane Irma, which  has spared thousands of Floridians an increase in their energy bill  this year.   Mr. Speaker, these are just a few of the many ways that the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act has already made a difference in the lives of hardworking  men and women in northeast Florida and across the State by allowing  them to keep more of their hard-earned money in their paycheck.   Tonight, we will hear from a number of my fellow Floridians about the  great successes of this bill and helping the lives of Florida families  in our district.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida's First District  (Mr. Gaetz). He a great colleague of mine on the Judiciary Committee  and a defender of a strong, booming economy.    Mr. Speaker, I had the great honor as a sheriff in  Florida representing the Florida Sheriffs Association to work with Matt  Gaetz when he was in the House. I have to tell you, there is no one  that works harder for the State of Florida and this country now that he  is in Congress. I just want to thank him for the hard work. He has  always been a great partner to work with. We had some great successes  there, and then to come up here and actually be part of the first tax  cuts and reform in over some 30-odd years was significant.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from north central Florida's  Third District, Mr. Ted Yoho. He is a small-business owner himself who  understands taxes and the regulatory burden that businesses face.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from  central Florida, Ted Yoho, and I have had those same conversations with  constituents back home. The gentleman is absolutely right. They don't  think it is crumbs. It is very significant in their lives. And I can  tell you, as a freshman, I was very proud to be here at a very historic  moment. And I think this Congress can be very proud  [[Page H3962]]  of what was accomplished through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act because it  is truly impacting on people's lives.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take this time to thank all of my colleagues  from Florida who joined with me this evening to highlight the successes  of this historic tax reform.   Across the Nation and back home in Florida, we have seen the  incredible impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. More than 500 companies  have announced pay raises, bonuses, increased 401(k) contributions, or  even lower utility rates. Direct bonus announcements have reached over  $4 billion across the Nation. Mr. Speaker, that is $4 billion in direct  bonuses to employees all across this Nation. That $4 billion is going  back into our economy and into the hands of hardworking Americans  rather than to the IRS. Folks, this is just the beginning.    Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, and as my good friend from central  Florida said, these are not crumbs. These are loaves of bread for  countless Americans who have been living paycheck to paycheck, unsure  about how they would be able to feed their families. These reforms,  which are the largest in over 30 years, are helping grow small  businesses and breathing life back into the American Dream for so many.   So I want to, again, thank my colleagues from the great State of  Florida for joining me this evening to shine a light on these great  successes for Floridians and for all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
