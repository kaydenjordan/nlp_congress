 Madam Speaker, today, April 23, 2020, I missed roll  call votes 103 and 104.   Had I been present for roll call 103, on Agreeing to H. Res. 938,  Providing for the adoption of the resolution (H. Res. 935) establishing  a Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis as a select  investigative subcommittee of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, I  would have voted ``Yes.''   Had I been present for roll call 104, on Agreeing to the Senate  Amendment to H.R. 266, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care  Enhancement Act, I would have voted ``Yes.''                            ____________________
