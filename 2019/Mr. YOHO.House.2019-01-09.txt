 Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of Law Enforcement  Appreciation Day to show my support and utmost respect for peace  officers across the Nation.   Sadly, last year, we lost over 100 law enforcement officers in the  line of duty. Of that number, three came from my hometown. I am  reminded today of the continued sacrifice these officers make and the  dangers they face day after day and night after night.   It is important that we always show our appreciation for those who  work tirelessly to keep us safe. A lesson could be learned from them on  service. They serve people, communities, and a nation, not political  ideologies.   This selfless service is both physically and mentally demanding on  officers and their families. So, today, we honor not only those who  serve but those who serve alongside them.   Law enforcement officers deserve our utmost respect and recognition  today and every day. Please join me in thanking these brave men and  women for their sacrifices and service to our country and our  communities.                            ____________________
