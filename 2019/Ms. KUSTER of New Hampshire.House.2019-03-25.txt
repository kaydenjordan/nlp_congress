 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Women's History Month and the important role that New Hampshire has  played in our proud tradition of women breaking barriers.   In 1870, 50 years before passage of the 19th Amendment, Marilla  Ricker attempted to vote in New Hampshire. She was denied the ballot,  but she refused to stand by and continued to attempt to vote over the  coming decades.   Ms. Ricker was denied admittance to the New Hampshire Bar, but fought  all the way to the State supreme court, and in 1890 became the first  woman admitted to our State bar.   Women hold many firsts in elected office in New Hampshire. Dudley  Dudley, the first woman on the New Hampshire Executive Council; Jeanne  Shaheen, Governor; Beverly Hollingworth, Senate President; and Donna  Sytek, Speaker of the New Hampshire House, all served together in 1999.  Linda Dalianis became our first Chief Justice of the New Hampshire  Supreme Court.   In 2012, I was honored to be a member of the first ever all-female  congressional delegation with Senators Jeanne Shaheen, Kelly Ayotte,  and Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter. Now, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie  Hassan are the only women ever in American history to serve as Governor  and U.S. Senator.   For Women's History Month, I am proud of New Hampshire's contribution  to advancing women.                            ____________________
