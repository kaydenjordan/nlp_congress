 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today as the  Democrats continue to scare the American public when it comes to their  healthcare.   This week's Democratic Presidential debate the other night in South  Carolina was a free-for-all. Their frontrunner, a man I believe to be a  dangerous democratic Socialist, Bernie Sanders, is in the spotlight,  and he seems to be in the lead. Socialist tax-and-spend policies remain  on full display.   The top policy priority of the Democrats would destroy healthcare  freedom in America. They are proposing a complete government takeover  of our Nation's healthcare system--a complete government takeover. They  call it Medicare for All, but let's take a look at what that actually  means. It means that 180 million Americans who get their health  insurance through work would lose that insurance. They would lose that  health insurance. Washington bureaucrats would be in control of  healthcare.   The Sanders proposal has a price tag of $34 trillion--$34 trillion  with a ``t.'' It would bankrupt the country and everyone in it. The  only way to even try to pay for it is with massive, across-the-board  tax hikes, and Bernie Sanders said he is willing to do it.   Do not be deceived when they first talk about targeting the rich  because the tax increases would hit working families and even people  making $29,000 a year. That is according to Bernie Sanders' own math.  And taxes are likely to double. Medicare for All would deliver a  crushing blow not only to family budgets but I believe to the entire  economy. It would end America's success story.   Thanks to Republican tax and regulatory relief, we have a record- setting economy, record low unemployment, record job growth--7 million  new jobs. Wages are rising. Middle-class wages and blue-collar wages  are going up. It is a worker windfall, a blue-collar boom. A record 61  percent of Americans say they are better off financially than when  President Trump took office. People are confident about the future, and  the President's job approval is at an alltime high.   Still, the 2020 Democrats don't seem to get it. You don't hear a  positive word about the economy. Instead, Democrats seem to attack one  another and try to move further and further to the Left. During the  debate last week, the crowd actually booed a defense of free markets.   Some Democratic candidates are proposing a scaled-back version of  Medicare for All that they call a ``public option,'' but this proposal  would create a  [[Page S1165]]  government health plan to compete with work-sponsored health insurance.  Don't be fooled--that public option would hurt patients across the  country, especially people living in rural areas. It would disrupt  insurance coverage, slash funding for doctors and hospitals, and would  force local hospitals and clinics to close. Simply put, a public option  is a pit stop on the road to 100 percent government-run healthcare in  America.   Clearly, Democrats are ignoring their own voters. Union workers  across the country are telling Democrats: Don't touch our hard-earned  healthcare benefits. People don't want radical healthcare schemes,  which is what the Democrats are proposing. People care more about their  pocketbooks. They want their own healthcare, but they want it at a  lower cost. That is what I hear every weekend at home in Wyoming.   Americans are struggling to pay for insurance premiums for doctors,  for hospitals, and for prescription drugs. According to a new POLITICO- Harvard poll, 8 in 10 Americans--89 percent of Democrats and 76 percent  of Republicans--want us to lower their healthcare costs. Seventy-five  percent say we must lower the costs of prescription drugs. I agree. The  Kaiser Family Foundation reports that nearly one in four people is  having trouble paying for their prescriptions. But Socialist policies  are the wrong medicine. They will only worsen the problems.   Republicans are listening to people's concerns. We have commonsense  solutions to lower out-of-pocket costs without lowering standards. I am  a doctor, the husband of a breast cancer survivor, and the son of a 97- year-old mother. Let me assure you, Republicans will always protect  vulnerable Americans, especially people with preexisting conditions.  The Republican healthcare agenda is about giving patients more choices  and better healthcare. It is about improving healthcare access and  affordability.   Working with President Trump, we are already providing much needed  relief from costly ObamaCare taxes. These unfair taxes hurt working  families, they hurt small businesses, they hurt seniors, and we have  ended them.   Now we are working to drive down drug costs. As part of this effort,  in December, I joined six Republican Senators to introduce the Lower  Costs, More Cures Act. This legislation would limit out-of-pocket drug  costs for people with Medicare Part D plans. We also ended the drug  price gag rule to help patients find more affordable drugs. We are  working to end surprise medical billings. These unexpected,  unreasonable, and unaffordable bills undermine families' finances. It  is an intolerable practice, and it must stop.   Republicans are delivering better healthcare. Still, to make more  progress, we need Democrats to work with us. It is time to come  together. It is time to cooperate. It is time to find common ground. I  will tell you, taking away health insurance from 180 million Americans  who get it through work is not common ground. There is no common  ground. That is the direction of the Democratic Party. We need to find  common ground. Taking insurance away from 180 million Americans who get  it from work and then giving free health insurance to illegal  immigrants and raising taxes from Americans to pay for it is not common  ground.   Let's work together to give patients the high-quality care they need  from a doctor they choose at lower costs.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, Scott Sims and his family are ranchers  at McFadden, in southeastern Wyoming. Scott also serves as president of  the Wyoming Stock Growers Association.   The Sims family are practitioners of holistic management and low-cost  production. They believe they have a responsibility ``to take care of  the land, with its weather, beauty, isolation and recreation. We strive  to live independently and to follow our passion: with power of choice,  faith in States rights, and freedom from excessive regulation.''   The values the Sims family follows in their work and lives are  simple: honesty, respect, integrity, trust, fairness, tolerance, work  ethic, self-work, and appreciation of each other and individual faiths.   The Wyoming Stock Growers Association is making plans to celebrate  their 150th anniversary in 2022. They are laying the groundwork for the  association to begin its next 150 years of service to Wyoming's  livestock businesses and families with a strong commitment to Wyoming's  resources, the industry and their communities.   In the Winter 2020 edition of Cow Country, the official magazine of  the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, Scott authored an article titled  ``Defining the Path Forward.'' I believe his words apply just as much  to life in America today as they do to the association's planning for  the next 150 years. I wish the Stock Growers all the best as they  complete their first 150 years in Wyoming, and begin their next century  of work on behalf of Wyoming's livestock producers.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article written by  Scott Sims be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      [From Cow Country, Winter 2020]                         Defining the Path Forward         I can only imagine what the founders of the Wyoming Stock       Growers Association envisioned as to what the path forward       would look like back in 1872. It probably had more to do with       control of the range and dealing with cattle rustling. I am       pretty sure their vision did not include the range of issues       that the association deals with today, that came about as       obstacles developed while riding up the path.        I do know that right now I want to look back down the path       to the 2019 Winter Roundup Convention. Thank you to all that       attended and made it such a success. There was a wide range       from older, to young, to very young in attendance. There was       broad representation from other industry groups, state and       federal agencies, legislators, and etc. The point being is       that the great diversity, the variety of issues that are       dealt with, and the huge array of people that come to share       their knowledge and expertise, make for a strong       organization. For you members that can't come to the       convention, feel assured that the Wyoming Stock Growers is       only a phone call away from addressing your needs.        So what does the path forward look like? I think that it       might look different moving forward. Many of us realize that       the dynamics of the ranching industry look much different       than in past generations. The future of the Wyoming Stock       Growers is in the hands of the next generations. They will       have the voice as to what is most important to their future       in the business, and where the association might play a role.        I feel there is a great future in the ranching business.       The way businesses are structured will have a different look       as to the land we operate on. There will be land arrangements       such as leasing and smarter estate planning to keep family       ranches in the right hands. There will be marketing       opportunities if you take the time to develop and promote a       good product. There is no one solution that will make or       break the cattle business, but ultimately it will come down       to cattle cycles and how you manage through them. There is a       role for government, but keep it limited. Regenerative       agriculture is a growing way of management that can allow for       substantially increasing production on the land. Two things       that you have control over are managing costs, and managing       the land. Being able to sell what you do to improve the       health of the land will allow you many opportunities. Tell       your story and tell it with confidence. You may find yourself       at the table across from people that may not understand you.       They definitely won't understand if you are not there.        I just gave my thoughts on what I think is along the path       forward, but what does it look like for you? Whatever it is,       let's ride the path together as an industry and as members of       the Wyoming Stock Growers.                            ____________________
