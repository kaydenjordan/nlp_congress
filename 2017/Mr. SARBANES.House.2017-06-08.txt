 Mr. Chairman, in 2008 our financial system cratered,  bringing the broader world economy to its knees. Millions of Americans  lost their homes; millions more lost their jobs by no fault of their  own; and $13 trillion in wealth and savings was lost.   We went to work fixing the glaring holes in our Nation's financial  regulatory system. Among other things, we enacted tougher mortgage  standards; we brought the derivatives market out of the shadows; we  stopped the casino-like bets at our investment banks; and we created a  consumer-focused protection bureau.   Unfortunately, what we couldn't do was eradicate greed; and, sadly,  today greed is rearing its ugly head once again. The Republican- controlled Congress is about to pass H.R. 10, the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act,  a bill that would throw away the lessons of the 2008 financial crash  and unleash the demons that nearly took down the world economy.    I urge the House to reject this bill.
