 Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank you to  everybody standing up here. They came to practices in the mornings,  they braved serious injuries.   Mr. Speaker, a special shout-out to our colleague, Rick Crawford, who  is not here, who broke a fibula trying to play for this game. We missed  him.   Mr. Speaker, another shout-out goes to Bob Dole and Jeff Denham,  former Members who have played, but certainly our pros that helped  coach us, John Booty and Ken Harvey. All of them deserve thanks.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all Members, whenever they see these great Capitol  Police officers, thank them for what they do each and every day for us  and for the millions of visitors that come to this institution. But  remind them that the charities are the winners, and make sure they know  that the Members are the victors.                            ____________________
