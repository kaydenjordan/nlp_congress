 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the August inflation numbers came out  [[Page S4629]]  this week, and they weren't good. Inflation was even higher than  expected. It was very clear that soaring prices are likely to continue  for quite a while, but as usual, it doesn't seem to concern the  Democrats one bit.   The President was asked Tuesday if he was concerned about August's  even-worse-than-expected inflation report.   His answer? ``No, I'm not.''   It was just one more tone-deaf moment for the President and the  Democrats.   On Tuesday, the President and the Democrats gathered at the White  House to congratulate themselves for having passed their so-called  Inflation Reduction Act, a bill that will do nothing--nothing--to  reduce inflation. That is not just my opinion. That was the conclusion  of the nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model and of the Democrat  chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who referred to the bill as  the ``so-called Inflation Reduction Act'' on the Senate floor while  admitting it would do nothing to solve our Nation's inflation crisis.   But that didn't stop the Democrats from celebrating yesterday. For  most of us, of course, it is difficult to understand what there was to  celebrate. Leaving aside the issue of the 40-year-high inflation, we  already know that the bill will also fall short in another respect--on  deficit reduction.   The Democrats' claims that the bill would provide meaningful deficit  reduction were always somewhat dubious, but even granting the  Democrats' rosiest assumptions, President Biden wiped out any deficit  reduction when he announced his massive student loan giveaway 8 days--8  days--after the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law.   So no inflation reduction, no deficit reduction. Oh, one other thing:  The Inflation Reduction Act will drive up energy bills for Americans.   So the question is: What was there to celebrate?   Well, for the Democrats, the Inflation Reduction Act marked a chance  to finally push through some of their far-left, Green New Deal  fantasies, things like electric vehicle tax credits to help wealthy  Americans buy electric cars, more than $60 billion--$60 billion--for  ``environmental justice priorities,'' including $1.9 billion for things  like identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage, and the list goes on. So  I think the Democrats are pretty satisfied with themselves over finally  jamming through elements of their Green New Deal agenda.   Then, of course, they succeeded in extending increased ObamaCare  subsidies that will push Americans off of private healthcare plans and  into government-run care.   Then--then--there are the tax hikes. The current Democratic leader  once said, ``You don't want to take money out of the economy when the  economy is shrinking,'' like it has in the previous two quarters. But  those days are gone. For the Democrats, raising taxes has become an  article of faith.   And it goes far beyond raising money to help pay for their Big  Government spending. The Democrats believe raising taxes on  corporations and well-off Americans is good in and of itself, even if  those tax hikes have a negative effect on less well-off Americans and  the economy. The tax hikes that the Democrats have included in their  so-called Inflation Reduction Act will, indeed, have a negative effect  on our economy and on the hard-working Americans who help support it.  The Democrats' tax hikes on businesses will result in slower growth,  lower wages, and thousands of fewer jobs, and the Democrats' tax hikes  on conventional energy will result in higher energy prices for working  families.   In addition to raising taxes, the other main way the Inflation  Reduction Act raises revenue is by increasing IRS audits and placing  new burdens on taxpayers.   The Democrats' bill contains a whopping $80 billion in increased  funding for the IRS. That is an increase in funding which represents  six times the annual budget of the IRS today. More than half of those  funds, or $46 billion, are earmarked for increased IRS enforcement.  Just 4 percent is for improving customer service, which should tell you  all you need to know about where the Democrats' real priorities lie.   The bill would provide for the hiring of as many as 87,000 new  employees, which would more than double the current size of the Agency  and make the IRS--make the IRS, if you can believe this--larger than  Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Coast Guard put together,  combined.   In the lead-up to the passage of the Democrats' bill, the Biden  administration put out a statement declaring that the money for IRS  enforcement would not go to the increased audits of households making  less than $400,000. Because we had reason to doubt that that would be  the case, the Republicans put forward an amendment to the bill to  prevent the IRS from using its new money to audit those Americans.  Every Democrat--every single Democrat--voted against the amendment. So,  I guess, the Democrats are happy to oppose more IRS audits of middle- class Americans in theory, but they don't want to cut off the  possibility of those audits in practice if they end up needing them to  help fund their Green New Deal spending.   I don't need to tell anyone that the IRS is notorious for mishandling  sensitive taxpayer data. As recently as this month, we learned that the  IRS had inadvertently posted confidential taxpayer data of around  120,000 individuals on its website--private taxpayer information that  was available to the general public.   Then, of course, there was last year's leak, or hack, of confidential  taxpayer information that was shared with the left-leaning ProPublica  and was used to advance a partisan agenda for which, I might add,  neither the IRS nor the Biden administration has provided any  accountability.   Then there was the infamous targeting of conservative groups for  extra scrutiny under the Obama IRS, and the list goes on.   I haven't even discussed the IRS's record of grossly  underperforming--some would say nonexistent--customer service. During  the 2022 tax season, just 10 percent of taxpayers' calls--10 percent of  taxpayers' calls--to the IRS were answered by an IRS employee. What we  need to be doing is holding the IRS accountable, not setting tens of  thousands of new IRS agents loose on taxpayers' accounts.   Earlier this week, I joined my Republican colleagues on the Senate  Finance Committee to introduce legislation to prevent the IRS from  using its new funding to audit American workers or small business  owners earning less than $400,000 per year.   I also introduced a bill this week, along with Senator Collins, to  improve taxpayer service at the IRS. Our legislation, called the  Increase Reliable Services Now Act, would prevent the IRS from hiring  new employees for enforcement until customer service at the IRS had  reached a more acceptable level. It is unacceptable--unacceptable--that  taxpayers have a 1 in 10 chance of receiving assistance when calling  the IRS, and the Agency should not be allowed to increase enforcement  hires until it has achieved at least a basic level of customer service.   So we have 87,000 new employees, which is double--double--the size of  the current IRS workforce, and we have $80 billion, which is six times  the current annual budget of the IRS, with a specific focus: going  after taxpayers in this country to try and get, raise--whatever--more  revenue to fund the Democrats' Big Government fantasies. At the same  time, 1 in 10 taxpayers is getting his calls returned at the IRS.   I will continue to work to increase IRS accountability and prevent  hard-working Americans from being squeezed to fund Democrats' Green New  Deal spending.   Like the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan spending spree that came  before it--which, I would add, helped plunge our country into our  current inflation crisis--the Inflation Reduction Act is a bad deal for  the American people, and all of the self-congratulatory White House  parties in the world aren't going to change that basic fundamental  fact.   Americans are experiencing serious economic hardship, and Democrats  are doing nothing to help.   I yield the floor.
