 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3,  the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act.   We must always be careful stewards of the taxpayers' hard-earned  money. That is why I was proud to sign on as an original cosponsor of  President Trump's rescission package.   As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I  understand more than most that President Trump's proposal rescinding  nearly $15 billion is necessary.   It is common sense that money sitting in Federal coffers and not  being spent should be returned to the Treasury. This bill is a welcome  step to cut wasteful spending and will restore fiscal sanity to  Washington.   Importantly, the rescissions package on the floor today no longer  rescinds Ebola funding. Sadly, that horrible disease has recently  returned to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It also no longer  rescinds funding for Hurricane Sandy victims.   I hope the Senate will pass this bill as soon as possible so that the  President can sign these historic spending cuts into law. I urge all  Members to support this commonsense proposal.
