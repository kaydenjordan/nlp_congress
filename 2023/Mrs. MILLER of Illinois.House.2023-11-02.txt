 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of my  amendment that would reduce Deputy Assistant Administrator Jake Li's  salary to $1.   Mr. Li oversees all pesticide programs at the Biden EPA. The Biden  EPA has consistently politicized crop reduction tools, creating  uncertainty for farmers.   In their most recent attack on farmers and ranchers, the Biden EPA  released a new herbicide strategy at the request of the radical climate  cult lobby. This program would force farmers to implement costly  mitigation measures, likely forcing them out of production entirely.   According to the Biden administration's own estimates, this program  could cost more than $5 billion for all corn acres in Illinois, Iowa,  and Nebraska alone. This is just one more example of how the Biden  administration puts the leftwing political agenda ahead of farmers who  grow food to feed America and the world.   Madam Chair, please join me in supporting this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise in support of my  amendment that would prohibit funding for the Solar for All program.   During an Agriculture Committee hearing earlier this year, the EPA  Administrator told me that the EPA does not incentivize solar panels.  This program clearly demonstrates he was not being truthful in his  testimony.   Under the Biden administration's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, the  EPA has announced a $7 billion subsidy for solar panels. China  completely controls the solar panel industry, and we should not be  using taxpayer money to subsidize our adversaries in the name of a  leftwing political ideology.                                time  2045    According to the EPA's own website, solar panels contain hazardous  materials that are harmful to humans.   In my home State of Illinois, a school roof lit on fire due to  excessive heat generated by solar panels on the roof.   The Biden administration needs to stop prioritizing the left's  radical climate agenda over the energy needs of the American people.   Please join me in supporting this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    I would like to remind my friends on the  other side that China controls the mining of rare earth minerals used  to produce solar panels.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in April, EPA Administrator  Regan testified before the House Agriculture Committee and told me the  EPA doesn't incentivize solar panels, that they are a regulatory  agency. His statement to the committee was blatantly false.   The EPA does incentivize solar panels, which is why I introduced an  amendment to strip all funding from the EPA's Solar for All program.   The Biden administration wants to cover rich, fertile farmland that  we use to grow food with Chinese solar panels.   Mr. Chair, I support this amendment because we must send a message to  the EPA to leave the farmers alone and never mislead Congress when  testifying.
