 Mr. Speaker, 25 months ago, we saw the crisis in  Oroville, California, of the broken spillway at Oroville Dam, belonging  to the State water project. Thankfully, emergency services were able to  come in and, as soon as possible, get things functioning once again for  the safety of the flood control as well as the storage and the  hydroelectricity that is produced there.   We had much help that came from FEMA; and I want to say thank you to  the folks at FEMA, this administration, and Secretary Nielsen for being  on the spot in helping with this restoration process. $333 million have  flowed to helping the crisis at the spillway be restored to a working  spillway.   Now, there are those who are clamoring for even more money, but that  lies on the backs of the State of California and the DWR for the extra  money, bringing it up to $1.1 billion.   The State of California claims it is in a surplus situation, and it  needs to pay its own bills and put the money aside to take care of the  project--not the other 49 States--for the nonemergency part of the  project.   So, again, thanks to FEMA for their attention to this, as well as the  wildfire situation we had in Paradise, California, for helping us in  northern California.                            ____________________
