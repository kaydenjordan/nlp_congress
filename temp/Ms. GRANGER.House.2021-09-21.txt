 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in reluctant opposition to H.R. 5305, a bill that  contains many critical items, including a continuing resolution to fund  the Federal Government until December 3.   Over the last month, Republican Members of the House and Senate have  voiced concerns about tying a vote to suspend the debt ceiling with a  vote to keep the government funded.   It is disappointing, but that is exactly what is happening here  today.   Even if this bill passes the House, we know it is going to face  strong resistance in the Senate.   With only a few days left in the fiscal year, this decision alone  could force us into an unnecessary and costly government shutdown.   I do want to thank our committee chair, Ms. DeLauro, for working to  develop a bill that includes priorities of Members on both sides of the  aisle.   In addition to this bill allowing critical adjustments to be made in  government programs over the next 2 months, we worked together on much  needed supplemental funding to address hurricanes, wildfires, flooding,  and other impacts of natural disasters.   Unfortunately, the chair's good faith efforts have been undone by  other political decisions.   Not only does this bill include language to suspend the debt ceiling,  the funding for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system was removed  from the bill after it was filed.   I do not understand why this decision was made because it was only 4  short months ago that Israel faced rocket attacks on a scale that had  never been seen before. Israeli civilians would have suffered terrible  casualties had it not been for Iron Dome.   Iron Dome rocket interceptors need to be restored, and that is why  funding was included as part of the original package.   We should not be turning our backs on our steadfast ally at a time  when they continue to face dangerous threats from terrorists. The  decision to pull funding will leave Israel more vulnerable.    In addition to this funding being removed, there are some other items  that deserve further review as we move forward with the fiscal year  2022 appropriations process.   For example, we must give the Department of Homeland Security the  resources it needs to address the historically high number of migrants  flooding our borders.   The situation on the border is the worst it has ever been, and we  must get it under control.   Putting these issues aside, we all know the reality is that we must  pass a bill to keep the government open.   There is no time for delay.   We should not pretend that by considering this bill on the floor of  the House today that we will be any closer to sending a bill to the  President's desk to prevent a government shutdown.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1915     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text  of the amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the  motion to recommit.  [[Page H4592]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my amendment would provide $1 billion to replenish  Israel's Iron Dome security system.   Four months ago, Israel was under attack from terrorists. The rocket  fire into Israel was on a scale that had never been seen before.  Countless civilian lives were saved because of the Iron Dome system  that the United States has supported year after year.    Because of the attacks this spring, Iron Dome rocket interceptors  need to be restored immediately. Members have expressed their support  for this funding for months. So has the President of the United States,  and so has the Secretary of Defense.   Now is the time to ensure Israel has what it needs to defend itself  in the face of real and growing threats. This is a commonsense motion  that would fund the Iron Dome system and reassure our ally that America  will never turn its back on the great State of Israel.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the motion, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, as I said before, we all know  we must pass a CR to keep the government open. But this bill has too  many fatal flaws, and passing it is simply a wasted opportunity. We are  not any closer to sending a bill to the President's desk to prevent a  government shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
