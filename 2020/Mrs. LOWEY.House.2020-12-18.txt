 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  joint resolution (H.J. Res. 107) making further continuing  appropriations for fiscal year 2021, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                               H.J. Res. 107         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled,      That the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 (division A of       Public Law 116-159) is further amended by striking the date       specified in section 106(3) and inserting ``December 20,       2020''.        This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Further       Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 107, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, families and small businesses desperately need support  as they continue to reel from the coronavirus pandemic. As we speak,  bipartisan negotiations are ongoing to deliver emergency relief  alongside an omnibus comprising fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills.   To keep government open while negotiations conclude, the legislation  before us extends funding at current levels through Sunday.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  ongoing talks by adopting this clean continuing resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge its support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
