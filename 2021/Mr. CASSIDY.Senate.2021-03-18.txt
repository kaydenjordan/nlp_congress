 Madam President, I rise today to speak to the  fortitude of the students, faculty, and staff of LaGrange High School.  Located in Lake Charles, LA, LaGrange High School educates over 1,000  students and is led by their Principal Monica Guillory. As you may  know, on top of a global pandemic, southwest Louisiana was ravaged by  two major hurricanes last year. In most cases, people would try to  return to some sense of normalcy or return to the status quo following  a deadly virus and multiple natural disasters. However, the LaGrange  High School girls' basketball team, known as the Lady Gators, would not  accept the status quo. Led by head coach La'Keem Holmes, and assistant  coaches Patrick Woodard, Sharde Henry, and Sean Andress, these ladies  carried their school and community through troubled waters and became  back-to-back Class 4A State champions. This is the first school in the  Lake Charles area to be State champions back-to-back. These young women  gave their community something to rally behind during hard times, the  purple and white. What a gift that is. It is my honor to visit them and  learn of all the great things they are accomplishing.                            ____________________
