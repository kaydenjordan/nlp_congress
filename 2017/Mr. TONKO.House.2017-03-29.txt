 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1430, the  Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act.   I have serious concerns with this bill that the majority has offered.  This bill pretends to improve scientific integrity and transparency  while, in reality, they would stop the EPA from doing its critical job,  its critical mission of protecting the American people.   Many credible organizations have opposed the HONEST Act, including  the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Union of  Concerned Scientists, American Institute of Biological Sciences,  American Lung Association, American Public Health Association, the  League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council, and  the Environmental Defense Action Fund.   Two others that I include in the Record, the copies that I hold in my  hand, in opposition, have been received from the Consortium for Ocean  Leadership, and the other from the Environmental Data and Governance  Initiative.                                                      Consortium for                                                Ocean Leadership,                                     Washington, DC, March 27, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: On behalf of the Consortium for Ocean       Leadership, which represents our nation's leading ocean       research and technology institutions (from academia,       industry, and aquaria), I am writing to express concern       regarding the Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment       (HONEST) Act of 2017 (H.R. 1430). Sound science must underpin       the rulemaking process at all our nation's federal agencies,       the Environmental Protection Agency included. I am concerned       about the practical implications of this bill and what it       means, not only for the rulemaking process, but for the       health, security, and prosperity of our nation and its       citizens. While I ardently support efforts to ensure the       continued use of sound science, I urge you and your       colleagues to consider unintended consequences of this bill       before bringing it to the House floor.        While reproducibility is a fundamental assumption of       science, that should not be conflated with the idea that all       non-reproducible science is incorrect. There are many cases       where reproducibility is simply not possible, but that does       not negate the importance of the conclusions that have been       reached. In 1994, the comet Shoemaker-Levy collided with our       celestial neighbor Jupiter, providing a first-hand look at       cosmic collisions and insight on both the comet and the       planet. The devastating Deepwater Horizon disaster in the       Gulf of Mexico has provided untold insights into everything       ranging from ecosystem responses to oil to impacts on       communities' physical and mental health. Because studies       stemming from these one-time incidents are not reproducible,       it does not mean that their methodology and results are       flawed. Additionally, longitudinal studies, especially in the       public health arena, are often too large and take so much       time (e.g., a study following a cohort for multiple decades)       that they could not realistically be reproduced but are       instead replicated through statistical modeling. Under the       current language of the HONEST Act, similar studies within       EPA's purview would be excluded from the agency's use,       potentially keeping the agency from making a proposal or       disseminating information and limiting the amount of good       science from which the EPA can makes decisions.        The bill also requires scientific and technical information       used to make federal regulations be posted online. While the       language specifies that personally identifiable information       used in these studies be redacted (unlike in the bill's       predecessor, the Secret Science Reform Act), the HONEST Act       goes on to state that personal information could be disclosed       to anyone who signs a confidentiality agreement with the       administrator. If federal regulations are made that impact a       specific industry, the same industry could access the       personal records of those who participated in the study.       Knowing that their personal information could be made       accessible to anyone would likely reduce the number of       willing participants in such a study, again limiting the best       science available to the agency.        Additionally, redacting information from documents is a       costly and time-consuming process that often requires the       work of an entire office. The EPA's limited resources, rather       than being spent fulfilling its mission ``to protect human       health and the environment'' would instead be spent       redacting, potentially hundreds of thousands of documents.       Conversely, the bill does not define who would make this       information publicly available online (and make appropriate       redactions) if the EPA were relying on a published, peer-      reviewed study performed by another entity, such as an       academic research institution. This would potentially impose       unexpected costs on the institution.        Rather than improving the quality of science used by the       agency, this bill would instead limit the amount of ``best       available science'' available for decision-making and would       require significant time and manpower. Such an impact would       threaten the health, not only of our nation, but of our       country's citizens who rely on the EPA to protect their well-      being. The unintended consequences from this bill are myriad,       and the ocean science and technology community stands ready       to help you evaluate them before considering this legislation       on the House floor.            Respectfully,      Jonathan W. White, RADM (Ret.), USN,        President and CEO, Consortium for Ocean Leadership.                                   ____                                                  Environmental Data                                         & Governance Initiative,                                                     March 27, 2017.        Dear Representative: The Environmental Data & Governance       Initiative (EDGI) has analyzed the potential effects of the       Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of 2017 (H.R.       1430) and determined that the bill would obstruct the EPA's       use of scientific studies in essential agency work. EDGI is       an organization comprised of non-profit employees and       academics that promotes open and accessible government data       and information along with evidence-based policy making. As       researchers invested in robust environmental data governance,       EDGI members are concerned that this legislation would force       the EPA to make determinations without certain categories of       crucial evidence-based research it needs to make the best       decisions for the health and welfare of the public and the       environment.        H.R. 1430 is just the latest iteration of the proposed       Secret Science Reform Acts of 2014 and 2015. These bills       would have prevented the EPA from relying on a large number       of validated and pivotal scientific studies in its decision-      making processes. Similarly, in its words, H.R. 1430 would       ``prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from       proposing, finalizing, or disseminating regulations or       assessments based upon science that is not transparent or       reproducible.'' Proponents claim that H.R. 1430 would improve       transparency in scientific decision-making and public data       accessibility, efforts that EDGI supports. However, as EDGI's       analysis shows, H.R. 1430 instead places important validated       science off limits to the EPA.        The data access requirements in H.R. 1430 would obstruct       public protections critical to human safety and health. Any       studies that utilize confidential medical records--including       many human health studies--would be nearly impossible for the       EPA to use because personally identifiable medical data       cannot be released to the general public. For instance, the       EPA would not be able to use epidemiological studies that are       critical for linking exposure to toxics with certain types of       diseases in the creation of standards that ensure our safe       drinking water and healthy air.  [[Page H2543]]         Additionally, the proposed legislation would bar studies       that cannot be reproduced from use by the EPA. Blocking the       EPA from using studies that are hard to reproduce impedes the       EPA's ability to protect the public from future health       hazards. Some of the nation's best evidence of public health       risks comes from long-term analyses, assessments of chronic       effects of exposure to toxic substances, studies based on       natural and human-caused catastrophes, and other studies that       we cannot reproduce.        Specific examples of current protections and programs that       would have been difficult, if not impossible, for the EPA to       issue had H.R. 1430 been in place include:        Standards that protect children from lead-based paint       hazards in their homes and schools. The EPA creates standards       that protect children from the adverse neurological effects       of exposure to lead in paint, dust, and soil. The agency       bases these lead protections on long-term studies of children       who have suffered lead exposure in the past. Because EPA       regulations have effectively reduced lead exposure in       children, reproducing these long-term epidemiological studies       would be nearly impossible, as the cohort of study subjects       no longer exists. Prohibiting the EPA from using historical       reports like these would make continuing regulation of lead       much harder.        Safeguards that protect people from exposure to radioactive       contaminants in drinking water. The EPA's standards for the       permissible quantity of certain radionuclides, such as       uranium, found in drinking water are based on data from       radiation exposure studies that use confidential patient       information from a cohort of Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic       bomb survivors, which could not be used under this bill.       Long-term epidemiological studies conducted on this cohort       are also unreproducible, rendering these studies, and others       like them, nearly impossible for the EPA to use under H.R.       1430's provisions.        Measures that improve safety at industrial facilities and       protect and assist first responders and emergency authorities       during accidents. The EPA improved its risk management       regulations following several catastrophic events involving       chemical plants, including an explosion at the West       Fertilizer Company facility in Texas that killed 14 people,       ten of them first responders. The studies that result from       chemical explosions like these cannot be reproduced and would       not be available for the EPA's use under H.R. 1430,       preventing the agency from properly protecting first       responders and the public from future chemical disasters.        Plans that ensure best practices in cleaning up major oil       spills and other hazardous waste spills that affect wildlife       health and habitats. After the Exxon Valdez oil tanker ran       aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989,       the EPA developed a restoration program to clean up the 11       million gallons of oil that had spilled into the Sound and       affected over 1,000 miles of shoreline. This cleanup program       would have been impossible without field studies of Prince       William Sound and other historical oil spills. Given the       large scale of these catastrophic spills, these studies       cannot be reproduced and thus would be barred from use by the       EPA by H.R. 1430.        The EPA would be hampered from implementing these vital       protections and programs under H.R. 1430. While the bill       contains a provision that pretends to skirt some of these       legal obstacles by only divulging protected materials to       people who sign confidentiality agreements, this provision is       illusory because medical data, trade secrets, and other       privacy-protected data cannot be released to the general       public, regardless of whether they sign a confidentiality       agreement. The EPA cannot issue confidentiality agreements on       behalf of third party researchers, so H.R. 1430 would inhibit       the EPA's ability to use many important scientific studies       despite this confidentiality agreement provision.        Further, H.R. 1430 limits the EPA to spending only $1       million a year to comply with these new requirements, yet the       CBO estimated that past versions of this legislation would       have cost the EPA up to $250 million annually to implement       the data access provisions required in the bill. The added       obligations specified in this legislation, coupled with a       lack of adequate funding to implement the law, would prevent       the EPA from fulfilling its hazard prevention and       environmental safety protection responsibilities.        Agencies tasked with protecting human health must be able       to rely on all available scientific data. Currently, the EPA       goes to great lengths to ensure that all of the data it       relies on is thoroughly reviewed and accessible. The EPA uses       several processes to ensure quality and relevance of data,       such as internal and external peer review and review by       scientific advisory boards.        When the EPA is prohibited from utilizing the most optimal       data, it puts the health and safety of citizens at risk.       Protecting safe drinking water and healthy air depends on the       EPA's ability to incorporate the best available evidence from       all scientific fields of study into its risk assessments and       regulation drafting processes. EDGI's analysis and research       shows that the passage of H.R. 1430 would block the EPA from       using the data it needs to fulfill its mission of protecting       public health and the environment.            Sincerely,      Sarah Lamdan,        Director of Legal Research, Environmental Data Governance       Initiative; Associate Law Library Professor, CUNY School of       Law.                  on behalf of the edgi steering committee:         Andrew Bergman, Ph.D. Candidate, Applied Physics, Harvard       University; Phil Brown, Ph.D., Sociology, University       Distinguished Professor of Sociology and Health Sciences,       Northeastern University; Lindsey Dillon, Ph.D., Geography,       Assistant Professor of Sociology, University of California,       Santa Cruz; Gretchen Gehrke, Ph.D., Geochemistry, Data and       Advocacy Steward, Public Lab; Rebecca Lave, Ph.D., Geography,       Associate Professor of Geography, Indiana University.

The Union of Concerned Scientists has recently said that  ``the bill effectively prevents the EPA from using the weight of  scientific evidence to protect public health and the environment.''   They go on to say ``this doesn't make sense.''   I agree. This doesn't make any sense.   Instead, I hope that, as a Congress, we can turn our attention to  truly protecting scientific integrity. We must protect the scientific  process from political interference, which is why I recently introduced  the Scientific Integrity Act, which will require our United States  Federal agencies to adopt or strengthen policies to insulate  government-directed research from the influence of political pressure  and special interests.   Under the Scientific Integrity Act, Federal agencies that conduct or  fund scientific research would be required to develop clear, written  scientific integrity policies that can guarantee research is being done  and published without undue influence, censorship, or distortion.   Scientific and technological information would be able to flow more  easily while protecting privacy, confidentiality, and our national  security. Twenty-four separate Federal agencies have developed  scientific integrity policies to date. This legislation would also  codify and strengthen these policies within a common framework.   Every Democrat on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee has  supported the Scientific Integrity Act, and I invite all of my  colleagues across the aisle to join us in working to truly protect  scientific integrity.   I urge a ``no'' vote on the so-called HONEST Act.    Madam Speaker, during yesterday evening's vote series, I  was present on the House floor. However, my vote was not recorded on  rollcall No. 202, due to a technical malfunction. Had I been recorded,  I would have voted ``no'' on S.J. Res. 34.                            ____________________
