 Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in the House and on  the  [[Page H8060]]  PFAS Task Force who have come to the floor this week to call on our  congressional leadership, House Armed Services Committee, and all the  conferees tasked with conferencing the fiscal year 2020 National  Defense Authorization Act to include a strong PFAS package.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for his leadership and tireless  work crafting this year's NDAA. It is a good bill, and it includes many  top priorities that will care for our servicemembers and keep the  United States well defended, but we are in the midst of a growing  nationwide human health and environmental crisis.   PFAS chemicals are harmful man-made toxic substances wherever they  are found.   We know that there are up to 297 military installations that have  confirmed PFAS contamination. This puts our military families at risk  and the communities surrounding them at risk, and it puts our national  security at risk if we do not include robust PFAS provisions.   The American people are counting on us to protect them, and we must  include this provision. Our military is arguing that this needs to be  cleaned up.   Please keep PFAS in the bill.                            ____________________
