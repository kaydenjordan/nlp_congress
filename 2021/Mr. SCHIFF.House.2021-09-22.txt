 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Khanna  amendment. I am very grateful to Representative Khanna for his  leadership.   Yemen and its people are suffering through a catastrophic tragedy.  Sixteen million in Yemen are at risk of famine. This year alone,  400,000 children may die from severe malnutrition made so much worse by  the conflict raging there.   Today, we have a powerful opportunity to help bring an end to this  suffering by terminating the U.S. decision to provide military  assistance to the Saudi Arabian coalition fueling Yemen's civil war.  Our participation in this suffering simply cannot continue. We cannot  be a party to the death of children and innocent civilians.   This is why I urge an emphatic ``yes'' in support of this amendment,  to bring an end to the U.S. funding of the Saudi-led military campaign  in Yemen.  [[Page H4940]]
