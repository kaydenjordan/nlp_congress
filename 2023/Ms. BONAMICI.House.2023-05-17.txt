 Mr. Speaker, the House Republicans released their  proposed agricultural funding bill this morning, and there is no doubt  that they are ready to cut nutrition benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to defend the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program, or SNAP.   When I worked my way through college, I used assistance--called food  stamps at the time--so I would have enough to eat.   My experience is not unique. More than 34 million people in the  United States are food insecure. Every day millions of Americans rely  on SNAP to help them put food on the table for themselves and for their  families.   SNAP is our most effective anti-hunger program, and we should be  improving its vital benefits. Unfortunately, my colleagues across the  aisle are doing the opposite.   Under the House Republicans' budget bill, which should be called the  default on America act, many people across the country, including many  seniors, will lose access to this critical assistance.   My colleagues claim their benefit cuts will get people back to work  and reduce our national debt, but taking food assistance away from  vulnerable Americans will not help anyone find work, it will just make  them hungry.   Balancing the budget on the backs of low-income seniors is shameful.  Unlike the default in America act, the bill I will soon introduce will  increase access to SNAP benefits for our Nation's most vulnerable  seniors.   My Senior Hunger Prevention Act will reduce food insecurity and raise  the value of SNAP benefits so seniors can live and age with dignity.   Additionally, the first bill I introduced this Congress is designed  to eliminate barriers for college students accessing SNAP benefits.   Students of any age can't learn when they are hungry, and we know  that they are more likely to succeed in the classroom when they are not  worried about where their next meal is coming from.  [[Page H2383]]    Mr. Speaker, strengthening SNAP should not be a partisan issue. I  also support the bills that several of our colleagues have introduced  that will improve our food security programs.   Following last year's White House Conference on Hunger, and as we  consider the farm bill, Congress must make it a priority to get  assistance to those who need it most.   Mr. Speaker, we are at a critical moment to take action to end  hunger, and the default on America act is not the answer. We must  strengthen SNAP, not cut it.                            ____________________
