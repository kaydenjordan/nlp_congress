 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  confirmation vote on the Vaden nomination occur at 2:15 p.m. today.    Madam President, I am joined on the floor by the Senator  from North Carolina, and I think a few additional Members will be  coming to talk about Thanksgiving Day and about one of the things that  we are most thankful for in this Nation, which is the service of our  veterans who have stepped forward in uniform to give us the free  country that we enjoy today and the freedoms that we enjoy today-- veterans like my 96-year-old father, who was in World War II, who was  recognized at the Ole Miss-South Carolina game just Saturday night as  one of the surviving World War II veterans.   So I want to take a personal moment to recognize my dad and people  like him who served so many, many decades ago. They kept us safe and  defended our most important freedoms, including the freedom that  Americans exercised just this month--the freedom to cast a ballot.   I am a veteran myself, and I am a proud veteran. Of course, my  accomplishments do not compare with those of my World War II veteran  dad's. I am also the proud father of an Air Force major today, Maj.  McDaniel Wicker. So being a veteran is a proud tradition in our family.  Also, it is a proud recognition that we make as Members of Congress and  to take care that the promises we have made are kept to the armed  services members who have stepped forward and donned a uniform.   That means making sure, during this COVID-19 pandemic, that federally  run retirement homes, like the Armed Services Retirement Home in  Gulfport, MS, have the resources they need. It means acting boldly to  reform the VA, which we have done, actually, on a bipartisan basis, in  recent years, with legislation like the VA MISSION Act and the VA  Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. These laws have  reduced wait times, expanded access to telemedicine and private care,  and allowed the Department of Veterans Affairs to fire employees who  have engaged in poor performance. As I say that, I might add, when I  talk to veterans who have used the services of the VA, so many times,  they are complimentary and profusely generous in their praise of the  employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs. For those who don't  get the job done and perform poorly, we now have the ability, under  this important legislation, to get rid of them and replace them with  those who will join the majority of the VA employees in getting the job  done.   I have also introduced legislation with Senator Kaine to designate  September 30 as National Veterans Suicide Prevention Day. It is  something on which, again, we have worked in a bipartisan manner down  through the Congresses.   This month is not only Thanksgiving month and election month, but it  is Military Family Appreciation Month. Showing our thankfulness to  veterans also includes showing our thankfulness to the families of our  military members. So I am pleased to join my colleagues and yield the  floor, in just a few moments, to my colleague from North Carolina.   Just today, Members of the House and Senate are working on the final  paragraphs and the final provisions that remain undecided within the  National Defense Authorization Act. This year, it will be named after a  retiring colleague of ours, Representative Mac Thornberry, of Texas,  who did not seek reelection this year. I can tell you that Members of  the Senate and Members of this Republican conference are working hard  today to make our National Defense Authorization Act a reality again  for the 60th straight year and to serve those veterans and future  veterans who have done so much to make our country free.   At this point, I yield the floor    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise this  afternoon, as I do, to commend an outstanding young American. In this  case, a young Mississippian; namely, Miss Asya Branch, from Booneville,  MS, who was recently crowned as Miss USA 2020.   For those of you from Michigan, take some pride. She was born in  Michigan but moved to Mississippi at an early age and spent her  childhood in Booneville, as I said. She graduated this year from my  alma mater, the University of Mississippi, having studied broadcast  journalism.   Miss Asya Branch has experienced dizzying success during the past 2  years. In 2018, Asya Branch won the title of Miss Mississippi under the  Miss America Organization. The following year, she became the first  African-American woman to win the other State title, Miss Mississippi  USA. She is only the seventh person in history to hold both State  titles: Miss Mississippi and Miss Mississippi USA. And now she is the  first-ever Miss Mississippi USA to win the Miss USA crown.   Asya Branch has been competing in pageants since 2016, when she won  her first preliminary title in the Miss Mississippi competition. She  went on to win Ole Miss's Parade of Beauties competition and numerous  local titles. She has gained wide recognition because she is beautiful,  well-spoken, and she is a gifted vocalist. But, also, there is a  serious part of her platform and serious personal story of Asya's in  overcoming adversity, and I admire that so much in Asya Branch. She  speaks openly about her father's 10 years in the State prison,  resulting in his absence for much of her upbringing. That difficult  period shaped who Asya Branch is and gave her strength and a unique  perspective on incarceration.   During the Mississippi pageant, Asya's platform was empowering  children of incarcerated parents. Can you imagine the courage of a  young woman taking that on as her platform? It enabled her to reach out  to other children, encourage them that their lives do not have to be  defined by their circumstances.   During her year as Miss Mississippi, she was part of a White House  roundtable, where she discussed criminal justice and prison reform,  much as we did here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. And the First Step  Act--she discussed this act with President Trump and Vice President  Pence, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant, and lawmakers, including  Senator Hyde-Smith and me.   She also started the Love Letters Program in which she donated  stationery and stamps to inmates, allowing them to write to their loved  ones. In her new role as Miss USA, she plans to expand Love Letters to  a national level and continue advocating for criminal justice and  prison reform.   You can see why I am so proud of Asya Branch and so impressed with  her accomplishments. She has the honor of holding two State titles and  now a national title. This speaks to her unique gifts, accomplishments,  courage, and passion for bringing about constructive change to the  world.   I commend Asya for her example of perseverance. She has made  Mississippi proud, and I think she is going to make the United States  proud as she moves forward next year to the Miss Universe pageant,  where I am sure she will do well. I encourage all Americans to root for  her next year, as we will certainly be doing at my house.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, for the Committee on Commerce, Science,  and Transportation I report favorably the following nomination lists  which were printed in the Records on the dates indicated, and ask  unanimous consent, to save the expense of reprinting on the Executive  Calendar that these nominations lie at the Secretary's desk for the  information of Senators.
