 Mr. President, I rise today to offer a motion that  would protect Medicaid, the Medicaid expansion, and the Healthy Indiana  Plan--known as HIP 2.0--in my home State of Indiana.   I first want to thank my colleagues for their support of this motion.  I am proud to have Senators Casey, Cantwell, Blumenthal, Leahy, Brown,  Harris, Hassan, Franken, Feinstein, Udall, Shaheen, Carper, Coons,  Whitehouse, Kaine, Van Hollen, Cortez Masto, Baldwin, Menendez, Reed,  Duckworth, Manchin, Markey, Stabenow, Durbin, Wyden, Murphy, Warren,  Gillibrand, Cardin, Klobuchar, Heinrich, Hirono, Booker, Peters,  Warner, and Nelson as supporters of this effort.   I also want to extend a special thank-you to my friend Senator Bob  Casey of Pennsylvania. Senator Casey has been a tireless advocate for  protecting the Medicaid Program and the critical services it provides,  not just to the people of Pennsylvania but to millions of Americans  across our beloved country. Senator Casey has done incredible work to  remind all Americans of the important role Medicaid plays in our  communities and the millions of children, families, students, and  seniors who have coverage through Medicaid.   My motion is simple. It would send this bill back to the Finance  Committee to get the consideration it never received, and it would  require the committee to strike provisions that reduce or eliminate  benefits for those currently eligible for Medicaid, prevent States from  expanding Medicaid, or shift costs to States to cover that care.   In my State of Indiana, we have seen the success of a bipartisan  approach to expanding the Medicaid Program and helping our fellow  citizen access health insurance. I was proud to work with then-Indiana  Governor and now-Vice President Mike Pence when he used the Affordable  Care Act to establish HIP 2.0. More than 400,000 Hoosiers have been  able to access coverage through HIP 2.0, many for the first time in  their lives. HIP 2.0 has helped reduce the uninsured rate in Indiana by  30 percent. Our Vice President called HIP 2.0--that is the Medicaid  expansion in Indiana--a national model.   Then-Governor Pence is hardly the only Republican Governor to praise  the Medicaid expansion as a way to cover more of our citizens. Governor  Sandoval of Nevada said just yesterday that he ``will continue to do  all I can to protect the thousands of Nevadans whose lives are  healthier and happier as a result of the expansion of Medicaid.''  Governor Kasich of Ohio has offered similar sentiments as he has fought  to protect the Medicaid coverage for his State.   Nationwide, 31 States and Washington, DC, expanded coverage to more  than 14 million Americans, many of whom have health insurance for the  first time in their lives. All of that progress is at risk with the  current bill.   Many of our States, including Indiana, have been devastated by the  opioid abuse and heroin use epidemics. This public health crisis hasn't  been confined to simply one neighborhood or one economic bracket; it  has been felt in communities across my State and all communities across  our country.   Vice President Pence said in his farewell address as Governor: ``With  HIP 2.0, we have also made great strides expanding treatment for those  who struggle in the grip of drug addiction.'' I agree with the Vice  President. HIP 2.0 and the Medicaid expansion have made treatment and  recovery services more accessible for thousands of Americans struggling  with addiction as they work to get back on their feet.   I don't think there is a single Member of this entire body--the U.S.  Senate--who hasn't heard from the relative of someone who is battling  addiction or from someone who has lost a loved one due to this  epidemic. Gutting Medicaid and ending programs like HIP 2.0 as we know  them would not make life better for Hoosiers or for the other 14  million Americans who have gained coverage through the Medicaid  expansion. It would actually do the opposite.   Too often, this debate has been about statistics and not about the  people who would be harmed. But healthcare, at the end of the day, is  inherently personal. It is about the health and the economic well-being  of our loved ones. It is about not having to go to the ER just to visit  a doctor. It is about our financial security so our families and our  friends aren't one illness away from bankruptcy.   The proposal before us wouldn't just impact Medicaid expansion; it  would harm millions of working Americans who count on Medicaid for  basic healthcare. It would affect more families than that, including  those families who have insurance through their jobs but also use  Medicaid to access care for chronic or complex conditions.   In 2015, 63 percent of Medicaid households had at least one full-time  worker, and another 14 percent had part-time workers. That is almost 80  percent. For these hard-working Americans, Medicaid provides their  families with financial security and stability and the healthcare they  need so they can keep working.   Last month I stood on this floor and shared the stories of Hoosiers,  including those who have Medicaid for themselves or to ensure that  their children have the care they need. I have met with these families  and heard their struggles, their fears, and their pain. I have listened  as they pleaded with all of us here to protect their ability to access  Medicaid. Many of these Hoosiers or their children are struggling with  very complex medical needs that made it impossible for them to get  coverage in the past. They would be priced out of the market under this  current legislation. I cannot support a bill that takes care away from  these families or from their children.   My faith teaches me that we are all God's children, and every man,  woman, and child should have the chance to live up to their God-given  potential. There is nothing we wouldn't do to take care of our kids.  These aren't just Indiana values. These are values in every town in  every corner of our country.  [[Page S4243]]    My faith also teaches me that we all deserve to live, work, and  retire with dignity. In Indiana, 62 percent of Hoosier nursing home  residents use Medicaid to help pay for their care. According to the  Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicaid supports more than 1.4 million  Americans in nursing homes across our country. Their care would be  threatened by this bill, which is part of why seniors' groups have been  so vocal in their opposition to the proposed Medicaid cuts in this  bill.   I have also heard from a number of school superintendents all across  my State opposing the Medicaid cuts because of the harm it would cause  to the thousands of students across the Hoosier State. Schools use  Medicaid funding for certain health-related services they provide,  including individualized education plans, special transportation for  children with disabilities, social workers, physical and occupational  therapists, and medical equipment at the schools.   Some school districts use Medicaid to help pay for health  professionals or for full-time registered nurses at schools across the  country, where they assist students with complex medical needs and  treat students with everything from illnesses to asthma attacks.   As school districts and local governments across the country continue  to make even more difficult budget choices, cutting off this critically  important source of funding creates just one more huge challenge. In  addition to trying to make up the lost funding, our communities and  States could be impacted in other areas as well, including  infrastructure, other education spending, police and fire, and other  local priorities.   The plan from my friends across the aisle undermines coverage for  millions, but we haven't even had a hearing on their proposal.  Committees haven't been able to go through regular order to examine the  merits of Medicaid and the Medicaid expansion and how gutting them  would harm millions of people--children with really complex medical  conditions, those struggling with substance abuse disorders, and  seniors in nursing homes trying to live with dignity and peace.   My motion sends this bill back to the Finance Committee to ensure  that we are protecting those Americans who are the most vulnerable  among our society. It would allow us to move toward strengthening  healthcare for our country.   If you believe we should support children and families with complex  medical conditions, then you should support this motion. If you want to  protect the 1.4 million seniors using Medicaid for nursing home care,  then you should vote for this motion. If you want to continue the  progress we have made fighting the opioid abuse and heroin use  epidemics, then I ask for your vote in this effort.   I firmly believe we can improve healthcare and build upon the gains  we have made if we work together--not as Democrats or as Republicans  but as Senators and Americans--in a bipartisan manner. This is not a  political game. The consequences are as serious as it gets, and the  American people are counting on us.   I urge my colleagues to support this motion.   Thank you, Mr. President.    Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion  to H.R. 1628 and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senators Casey, Cantwell,  Blumenthal, Leahy, Brown, Harris, Hassan, Franken, Feinstein, Udall,  Shaheen, Carper, Coons, Whitehouse, Kaine, Van Hollen, Cortez Masto,  Baldwin, Menendez, Reed, Duckworth, Manchin, Markey, Stabenow, Durbin,  Wyden, Murphy, Warren, Gillibrand, Cardin, Klobuchar, Heinrich, Hirono,  Booker, Peters, and Nelson.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Donnelly moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) strike provisions that will--        (A) reduce or eliminate benefits or coverage for       individuals who are currently eligible for Medicaid;  [[Page S4271]]         (B) prevent or discourage a State from expanding its       Medicaid program to include groups of individuals or types of       services that are optional under current law; or        (C) shift costs to States to cover this care.
