 Madam Speaker, I represent Newark, New Jersey, home of  Port Newark and Newark Liberty International Airport.   Port Newark is the busiest container port on the East Coast, handling  over 700,000 cargo containers annually. In 2015, over 37 million  passengers traveled through Newark Liberty International Airport,  including many traveling into the United States from abroad.   As a Member of Congress representing the largest port on the Eastern  seaboard and one of the busiest international airports in the country,  it is important to me that the Federal Government do everything in its  power to push out our borders--to prevent dangerous cargo and dangerous  people from coming into our country.   The DHS Overseas Personnel Enhancement Act of 2017 would do just that  by directing the Department to develop and execute an overseas  personnel assessment and enhancement plan.   As we speak, nearly 2,000 DHS employees are stationed around the  globe, engaging in terrorism prevention, counternarcotics, and  antihuman smuggling activities in more than 70 countries.   About half of DHS personnel deployed overseas are from Customs and  Border Protection, who are responsible for screening U.S.-bound  passengers at airports, inspecting cargo being loaded onto ships bound  for the U.S., and training other nations' customs and border forces.   The Department also sends Immigration and Customs Enforcement special  agents, Secret Service special agents, and Transportation Security  Administration officials abroad to help prevent international criminal  and terrorist activity from spreading into the United States.   These activities have a direct impact on the security of my district.  Over the course of the past year, multiple people have been caught  attempting to smuggle drugs into the country through Newark Liberty  International Airport, including a man who tried to bring over 1  kilogram of heroin into the country by disguising it as a six-layer  cake.   While I applaud CBP for apprehending bad actors as they attempt to  enter the United States, I would prefer to keep bad people and bad  cargo outside of our borders, particularly in light of the drug  epidemic affecting many of our communities.   Accordingly, I am committed to ensuring that the Department has  optimized the deployment of its international personnel.   Madam Speaker, therefore, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4567.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1486, the Securing American  Non-Profit Organizations Against Terrorism Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1486 would authorize the Department of Homeland  Security's Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which awards grants to  nonprofit organizations at risk of a terrorist attack, in statute.   Since early last year, nonprofit organizations throughout the United  States have experienced an uptick in threats, vandalism, and violent  acts. According to the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Semitic incidents  jumped 67 percent from 2016 to the first three quarters of 2017. Many  nonprofit organizations, however, do not have the resources to make  their facilities more secure by installing proper surveillance,  hardening their facilities, and undergoing general preparedness  activities.   The need for nonprofit organizations across the country to have  access to the Homeland Security grants to bolster security is  substantial. Given the security challenges associated with the current  terrorist threat environment, it is important that this critical  Homeland Security grant program be codified in law.   This bill goes further than just codifying the existing program. It  expands it to include jurisdictions that are located outside funded  UASIs but are still at risk of terrorism.   H.R. 1486 authorizes the Nonprofit Security Grant Program at $50  million, a $25 million increase over its current funding level.  Language similar to this measure was included in the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017, which passed the House  earlier this Congress.   I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, with the emergence of lone wolves and small terrorist  cells, we have seen that acts of terror are not just limited to urban  areas. As threats to our homeland continue to evolve and as violent  extremists continue to exploit soft targets, the risk to nonprofit  organizations grows. We need to make sure that we do our part to ensure  that places of worship and other nonprofit organizations throughout the  country have access to resources necessary to keep themselves safe and  secure.                                time  1315    H.R. 1486 was endorsed by The Jewish Federations of North America. I  appreciate its support.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letter of support.                                              The Jewish Federations                                                of North America,                                   Washington, DC, December 7, 2017.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul, Chairman,      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson, Ranking Member,      Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Daniel M. Donovan, Chairman,      Hon. Donald M. Payne, Jr., Ranking Member,      Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and           Communications, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen McCaul and Donovan and Ranking Members       Thompson and Payne: We commend you for scheduling the mark-up       of H.R. 1486, the Securing American Non-Profit Organizations       Against Terrorism Act of 2017. The Jewish Federations       strongly endorse this bill, and respectfully urge Members of       the Committee to adopt Ranking Member Thompson's amendment of       the bill in the nature of a substitute, in order to align it       with Sec. 2011 of House-passed H.R. 2825, the Department of       Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.        The vulnerability of places of worship to violent homegrown       extremists (HVEs) is a growing threat in the United States.       According to a joint assessment by the National       Counterterrorism Center, Department of Homeland Security       (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, HVEs are       increasingly favoring softer civilian targets, such as houses       of worship, having judged them to have lower levels of       security (and, for some, as a result of encouragement from       overseas violent extremists, such as ISIL).        Last month, the FBI released its annual hate crimes report       for 2016, which found that Muslim bias crimes increased ,       and, for the 20th consecutive year, anti-Jewish hate crimes       amounted to the majority of all religious bias crimes       reported. This year, synagogues, churches, mosques, religious       centers, cemeteries, and other nonprofits have been subjected       to arson/fire-bombing, shooting/mass shooting, attempted       bombing, death threats, robbery, vandalism/destruction of       property, hate-based/anti-Semitic graffiti, assault,       intimidation, and the targets of incitement to violence.        According to DHS, religious facilities share a number of       common vulnerabilities that make them ready targets of       attack, including unrestricted access to facilities and       contiguous and peripheral areas, easy identification,       predictable schedules, and large congregations of people. To       minimize these vulnerabilities, DHS recommends protective       measures that include, access controls, barriers, monitoring,       surveillance, and other physical target hardening and       preparedness investments, such as planning and training.       Unfortunately, DHS acknowledges that common vulnerabilities       also include the limited resources nonprofit institutions       have for security.        Passage of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to       H.R. 1486 would address the vulnerabilities of at-risk       nonprofit institutions, by authorizing a nonprofit security       grant program for the acquisition and installation of       physical target hardening, including fencing, bollards, and       other barriers; lighting, surveillance, and metal detection       equipment; blast proofing doors and windows; cyber-security;       and related employee training and awareness exercises.        For these reasons, JFNA strongly endorses H.R. 1486, and       respectfully urges Members of the Committee to adopt the bill       as amended.            Sincerely,                                             Robert B. Goldberg,                               Senior Director, Legislative Affairs,                           The Jewish Federations of North America.     Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support  H.R. 1486, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jordan Thomas, a senior  at Princeton University and a graduate of University High School in  Newark, New Jersey, for being selected as a 2018 Rhodes Scholar, one of  only 32 in the country.   This young man, who graduated high school in my district, is the  first Newark Public Schools student in over a decade to receive this  prestigious honor.   In addition to getting straight A's since his freshman year at  Princeton, Jordan is writing a thesis on school-based support services  that Newark Public Schools offers pregnant and parenting teens.   In the next year, he will be taking his talents abroad to study  social policy at Oxford College in England. Jordan plans to return to  his home of Newark as a public servant. He told the Star Ledger  newspaper: ``Newark built me. Newark shaped me.'' As a lifelong  resident of Newark myself, I know that feeling.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Jordan  Thomas for his successes, service, and future. His love for his  community shows that our country's future is in good hands.                            ____________________
