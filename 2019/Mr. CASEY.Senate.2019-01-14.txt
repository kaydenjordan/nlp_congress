 Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about the shutdown.  I know the hour is late. I will cut short my remarks.   But we are now, as you heard and as many Americans know, in day 24 of  the shutdown. This is a shutdown that the President, a number of weeks  ago, said that he--I am not quoting him exactly,  [[Page S185]]  but he seemed to want to have a shutdown, and then he went forward and  executed it even after this body, the Senate, voted unanimously just  before Christmas to extend funding for the government until February so  we could continue debates until then. But he chose to upend that and  now we have this shutdown lasting not just 24 days but now the longest  in American history. That is not a distinction any President or  administration or Congress--especially the majority here in the  Senate--should be proud of.   I think it is very clear that there is a way out of this, and the way  out of this would not foreclose--in fact, it would enhance--the chances  that we can have a fulsome, thorough, policy-oriented debate on border  security, which we should have. We should actually enlarge that to  speak to or debate a lot of major immigration issues and maybe come up  with a bipartisan bill like we had in 2013, where 68 votes brought  forward a bill out of the Senate that had probably the best border  security provisions in recent American history. It had a pathway to  citizenship. It was a long and arduous path but a pathway, nonetheless.  As well, it had guest worker provisions so that employers could have  order, rules, and certainty as to their workforce and our immigration  system.   We have a very broken system that we would have been 5 years, at  least, into the fixing of or the repair of if we had passed that bill-- or if the House had passed that bill. It had 68 votes in the Senate,  but it died in the House. We haven't seen a bill like that since-- certainly, not any bill that was as comprehensive.    Here we are with 24 days of government employees being held hostage  by the administration. I think there is some complicity here in the  Senate, as well, because we know there is a bill that would open eight  of the nine agencies. That bill is here in the Senate. We could pass it  tonight, tomorrow morning, or tomorrow afternoon. We could pass it very  quickly because--remember, the first act of a Democratic-majority House  was to pass Republican appropriations bills--they are bills that sailed  through the Republican-majority Senate with little to no opposition.   That is where we find ourselves, with a way out of this predicament,  which I believe would not only open up the government--which would be  good for the whole country and for both parties all across the country  and, especially, for the people mostly adversely affected--but it would  also isolate the issue. Right?   The President says that he wants to have changes made, and he has a  different view than I do, but let's have weeks of debate on border  security or everything else he wants to talk about. Let's bring in the  experts. Let's have a dueling set of experts. Let's see whom the  American people support. Do they support one point of view that says we  want border security or the other point of view that says that you want  a wall or some steel barrier? That is kind of the choice. Do you want  real border security or something else? We should have a debate about  that.   If anything, the debate about the shutdown would be set aside because  it would be over. The government would be opened. The country, the  press, the Senate, and the House would naturally focus then on issues  of dispute. That would isolate the issue.   But it is very difficult to maintain an argument or a reasoned  debate--a debate based upon facts and policy and law, and, I hope, on  the advice and consultation of border security experts, not just  politicians. We have a lot of smart people in the Congress, but very  few, if any of them, are border security experts. Let's listen to the  experts. Let's take testimony from them like they had back in 2013,  which undergirded the bill that got 68 votes. That would be a way to  isolate and focus on the issue, instead of bringing misery to what is  now hundreds of thousands of Americans--soon to grow to millions and,  then, tens of millions--because those who miss paychecks today are a  very big number. That number will grow when it starts to affect  government services, which I will outline rather quickly because of the  hour.   We have a lot of men and women in the country now working without pay  or being furloughed, worrying about whether they can make a mortgage  payment, put food on the table, or pay their heating bill. They don't  have a choice. They can't just say: Well, sir, I can't pay the bill  today because the government shut down. So just wait and you will be  just fine.   No, they have to pay the bill. Thank God we passed legislation for  backpay, but for some of these folks, backpay will not be enough  because their credit will be adversely impacted. Their credit may be  destroyed even if they get the backpay.   On Friday, 820,000 Federal workers, including 14,000 in my home State  of Pennsylvania, missed a paycheck--more than 1,300 Department of  Agriculture employees, 990 Department of Interior employees, 1,200  Federal Bureau of Prisons employees, 775 FAA and TSA employees, 700 EPA  employees, as well as assistant U.S. attorneys in different parts of  Pennsylvania.   I will share a small part of a longer letter that I got from a  constituent. This constituent said:         I am currently a furloughed U.S. State Department employee       and one of your constituents. I will soon miss a paycheck       and, with car payments, student loan payments, et cetera, on       the horizon, my family of five will likely suffer. Beyond our       personal hardship, this shutdown is both expensive and       counterproductive to border security.    I couldn't agree more with that constituent and with the argument  that constituent makes, but what is even more compelling, of course, is  not the argument about the policy debate here in Washington. The more  compelling part of that, of course, is missing car payments, student  loan payments, and a family of that size suffering. That is real life.  That is not just a Washington theoretical debate. That is real life for  that family.   How about farmers? These are people who are not Federal Government  employees, but they are affected by the fact that Federal Government  employees are not at their desks or not in the field. Farmers can't  visit their local Farm Service Agency office to get assistance.   We have a new farm bill. It is one of the great bipartisan  achievements. Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, came  together for a big farm bill. That is great. I am glad we got that done  at the end of 2018.   The bad news is that some of that requires advice, consultation, and  engagement with Farm Service Agency offices. They are not able to give  that assistance.   How about seniors who rely upon transportation services and nutrition  services provided by the Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals  with Disabilities Program? That and the Commodity Supplemental Food  Program, also known as the Senior Food Box, are now at risk of being  isolated. These seniors are now at risk of being isolated at home and  without food.   Approximately 2,400 units of low-income housing in Pennsylvania are  in jeopardy because the Department of Housing and Urban Development  will not be able to renew a contract. More than two-thirds of the  people who receive this type of assistance are seniors and people with  disabilities. The people who benefit from this type of housing  assistance have average incomes of less than $13,000.   Two million Pennsylvanians receive food assistance. It is actually  about 1.8 million, but it is almost 2 million Pennsylvanians who  receive assistance through the SNAP program, or the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program. We used to call it food stamps. They may  lose access if the shutdown drags on much longer.   I know the administration says: Don't worry. Everything is OK for  February.   That is, in essence, what the administration said, and they haven't  given us a definitive word about March.   So of those 1.8 million Pennsylvanians, a huge share of them have a  disability, and a huge share of them are children in households who  can't support themselves and can't afford food on their own because  they are children. They benefit, as well. They are part of the 1.8.   A lot of them, of course, are seniors who deserve this program  because that is what we do in America. We try to help people who need  food assistance. That is called being America--being the strong country  that we are, showing how strong we are not just by virtue of our  military and our GDP--everyone knows that. No one comes close  [[Page S186]]  in the world. But we are also strong because we say we care about  people with disabilities. We want to make sure if they need Medicaid,  they get that kind of healthcare. If they need food assistance, we will  get that for them. We care about our seniors, too, because we are  America and we are strong, and it is an American value.   These programs are important. When they are shut down, that is not an  American value being upheld. When we talk about these programs and  about food assistance, this is also real life--literally, today or the  day when you lose food assistance. Why should that assistance even be  the subject of uncertainty--uncertainty because someone doesn't get  their way on a policy matter here in Washington?   I guess it is OK for any Member of Congress because we are a coequal  branch of government. It is not like the President is higher than the  Congress. We are coequal. I guess because the President wants to shut  the government down to make a point about a policy matter, I guess that  should be an option that any Member of the House or the Senate should  exercise. So the next time, it will be a Member of Congress, when you  lose a battle on a policy matter or you don't propose the funding on  time, which is what happened here. They didn't ask for the money at the  beginning of the year. So they tried to shoehorn it in at the end of  the year. I guess if you lose the policy debate or your bill doesn't  pass, you vote to shut the government down--take action to shut the  government down like the President did.   I don't think that is the way any party or any country should  operate. So 200,000 Pennsylvanians may lose access to the Women,  Infants, and Children Program, which provides critical nutritional  support to mothers and young children--200,000.   So there are the 2 million I talked about. There are 1.8 million  people who are getting the benefits of the SNAP program, which, by the  way, helps all Americans. People ask: What do you mean by that? It  does. If you spend a buck on SNAP, you get $1.80 back in economic  activity because people have to eat, and they tend to spend that money  quickly. It helps everybody. So the SNAP program is not just a nice  thing to do for people who have disabilities or for seniors or  children; the SNAP program helps all of us because it helps to  stimulate the economy.   Even if you are disinterested in supporting this program but are  interested in having your own American economy grow, you should support  the SNAP program. It is also the right thing to do because it is a  darned good program. When you add 1.1 million people who are getting  SNAP and then 200,000 people who benefit from the WIC Program, you will  have gotten over 2 million just in one State.   These programs are not out of money this week or in the month of  January or in the month of February, but we don't know about March yet.  We haven't gotten any guarantees about March. Even if we get a  guarantee about March, what about April? That is far from guaranteed.  So that is what we are talking about here. Why should these people have  to wait? Why should a farmer have to wait weeks or months to talk to a  Farm Service Agency office? Why should families who have food  insecurity as part of their lives not be able to get something to eat  because we are having a policy debate here? Why shouldn't we give them  the certainty that they vote for us to ensure?   It is unconscionable and unacceptable, and I wish I could come up  with better words than that because they are not at all adequate. It is  unconscionable that children and moms and hungry Americans will suffer  because of this shutdown.   The President says he is concerned about crime and the flow of  dangerous drugs into the country. I agree with him. A lot of Americans  do, of course. Yet the shutdown is significantly impairing the FBI and  the DEA's law enforcement efforts. These are part of the list of  Agencies that are impacted. Agents are still doing their work to keep  the public safe. They are dedicated, and they are going to do their  work no matter what.   Yet, with many analysts on furlough, it is getting harder and harder  to work effectively to keep the public safe. I want an FBI that has all  of the resources it needs, with everyone on duty, with everyone  working. If the FBI is undermined because of the shutdown, we are less  safe. If the DEA, the Drug Enforcement Agency, is undermined because of  the shutdown, we are less safe. You don't have to be a law enforcement  expert to say that.   It goes on from there. I have more, but I will not because of the  hour. I will go back to the beginning.   There are adverse impacts today with people not being paid as of  Friday. That alone is compelling and urgent and insulting, frankly, to  us as Americans and is directly insulting to those families who don't  deserve this. It is going to get a lot worse, though. That number is  going to grow and grow, not just with those who are directly affected  with their paychecks and in their livelihoods and their credit ratings  and all of that but with people who depend upon the Federal Government  for help when they are vulnerable, when they are hungry, when they want  an answer to a question, when they want to close on a mortgage or do a  long list of other things.   For the life of me, I do not understand why we would not pass a bill  that is sitting in this Chamber that would open eight of the nine  Agencies--that are closed--until the end of the fiscal year, September  30, so the shutdown will be over for those eight agencies. Then you  would have one Agency, Homeland Security, that would get short-term  funding, which would be another reason we could continue the debate and  another way to focus attention on border security and anything else  anybody wants to talk about here. It would focus the attention on that  issue and remove the issue that is in front of all of us, which is that  25 percent of the government--and a lot of it affecting a lot of  people--is closed, shuttered, not working, not effective, not  delivering on results.   There is an easy solution here that not only does not close the  debate on border security--effective, expert-recommended border  security--but, if anything, enhances the possibility that there will be  a more engaged debate on border security. As I said, I hope it will  grow into a larger immigration debate.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
