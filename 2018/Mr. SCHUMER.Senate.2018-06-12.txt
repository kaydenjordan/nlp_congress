 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before I begin my remarks, I wish to  congratulate our Republican leader on becoming the longest serving  Republican leader in the Senate. My friend Leader McConnell reached  that milestone today.   It is no secret we disagree on a whole lot of issues, both political  and philosophical, but that doesn't mean we can't or don't work  together or that I don't admire the qualities which help make him the  longest serving Republican leader.   He understands his caucus and represents them well. He knows how to  fight, and he knows how to cooperate. The job is not an easy one so it  is a testament to his qualities that he has done it longer than anyone  in the history of the Senate.                               Trump-Kim Summit     Madam President, on North Korea, in the early hours this  morning, President Trump and Chairman Kim met in Singapore for the  first meeting between a sitting U.S. President and the leader of North  Korea. It was a welcome improvement to see the two of them having a  dialogue rather than engaging in name-calling and saber-rattling.  Certainly, Americans feel better about talking than name-calling and  threats of war, which had characterized the relationship up until now.   Though we are all rooting for diplomacy to succeed, we must be clear- eyed about what a diplomatic success with North Korea looks like. A  diplomatic success would be the complete, verifiable, irreversible  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula--nothing less. Why do we say  that? It is not to make any political points, but a nuclear North Korea  with ICBMs probably presents a greater danger to the United States and  the safety and well-being of  [[Page S3731]]  our country than any other in the world. It is imperative that we  actually get action here, not just photo ops. Previous negotiations  have sought the same goal, with good reason. In 1994 and 2005, those  negotiations yielded agreements that were, in fact, much more rigorous  than the initial communique issued by President Trump and Chairman Kim.  This communique lists denuclearization as a far-off goal but includes  no details about a pathway to achieving it; no details about how the  United States might verify that North Korea has disarmed when they  repeatedly lied in the past; no details about stopping the enrichment  of plutonium and uranium; no details even about the definition of  complete denuclearization, which has been a main point of contention in  previous negotiations.   Unfortunately, the entire document is short on details. As we have  learned, in the wake of the collapse of the 1994 and 2005 agreements,  North Korea is liable to backtrack on vague commitments as soon as it  is in its interest. Chairman Kim, like his father before him, has a  history of backing away from agreements. There is a great fear now that  Chairman Kim has won a major concession from the United States of a  meeting with our President, he may not go any further.   Now, as then, we must be wary of this probability. When trust is  lacking, it is best not to dive in headfirst and hope for the best but  rather to work slowly, transparently, and verifiably to build trust and  lock in concessions. It is worrisome--very worrisome--that this joint  statement is so imprecise.   What the United States has gained is vague and unverifiable at best;  what North Korea has gained, however, is tangible and lasting. By  granting a meeting with Chairman Kim, President Trump has granted a  brutal and repressive dictatorship the international legitimacy it long  craved. The symbols that were broadcast all over the world last night  have lasting consequences for the United States, for North Korea, and  the entire region.   For the United States, it is permanent proof that we have legitimized  a brutal dictator who has starved his own people. For North Koreans, to  have their flags astride those of the United States, it is a clear  symbol that they are to be respected and belong among the community of  nations, and their sins at home and abroad are beginning to be  forgiven. If the United States is unable to win concrete, lasting  concessions from North Korea, the meeting alone will be a victory for  Kim Jong Un and a defeat for President Trump.   Even more troubling, only an hour ago, President Trump agreed to  freeze joint military exercises with South Korea--a legal activity--in  exchange for the mere hope that North Korea will freeze its illegal  nuclear testing regime. Alarmingly, President Trump called our military  exercises with South Korea provocations. That is something North Korea  would say, not South Korea or the United States.   Again, it seems the President has undercut our foreign policy by  drawing a false equivalency between joint military exercises with our  allies and the nuclear testing of a rogue regime.   Ultimately, if this is the result, it will have failed President  Trump's own standard. The President has said that ``if North Korea  doesn't denuclearize, that will not be acceptable.'' President Trump  has not made much progress toward that goal yet and has given up  substantial leverage already: the leverage of joint military exercises  and the leverage of an audience with the President of the United  States.   Imagine for a moment if a Democratic President had gone to North  Korea in similar circumstances and came away with little more than a  handshake and a photo op. Imagine if a Democratic President had placed  the flag of the United States next to the flag of North Korea and met a  dictator on equal terms. The commentators of the rightwing media and,  in fact, the entire Republican Party would be shouting grave warnings  about the end of American leadership and the belittling of our country,  about selling out and appeasement.   We Democrats do not see it this way. We remain supportive of American  diplomatic efforts, in general, but are focused on significant,  substantive concerns with President Trump's preliminary arrangement  with North Korea. We want to see these efforts succeed and ensure that  what has just transpired was not purely a reality show summit.   Here in the Senate, we Democrats believe that means five things.  First, North Korea must dismantle or remove every single one of its  nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. Second, North Korea must end  the production and enrichment of uranium and plutonium for military  purposes and permanently dismantle its nuclear weapons infrastructure.  That means test sites, all nuclear weapons research and development  facilities, and enrichment facilities all have to be destroyed. Third,  North Korea must continue to suspend all ballistic missile tests.  Fourth, North Korea must commit to anytime, anywhere inspections for  both its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, including all  nondeclared suspicious sites. If inspectors reveal any violation, we  must be permitted to implement snapback sanctions. Lastly, any  agreement between the United States and North Korea must be permanent.   Let us hope this is not the final chapter in diplomacy with  Pyongyang. President Trump and his team must take stock in what has  happened, what North Korea has achieved, and what we have yet to  achieve and pursue again a tougher course. For the sake of our national  security, our interests abroad, and the safety of the American people,  the United States can settle for no less than the certifiable,  permanent denuclearization of North Korea.   I yield the floor.
