 Madam President, I have often come to the floor to  relay the stories of Kentuckians who have suffered under ObamaCare.   Under ObamaCare, Kentuckians have seen their premiums skyrocket--by  an average of 75 percent since 2013.   Under ObamaCare, Kentuckians have seen their options for health  insurance plummet. This year, families living in 90 percent of the  counties in Kentucky will have little or no options of insurers to pick  from; that is, two options or less.   We all know the statistics in our own States. We also know the pain  of ObamaCare is about far more than just numbers on a page. Behind each  of ObamaCare's unaffordable premium increases, there is a family  struggling to make ends meet. Behind all the canceled plans and  restricted choices, there are countless individuals who have been left  behind by this failing law.   Today Vice President Pence is traveling to Lexington in my State to  hear directly from my constituents, including small business owners who  have struggled under ObamaCare. As the Vice President knows,  ObamaCare's pain is about more than just skyrocketing costs and  plummeting choices; its taxes, mandates, and heavy-handed regulations  hurt too. They have subjected small businesses across the country to  serious challenges.   ObamaCare has been hurting the men and women we represent for many  years in many different ways. I am thankful we finally have an  administration that seems to care, an administration that has made a  real effort to actually listen to those who have been forced to endure  the negative consequences of this failing law.   ObamaCare has been spiraling toward collapse for years. Today it  teeters on the brink of total meltdown, threatening to hurt even more  of our friends and loved ones. We really can't allow that to happen.   Doing nothing about ObamaCare is simply not an option. That is why we  have been working hard to move beyond the failures of ObamaCare with  Better Care legislation. We want to stabilize and reform the collapsing  insurance markets, we want to put downward pressure on premiums, and we  want to put upward lift on choice. We want to give States dramatic new  tools that can drive a new era of improved health outcomes, especially  for those most in need, and we want to put more affordable insurance in  reach for Americans ObamaCare continues to leave behind.   If we sit on our hands, families will continue to suffer. If we let  this opportunity to move beyond ObamaCare pass us by, what other  options will there be? One idea from the Democratic leader is simply to  throw money at insurance companies--no reforms, no changes, just a  multibillion-dollar bandaid.   Another idea from many other Democrats is to quadruple down on  ObamaCare with a government-run single-payer system. It is called  single payer because there is just one payer--one payer: the  government. Nearly every healthcare decision would be decided by a  Federal bureaucrat. Taxes could go up astronomically. The total cost  could add up to $32 trillion, according to an estimate of a leading  proposal.   Now, Americans deserve better than a massive expansion of a failed  idea. Americans deserve better than a bandaid. Americans deserve better  than ObamaCare. What they really deserve is better care, and we  continue to work together to provide it. We are having productive  discussions about the future of healthcare, just like we should be  doing, and soon it will be time to move those discussions right out  here to the Senate floor.   Once we proceed to the bill, Members--Republicans and Democrats  alike--will have the opportunity to engage in robust debate and a  robust amendment process right here on the Senate floor. I am sure  Members will  [[Page S3934]]  have other good ideas then, and I hope they will offer them. They will  certainly have the opportunity to offer them, but if the Senate is  prevented from even proceeding to the bill, none of us will have an  opportunity--not Republicans, not Democrats, not anyone.   I regret that our Democratic colleagues made clear from the outset  that they weren't interested in working seriously with us to pursue the  kind of comprehensive reforms needed to truly move beyond the pain of  ObamaCare, but they will have a new opportunity soon. Once we get on  the bill, they will have another chance to offer their solutions. I  hope they will offer more than just a bandaid. I hope they will offer  more than just a $32 trillion reup of a failed idea.   Whatever they would like to propose, I hope they will take the chance  to open debate and advance the legislative process--for every Senator,  for every American.   Leaving the American people to suffer under the ObamaCare status quo,  I think, is unacceptable. We have seen the pain in our home States. We  have seen the heartbreak all across our country. The American people  are relying on us to bring them real relief, so we will keep working  hard to deliver just that.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, yesterday I shared  some data reflecting the historic level of obstruction Senate Democrats  have displayed when it comes to confirming our President's nominees. I  noted that the opposition they have shown to these nominees most of the  time seems to have little to do with the nominees themselves, nor  whether or not Democrats even support them. In many cases, our  Democratic colleagues actually support the nominees.   Take the nominee before us today for a U.S. district court judge in  Idaho. He was reported out of committee on a voice vote. Every single  Democrat then voted for cloture on his nomination. Yet Democrats still  chose to throw up procedural hurdles to a nominee for whom they have no  objection.   In fact, Senate Democrats have continuously forced procedural hurdles  more than 30 times, compared to only 8 cloture votes Republicans  required on nominees at this point in President Obama's administration.   They are obviously bound and determined to impede the President from  making appointments, and they are willing to go to increasingly absurd  lengths to further that goal--like requiring 30 hours of debate time on  a noncontroversial nominee after having just voted unanimously that  debate on the nomination was unnecessary.   If our Democratic colleagues keep up this current rate of  obstruction, only allowing about one confirmation every 3\1/2\ days, it  will take the Senate almost 11\1/2\ years to confirm the remaining  Presidential appointments that must come before us.   I will say that again. At this rate, it would take us nearly 11\1/2\  years to confirm the remaining Presidential appointments. That is why I  say to my friends across the aisle, this near total obstruction simply  cannot continue.   As the Democratic leader once said himself, ``Who in America doesn't  think a president, Democrat or Republican, deserves his or her picks  for who should run the agencies? Nobody.'' That is a direct quote from  the Democratic leader.   He went on. He said: ``The American people deserve a functioning  government, not gridlock.''   So I would again ask my friend the Democratic leader and his party to  consider the consequences of their actions and chart a different path.  That is the best outcome for the country and for the Senate.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
