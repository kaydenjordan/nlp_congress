 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my good  friend, Rabbi Claudio J. Kogan.   Rabbi Kogan has devoted his life to being a spiritual leader in the  Jewish faith and a leader in our community.   Rabbi Kogan is currently the director of the University of Texas Rio  Grande Valley School of Medicine's new Institute for Bioethics and  Social Justice. Since June 2018, Rabbi Kogan has led the School of  Medicine's efforts on ethical and social issues that affect south Texas  and the Nation.   Rabbi Kogan is a physician and an ordained rabbi. He earned his  medical degree from the University of Buenos Aires School of Medicine  and a master's of bioethics from the University of Pennsylvania.   Rabbi Kogan has also spent time as a member of the Institutional  Review Board at the Yale University School of Medicine.   Previously, he served as rabbi at Temple Emanuel in my district in  McAllen, Texas, and continues to serve as a chaplain for various law  enforcement agencies and hospital systems in the area.   Madam Speaker, it is my honor to have Rabbi Kogan and his family join  us here today in the people's House.                            ____________________
