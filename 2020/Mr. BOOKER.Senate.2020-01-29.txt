 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from New Jersey.    Thank you, sir.   Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk to be asked of the  House manager.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Booker's question is for the House  manager:         Even if a communication or a document is covered by       executive privilege, that privilege can be overcome by       showing the evidence is important and unavailable elsewhere.       On January 22, while this trial was underway, President Trump       said, ``I thought our team did a very good job. But honestly,       we have all the material. They don't have the material.'' Can       you comment on whether executive privilege allows a President       to conceal information from Congress, particularly if the       evidence cannot be obtained elsewhere?    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and I thank the  distinguished Senator from New Jersey for his question.   President Trump alone has the power to assert executive privilege. As  counsel admitted on Saturday, the President had not formally invoked it  over any document requested in this impeachment inquiry. This has not  been asserted as it relates to any single document. Executive privilege  gives President Trump a qualified form of confidentiality when he does  get advice from his aides in order to carry out the duties of his  office.   As I know you are all aware, it is often the case in congressional  investigations that a President will claim executive privilege over a  very small subset of materials. In that case, what the executive branch  usually does and should do is to produce everything that it can and  then provide a log of documents in dispute or permit a private review  of the documents that have been contested.   That is not what has occurred in this case because the President has  ordered the entire executive branch to defy our constitutionally  inspired impeachment inquiry. Blanket defiance is what has taken place,  and there is no right to do that.   Every court that has considered the matter has asserted that the  President cannot assert a privilege to protect his own misconduct, to  protect wrongdoing, to protect evidence that the Constitution may have  been violated. The President cannot do it.   In an impeachment inquiry, the congressional need for information and  its constitutional authority, of course, are at their greatest. It is  imperative to investigate serious allegations of misconduct that might  constitute high crimes and misdemeanors, and that is what is before you  right now.   Let's look at what the Supreme Court has said in circumstances that  are closest to what we face today--in U.S. v. Nixon--in the context of  a grand jury subpoena. The Supreme Court found that President Nixon's  [[Page S668]]  generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated need  for evidence in the pending trial, and the Federal court here in DC has  recognized that Congress's need for information and for documents  during an impeachment inquiry is particularly compelling.   Turning to the facts of this matter briefly, any argument that every  single document requested by Congress is subject to privilege or some  form of absolute immunity is absurd. There are calendar invitations,  scheduling emails, photographs, correspondence with outside parties  like Rudolph Giuliani. These are all important pieces of evidence for  you to consider and are not the types of materials subject to any  reasonable claim of executive privilege.   If you want a fair trial, it should involve documents. Given the  nature of these proceedings, documents like Ambassador Bolton's notes  and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's Presidential decision memo should also  be provided to you so you can seek the truth, the whole truth, and  nothing but the truth.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Louisiana.
