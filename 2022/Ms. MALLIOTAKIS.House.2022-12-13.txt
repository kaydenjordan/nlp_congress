 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  deadly consequences of President Biden's open borders.   In the last month, three Border Patrol agents have committed suicide,  bringing the total number of agents who have sadly taken their own  lives to 14 this year. That tragically adds to the 35 who have been  killed in the line of duty in 2021.  [[Page H9696]]    With President Biden tying the hands of our agents and enabling  lawlessness at our border, morale among the force has been crushed to  an unthinkable low--so low, in fact, that the CBP has hired a  suicidologist to help prevent further loss among its force.   Our CBP agents are overwhelmed, overworked, underfunded, and they are  demoralized. They put their lives on the line every day to defend our  Nation's borders while receiving no support from the top levels of our  government.   In fact, the President says that there are more important things  going on.   It should not come as a shock that so many are at wit's end.   While some have taken their own lives, many others have been  seriously injured or have made the ultimate sacrifice while on the  front lines.   In April, 22-year-old Texas National Guard Specialist Bishop Evans  was swept away in the Rio Grande while attempting to save two migrants  from drowning. We later found out that the two he sacrificed his life  for were actually attempting to traffic illegal narcotics.   Just last week, a 38-year-old father of two, CBP Agent Raul Humberto  Gonzalez was killed in an ATV crash while chasing a group of migrants  illegally crossing the border.   Perhaps if the cartels were not allowed free rein on our border to  smuggle drugs and to traffic humans, Specialist Bishop Evans and Agent  Gonzalez would be with us today.   No one has benefited more from this country's lax open border  policies than the cartels. The Drug Enforcement Agency has told us that  up to 70 to 80 percent of fentanyl in the United States comes into our  country over the southern border. We know the vast majority of fentanyl  is being manufactured in China and brought into our country over the  southern border straight into American cities poisoning our youth.    The Drug Enforcement Agency is telling us that is where it is coming  from, yet we continue to have an open border policy, and this body  refuses to act to secure our border.   Drug overdoses are the leading cause of death of 18-to 45-year-olds  in the United States, killing 100,000 Americans last year alone; three- quarters of those deaths are from fentanyl. One American dies every 7  minutes from this deadly drug streaming over our open border, and by  the time I finish this speech, there will be one more American lost.   Our babies are dying. Last month, San Francisco firefighters had to  use Narcan to save the life of a 10-month-old baby boy who came into  contact with fentanyl while playing in a park. In May, a 3-year-old in  California died from a fentanyl overdose, and in November of last year,  so did a 1-year-old child in Connecticut. In the last 3 months, there  have been two fatal fentanyl exposures in western Washington State  involving children no older than 2 years old.   The fact that our babies are overdosing on this poison should alarm  every single person in this Chamber. The silence from many of those on  the other side of the aisle and the Biden administration is, quite  frankly, sickening. And if you hear anything at all, they tell you that  the border is secure--a complete lie.   Biden's open borders have created full-blown national security,  public safety, and humanitarian crises in the United States, not only  for our law enforcement and constituents but for the migrants as well.   In fact, fiscal year 2022 was the deadliest year ever recorded for  migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border unlawfully with 853  migrant deaths. Many drowned in the Rio Grande. They perished due to  dehydration from battling extreme heat and difficult terrain or taken  deadly falls while climbing border barriers.   In June, 53 migrants were found dead in San Antonio after being  abandoned in a tractor trailer without air-conditioning or water. In  September, a migrant mother of two committed suicide in a New York City  homeless shelter. Her 15-year-old son discovered her body. Think about  the consequences he will have for the rest of his life.   Some have accused the Republicans who want to secure our borders of  being uncompassionate. The greatest humanitarian crisis in our country  is unfolding right before our eyes, and I urge our colleagues and our  President to work with us to take action to secure it.                            ____________________
