 Madam President, yesterday, as chairman of the Senate  Judiciary Committee, I had the honor of welcoming a group of important  guests to Washington.   The committee was joined by the families of some of the victims in  last month's mass shooting in Buffalo, NY, when a White supremacist  marched into the Tops Grocery store with an assault rifle and massacred  10 Black Americans in cold blood and wounded three others. Just weeks  after laying their loved ones to rest, these families flew to  Washington to deliver one very simple, straightforward message to  Congress: Do something. Do something to prevent the next mass shooting,  to combat the lethal threat posed by violent White supremacists, to  honor the memory of those who were slain in this horrifying act of  racist violence.   One of the family members who attended yesterday was Garnell  Whitfield, Jr., and his brother Raymond. Their mother Ruth Whitfield  was the eldest victim in this Buffalo shooting. She was 86 years old.   In the hours before her murder, Mrs. Whitfield just finished her  regular daily ritual, visiting her husband, Mr. Whitfield's father, at  his nursing home. The two had been married for 68 years, and in an  instant, she was gone. Her family is shattered.   During yesterday's hearing, Mr. Whitfield courageously voiced what  millions of Americans feel about the devastating run of mass shootings  in America: outrage. He asked me and the fellow committee members there  a really important question:         What are you doing? You were elected to protect us. Is       there nothing that you [can] personally [be] willing to do to       stop the cancer of White supremacy and the domestic terrorism       it inspires?    Mr. Whitfield concluded his testimony with the following words I hope  every Member of the Senate will hear. He said:         Mrs. Ruth Whitfield's life mattered. Your actions here will       tell us if and how much it mattered to you.    We heard the same sentiment from across the country--from Uvalde, TX,  to Chicago, IL. It is impossible to keep track of these mass shootings.  They have claimed so many innocent lives.   During this past weekend alone, our Nation was hit with at least 10  of them--10. Think about it: In this country, 10 in one weekend. In  many countries--most countries around the world--there are none. No  other developed Nation on Earth experiences this degree of bloody  carnage every day, every week. And if we want to prove to Americans  like Garnell Whitfield that the lives of their loved ones who were lost  really do matter to us, we have to do something in the Senate.   The first thing is simple: close the loopholes on the purchase of  guns. Currently, there is a bipartisan group of Senators working on  this issue. I commend this group, especially Senators Murphy and  Cornyn--Democrat and Republican--who are leading this effort.   We are also going to hold a hearing next week in the Judiciary  Committee over a phenomena which is equally embarrassing. Gunfire is  now the leading cause of death for kids in America. Did you hear that?  Gunfire, the leading cause of death of children in America.   We talk about protecting our kids, our highest priority. Well, the  guns are killing our kids more than automobiles, more than poison, more  than accidents in the home.    I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs.  Gillibrand) is necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 40, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 221 Ex.]                                  YEAS--59       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Crapo      Daines      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Graham      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Lummis      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Portman      Reed      Risch      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Scott (SC)      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--40       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Cruz      Ernst      Fischer      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Paul      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Tuberville      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--1               Gillibrand           The nomination was confirmed.
