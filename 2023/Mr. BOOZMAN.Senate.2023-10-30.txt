 Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to  outstanding educator Pam Cummings, the 2023 Arkansas History Teacher of  the Year.   Cummings has dedicated her life to education and teaching the next  generation of Arkansans. She started her career at a public charter  school in Little Rock before becoming a history teacher in the Benton  School District. For the last 12 years, she has shared her passion for  history with Panther students in a number of classes, including U.S.  history, advanced placement government, and world history. Her interest  in history shapes her lessons and that enthusiasm is passed along to  her students. When students see the real-world effect of what she is  teaching, it brings her joy to see the connection. In addition to  earning bachelor's degrees in journalism and political science, she has  master's degrees in American history and government and education  theory and practice. This leaves no doubt about her expertise and  excellence in the classroom. In 2018, Cummings was named a recipient of  the James Madison Memorial Fellowship for Arkansas. She has also served  on the Arkansas Coalition for Social Studies.   Celebrating its 20th anniversary, the History Teacher of the Year  award is presented by the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History,  the Nation's leading organization dedicated to K-12 American history  education. The award honors one K-12 history teacher from each State,  Washington DC, Department of Defense schools, and U.S. Territories.   Teachers shape the future. Arkansans can be proud knowing our youth  have such a talented and knowledgeable educator who is committed to her  craft. I congratulate Pam Cummings for this achievement and the  positive impact she is making on the community. I am confident her  efforts are inspiring a lifelong interest in history.                            ____________________
