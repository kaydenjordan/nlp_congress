 Mr. Speaker, the cost of everything is spiking,  from gas to groceries.   One of the main reasons for these spikes is that energy costs are  soaring. Affordable, reliable energy fuels our economy and our daily  lives.   But some of my colleagues don't like the affordable, reliable energy  that has built our economy and lifted billions of men, women, and  children around the world out of poverty. Why? Because this energy has  been provided by fossil fuels and nuclear power, energy sources  vilified by many wealthy elites and the activist class, those least  impacted by these high prices.   Make no mistake, when pipelines are blocked, new leasing on Federal  lands is stopped, and mines are forced to close, working families pay  the price.   This rush to green is a tax on working families, the middle class,  because a larger part of their paychecks is consumed by these  increasing prices on items necessary for daily life.   The American people should know, this race to green is not really  about carbon. It is about control.                            ____________________
