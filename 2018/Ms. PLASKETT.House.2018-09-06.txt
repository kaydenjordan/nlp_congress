 Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago today, Hurricane Irma struck my  home, the Virgin Islands of the United States. Much was lost, but we  were bent but not broken, and our good God has preserved our spirit.   This week, many Virgin Islands students return to school. Some still  await their facilities being prepared for them. It is a significant  step forward. It also serves as a reminder that there is much work yet  in restoring an environment wholly conducive to the needs of our  students.   After the hurricanes, both school districts lost estimates of $700  million in facility supplies and food for educational purposes. It is  incumbent on all of us--all of us--to put our shoulders in to push our  children forward.   I want to thank those who have been gifted with one of the most  important roles in our community: the hardworking teachers,  administrators, faculty, and staff who played an integral role in our  students returning to school this week in the Virgin Islands. We are  grateful for your efforts.                            ____________________
