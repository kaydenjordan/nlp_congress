 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of parents who  have the right to guide their child's education and to know what is  being taught in the classroom.   This body will soon vote on a great piece of legislation, H.R. 5, the  Parental Bill of Rights. This bill puts parents in the driver's seat  and makes students the priority, not bureaucrats or administrators.   It is hard to imagine who would fight against parental rights and  school choice, but just the other day, Democratic legislators in my  home State of Georgia were trying to stop several successful bills that  expand education options for families.   Shockingly, their reasoning was that low-income families are too  uneducated and poor to have a say over their own children's schooling.   If you don't believe me, here are the exact words of Georgia's 67th  House District Representative just last week: ``. . . they,'' meaning  the parents, ``are already in the lower 25th percentile, meaning a lot  of those parents did not finish high school, cannot direct, and could  not finish their own education.''    She continues: ``I am extremely concerned that we would put money in  their hands, that entire piece of life in the hands of parents who are  not qualified to make those decisions.''   Well, I think that is nonsense. The vast majority of Americans--moms  and dads and teachers and students--know that is nonsense.   History is littered by governments who thought they knew better, and  that people and parents did not know better, much to the detriment of  that culture and the ultimate failure of that government.   That is why I am offering two amendments to the Parental Bill of  Rights. The first one establishes the right of parents to be informed  about, and consent to, participation in any non-curriculum events or  activities.   We already do this for things that government schools deem important  like field trips, gifted programs, individual education plans, and free  and reduced lunches. I believe that parents' rights do not end at the  discretion of the administration.   Unfortunately, in recent years, some school systems have used the  classroom as a bully pulpit to push social engineering instead of  learning environments. This is not a partisan issue, and this has got  to stop. The way it stops is keeping parents informed of what happens  at school.   My other amendment guarantees parents the opportunity to address  their school boards regarding any violation of their rights. As we have  seen too often across the country, concerned moms and dads have been  silenced, thrown out, or threatened when standing up for their  children. This is unacceptable.   Families need accountability in their schools and a place to make  their voices heard. Fortunately, from Georgia to Virginia, from Texas  to Idaho, and yes, even from California to New York, we are beginning  to put students over systems and the people over a government, just  like the Constitution intended.   This revolution of school choice and parental rights will help  millions of families across America, and we are just getting started.                            ____________________
