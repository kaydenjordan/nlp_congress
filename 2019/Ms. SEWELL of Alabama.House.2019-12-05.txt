 Mr. Speaker, today I proudly rise to support  the rule on H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019.   Voting rights are primal. They are the cornerstone of our democracy.  No right is more precious to our citizenship than the right of all  Americans to be able to vote. When Americans are not able to cast their  ballots, their votes are silenced, and we, especially as elected  officials, should be alarmed if any American who wants to cast a ballot  is unable to cast a ballot.   What H.R. 4 does is it restores the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by  giving a new coverage formula. In fact, the Roberts Court specifically  said in striking down section 4(b) that it was outdated. So H.R. 4 is  our effort, the efforts of three committees, hours of testimony, lots  and lots of stakeholders, and lots and lots of people who were American  citizens not able to vote; it is that effort that led to a narrowly  tailored new coverage formula. That new coverage formula does not look  back to the 1960s or to the 1970s. It looks back 25 years, that is 1994  and going forward.   It requires adjudicated violations of voter discrimination. It is  narrowly tailored, and it hits the mark as to what the Supreme Court  requires us to do in saying that Congress could feel free to update its  coverage formula.   The Supreme Court and Roberts, in his opinion, also said that voter  discrimination still existed. It admitted that it still existed. And  H.R. 4 is our effort to actually provide a modern-day voter coverage  formula that will allow States and jurisdictions with the most  egregious forms of discrimination to be required to preclear.                                time  1300    The Shelby v. Holder decision originated out of Shelby County,  Alabama. I am honored every day to represent Alabama's Seventh  Congressional District. It is a district that knows all too well the  importance of voting.   You see, my district includes not only Birmingham and Montgomery but  my hometown of Selma, Alabama. It was on a bridge in my hometown that  our colleague   John Lewis and so many other foot soldiers bled on that  bridge for the equal right of all Americans to be able to vote.   This is exactly what H.R. 4 does. It restores the full protections of  the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In so doing, it provides a mechanism by  which the most egregious States and localities must preclear before the  elections. It is so hard to unring the bell once an election has  already taken place. So section 2, while it has been used to litigate  and to get good results, it only can occur after the election has taken  place.   So I say to you, Mr. Speaker, that this is not only an important  piece of legislation for our Nation to ensure that every American-- American--who has the ability, who is 18 years of age or older, has the  right to access a ballot box.   It is clear to me that since the Shelby v. Holder decision, so many  States have now instituted voter discrimination laws. Some of them have  been in the guise of voter fraud, but the Brennan Center and so many  others have found that voter fraud happens minisculely in any election.   It is not about voter fraud. It is about voter suppression,  suppressing the voices of certain Americans. And that is un-American,  Mr. Speaker.   Just the 2018 midterm elections alone highlight the voter  discrimination that occurred.   In Georgia, the Republican candidate for Governor used his power as  secretary of state to put 53,000 voter registrations on hold, nearly 70  percent of which belonged to African American voters.   In North Dakota, Republicans established a new requirement that  voters must show an ID that they live at a residential street address.  It was not enough that they had a P.O. Box. That law was a barrier to  thousands of Native Americans who live on reservations and use P.O.  Boxes rather than residential street addresses.    Mr. Speaker, as my colleague from Maryland has  shown, in Maricopa County, Arizona, which I think is where the  gentlewoman is from, there is still voter discrimination.   Mr. Speaker, this is a seminal piece of legislation that will restore  rights for the people. All of us, Republicans and Democrats, should be  about making sure it is easier to vote, not harder to vote.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the rule and the  underlying legislation, H.R. 4.
