 Mr. Speaker, I rise as a fierce defender from New  Mexico to support this amendment to defend our Social Security and our  Medicare.   As our colleagues across the aisle are trying to gut Social Security  and Medicare, Democrats are looking for long-term solutions not only to  expand these lifesaving programs but to ensure that they are solvent  for generations to come.   These programs are lifelines for people in New Mexico. In fact, in  New Mexico, we have the highest share of individuals who are on  Medicaid by population in the country. That is 873,000 New Mexicans who  depend on Medicaid. Our children in New Mexico depend on Medicaid. Over  half of our children are on Medicaid.   These programs save lives.   I ask my colleagues: What kind of cruel ransom note are they putting  forward that would gut these programs, that would gut programs that  feed our children, and that would gut our environmental programs in the  name of raising our debt ceiling?   Mr. Speaker, I ask: What is it that we are actually trying to do here  today?   That is why I oppose the underlying bill that we are debating today  and why I support this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and  to return to the work of the people who elected us.
