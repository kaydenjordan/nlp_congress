 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that we would  amend this rule, which then would make in order the Cole-McCarthy  amendment.   Now, that amendment would ensure the President can protect the United  States and our ally, Israel. I don't think that is asking too much.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend on the  Rules Committee for yielding me the time.   Our proposal to defeat the previous question and offer this amendment  would do no underlying violence to the two bills--it has nothing to do  with them--but it would save lives of all kinds of people in America.   You see, fentanyl is a synthetic, manmade opioid. It is 50 times more  potent than heroin. It is 100 times more potent than morphine. It is a  scheduled drug under the Controlled Substances Act. However, Madam  Speaker, drug traffickers are able to make small changes to fentanyl  and its chemical structure, and that creates a new variation of the  substance.   Now, these so-called analogues are not on the schedule of controlled  drugs. They are outside of the control of law enforcement, and they are  incredibly dangerous--may I say, deadly.   For example, one of these analogues, carfentanil, is 100 times as  potent as the same amount of fentanyl, 5,000 times more potent than a  unit of heroin, and 10,000 times as potent as a unit of morphine.   Now, the creation of analogues outpaced the Drug Enforcement  Administration's ability to schedule them, so the DEA used emergency  authorities to place all of the analogues in schedule I.   The Controlled Substances Act, the CSA, provides the Attorney General  with the authority to temporarily place a substance in schedule I of  the CSA for 2 years if he finds that such action is necessary to avoid  an imminent hazard to the public safety. In 2018, the Trump  administration's DEA used this authority to place fentanyl analogues  and fentanyl-like substances on that schedule I.   So here is the issue: The emergency scheduling order expires next  Thursday, February 6, and Congress has yet  [[Page H587]]  to extend it. The Senate passed an extension, Madam Speaker, I believe,  unanimously; but, so far, Democrats in the House have not acted.   There is no excuse for this. There is no reason for this. Lives will  be lost. We have seen a series of delay tactics, and that is leading to  an expiration of this incredibly important authority.   With the United States Senate dealing with impeachment, there is no  time for the House to generate a new product, a different bill, before  this expires. So the House needs to pass the Senate extension this week  so law enforcement does not lose or have a lapse on this important  capability to fight fentanyl, which is deadly, which is added to  heroin, which causes deaths all across America.   We are using this limited tool we have asking for a defeat of the  previous question so that we can offer this should-be-unanimous  amendment to get it on a vehicle so it can become law.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, the gentleman's passionate statements are  all accurate and true. It was not that long ago we came together as a  Congress, the last Congress, under my leadership of the Energy and  Commerce Committee, and passed nearly 60 pieces of legislation into  one, the SUPPORT Act, that deals with the opioid crisis, the substance  use disorder crisis in America, and one of the key points of that was  dealing with this illegal fentanyl that is coming in.   If we let this authority expire, the real practical consequence is  these evil actors, these chemists in their labs, will simply alter the  chemical makeup, which they do all the time, create an even more deadly  or powerful fentanyl that can go into heroin and other drugs and kill  our citizens, and they can do that lawfully because that new substance  will not be covered.   Now, we would hope the majority would move the Senate bill. But we  have seen no text; we have heard no schedule. This authority expires  next week on February 6, and we only have a legislative day or two  left.   Madam Speaker, lives hang in the balance. This, we should adopt.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, we agree on the fentanyl issue, I think.   My understanding is that the leader posted this, Madam Speaker, at  11:50 this morning, about a half an hour after we posted our previous  question proposal to bring this to the floor.   We are just curious what text, when it is scheduled. We need to  resolve this issue, we would agree.                                time  1345     Madam Speaker, I ask the gentleman when that will occur.
