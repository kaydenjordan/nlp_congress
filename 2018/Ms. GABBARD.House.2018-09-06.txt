 Mr. Speaker, for too long, the United States has turned  a blind eye to the atrocities being committed against civilians in  Yemen by the Saudi-U.S. coalition.   Just last month, the Saudi-led coalition dropped a U.S.-made bomb in  a devastating attack on a schoolbus that killed 40 children, just the  latest in the long string of horrors in this genocidal war that has  killed tens of thousands of Yemeni civilians with bombs and mass  starvation, creating the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Yet  today, in Yemen, our military continues to wage this interventionist  war alongside Saudi Arabia, unauthorized by Congress.   The time for crocodile tears and baseless platitudes is over. Enough  is enough. The U.S. must end its support for Saudi Arabia and stop  waging interventionist wars that increase destruction, death, and  suffering around the world, drain our resources here at home, and  threaten our own national security.                            ____________________
