 Madam Speaker, we know that more than 600,000  Americans and 3.8 million people worldwide have died as a result of  COVID-19. A recent study found that cases could have been significantly  reduced around the globe if interventions in China could have been  conducted just weeks earlier.   It is a widely accepted fact that China's obstruction and coverup  cost lives. It is simple: China lied and Americans died.   Also, despite mounting credible evidence that COVID-19 may have  actually originated from a Chinese lab, Congress has not held a single  hearing on the origins of COVID-19.   I am proud to be one of 200 Republican Members calling for these  necessary investigations. Americans have a right to know the truth, and  we must hold China accountable for their COVID coverup.                            ____________________
