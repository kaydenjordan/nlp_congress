 Mr. Speaker, none of us in this Chamber thought  that we would have a President, even as a Democrat, that would let the  country get this way. Strengthening our national security and  prioritizing the well-being of the American people should be a  bipartisan issue. This is the strongest border security bill to come to  the House floor in decades, but my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle refuse to support this commonsense legislation, instead using  terms like cruel, horrible, and heartless Republicans. The American  people won't fall for that. They don't fall for that.   The Biden administration has created a humanitarian and security  crisis unlike anything we have ever seen. They have outright refused to  enforce the law, prioritizing the livelihoods of illegal aliens over  American citizens. Drug cartels are running rampant. NGOs are handing  out debit cards and bus tickets to migrants paid for with our taxpayer  dollars. Human traffickers are targeting migrant children; it is  heartless to do nothing about that and let the status quo continue.   However, it gets worse tonight at midnight. When title 42 lifts  tonight at midnight, we will see yet another migrant surge to add to  the historic numbers this administration has already amassed.  [[Page H2270]]    The Secure the Border Act strengthens protections for migrant  children during a time when the Biden administration is losing over  85,000 unaccompanied minor children due to foolish and reckless  practices. This bill protects migrant children, American citizens, and  American workers.   H.R. 2 has my full support, and I urge my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle to join the American people in our fight to secure  our Nation.
