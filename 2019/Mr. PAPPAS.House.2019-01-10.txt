 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to say this is the first time  that I have addressed my constituents and my colleagues from the floor  of this House.   Under normal circumstances, I would be talking about creating new  jobs and new opportunities for my constituents in New Hampshire. I  would be talking about plans to rebuild our roads and bridges, to step  up our response to the opioid crisis. I would be sharing and discussing  ideas and proposals that can improve people's lives and move America  forward. But today's circumstances in this brand-new Congress are  anything but normal.   Instead of talking about how we can reform government, I am here to  plead with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to simply reopen  government.   Mr. Speaker, today marks day 20 of the shutdown. After nearly 3 weeks  without a paycheck, Federal employees across the country are grappling  with how they will pay their rent, their mortgage, and their utility  bills. They are anxious about putting food on the table and providing  for their kids.   With no end in sight, thousands of workers in my State of New  Hampshire are facing tough questions. What if the shutdown lasts months  or even years, as this President has threatened? What will that mean  for their savings, for their jobs, and for their families? Will they be  forced to leave Federal service simply to stay afloat?   The treatment of our dedicated Federal workers is completely  unacceptable. As someone who operated a family business with 230  workers, I can tell you that shutting your doors and cutting off pay  for your employees is no way to run a business. It is certainly no way  to run the greatest country on Earth.   Mr. Speaker, this is the people's House, so today I am lifting up the  stories of everyday Granite Staters, who are suffering because of this  senseless shutdown.   I am here on behalf of a furloughed IRS worker from Sandown. Her bank  is denying her the interest-free loan they promised Federal workers,  because the furlough letter the IRS gave her was too vague. And, of  course, there is no one around at the IRS to write her a new one.   I am here on behalf of an air traffic controller from Derry who just  transferred airports and has been told she may not get back pay because  she was furloughed prior to starting her new assignment.   I am here on behalf of an FAA worker from Hampton who is being forced  to take unpaid leave to look after his wife who is going through a  health emergency. He is worrying about how he can possibly care for his  spouse without knowing when his next paycheck is going to arrive.   These workers from my district deserve better from our Nation's  leaders, and so do each and every one of the American people.   This fall, voters sent an unmistakable message: the way Washington  works simply isn't working for them. They want less drama and  dysfunction, more compromise and more common sense. They want leaders  who will put the national interest before their own partisan political  interest.   Instead of business as usual in Washington, it is time for Washington  to start operating more like a responsible business that looks out for  its workers. That means ending the shutdown now and making sure all of  our outstanding Federal employees and contractors are fully  compensated.   We have got to do better. For the sake of the more than 2,400 Federal  workers in New Hampshire who are currently furloughed or working  without pay and the more than 800,000 across this country, let's close  this dark chapter by immediately reopening the doors of our government.                            ____________________
