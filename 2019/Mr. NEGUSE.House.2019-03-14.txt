 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership and  for introducing this incredibly important resolution.   Mr. Speaker, the investigation currently under way by Special Counsel  Robert Mueller is incredibly important: an open investigation into  incredibly serious allegations, potential obstruction of justice,  corruption, and possible links of coordination between President  Trump's Presidential campaign and the Russian Government, efforts to  meddle in our democratic process, and mislead and manipulate American  voters.   The allegations at the center of this investigation, as I said, are  serious, they are credible, and they are unprecedented. With 37  indictments and counting, it is of paramount importance that the  special counsel's report and the underlying evidence be made public for  the sake of transparency and trust in our government.   As a nation, as a Congress, and as a Republic, we need to know all of  the facts about this investigation and what unfolded between players in  the President's campaign and Russia in 2016. We must protect and  respect the work of Special Counsel Mueller, and his report must be  released, in full, for the Congress and for the American people to see.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the chairman for introducing this  resolution, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.
