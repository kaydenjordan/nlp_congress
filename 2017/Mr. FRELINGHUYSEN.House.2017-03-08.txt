 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 174, I  call up the bill (H.R. 1301) making appropriations for the Department  of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1301, and that I may  include tabular material on the same.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present H.R. 1301, the Defense  Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2017.   In total, this bill provides $577.9 billion in funding for the  Department of Defense: $516.1 billion in discretionary funding and  $61.8 billion in overseas contingency operations and global war on  terrorism funding.   When combined with the funding provided in the continuing resolution  supplemental enacted in December, total defense funding for fiscal year  2017 equals $584 billion, consistent with the top line provided in the  National Defense Authorization Act, and $10.9 billion more than fiscal  year 2016 levels.   Mr. Speaker, strengthening our national security and rebuilding our  military starts today, with this agreement,  [[Page H1640]]  the first step after years of cutbacks. Our Armed Forces and  intelligence community are currently operating under a continuing  resolution, which denies them stability and predictability, both of  which they have not had for many years.   H.R. 1301 provides that stability, removing defense funding from  under continuing resolution autopilot, preventing further damage to our  national defense and providing additional support for our men and women  in uniform and their families.   Our troops serve with honor in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, South Korea,  Japan, across the Baltics, the Sinai, and Africa on the ground, in the  air, and aboard ships across the globe doing the work of freedom.   Mr. Speaker, this agreement rejects the troop reductions proposed by  the previous administration, providing for increased end-strength  levels authorized by the NDAA: 1.3 million Active Duty troops and  813,000 National Guard and Reserve troops, all of whom work as one  team.   Our bill also fully funds the authorized 2.1 percent pay raise and  provides increased funding for Defense Health Programs to ensure full  care for all of our warfighters, their families, and military retirees.   This agreement also ensures that our Armed Forces have the training  and equipment they need to conduct successful missions. Funding is  increased for key readiness programs that prepare and train our troops  and that modernize essential military installations. It reverses the  previous administration's cuts to procurement, providing for additional  production of state-of-the-art aircraft and ships.   In addition, we enhance cyber and ISR programs, or intelligence,  surveillance and reconnaissance programs, capabilities our combatant  commanders badly need.   This reflects congressional priorities. We took into account the  views of each and every Member who worked with us throughout the  process. This is a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that deserves the  support of the House.   I thank Chairwoman Kay Granger for her efforts in bringing this bill  to the floor today and for taking over the leadership of the Defense  Subcommittee in January.   I also thank the subcommittee's ranking member, Mr. Visclosky, for  his contributions to this bill and the earlier bill. He has been an  excellent partner throughout this process, and I am grateful for our  continued strong working relationship.   In addition, I commend Nita Lowey, the ranking member of the full  committee, for her partnership and commitment to completing all of our  appropriations work.   Lastly, I thank the staff of the subcommittee that is behind me, both  minority and majority, as well as our personal offices and the full  Appropriations Committee for their tireless work putting this bill  together.   In particular, I would like to acknowledge Will Smith and David  Pomerantz, the outgoing staff directors for the Appropriations  Committee, both majority and minority, in this remarkable committee.  Both have made immeasurable contributions to the Appropriations  Committee in this institution, and we are indebted for their service.  We thank both of them and wish them both the best.   Mr. Speaker, today our Nation faces a dangerous and unpredictable  world. At the same time, our Armed Forces are struggling to have our  soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines fully trained and ready to meet  every conceivable threat. That important work to address that critical  situation starts with this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the agreement, and I reserve the  balance of my time.   EXPLANATORY STATEMENT SUBMITTED BY MR. FRELINGHUYSEN, CHAIRMAN OF THE           HOUSE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS REGARDING H.R. 1301         The following is an explanation of the effects of this Act,       which makes appropriations for the Department of Defense for       fiscal year 2017. Unless otherwise noted, references to the       House and Senate reports are to House Report 114-577 and       Senate Report 114-263, respectively. The language contained       in the House and Senate reports warrant full compliance and       carry the same weight as language included in this       explanatory statement unless specifically addressed to the       contrary in the bill or this explanatory statement. While       repeating some language from the House or Senate reports for       emphasis, this explanatory statement does not intend to       negate the language referred to above unless expressly       provided herein.                 DEFINITION OF PROGRAM, PROJECT, AND ACTIVITY         For the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency       Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-177), as amended       by the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control       Reaffirmation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-119), and by the       Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508), the       terms ``program, project, and activity'' for appropriations       contained in this Act shall be defined as the most specific       level of budget items identified in the Department of Defense       Appropriations Act, 2017, the related classified annexes and       explanatory statements, and the P-1 and R-1 budget       justification documents as subsequently modified by       congressional action.        The following exception to the above definition shall       apply: the military personnel and the operation and       maintenance accounts, for which the term ``program, project,       and activity'' is defined as the appropriations accounts       contained in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act.        At the time the President submits the budget request for       fiscal year 2018, the Secretary of Defense is directed to       transmit to the congressional defense committees budget       justification documents to be known as the ``M-1'' and the       ``O-1'' which shall identify, at the budget activity,       activity group, and sub-activity group level, the amounts       requested by the President to be appropriated to the       Department of Defense for military personnel and operation       and maintenance in any budget request, or amended budget       request, for fiscal year 2018.                            REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE         The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow       the reprogramming guidance for acquisition accounts as       specified in the report accompanying the House version of the       Department of Defense Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year       2008 (House Report 110-279). For operation and maintenance       accounts, the Secretary of Defense shall continue to follow       the reprogramming guidelines specified in the conference       report accompanying H.R. 3222, the Department of Defense       Appropriations Act, 2008. The dollar threshold for       reprogramming funds shall remain at $10,000,000 for military       personnel; $15,000,000 for operation and maintenance;       $20,000,000 for procurement; and $10,000,000 for research,       development, test and evaluation.        Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is       directed to continue to provide the congressional defense       committees annual DD Form 1416 reports for titles I and II       and quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports for       Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of       this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with       guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying       the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The       Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior       approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified       dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or       research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is       less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for       reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments.       Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of       a military personnel (M-1), an operation and maintenance (O-      1), a procurement (P-1), or a research, development, test and       evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the       Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval       reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In       addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval       reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest       items are established elsewhere in this statement.                              FUNDING INCREASES         The funding increases outlined in the tables for each       appropriation account shall be provided only for the specific       purposes indicated in the tables.                     CONGRESSIONAL SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS         Items for which additional funds have been provided or       items for which funding is specifically reduced as shown in       the project level tables or in paragraphs using the phrase       ``only for'' or ``only to'' are congressional special       interest items for the purpose of the Base for Reprogramming       (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be carried on the DD       Form 1414 at the stated amount, as specifically addressed in       the explanatory statement.                               CLASSIFIED ANNEX         Adjustments to classified programs are addressed in the       accompanying classified annex.                     BUDGET LIAISON SUPPORT TO THE HOUSE                     AND SENATE DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS                               SUBCOMMITTEES         The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees       rely heavily on offices within the Comptroller organizations       of the military departments and the Office of the Secretary       of Defense to conduct their oversight responsibilities and       make funding recommendations for the Department of Defense.       Established in the 1970s in accordance with a recommendation       of the Blue Ribbon Defense Panel, these offices facilitate       the appropriate flow of information between the House and       Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees and the       Comptroller of the respective department or agency. In the       early 1990s, the House and Senate Defense Appropriations       Subcommittees restated the  [[Page H1641]]       support these organizations provide to the Committees and       noted that ``while the various offices of legislative affairs       offer great assistance to DoD and the Congress, they do not       provide the expertise and the direct relationship to the       Comptroller organizations which are essential to the       effective communication between DoD and the Committees on       Appropriations.''        Further, the explanatory statement accompanying the       Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2016 echoed the       imperative to maintain the existing liaison structure to       achieve the highest level of communication and trust between       the Department of Defense and the House and Senate Defense       Appropriations Subcommittees.        The House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees       repeat this support for the budget liaison organizations and       reiterate previously stated concerns that efforts to       incorporate these organizations into the military and Office       of the Secretary of Defense legislative affairs offices would       be deleterious to the appropriations process and to the       utility of the budget liaison operation. Therefore, the       agreement retains a provision in title II of this Act from       previous years that prohibits the use of funds in this Act to       plan or implement the consolidation of a budget or       appropriations liaison office of the Office of the Secretary       of Defense, the office of the Secretary of a military       department, or the Service headquarters of one of the Armed       Forces into a legislative affairs or legislative liaison       office.                            CYBERSPACE ACTIVITIES         The agreement fully funds the fiscal year 2017 base budget       requirement of $6,734,000,000 for the Army, Navy, Marine       Corps, Air Force, and the defense agencies cyberspace       activities, an increase of $992,000,000 over the fiscal year       2016 enacted level.        While the Service and defense-wide budget justification       material, as well as the Department of Defense classified       cyberspace activities information technology investments       budget justification materials, provide some level of detail,       much of the funding is encompassed within larger programs and       funding lines, which limits visibility and congressional       oversight of requested funding for cyberspace activities       specifically.        Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the Department of Defense       Chief Information Officer is directed to modify the       cyberspace activities exhibit in order to provide increased       visibility and clarity into the cyberspace activities funding       requirements and changes to funding requirements from the       previous fiscal year enacted levels, to segregate civilian       and military pay, and to provide a crosswalk between the       cyberspace activities justification books and the Services       and defense-wide budget justification material.        Further, in order to provide additional clarity and to       enhance oversight, the Department of Defense Chief       Information Officer, in coordination with the Under Secretary       of Defense (Comptroller) and the Service Secretaries, is       directed to conduct a review of the budget justification       material and provide a proposal to the House and Senate       Appropriations Committees not later than September 1, 2017,       for how to clearly delineate the Department of Defense cyber       investment activities requested in the operation and       maintenance, procurement, and research, development, test and       evaluation accounts as part of the budget justification       material beginning with the fiscal year 2019 budget       submission. The Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and       the Chief Information Officer are encouraged to consider       establishing a unique cyber sub-activity group for operation       and maintenance accounts and individual cost codes, projects,       or program elements for procurement and research,       development, test and evaluation accounts as part of this       review.        The Department of Defense cyberspace activities table       provided shows the amount of funding provided to each Service       and defense-wide account in fiscal years 2016 and 2017.       Funding appropriated therein may be used only for cyberspace       activities as defined by the classified cyberspace activities       information technology investment budget request for fiscal       year 2017. The Secretary of Defense is directed to use normal       prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funding       out of any operation and maintenance, procurement, or       research, development, test and evaluation accounts as       identified in the table titled ``Department of Defense       Cyberspace Activities'' for any purpose other than cyberspace       activities. The Department of Defense Chief Information       Officer shall submit to the House and Senate Appropriations       Committees two reports not later than May 30, 2017, and       November 30, 2017, which provide the mid-year and end of       fiscal year financial obligation and execution data for       cyberspace activities of each year.        This language replaces the language included under the       heading ``Cyberspace Operations'' in House Report 114-577.

TITLE I--MILITARY PERSONNEL         The agreement provides $128,725,978,000 in Title I,       Military Personnel.

The agreement also provides the funding       necessary to support a 2.1 percent pay raise for all military       personnel, as authorized, effective January 1, 2017.            reprogramming guidance for military personnel accounts         The Secretary of Defense is directed to submit the Base for       Reprogramming (DD Form 1414) for each of the fiscal year 2017       appropriations accounts not later than 60 days after the       enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Defense is prohibited       from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any       purpose other than originally appropriated until the       aforementioned report is submitted to the House and Senate       Appropriations Committees.        The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal       prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in       the Services' military personnel accounts between budget       activities in excess of $10,000,000.                  military personnel special interest items         Items for which additional funds have been provided or have       been specifically reduced as shown in the project level       tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ``only for'' or       ``only to'' in the explanatory statement are congressional       special interest items for the purpose of the Base for       Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be       carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as       specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below       Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or       reduce funding from congressional special interest items as       identified on the DD Form 1414.                                military bands         Military bands honor and celebrate warfighters, promote       patriotism during community events, inspire servicemembers,       and enhance efforts to recruit and retain troops. Band       engagements play an important support role for national       security and joint operations, opening diplomatic doors for       political and military discussions while building trust and       confidence with foreign military and civilian authorities.       However, the activities of military bands must not detract       from the core competencies of the military. The Secretary of       Defense should review opportunities to ensure that only the       critical functions of military bands are supported while       minimizing impacts on funding for essential readiness,       military personnel, modernization, and research and       development activities.

The Secretary of Defense is prohibited       from executing any reprogramming or transfer of funds for any       purpose other than originally appropriated until the       aforementioned report is submitted to the House and Senate       Appropriations Committees.        The Secretary of Defense is directed to use the normal       prior approval reprogramming procedures to transfer funds in       the Services' operation and maintenance accounts between O-1       budget activities in excess of $15,000,000. In addition, the       Secretary of Defense should follow prior approval       reprogramming procedures for transfers in excess of       $15,000,000 out of the following budget sub-activities:        Army:        Maneuver units        Modular support brigades        Land forces operations support        Force readiness operations support        Land forces depot maintenance        Base operations support        Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization        Navy:        Mission and other flight operations        Aircraft depot maintenance        Mission and other ship operations        Ship depot maintenance        Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization        Marine Corps:        Depot maintenance        Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization        Air Force:        Primary combat forces        Combat enhancement forces        Operating forces depot maintenance        Facilities sustainment, restoration, and modernization        Mobilization depot maintenance        Training and recruiting depot maintenance        Administration and service-wide depot maintenance        Air Force Reserve:        Depot maintenance        Air National Guard:        Depot maintenance        Additionally, the Secretary of Defense should follow prior       approval reprogramming procedures for transfers in excess of       $15,000,000 into the following budget sub-activity:        Operation and Maintenance, Army National Guard:        Other personnel support/recruiting and advertising        With respect to Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide,       proposed transfers of funds to or from the levels specified       for defense agencies in excess of $15,000,000 shall be       subject to prior approval reprogramming procedures.               OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS         Items for which additional funds have been provided or have       been specifically reduced as shown in the project level       tables or in paragraphs using the phrase ``only for'' or       ``only to'' in the explanatory statement are congressional       special interest items for the purpose of the Base for       Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of these items must be       carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated amount as       specifically addressed in the explanatory statement. Below       Threshold Reprogrammings may not be used to either restore or       reduce funding from congressional special interest items as       identified on the DD Form 1414.                                  READINESS         The agreement provides additional readiness funds for the       Services within the operation and maintenance accounts. This       funding shall be used only to improve military readiness,       including increased training, depot maintenance, and base       operations support. None of the funding provided may be used       for recruiting, marketing, or advertising programs. The       funding provided is a congressional special interest item.       The Secretary of Defense and the Service Secretaries are       directed to submit a detailed spending plan by sub-activity       group to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees not       less than 30 days prior to the obligation of these funds.       These transfers may be implemented 30 days after       congressional notification unless an objection is received       from either the House or Senate Appropriations Committees.                     ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT         The agreement does not include a provision included in the       House-passed version of H.R. 5293 that referenced the Energy       Independence and Security Act of 2007. It is noted that the       enforcement of section 526 of the Energy Independence and       Security Act of 2007 may lead to higher fuel costs for       federal fleets in the absence of competitively priced new       generation fuels that emit fewer emissions. In carrying out       this statute, the Secretary of Defense and the Service       Secretaries should work to ensure that costs associated with       fuel purchases necessary to carry out their respective       missions should be minimized to the greatest extent possible.                              CIVILIAN PAY RAISE         Although the agreement does not include additional funds       specifically for the civilian pay increase from 1.6 percent       to 2.1 percent, sufficient funding is available within the       appropriations accounts to fully fund the increase due to       assets created by the civilian hiring freeze and the extended       length of H.R. 2028, theFurther Continuing and Security       Assistance Appropriations Act, 2017.                          AQUEOUS FILM FORMING FOAM         The use of the fire-extinguishing agent Aqueous Film       Forming Foam (AFFF) by the Department of Defense has been       linked to elevated levels of perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs)       on military bases and in neighboring communities. According       to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the       National Institutes of Health, PFCs have adverse impacts on       human health. The Navy and Air Force have begun remediation       of PFC contamination. The Secretary of Defense is encouraged       to require all Services to establish procedures for prompt       and cost-effective remediation. In addition, the Secretary of       Defense is directed to submit a report to the congressional       defense committees not later than 120 days after the       enactment of this Act that assesses the number of formerly       used and current military installations where AFFF was or is       currently used and the impact of PFC contaminated drinking       water on surrounding communities. The report should also       include plans for prompt community notification of such       contamination, when the contamination was detected, and the       procedures for timely remediation.

The agreement on items addressed by either the       House or the Senate is as follows:  [[Page H1728]]       [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH08MR17.063         [[Page H1729]]                    REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS         The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow       the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report       accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense       Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110-      279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming       funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and       $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.        Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is       directed to continue to provide the congressional defense       committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports       for Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of       this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the       guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying       the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The       Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior       approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified       dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or       research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is       less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for       reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments.       Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of       a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test and       evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the       Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval       reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In       addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval       reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest       items are established elsewhere in this statement.                              FUNDING INCREASES         The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be       provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the       tables.                      PROCUREMENT SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS         Items for which additional funds have been provided as       shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the       phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in the explanatory       statement are congressional special interest items for the       purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of       these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated       amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory       statement.          JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER BUDGET JUSTIFICATIONS AND CONTRACTING         Throughout the fiscal year 2017 budget review process, the       Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Joint Program Office provided       insufficient justification and incomplete information in an       untimely manner. It is imperative that requested information       is received promptly for proper congressional oversight of       this major defense acquisition program.        It is understood that the Secretary of Defense is reviewing       potential alternative management structures for the JSF       program as directed by the National Defense Authorization Act       for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328). This review will       provide an opportunity to improve communication between the       JSF Program Executive Officer (PEO), the Services, and the       congressional defense committees to ensure the program's       funding requirements are fully understood, communicated, and       justified.        Additionally, there is concern that the number of F-35s       enacted in annual Department of Defense Appropriations Acts       are not being placed on contract by the JSF PEO in a timely       manner. Four F-35s included in the Department of Defense       Appropriations Act, 2015 and 13 F-35s included in the       Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2016 were not part       of their respective low rate initial production (LRIP)       contracts due to the PEO's contracting strategy.       Specifically, only four F-35Cs were included on LRIPs 9 and       10, rather than the ten F-35Cs enacted in the Department of       Defense Appropriations Acts, 2015 and 2016, impeding       production efficiencies. The agreement directs the JSF PEO to       use a contracting approach that would award all aircraft       included in each Department of Defense Appropriations Act on       the respective production contract for that fiscal year. The       agreement includes funding for 74 F-35 aircraft. The JSF PEO       is directed to brief the congressional defense committees not       later than 45 days after the enactment of this Act on the       contracting strategy for these aircraft.                         AIRCRAFT PROCUREMENT, ARMY         The agreement on items addressed by either the House or the       Senate is as follows:  [[Page H1730]]       [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH08MR17.064         [[Page H1731]]       [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH08MR17.065         [[Page H1732]]       [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH08MR17.066         [[Page H1733]]                         UH-72 LAKOTA LIGHT UTILITY HELICOPTER         The agreement provides $187,000,000 to procure 28 UH-72       Lakota Light Utility Helicopters for the Army in support of       ongoing mission requirements at the Army Aviation Center of       Excellence at Fort Rucker, the Combat Training Centers, and       the Army Test and Evaluation Center. The agreement notes that       this investment is consistent with previous appropriations       and was included in the Army's unfunded priority list. The       Secretary of the Army is encouraged to request funding for       UH-72 Lakota Light Utility Helicopters to address ongoing       mission requirements in future budget submissions.

Additionally, the Navy is addressing increasing ballistic and       cruise missile threats through the development and       acquisition of an Air and Missile Defense Radar, which is       planned for integration on the DDG-51 class of ships through       an engineering change proposal, resulting in a new Flight III       configuration. However, a recent Government Accountability       Office report (GAO 16-613) details concerns regarding a lack       of sufficient acquisition and limited detail design knowledge       to support the Navy's current Flight III procurement       strategy. Further concerns remain regarding the full costs of       DDG-51 Flight III destroyers. Therefore, the Secretary of the       Navy should award and complete the additional DDG-51 ship,       fully funded in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, as an additional       DDG-51 Flight IIA ship. The Secretary of the Navy is directed       to expeditiously award this ship construction contract.                  polar icebreaker recapitalization project         The Navy and the Coast Guard are collaborating to refine       requirements and an acquisition strategy for procurement of       an affordable polar icebreaker. This collaboration continues       to refine program costs and requirements in an effort to       award a detailed design and construction contract for the       lead ship in fiscal year 2019.

The agreement on       items addressed by either the House or the Senate is as       follows:  [[Page H1820]]       [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TH08MR17.137         [[Page H1821]]                    REPROGRAMMING GUIDANCE FOR ACQUISITION ACCOUNTS         The Secretary of Defense is directed to continue to follow       the reprogramming guidance as specified in the report       accompanying the House version of the Department of Defense       Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2008 (House Report 110-      279). Specifically, the dollar threshold for reprogramming       funds shall remain at $20,000,000 for procurement and       $10,000,000 for research, development, test and evaluation.        Also, the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is       directed to continue to provide the congressional defense       committees quarterly, spreadsheet-based DD Form 1416 reports       for Service and defense-wide accounts in titles III and IV of       this Act. Reports for titles III and IV shall comply with the       guidance specified in the explanatory statement accompanying       the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006. The       Department shall continue to follow the limitation that prior       approval reprogrammings are set at either the specified       dollar threshold or 20 percent of the procurement or       research, development, test and evaluation line, whichever is       less. These thresholds are cumulative from the base for       reprogramming value as modified by any adjustments.       Therefore, if the combined value of transfers into or out of       a procurement (P-1) or research, development, test and       evaluation (R-1) line exceeds the identified threshold, the       Secretary of Defense must submit a prior approval       reprogramming to the congressional defense committees. In       addition, guidelines on the application of prior approval       reprogramming procedures for congressional special interest       items are established elsewhere in this statement.                              FUNDING INCREASES         The funding increases outlined in these tables shall be       provided only for the specific purposes indicated in the       tables.      RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND EVALUATION SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS         Items for which additional funds have been provided as       shown in the project level tables or in paragraphs using the       phrase ``only for'' or ``only to'' in the explanatory       statement are congressional special interest items for the       purpose of the Base for Reprogramming (DD Form 1414). Each of       these items must be carried on the DD Form 1414 at the stated       amount as specifically addressed in the explanatory       statement.                 JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER FOLLOW-ON MODERNIZATION         The Joint Strike Fighter Program Executive Officer is       directed to comply with the reporting requirement included       under the heading ``Joint Strike Fighter Follow-on       Modernization'' in Senate Report 114-263. The Secretary of       Defense is not required to comply with the reporting       requirement included under the heading ``Joint Strike Fighter       Follow-on Development'' in House Report 114-577.

To limit such transfers and improve       oversight within the Defense Health Program operation and       maintenance account, the agreement includes a provision which       caps the funds available for Private Sector Care under the       TRICARE program subject to prior approval reprogramming       procedures. The provision and accompanying explanatory       statement language should not be interpreted as limiting the       amount of funds that may be transferred to the In-House Care       budget sub-activity from other budget sub-activities within       the Defense Health Program. In addition, funding for the In-      House Care budget sub-activity continues to be designated as       a congressional special interest item. Any transfer of funds       from the In-House Care budget sub-activity into the Private       Sector Care budget sub-activity or any other budget sub-      activity requires the Secretary of Defense to follow prior       approval reprogramming procedures for operation and       maintenance funds.        The Secretary of Defense is directed to provide written       notification to the congressional defense committees of       cumulative transfers in excess of $10,000,000 out of the       Private Sector Care budget sub-activity not later than       fifteen days after such a transfer. Furthermore, the       Secretary of Defense is directed to provide a report to the       congressional defense committees not later than 30 days after       the enactment of this Act that delineates transfers of funds       in excess of $10,000,000, and the dates any transfers       occurred, from the Private Sector Care budget sub-activity to       any other budget sub-activity groups for fiscal year 2016.        The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) is       directed to provide quarterly reports to the congressional       defense committees on budget execution data for all of the       Defense Health Program budget activities and to adequately       reflect changes to the budget activities requested by the       Services in future budget submissions.                    PEER-REVIEWED CANCER RESEARCH PROGRAM         The agreement provides $60,000,000 for the peer-reviewed       cancer research program to research cancers not addressed in       the breast, prostate, ovarian, kidney, and lung cancer       research programs.        The funds provided in the peer-reviewed cancer research       program are directed to be used to conduct research in the       following areas: bladder cancer, brain cancer, colorectal       cancer, immunotherapy, listeria-based regimens for cancer,       liver cancer, lymphoma, melanoma and other skin cancers,       mesothelioma, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer, pediatric       brain tumors, stomach cancer, and cancer in children,       adolescents, and young adults.        The reports directed under this heading in House Report       114-577 and Senate Report 114-263 are still required.                    PEER-REVIEWED MEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAM         The agreement provides $300,000,000 for a peer-reviewed       medical research program. The Secretary of Defense, in       conjunction with the Service Surgeons General, is directed to       select medical research projects of clear scientific merit       and direct relevance to military health. Research areas       considered under this funding are restricted to the following       areas: acute lung injury, antimicrobial resistance,       arthritis, burn pit exposure, chronic migraine and post-      traumatic headache, congenital heart disease, constrictive       bronchiolitis, diabetes, diarrheal diseases, dystonia, early       trauma thermal regulation, eating disorders, emerging       infectious diseases, epidermolysis bullosa, focal segmental       glomerulosclerosis, Fragile X, Guillain-Barre syndrome,       hepatitis B and C, hereditary angioedema, hydrocephalus,       immunomonitoring of intestinal transplants, inflammatory       bowel diseases, influenza, integrative medicine, interstitial       cystitis, malaria, metals toxicology, mitochondrial disease,       musculoskeletal disorders, nanomaterials for bone       regeneration, non-opioid pain management, pancreatitis,       pathogen-inactivated dried cryoprecipitate, polycystic kidney       disease, post-traumatic osteoarthritis, pulmonary fibrosis,       respiratory health, Rett syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis,       scleroderma, sleep disorders, spinal muscular atrophy,       sustained-release drug delivery, tinnitus, tuberculosis,       vaccine development for infectious disease, vascular       malformations, and women's heart disease. The additional       funding provided under the peer-reviewed medical research       program shall be devoted only to the purposes listed above.                       ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM         Concerns remain with the progress being made by the       Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to fully develop,       procure, and deploy an interoperable electronic health record       solution. The two systems must be completely and meaningfully       interoperable, and the Under Secretary of Defense       (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) is encouraged to       focus on the overall goal of seamless compatibility between       the two Departments' electronic health record systems.        For the necessary oversight of this important program, the       Program Executive Officer (PEO) for the Defense Healthcare       Management Systems (DHMS) is directed to provide quarterly       reports to the congressional defense committees and the       Government Accountability Office on the cost and schedule of       the program, to include milestones, knowledge points, and       acquisition timelines, as well as quarterly obligation       reports. These reports should also include any changes to the       deployment timeline, including benchmarks, for full operating       capability; any refinements to the cost estimate for full       operating capability and the total lifecycle cost of the       program; an assurance that the acquisition strategy will       comply with the acquisition rules, requirements, guidelines,       and systems acquisition management practices of the federal       government; the status of the effort to achieve       interoperability between the electronic health record systems       of the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, including       the scope, cost, schedule, mapping to health data standards,       and performance benchmarks of the interoperable record; and       the progress toward developing, implementing, and fielding       the interoperable electronic health record throughout the two       Departments' medical facilities.        The PEO DHMS is directed to continue briefing the House and       Senate Appropriations Committees on a quarterly basis,       coinciding with the report submission. Given that full       deployment of the new electronic health record is not       scheduled until fiscal year 2022, the Department of Defense       is expected to continue working on interim modifications and       enhancements to the current system to improve       interoperability in the near-term. Additionally, the PEO DHMS       is directed to provide written notification to the House and       Senate Appropriations Committees prior to obligating any       contract, or combination of contracts, for electronic health       record systems in excess of $5,000,000.        Additionally, the Director of the Interagency Program       Office is directed to continue to provide quarterly briefings       on standards development, how those standards are being       incorporated by the two Departments, and the progress of       interoperability to the House and Senate Appropriations       Subcommittees for Defense and Military Construction, Veterans       Affairs, and Related Agencies. In an effort to ensure       government-wide accountability, the PEO DHMS, in coordination       with the appropriate personnel of the Department of Veterans       Affairs, is directed to provide the Federal Chief Information       Officer of the United States with monthly updates on progress       made by the two Departments to reach interoperability and       modernize their respective electronic health records.

To preserve the essential       joint capabilities of the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat       Organization (JIDO) and eliminate any duplication with       Service capabilities, the agreement recommends transferring       $62,800,000 to the Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide       account in title IX.        The budget request proposed consolidating the sub-accounts       under the appropriation into a single account titled Rapid       Acquisition and Threat Response. This flexibility would allow       for quick reaction changes in spending; however, it would       prevent the congressional defense committees from having any       insight into why or when these funding changes occur.       Therefore, the agreement provides the following funding       levels for JIDO programs: $101,286,000 for Rapid Capability       Delivery; $200,886,000 for Assist Situational Understanding;       and $37,300,000 for Enable Department of Defense       Responsiveness. The Director of the JIDO is directed to       provide quarterly reports to the congressional defense       committees should funding be shifted between the accounts not       later than 15 days after the end of the fiscal quarter.                      OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL         The agreement provides $22,062,000 for the Office of the       Inspector General.
