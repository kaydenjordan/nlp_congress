 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss something that has  been on my mind--discuss an issue that we have been talking about and  we have been holding hearings in both the Budget Committee and the Ways  and Means Committee, and that is the state of our economy, which I  would characterize as the dire state of our economy, which I believe--I  will demonstrate with some charts this evening--is due to the reckless  budgetary policies of this administration.   What I am talking about is today we have inflation at 8.6 percent,  which is the highest level in over 40 years. We also have a GDP, or  gross domestic product, the total output of our economy that is  shrinking in the first quarter. It shrank 1.4 percent. We may well be  on the way to a recession if the second quarter shows that it is  shrinking as well.   So there is no better time than right now to renew our Nation's  commitment to fiscal responsibility, and to make a difference in the  lives of the people that we represent.   Let's talk a little bit about inflation. Food prices are up 10.1  percent. Real wages--that is the difference between inflation and the  rise of wages--are down 3.4 percent as of today, meaning that the  average family is facing an effective pay cut of $1,500 just this year.   Everyone knows gas prices are at their highest ever with average  prices in my hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, now exceeding $5 a  gallon. Overall energy costs, home fuel oil, and others included, is up  34.6 percent.   Unfortunately, as I will point out tonight, the spending policies  enacted and pushed by the Biden administration and by Democrats in  Congress are really responsible for driving inflation and are  certainly--even if you don't agree with that--they are certainly  saddling future generations with debt. Someone will pay the price for  the massive debt we have now, and unfortunately, that will be our kids  and grandkids and future generations.   It has been said that Congress has a habit of only addressing  problems when we reach a crisis--only addressing issues when we reach a  crisis. That crisis may have already begun right now. We are in a  pretty tough spot in our economy at the moment and people are feeling  it every single day. We must step up to begin to address this.   Every Member of Congress, I am sure, has talked to their constituents  and can share stories about how their constituents are impacted by  rising prices. I can tell you myself, growing up as a child, I  experienced what it was like to have it be difficult for my family to  afford food.   I was one of 12 kids. My father was first a farmer and a roofer, my  mom was a stay-at-home mom. I can tell you about a stressful time for  my mother was going to the grocery store. The reason for that is  because she knew she would not have quite enough money to buy  everything that she thought she needed.   I remember walking with her up and down the aisles and she was  calculating in her head how much she was putting in the cart. She was  very concerned that she would get to the register and be embarrassed  that she would have to put some things back. Today, people are feeling  that.   I hear in my district, for instance, my constituent, Lamar, he put  the impact of inflation in clear terms. He tells me that he spends more  now but has less. He is doing with less. Paul says he is sadly giving  up on his hopes of retirement at this time. Tim said he has to choose  between gas and groceries every week. Lavern is 66 years old and had to  go back to work to help out his children and his grandchildren now,  though the impact of inflation on future debt will mean, as I mentioned  earlier, that his grandchildren will be paying the cost of the reckless  spending that we are seeing now. They will be paying for that for  decades.    We have all heard from our constituents. We have heard their  outcries. We have heard them talk to us about needing to rein in  inflation. I think it is time that we take it as a wakeup call. Let's  identify the causes of inflation and work to mitigate them.   That is one of the reasons that I wanted to get up and speak tonight  because we have had debates in both of the committees that I mentioned  about the causes of inflation--and that is not just a political  debate--it is not just because. It is because the only way that we can  begin to solve it is to understand the root cause of inflation, what  led to where we are now, and then what we can do to change it.  [[Page H5542]]    It is going to take leadership at all levels of government to address  not only inflation, but the $30 trillion now in debt, and trillions of  dollars in deficits as far as we can see and as far as the Biden budget  projects.   I am a businessowner, not an economist, so I can't even say that I  have all the answers. What I can tell you is that I believe that  capitalism, freedom, and free enterprise have made the United States  the most powerful Nation in the history of the world and has provided  more opportunity than ever before in the history of humankind. I think  returning to those core values can help lead us--will help lead us--out  of this mess.   First of all, there is a chart I will show you. Inflation does not  arrive randomly. There are forces that cause inflation. Every time we  have seen inflation in our history there are forces that cause it.   In this case, we have had things that are outside of our control,  Democrats will argue, and the President blames inflation on COVID-19,  supply chain disruptions, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the big bad oil  and gas companies, and other things. I don't know what the next thing  is that he will be blaming inflation on. I agree, they have certainly  played a role in causing inflation.   However, those challenges are the same challenges that every other  country across the world has faced and they do not explain why  inflation in the United States spiked earlier and is much worse than  what we are seeing in other countries.   This chart shows the annual core CPI inflation compared to OECD,  which is sort of peer countries, the Organization for Economic  Cooperation in Development Countries. It shows how inflation spiked  starting roughly the beginning of 2021 and far exceeded that of a  comparable country. What caused that?   I have another chart that puts a little finer point on this. This  shows that inflation started about the time that Biden took office and  really accelerated after the passing of the American Rescue Plan, which  put trillions of dollars in spending into our economy.   Now, I showed that chart today in a hearing in the Budget Committee  to Mr. Stephen Moore of the Save America Coalition, and he agreed that  the clear difference between what we saw in the past chart, the blue  line, and the other countries, the clear difference was the stimulus  that was provided, the increase in demand that was provided by  inserting trillions of dollars into the U.S. economy through the  American Rescue Plan Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article I wrote, an op-ed  that was published in The Hill on how President Biden's policies have  caused and will further fuel inflation.                       [From The Hill, Mar. 31, 2022]             Biden's Spending Plan Will Further Fuel Inflation                          (By Rep. Lloyd Smucker)         Americans are concerned about the economy. A recent NBC       poll indicated that only 33 percent of Americans approve of       President Joe Biden's handling of the economy. Inflation is       now at a 40-year high and has families concerned about their       financial well-being as they gather to review their budgets       around the kitchen table.        Democrats try to dismiss inflation as a mere nuisance for       Americans who have to cut back on so-called ``luxuries.''       When my constituents point out that gas is too expensive,       Democrats shrug and tell them to buy a Tesla. The Penn       Wharton Budget Model concluded that inflation       disproportionately impacts lower income Americans who have to       pay an even higher percentage of their income on necessities       like food and transportation. The latest consumer price index       report shows prices for food are up 7.9 percent, gasoline       prices recently reached record highs. We need to help the       Americans who can't afford to put gas in their car, let alone       buy an expensive new electric car.        Inflation isn't just an economic term; it has real world       consequences for the constituents that I represent. In my       district, I think of Connie who at 70 years old is looking       for a part-time job to help make ends meet because of the       higher cost of everyday necessities. I think of Tim who told       me he must decide between buying gas or groceries. I think of       Lynne who told me that she and her husband are planning to       put off retiring because of higher prices.        These kinds of stories are commonplace as inflation strains       family budgets across the nation. The Biden administration       claimed inflation was ``temporary'' and now places blame on       everything except his reckless spending. We know that the       left's irresponsible spending has accelerated inflation past       harmful levels. A study from the Federal Reserve Bank of San       Francisco concludes that Biden's spending led to higher       levels of inflation.        As the saying goes, an organization's budget is a statement       of its values. Now that President Biden released his Fiscal       Year 2023 budget, albeit seven weeks past the statutory       deadline, we can see clearly that this administration puts       wasteful, inflationary spending before all else. While the       president preaches fiscal restraint, this budget puts forth       policies reaffirming the president's tax-and-spend march       towards socialism.        Biden's proposed budget would spend $5.8 trillion next       fiscal year. His proposal would continue to pile on to the       national debt, which eclipsed $30 trillion earlier this year.       By their own estimates, his spending plan will add nearly $15       trillion in new debt over the next decade, with annual budget       deficits of at least $1 trillion per year.        The Biden administration continues to live in an alternate       reality when it comes to their inflation predictions. Their       budget report estimated the consumer price index (CPI) would       increase 4.7 percent for 2022. The most recent reading from       the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that CPI is up 7.9       percent over the last year. In last year's budget, they       predicted only a 2.1 percent change in CPI for 2022, far off       the mark from the high levels of inflation that we're       experiencing.        Buried deep within the administration's remarks in the       ``analytical perspectives'' the Biden administration believes       that inflation will return to its long-term trend in 2023       despite ``considerable uncertainty'' and their efforts to       continue the White House's messaging blaming Russia for       increased inflation. They have spent nearly a year deflecting       that their policies contribute to inflation, but at least the       administration is no longer parroting that inflation is       temporary.        From what we've read in Biden's first two budget proposals,       Americans should remain concerned about his dangerous levels       of spending, what it means for the future financial health of       our nation, and what it means for the future of inflation       levels. Our $30 trillion national debt significantly impacts       the next generation of Americans. Continuing to run trillion-      dollar deficits and adding more to our mountainous debt       further endangers our future.        While President Biden and congressional Democrats have       tried to move on from their months-long public feud on       spending, House Republicans are united in our fundamental       principles of working to renew fiscal sanity in Washington       through a limited government, pro-growth tax policy, and       strengthening our free enterprise system to create       opportunities for Americans to live the American Dream. We       will exercise robust oversight of President Biden's spending       spree to hold this administration accountable. We will       continue to fight against wasteful spending ballooning our       debt and deficit. House Republicans will work to put       America's fiscal house in order.     Mr. Speaker, March 2021, the Biden administration and  congressional Democrats rammed through $1.9 trillion in deficit  spending, and only a small portion of that really went to solving  problems and helping people that needed help through the pandemic--that  helped to defeat the pandemic. Much of this was not needed and only  served to fuel inflation.   By the way, they were warned by many economic experts. We warned  them. Republicans on the Budget Committee and the Ways and Means  Committee warned Democrats at the time this was passed in early 2021  that we would see exactly this result. We were relying on the forecasts  of many economists who were saying exactly that, who were warning the  administration of that at the time. Not just Republican economists, by  the way.   There is a name that many of you will know, he is a former Obama and  Clinton economist, Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, warned that the  American Rescue Plan would be the biggest macroeconomic mistake in 40  years, and it would cause inflationary pressures of a kind that we have  not seen in a generation.   Again, Larry Summers, a very well-respected Democrat administration  economist warning that we would be seeing the inflation that we are  seeing now, over a year ago, when the American Rescue Plan was passed.   Just recently a study by the San Francisco Federal Reserve confirms  that prediction, attributing the American Rescue Plan for at least  three points of the current 8.6 percent. Mark Goldwein of the Committee  for a Responsible Federal Budget, CRFB, described the American Rescue  Plan as ``pouring gasoline on the fire,'' in terms of an already  stimulated economy.   In my discussion with CBO director, Phillip Swagel, during a House  Budget  [[Page H5543]]  Committee hearing last month, he also agreed--head of CBO--that the  American Rescue Plan Act pumped trillions of dollars into the economy  that artificially fueled demand and ultimately drove today's inflation  crisis.                                time  2015    So what happened?   We had far too much cash in the economy and far too much demand.   I will show you, Mr. Speaker, something that my Governor in  Pennsylvania said. Governor Wolf tweeted that he wanted to send more  money to people all across Pennsylvania after jobs were open and people  were back to work because he said, ``States are swimming with cash.''   They have an unusual problem in Pennsylvania right now today. This is  the week they are finishing the Pennsylvania budget, and they have more  money than they know what to do with. Much of that came as a result of  the American Rescue Plan, and it was excess money that wasn't needed in  the economy.   So those funds would have been far better used paying down the  deficit, paying down the debt, and not fueling inflation by  artificially boosting demand. So it really is unfortunate because this  hurts my constituents, and it hurts people all across the country that  the White House did not heed the call of experts sooner and did not  take steps to reduce the impact of inflation.   For a while the White House instead said that inflation would be  transitory, and now just recently Secretary of the Treasury Yellen and  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell backed off that argument and agreed that  they were wrong, and that inflation was not transitory. We have a real  problem dealing with inflation at this point.   Secretary Yellen said in a Ways and Means hearing just last week: ``I  think I was wrong then about the path that inflation could take.''   One of the sad things about inflation is that it impacts different  people differently. The White House has claimed that inflation and the  economy's challenges that we are seeing today are high-class woes  reserved for the rich. But instead, it is the people on the lower end  of the economic scale who are making less money who are impacted more  than any others by inflation.   The Penn Wharton Budget Model concluded that inflation  disproportionately impacts lower-income Americans who have to pay an  even higher percentage of their income on necessities like food and  transportation, the price increases for which outpace the general  inflation rate.   As I mentioned earlier, the White House tries to blame multiple  sources: corporate greed, gas companies, Russia, and whatever else may  be as a source of inflation. But I think that only serves to deflect  blame, obscure the truth, and prevent us from coming to an agreement  where we can then begin to solve this.   I think the President became more interested in inflation after  seeing his plummeting approval rate. He is now talking about inflation  being a top priority of the administration. In fact, just recently he  wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal titled: ``My Plan for  Fighting Inflation.''   I will talk just briefly about that. He begins the op-ed by arguing  that our economy is actually in great shape, which strikes me as being  about as out of touch as you can get. He apparently isn't talking to  the constituents whom I talk to on a regular basis.   He lays out three points for combating inflation.   One, well, it is the Fed's job; two, his energy policies and build  back better agenda will fix it; and three, a supposed newfound  commitment to fiscal discipline.   In the op-ed he said that he welcomes debate on his plan. And maybe  tonight that is what we are doing. We are debating what really are the  ways that we can combat inflation and whether his plan really will  work.   So let's talk about the Fed because the President's first point was  arguing that it is the Fed's responsibility to control inflation. And  the President, again, has spent 1\1/2\ years pushing policies that fuel  inflation and then points to the Fed to fix the problem.   Now, I do agree that the Fed has a role in controlling inflation, and  essentially the tool they have will be to raise interest rates to try  to slow down the economy. But we all know that raising rates will be  required, which they are doing now. Tomorrow they are talking about a  0.75 percent increase in the Federal rate, which is a significant  increase, and they are talking about doing that multiple times. So it  has significant consequences on our economy both in the short and long  term.   What do I mean by that?   It makes it more expensive for businesses to borrow money. It makes  it more expensive for individuals to borrow money. We are seeing home  mortgage rates go up significantly already that will continue to do  that, and hundreds of thousands fewer people today are able to afford  to buy a home when they could have done so when they were lower. So  there will be a decrease for demand of goods and services which, again,  is an attempt to tamp down the economy to decrease demand and decrease  spending.   The other entity that is affected by rising interest rates is the  Federal Government. We are $30 trillion in debt. This chart shows what  will happen as interest rates are being raised. By just raising one- half of a percent--you see the first line--will increase interest costs  over the next 10 years by $1.3 trillion. Going up 2 percent will  increase interest costs by $5.3 trillion over the next 10 years.   Now, let's put that in perspective. That would be, under the  President's plan, 1.5 times our current Medicare spending, 1.4 times  our current defense spending, and 11 times our current veterans'  healthcare spending. So every single dollar that we have to pay in  additional interest costs will be taking dollars from programs that  help people across the country and will be taking dollars out of our  economy.   Increasing national debt is also a threat to our national security.  Mr. Speaker, I also wrote an op-ed in May that was published in The  Washington Times.   I include in the Record the article.                 [From the Washington Times, May 17, 2022]   When the Balloon Pops: Inflating Our Debt and Undermining Our Security                          (By Rep. Lloyd Smucker)                                   OPINION:         Twelve years ago, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Adm. Michael       Mullen famously warned, ``the most significant threat to our       national security is our debt.'' At the time, the nation's       federal debt was roughly $13.5 trillion. Congress and our       government have completely ignored Mr. Mullen's warning; our       national debt has now surpassed $30 trillion and is growing       exponentially.        China now owns $1.1 trillion of that debt, the second-      highest total among foreign sovereign governments, a clear       threat to our national security. If current trends continue,       that number will increase to $1.7 trillion over the next       decade.        Mr. Mullen recognized the tangible risks rising deficits       have on our nation. Every dollar spent servicing our debt,       meaning dollars spent paying the interest on the debt already       accrued, are dollars not spent on funding national       priorities. Currently, the Congressional Budget Office       estimates that we will pay an average of $543 billion per       year on just the interest for our nation's $30 trillion-plus       in national debt.        President Biden's Fiscal Year 2023 Budget only worsens the       problem. Under the president's proposed spending plan,       interest payments would jump to an average of $756 billion       per year, meaning $2 trillion more in total interest payments       over the next 10 years than currently projected.        Our country would be paying over $1 trillion in interest       payments to service the debt by 2031. To put that in       perspective, by 2031, we would pay 1.5 times our current       Medicare outlays and 1.4 times our current defense budget on       interest payments. As Undersecretary of Defense Comptroller       Michael McCord agreed during our discussion at the House       Budget Committee, the increasing burden of mandatory interest       payments threatens to crowd out discretionary spending       priorities, such as our defense budget.        Mr. Mullen warned us that our debt would soon reach a point       where we spent more paying off interest than funding our       military, risking our national security. Under the       president's budget, that warning will be proved true in 2029.       Given that China owns an increasing amount of our debt, those       interest payments will directly fund the interests of an       economic, and perhaps military, adversary.        Unfortunately, rampant, irresponsible federal spending has       compounding consequences on our economy.        Mr. Biden and House Democrats are wreaking havoc on our       economy and fueling inflation. Spurred by the $1.9 trillion       American Rescue Plan Act, the inflationary impacts of which       were forecasted and have been confirmed, our government ran a       $2.8 trillion deficit in 2021. The results of this massive       spending influx by the federal government have been immediate       and drastic: The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the  [[Page H5544]]       consumer price index for all items rose 8.3 percent over the       past year, near the highest level in over 40 years.        Inflation not only harms our economy in the immediate       future but also has long-term impacts on the cost of       servicing our debt. In March, in an attempt to tamp down Mr.       Biden's inflation, the Federal Reserve Board raised benchmark       interest rates by 0.25 percentage points. On May 4, the Fed       raised interest rates an additional 0.50 percentage points,       the largest single increase since 2000. These rate hikes will       have a ripple effect across our economy, including on       servicing our national debt. As inflation persists this year,       the Fed is expected to continue to raise rates at least 5       more times this year, with rates expected to surpass 1.9       percent.        The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a       nonpartisan nonprofit research organization, reports, ``If       interest rates are 50 basis points (0.50 percentage points)       higher than projected, average annual interest costs would       increase by $94 billion per year.'' Even higher interest rate       hikes will have even more devastating impacts. If interest       rates were to exceed CBO's projections by 2 percentage points       each year, similar to the Fed's expected actions for this       year, our nation could spend an additional $3.7 trillion       servicing our debt over the next decade.        This does not even factor in expected spending increases       under Mr. Biden's budget--this is just the impact of what has       already been spent. My Republican colleagues on the House       Budget Committee have prepared an analysis titled ``The       Consequences of Higher Interest Rates to the Federal       Budget,'' which provides an even grimmer outlook on the long-      term impacts of rate hikes on our nation's fiscal strength.        The Biden administration's spending increases the debt from       the outset, and the Fed's response to control inflation by       raising rates balloons the cost of our debt even more. Our       national security will falter. America will be forced to fund       China's rise. Generations yet to be born will be paying the       price for Mr. Biden's inflation. It is long past time for       Congress to step up and rein in this out-of-control spending       and inflation.     The article lays out how increased inflation ultimately  undermines our national security.   China, perhaps our greatest adversary of the next decade, now owns  $1.1 trillion of the national debt. That is the second highest total  among foreign sovereign governments, and increased dependence on China  is a clear threat to our national security.   If the current trends continue, China's portion of our national debt  will increase to $1.7 trillion over the next decade. Interest payments  as they rise will mean more income for China and will directly fuel  China's growth making them a stronger economic and military adversary.   Twelve years ago, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Michael  Mullen famously warned: ``The most significant threat to our national  security is our debt.'' That was 12 years ago. The most significant  threat to our national security is our national debt.   At that time, by the way, the Nation's Federal debt was roughly $13.5  trillion. Now it is at $30 trillion and growing.   What could be even worse is if our lenders lose faith in the ability  of the United States to pay back and make good on those loans. If they  essentially lose faith in the credit of the United States, that would  be what we call a sovereign debt crisis which would have a major  economic impact in the United States affecting every single American.   By the way, that is not merely a hypothetical. We have seen major  nations face sovereign debt crises. In 2009 Greece's budget deficits  totaled 12.7 percent of its GDP. By 2012, Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio  was 160 percent. Under CRFB's analysis our debt held by the public will  reach 126 percent of GDP by 2032 with the anticipated increased  interest rates. If we don't change this trajectory, this will put us  well on the way to a fiscal calamity like Greece has experienced not  long ago, just a few years ago.   So it is long past time for the U.S. to get our fiscal house in order  and abandon the reckless budgetary policies that sank the Greek economy  at that time.   Let's talk just briefly about energy, Mr. Speaker, another big factor  in the rising prices that we are seeing. This chart sort of blows me  away. Average prices of gas in my hometown right now exceed $5 a  gallon. Think about that, Mr. Speaker. Just a year and a half ago, 2  years ago, no one would have imagined that we would be spending $5 per  gallon. You see the same kind of increases in home fuel, Mr. Speaker,  heating costs, and so on. And the President blames oil and gas markets  for that high inflation rate, and he focuses on the role of Russia in  driving those.   But do you know what is amazing, Mr. Speaker?   Under President Trump when President Biden took office, our Nation  was energy independent and becoming a net exporter of oil in 2019. Some  of the very first actions that President Biden took were to halt  drilling on Federal lands and to stop the Keystone pipeline. Even as  prices went up, the administration doubled down on limiting the supply  of our drilling. No new permits were approved. So it is a classic  economic formula. They dramatically increased demand and reduced supply  which led to the prices that we are seeing now.   The President just put out his new budget. He says that now--really  the first time I think since he has been in office--it is important to  reduce deficits. I welcome that. I think it is important that we reduce  deficits. We have to reduce the debt long term. He claims credit for  reducing the Federal deficit by $1.7 trillion this year due to the  expiration of spending in the American Rescue Plan which, by the way,  is all deficit spending. He says that this reduction demonstrates a  newfound commitment to fiscal discipline.   Now, let's just look at that for a little bit.   If I eat 10,000 calories today--which is way more than I need--and  tomorrow I eat 5,000, well, that won't make me a model. It doesn't mean  that I am on any kind of a diet.   Look at this plan. This is the President's budget straight from his  budget documents. I get it. There was an anomaly during COVID. It was a  challenge for all of us, and the deficit went way up during COVID. But  look at the deficit before COVID which is the second bar on the left  side.   And then coming out of COVID what happens?   Do you see--if you take out the two COVID years which was an  exception, an anomaly, do you see deficits declining at all?   No. In fact, they are going up every single year.   That is not fiscal responsibility. In fact, I call it swamp math, to  say that we are reducing deficits when this is exactly what it looks  like in their budget plan. It is swamp math.   Mr. Speaker, if you set one foot outside the beltway, I can tell you  that every single American who looks at this does not believe that we  are reducing deficits in any way.                                time  2030    I don't mean that as a knock on the administration. Well, I guess I  do mean it as a knock on the administration.   But what I really mean to say is that we have to get serious about  implementing policies that will drive growth and that will result in  lower deficits over time, or we will be going down that path of fiscal  calamity.   Besides this, the other thing that the President is calling for,  still calling for, is what he calls the Build Back Better plan. This is  outlined in his budget.   Now, I call it build back bankrupt because it continues to put us on  a path of a potential sovereign debt crisis. It certainly continues to  build debt for our kids, our grandkids, and future generations.   The build back bankrupt plan imposes new taxes, 36 new taxes, on  Americans and dramatically increases spending beyond what you see here.  This is what they want to do, while they are claiming to do this, which  they are saying is reducing deficits. It makes no sense whatsoever.   One of the other things I want to mention--I am running out of time  here.   It has just been recently that we have had this economy working on  all cylinders, and we could be doing that again. This economy could be  in a far different position if we implemented policies similar to what  were done under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act under the previous  administration.   Just before COVID hit, we were seeing the impact. Almost every  measure you could possibly take showed that the economy was working for  the American people. By the way, middle-income American, the average  household income increased by $6,000 per year. That is a real impact.  People were feeling it, compared to a $3,500 drop in real wages during  this administration.  [[Page H5545]]    The TCJA boosted workers' paychecks. Income and wealth inequality  fell. Real wages for the bottom 10 percent, by the way, grew nearly  twice as fast as the top 10 percent. Real wealth of the bottom 50  percent of households rose three times faster than that of the top 1  percent.   Despite the challenges that we face now, I think hope is not lost. I  am optimistic that if we implement the right policies, America can once  again work for the American people. We need to be committed to that. We  need to have a discussion about what policies will work.
