 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise in the name of  liberty and justice for all.   Mr. Speaker, there is something happening in our country. It appears  to me that the inescapable, irreversible winds of change are sweeping  across our land. It seems to me that the people in this country have  seen things that they did not anticipate they would see. They didn't  expect to see what happened to George Floyd. They didn't expect to  understand what has happened to  [[Page H5112]]  Breonna Taylor. And the people in this country seem to want to see  change take place.   I am amazed at how one question by a moderator at an event has made a  significant impact. The simple question was, and I am paraphrasing:  Would you denounce white supremacy?   It was a simple question. It did not get the appropriate answer. As a  result, people are starting to believe that we ought not allow an  answer that is inappropriate to be acceptable.   I am just amazed at how persons across the aisle--and I am grateful  to them--persons across the aisle have said that there should have been  the appropriate answer given, which is: I condemn white supremacy; I  condemn the supremacist.   That is the answer, simple, easy answer.   And persons across the aisle are sending a clear and perspicuous  message to the Chief Executive Officer: He needs to change that  response--walk it back; talk it back; crawl it back; just take it back.   I don't know that he will, but I do know this: When we have my  friends across the aisle making it clear that this was wrong, something  is happening here, and I am grateful to my friends. I thank you for  taking the bold position that you are taking, not allowing this to be  just another one of the many episodes wherein inappropriate statements  have been made and not challenged. I thank you for what you have done,  all of you, those who have said you need to condemn white supremacy.   Something strange is happening. There is a change taking place, and I  am grateful to have lived long enough to see this change occur.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, how can one say you love the police  but you won't fund the municipality that pays the police?   How can you say that you want your children to be taught well in a  safe environment, but you won't fund the bill that would fund the  school system so that they can be taught well and be in a safe  environment?   How can you say you want your fires to be fought but you won't  protect firefighters? This bill does that.   Here is why you can't say you protect firefighters and would fund the  police: It is because Senator McConnell has said, openly and  notoriously, he would have the States go bankrupt.   Bankruptcy is not the way to go for heroes, for firefighters, for  police officers, for teachers.   It is time to compromise. This is the bill to be voted on, not the  one that is in your mind. Compromise, not the mind.
