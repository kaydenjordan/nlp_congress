 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8876, the Jackie Walorski  Maternal and Child Home Visiting Reauthorization Act.   On behalf of Indiana's Second District, I am grateful to the entire  Committee on Ways and Means for their work in putting together this  bipartisan legislation and honoring Jackie in such a meaningful way.    Jackie spent her life as a tireless advocate for hardworking Hoosiers  across the Second District. In particular, she put a tremendous amount  of time and effort towards the reauthorization of the MIECHV program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.
