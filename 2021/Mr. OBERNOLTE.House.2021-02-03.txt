 Mr. Speaker, the House Budget Committee was  constituted in 1974, and since then, not a single budget resolution has  passed out of this Chamber without hearings and reasoned debate, until  today.  [[Page H292]]    Should H. Con. Res. 11 pass, it will be the first budget resolution  in almost 50 years to pass this Chamber without a single hearing,  without a single vote, without a single witness. We are being told that  the reason for this is the need for quick action in response to  additional stimulus and relief for the coronavirus crisis.   But Mr. Speaker, I have read this resolution. It is 55 pages. I can't  find a single item in this resolution related to the coronavirus  crisis.   Now we are being told that might be true. You see, this is just a  shell that we pass this to the Senate, which triggers a lengthy and  complex process of budget reconciliation.   But, Mr. Speaker, if our intent is to pass quick relief, and I think  it should be, we could do that today. This Chamber has passed in the  last 12 months almost $4 trillion of relief. Mr. Speaker, of that, over  25 percent, over $1 trillion, remains unspent. We could fix that today.  We could fix that now, instead of relying on this lengthy and complex  process of budget reconciliation.   Mr. Speaker, this is a serious topic. It deserves serious  consideration, and not the violation of almost 50 years of protocol and  procedure in this Chamber. I urge a ``no'' vote.
