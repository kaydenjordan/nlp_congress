 Mr. President, while she is on the floor, I want to  commend my northwest colleague and friend, Senator Murray, for all of  her leadership, constantly coming to the floor and leading us on this  enormous health challenge--a challenge that is really existential for  so many women across the country.   Right now in State capitals across the land, Republican lawmakers are  passing extreme bills that throw in the trash can 45 years of settled  law on reproductive health. This is an open, coordinated attack on Roe  v. Wade and a woman's right to choose the healthcare she needs. These  Republican lawmakers are passing bills that are not only harmful, but  they are overwhelmingly opposed by the public--bills with harsh  criminal penalties for women and doctors, bills with no exceptions for  cases of rape or incest, bills that explicitly compare women getting  medical care to the Holocaust. Let me repeat that--bills that  explicitly compare women getting medical care to the Holocaust.   I want to be clear on what this is all about. The party of Donald  Trump is insisting on government control of women's bodies. That is  what is on the table in Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, and elsewhere-- government control of women's bodies.   Millions of women across the land are watching in anger and in fear  as all of this is playing out. I have heard from many of them back home  in Oregon. I heard it last weekend. I have four town meetings in the  rural part of Oregon coming up; I am going to hear it again. Women are  afraid for the future--their future and their family's future--because  they know what is at stake with this coordinated attack on their  rights.   First, it puts women's lives in danger.   The reality is, abortions will still happen in States that pass these  laws, but those abortions will happen later, and they will be unsafe.  Women are going to die. That is a fact. Women are going to die because  of these restrictions. If you need proof, just look at the figures  before and after the Roe case. In the decades before Roe, thousands of  women died due to unsafe abortions. And those are only the ones people  know about. That doesn't even take into consideration the unnamed, the  unknown victims of those misguided policies. After Roe was decided in  1973, women's healthcare got safer. Now, once again, there is an effort  to undermine that safety of women.   Second, in key ways, the future these restrictive laws are creating  is worse for women and healthcare professionals than before Roe.   What we are talking about now is jailing doctors for life. We are  talking about treating women like hardened criminals after they get a  medical procedure. Women in some places are facing the prospect that  they may need to report miscarriages to the government or they could  wind up in prison.   The other side in this debate paints a picture of women exercising  their right to choose that is unfair and unrealistic. These are  incredibly difficult choices. Many women exercising the right to choose  have just been hit with the most devastating medical news that  prospective parents can face. It is not up to State lawmakers and  government bureaucrats to step in and interfere with this intensely  private and personal choice, but that is exactly what is on offer with  the laws being passed in statehouses across the land. These laws bind  and punish women with a level of government control that did not exist  before Roe. This is right out of nightmarish fiction. It is a  coordinated attack on women's rights that is cruel and dangerous.   Abortion and other reproductive decisions are healthcare, and  healthcare choices ought to be made by women with the help of doctors  they trust, not by the Federal Government and not by State lawmakers-- women and doctors. That is it. Full stop.   My Democratic colleagues and I want to thank Senator Murray and  Senator Shaheen, who have been such advocates for women's healthcare  for many years in public service. They are here.   We are all going to be part of this effort that I am proud to join in  to fight at the Federal level with everything we have to stand up for  women's right to make intensely personal choices, and we are going to  be joining those women across the land who are standing up and fighting  with everything they have.   The government should not have control of women's bodies--end of  story.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, today I want to recognize and honor  Parkrose High School coach and security guard Keanon Lowe for his  heroism during the school day on May 17, 2019.   When Mr. Lowe spotted an armed student in a classroom in the  northeast Portland high school, he bravely tackled the student,  wrestled away the gun, and held the student until police arrived. Mr.  Lowe may have saved the lives of countless students, teachers, and  administrators at Parkrose.   In Mr. Lowe's own words the day after the incident, ``When I signed  up to be a security guard, football and track and field coach for  Parkrose High School, I did so to guide and coach young people whose  shoes I had once been in. I had no idea that I would one day have to  put my life on the line like I did yesterday for my students.''   Mr. Lowe is no stranger to the spotlight. Before becoming the  football and track coach at Parkrose, Mr. Lowe was a standout football  player in Oregon at Jesuit High School and then the University of  Oregon, U of O, ``Go Ducks!''   As an U of O alumnus, I witnessed Mr. Lowe's standout play both in  Autzen Stadium in Eugene and in the 2015 national championship game  against the Ohio State University.   All Ducks fans know Mr. Lowe as a champion on the field, and now all  of Oregon and the country, know him as a hero off the field.   Mr. Lowe's heroics saved the day on a Friday morning just before  noon. Students, teachers, and administrators at Parkrose, as well as  their loved ones, are incredibly grateful that Mr. Lowe prevented what  could have been a tragedy in my hometown.   Sadly, far too many schools in my State and across America have not  been so fortunate in the past few decades. Gun violence in schools has  essentially created a ``lockdown generation'' of students whose happy  memories of high school dances, games, plays, and other activities  jostle alongside memories of lockdown drills and, in far too many  instances, violent gunmen.   Again, in Mr. Lowe's own words, ``I'm blessed to be alive and  extremely happy that the students are safe. I'm not sure what's next, I  haven't had the time to really think about it. But I am sure I want to  be a part of the solution to school gun violence.''  [[Page S3001]]    I am grateful that Mr. Lowe prevented the worst on May 17, 2019, and  welcome his commitment to be a teammate in reducing the chances of gun  tragedies in every school in America.    Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal Campaign  Cybersecurity Assistance Act of 2019--a bulky name for a bill that  attempts to do a simply stated thing: protect our democracy from  foreign cyber attacks. This bill allows the national campaign  committees to provide much-needed cybersecurity assistance to State  political parties, Federal campaign offices' staffs, and Federal  candidates' personal accounts and devices.   In 2015 and 2016, hackers working for the Russian government  penetrated the networks of the Democratic National Committee and the  Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The hackers also  compromised the email account of Senator Hillary Clinton's presidential  campaign manager, John Podesta. The Russian government subsequently  leaked and weaponized Democratic party and campaign emails in order to  influence the outcome of several elections--most publicly, the  presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, but also  U.S. House of Representatives races in Illinois, New Hampshire, New  Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Hackers also targeted  Republicans during the same period, but were less successful in their  efforts.   The impact of Russia's hacking-enabled influence campaign was a  surprise to many. However, this was not the first time that a foreign  government hacked into the campaign organization of someone running to  be President of the United States. Senior officials from the 2008 Obama  and McCain presidential campaigns have publicly confirmed that both  organizations were compromised by hackers. In an interview with NBC  News 2013, Dennis Blair, who served as President Obama's Director of  National Intelligence between 2009 and 2010 stated that ``Based on  everything I know, this was a case of political cyber-espionage by the  Chinese government against the two American political parties. They  were looking for positions on China, surprises that might be rolled out  by campaigns against China.''   In recent years, the Republican National Committee, the National  Republican Senatorial Committee, and the the National Republican  Congressional Committee have all been hacked, as well as the campaigns  of Senators Graham and McCain. Both major political parties have  suffered hacks, and will undoubtedly continue to be targeted by foreign  governments and other sophisticated hackers.   Over the past two years, Congress has turned its attention to several  weaknesses in our democracy that were exploited by Russia including the  role of social media companies and long-standing flaws in paperless  voting machines used in several states. While these issues have yet to  be meaningfully addressed, they have, at least, been the subject of  oversight hearings and legislative proposals in Congress. In contrast,  Congress has yet to hold a single hearing on the vulnerability of  political parties and campaigns to hacking by foreign governments, nor  has anyone else in Congress introduced legislation to help defend these  organizations from cyber attacks.   For the sake of the integrity of the American political process, I  introduce this bill today to protect those running for office, and the  organizations that support them, from cyber attacks. Russia's hacking  and leaking of emails in 2016 is now well documented. Their efforts  continue. If you think they aren't working towards the 2020 federal  elections as hard as any cub reporter in Iowa, you'd be sadly mistaken.  And they are likely NOT alone. Other hostile governments will  undoubtedly seek to emulate and improve on Russia's tactics.   Congress has acted in the past to protect those running for office  from serious threats. After Senator Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated  in 1968, Congress authorized the Secret Service to protect Presidential  and Vice Presidential candidates. In extending Secret Service  protection to candidates, Congress recognized that the threats to  Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates required professional  protection. Congress must now take action to protect candidates for  Federal office--and consequently, our democracy--from another serious  threat: hacking by foreign governments.   The political parties are best of the available options to provide  cybersecurity to campaigns. Politicians are already dependent upon the  parties for fundraising, advertising, polling, messaging, and other  forms of support. Giving parties the responsibility to provide  cybersecurity does not make politicians dependent on help from a new  entity. Parties are also responsible to politicians they protect,  moreso at least than any other government, corporate, or non-profit  entity.   Quite simply, this bill gives the national campaign committees the  role of the ``IT Department'' for state parties, campaigns, and  candidates. The committees will be able to provide these entities with  securely configured laptops and cellphones, professionally administered  email, encrypted messaging, and collaboration software, and if  necessary, hire third-party cybersecurity experts to help in the event  of a successful hack.   This bill also permits the national parties to provide this  assistance with money they raise in their ``building fund.'' The  building fund is one of three supplementary accounts through which  Congress permitted the national campaign committees to raise an  additional $100,000 per individual, per year, to pay for the cost of  presidential nominating conventions, national party headquarters  buildings, and election recounts and other legal battles.   I know that some advocates have serious concerns about the building  fund and the other supplementary accounts created by Congress in 2014.  I share these concerns, and have long supported bold reforms of our  campaign finance system. However, the current Senate is extremely  unlikely to pass legislation creating public financing of elections  anytime soon, and so while we have the current system, permitting the  use of money in the building fund for cybersecurity appears to be the  least bad option. Most importantly, this approach does not permit the  parties to raise any new funds--it merely permits a new use of money  raised through the building fund.   I am not the only one to recognize the severity of the cyber threat  aimed at political parties. Earlier this year, the Canadian agency  responsible for government cybersecurity, the Communications Security  Establishment, issued a lengthy report on threats to elections, which  noted that that ``Globally, political parties, candidates, and their  staff remain attractive targets for cyber threat activity.'' Likewise,  the Maryland Board of Elections published guidance last week,  recognizing  [[Page S3009]]  that ``Campaigns are a potential cyber target,'' and consequently  permitted state political parties to provide additional cybersecurity  assistance to campaigns.   November 2020 gets closer by the day. Congress cannot wait any longer  to protect state parties, campaigns, and the candidates themselves from  sophisticated cyber attacks. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to  promptly act on this legislation, and to secure our democracy from  cyber threats before it is too late.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Scott of South Carolina, Mr.          Menendez, Mr. Young, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. Portman, Mr. Kaine, and          Ms. Smith):   S. 1583. A bill to amend the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention  Act to provide for additional procedures for families with children  under the age of 6, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
