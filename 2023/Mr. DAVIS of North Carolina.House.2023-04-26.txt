 Mr. Speaker, from cropping tobacco in  the fields of eastern North Carolina to now walking the Halls of  Congress, I am most grateful for the opportunity to work for the people  of North Carolina's First Congressional District and our future  generations.   We are a little over 100 days into the 118th Congress. I have rolled  up my sleeves to work hard for eastern North Carolina, rural America,  and the American people.   My highest priority remains the people of North Carolina's First  Congressional District. I have traveled from Elizabeth City to  Henderson, Greenville to Columbia, and everywhere in between, visiting  all 19 counties. While there, I pushed to expand Medicaid and stood up  for our farmers.   I am proud to sponsor three critical pieces of legislation and have  sponsored 40 bipartisan pieces of legislation. Our office has already  resolved over 200 constituent cases.   I look forward to continuing working to guarantee future generations  can live the American Dream in eastern North Carolina.                            ____________________
