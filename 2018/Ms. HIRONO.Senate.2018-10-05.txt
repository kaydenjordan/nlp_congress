 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the  nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United  States. Based on an in-depth examination of his legal career, academic  writings, and judicial record, I conclude that he has a long pattern of  misstating facts and misapplying the law in order to further his  partisan political agenda.   His partisan, ideologically driven agenda is particularly troubling  in cases involving women's intimate personal decisions.   Roe v. Wade and its progeny represent an acknowledgment in American  law and life that women ought to have control over whether and when to  bear children, but it is more than that. As Justice O'Connor explained  in Casey v. Planned Parenthood, ``It is a promise of the Constitution  that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not  enter.''   The Supreme Court's jurisprudence on reproductive rights is based on  case law going back decades that has assured Americans the right to  educate their children as they see fit; to marry anyone, no matter  their race; and to decide whether to use contraception inside or  outside of marriage. It is part of a jurisprudence of privacy and  autonomy that became a bedrock of American society that we have all  relied on to create families, choose professions, and raise children.  But Brett Kavanaugh, through his political choices and affiliations, as  well as his legal and judicial writing, has told us loud and clear that  he does not respect a woman's right to make her own intimate, personal  decisions and will do whatever he can, once confirmed, if confirmed, to  narrow and overturn Roe v. Wade.   A recent speech Kavanaugh delivered gives us further insight into his  own legal views on the topic. In 2017, at the American Enterprise  Institute, Kavanaugh gave a speech in tribute to the late Chief Justice  William Rehnquist. In his remarks, Kavanaugh praised Rehnquist's  dissent--dissent--in Roe v. Wade where the late Chief Justice found no  constitutional right to abortion because the right was not ``rooted in  the traditions and conscience of our people.'' Thank goodness the rest  of the Supreme Court did not follow Chief Justice Rehnquist.   To learn about Brett Kavanaugh's own legal views on reproductive  rights, we need only look at his dissent in last year's DC Circuit case  Garza v. Hargan. Here, a 17-year-old undocumented immigrant sought  release from government custody to obtain an abortion.   Kavanaugh's first fundamental misstatement in this case was  mischaracterizing it as a ``parental consent'' case. It was not. The  young woman had already received a proper judicial bypass from a Texas  judge and therefore did not need parental consent.  [[Page S6580]]    For a judge applying for a promotion to the Supreme Court to  completely misstate the issue in the case was astounding to me. In my  view, a first-year law student would not have deemed the Garza case to  be a parental consent case, but that is what he said.   Then, when applying the legal test under Roe and Casey to determine  whether the young woman's rights were being subject to an ``undue  burden,'' Judge Kavanaugh would have ruled against her. He thought  nothing of keeping a 17-year-old as a prisoner of the government Office  of Refugee Resettlement instead of releasing her to get an abortion  that was entirely within her rights to seek.   Compare that to the ease with which Judge Kavanaugh found that  religious employers, in the case of Priests for Life v. Department of  Health and Human Services, were burdened by filling out a two-page  form. The employers there were seeking to avoid paying for any  employee's health insurance that covered contraception, saying it  burdened their free exercise of religion.   The majority of the DC Circuit held that asking the employers to fill  out a brief form to let the government know of their objection was not  a substantial burden, but Judge Kavanaugh disagreed and would have  ruled to deny the female employees their proper health coverage, siding  with the Priests for Life. Judge Kavanaugh's colleague on the DC  Circuit went out of her way to write a concurring opinion to directly  rebut Judge Kavanaugh's dissent and correct his misstatements of the  case.    To Judge Kavanaugh, holding a woman in government custody  unnecessarily and against her will does not represent an undue burden  on the exercise of her constitutional right to an abortion, but when it  comes to a religious employer opting out of providing contraceptive  coverage to an employee, a two-page form is too great a burden.   The pattern of Judge Kavanaugh's views on the right to abortion is  clear. Anyone who feels assured he will uphold Roe v. Wade is living in  a fantasy world.   Laws that narrow women's reproductive rights in States like Texas,  Iowa, and Louisiana are currently making their way to the Supreme  Court, and all evidence shows that Judge Kavanaugh will side with them.  Advocates for women's reproductive rights are against Judge Kavanaugh's  ascent to the Supreme Court with good reason.   Another aspect of his judicial record that argues against  confirmation is Judge Kavanaugh's pattern of dissents. Dissents are  revealing. It is where judges go out of their way to voice their  disagreement with the majority on the court to show what their views  are. Judge Kavanaugh has the highest dissent rate among active DC  Circuit judges at 5.1 dissents per year.   One study I introduced at his hearing showed that he consistently  sided against workers and immigrants and only once favored consumers in  his dissents.   Another study showed he consistently sided against protecting the air  we breathe and the water we drink. So environmental and consumer rights  groups are against Judge Kavanaugh's ascent to the Supreme Court with  good reason.   Yet another study analyzed his dissents and found that Judge  Kavanaugh tended to dissent more often along partisan lines than his  colleagues and his ``divisiveness . . . ramped up during political  campaigns'' before Presidential elections. This is more than mere  coincidence. It also found that he had the highest rate of what the  study called ``partisan dissents''--where the other judges in the  majority were appointed by the opposing party; in other words, by  Democratic Presidents. Again, this is not the sort of fairminded  consideration of the facts and the law necessary for a Supreme Court  Justice.   His partisanship was clearly on display for all to see at his  Thursday hearing.   For me, as a Senator from Hawaii, Judge Kavanaugh's pattern of  misstating the facts and misapplying the law is evident in his work on  the case of Rice v. Cayetano and the rights of Native peoples.   President Trump has demonstrate through signing statements, budget  proposals, and proposed regulations that he views programs for our  indigenous communities as unconstitutional racial classifications, and  he found a like-minded Supreme Court nominee in Brett Kavanaugh.   Brett Kavanaugh has a long history of misstating facts and  misapplying the law in order to curtail the rights of indigenous  peoples--Native Hawaiians, Alaska Natives, and American Indians.   As an attorney in private practice in 1999, Brett Kavanaugh  coauthored a friend-of-the-court brief in support Harold ``Freddy''  Rice's challenge to the voting structure of the Office of Hawaiian  Affairs--a State office established in Hawaii to work for the  betterment of Native Hawaiians. Mr. Rice sued then-Governor of Hawaii  Benjamin Cayetano, and the case made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.   Judge Kavanaugh coauthored his amicus brief with other highly  conservative legal advocates, including Robert Bork--a harsh critic of  the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it was proposed. Judge Kavanaugh  separately, in addition to working on this amicus brief, wrote an op-ed  for the Wall Street Journal titled ``Are Hawaiians Indians?'' that made  false and offensive arguments.   In his op-ed and amicus brief, Judge Kavanaugh relied on incorrect  facts and misstatements, ignoring obvious truths that contradict his  position. He relied on these incorrect facts in order to reach his  political conclusion that Native Hawaiians and arguably other  indigenous communities who do not fit his limited view of Tribal  structure are not afforded any special protections by the Constitution.   He called OHA's voting structure into question under the 14th  Amendment, calling it a ``naked racial spoils system.'' In describing  the Native Hawaiian community, he went out of his way to ignore their  history, cobble together blatant falsehoods, and call into question  their status as an indigenous people.   His op-ed argues that Native Hawaiians are not entitled to  constitutional protections given to indigenous Americans because, as he  put it, ``They don't have their own government. They don't have their  own system of laws. They don't have their own elected leaders. They  don't live on reservations or on territorial enclaves. They don't even  live together in Hawaii.''   Judge Kavanaugh is saying that Native groups in the United States  derive their rights from having been herded onto reservations and  cheated out of their land and that they surrender their rights when  they move outside of these artificial boundaries. It is not only  factually wrong but deeply offensive. Kavanaugh argues that an  indigenous community must have its own government, system of laws, its  own elected leaders, and live together on a reservation to be  considered indigenous. By that, he means that only federally recognized  Tribes in the lower 48 States are afforded any protections.   After Judge Kavanaugh made his troubling and misleading arguments in  the amicus brief and op-ed, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Rice v.  Cayetano. They ruled that Hawaii's voting structure for the Office of  Hawaiian Affairs violated the 15th Amendment's voting rights  guarantees. The Supreme Court, in Rice, relied only on the 15th  Amendment. It did not address the 14th Amendment argument Judge  Kavanaugh made in his amicus brief, which claimed that the Office of  Hawaiian Affairs' voting structure was an unconstitutional ``racial  voting set-aside.'' But Judge Kavanaugh and his conservative allies  continued to misstate and misconstrue the holding in Rice for their own  political purposes.   In the Bush White House, Judge Kavanaugh continued to misapply the  law in Rice to argue that Native Hawaiians could not be the  beneficiaries of targeted programs, when clearly the case stands for a  much narrower proposition having nothing to do with government  benefits.   In fact, the Supreme Court declined to address Judge Kavanaugh's  question of whether the Office of Hawaiian Affairs' voting structure  could be an unconstitutional, race-based classification under the 14th  Amendment.   In one email, when he was in the Bush White House, Kavanaugh wrote:  ``I think the testimony needs to make clear that any program targeting  Native Hawaiians as a group is subject to strict scrutiny and of  questionable validity under the Constitution.''   In another, he wrote: ``White House Counsel objects and raises  questions  [[Page S6581]]  about the constitutionality of this bill, including but not limited to  the portions that refer to Native Hawaiians. See Rice v. Cayetano.''   At his hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee, when I asked him  about his misapplication of the law, Judge Kavanaugh again misstated  the holding of Rice and refused to correct his misstatement when I  asked him to clarify. He testified before the Judiciary Committee that  Rice ``was a straightforward violation of the 14th and 15th amendments  of the U.S. Constitution.'' He was wrong, but when I pressed him on  this point and asked him to show me where the majority decision in Rice  cited the 14th amendment, he refused to answer. Why? Because he was  clearly wrong.   It is deeply troubling to have a Supreme Court nominee for a lifetime  position who doesn't adhere to facts or correctly present the law.  Judge Kavanaugh's answers on this topic fit his pattern of evading and  skirting the truth.   His reliance on these stereotypes and bigoted tropes about Native  Hawaiians, as well as his misapplication of the law, represent a clear  and present danger to Native people all over this country, including in  Hawaii.   Notably, in his writings against Native Hawaiians, Judge Kavanaugh  completely avoided any reference to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement  Act, ANSCA. Under ANSCA, Alaska Natives organized themselves not as a  tribe in Judge Kavanaugh's understanding of the word but as village and  regional corporations with shares that individual Alaska Natives hold.  This is a novel and unique system for facilitating the U.S. trust  responsibilities and arguably not at all in keeping with what Judge  Kavanaugh believes deserves constitutional protection. That is why  Native communities across the country, including the Office of Hawaiian  Affairs, Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, Alaska Federation of  Natives, and the National Congress of American Indians have come  together to express deep concern over Judge Kavanaugh's nomination.   In the context of his views on Native peoples, I no longer find it  curious that Judge Kavanaugh devoted so much time back then to writing  an amicus brief and an op-ed on a case that involved Native Hawaiians.   I will have more to say tomorrow about other aspects of this  nomination--in particular, what Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's account of  her attack by Brett Kavanaugh reveals about the nominee, the Senate,  and the American culture.   For now, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jeffrey  Hantson, a law fellow, and Kai Bostock, a law clerk in my office, be  permitted floor access for the remainder of debate on the nomination of  Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.    Mr. President, I have to say I am sick of this. I am sick  of everyone who wants to rewrite the history of what happened in the  Senate with the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States. It  isn't even over yet, and they want people to believe that what we have  witnessed over the past weeks was what they call a ``political hit job  perpetrated by Democrats with a grudge.''   That is the story the nominee himself tried to sell in his testimony  on Thursday. He accused Democrats of lying in wait. He twisted Ranking  Member Feinstein's respect for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's wish for  privacy. He falsely claimed Democrats had her accusation ``ready,''  that Dr. Ford's accusation ``was held in secret for weeks,'' because  the Democrats, as Judge Kavanaugh put it, ``couldn't take me out on the  merits.''   What a paranoid fantasy.   Brett Kavanaugh's entire performance was an hour's long rant. I am  quoting him. He said:         This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and       orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up       anger about President Trump and the 2016 election.        Fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial       record. Revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of       dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.    Unbelievable, in my view. He claimed to have written this screed on  his own without showing it to any of his handlers. I find that hard to  believe, given that he was reported to have spent 10-hour days at the  White House preparing for this hearing.   We heard Dr. Ford's raw and sincere account of that night as a drunk  teenaged Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge attacked her. The nominee  called it a ``grotesque and coordinated character assassination.'' But  this isn't a conspiracy, Judge Kavanaugh. It is real.   Look at what Dr. Ford's coming forward has triggered. People believe  her for many reasons. Her recall of events is consistent with the way  survivors of trauma remember things. Her demeanor was forthright and  open. She had everything to lose and nothing to  [[Page S6686]]  gain by coming forward, and despite what many are saying, there is  quite a bit of collaboration of her story.   She knew Brett Kavanaugh. She socialized with his circle of friends.  She had told people in her life what happened to her long before Brett  Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court. His calendar attests to  him having attended at least one gathering consistent with her  recollection.   But another reason so many people believe Dr. Ford is that her  account is so familiar. It has echoes in so many of our own stories,  our own experiences. So many women have survived some version of what  happened to her, along a spectrum of experiences that range from creepy  looks or catcalls to rape and other violent attacks. So many women have  kept their stories to themselves for fear of not being believed, for  fear of retaliation or humiliation, or shunning.   In a column written by Monica Hesse in the Washington Post, entitled  ``Dear dads: Your daughters told me about their assaults. This is why  they never told you,'' Ms. Hesse writes about all the reasons why  survivors don't even tell people closest to them about what happened to  them.   She writes:         For all the stereotypes that linger about women being too       fragile or emotional, these past weeks have revealed what       many women already knew: A lot of effort goes into protecting       men we love from bad things that happen to us.''    She writes to fathers who are only now finding out about the daily  indignities women endure and explains why they were never told and why  their loved ones were now writing to Hesse herself.   I am going to quote extensively from this article:         To the father of the young woman who was assaulted by the       student athlete she was hired to tutor: She never told you       because she didn't want to break your heart. But she told me,       in a long email, because the memory of it was breaking her       own heart and she'd spent five years replaying it.        To the father of the junior high student who was pinned       down and undressed at a gathering 30 years ago: She didn't       tell you because she didn't want to see you cry. But she told       me that she still remembers every detail.        To the father of the teenager who was raped at a party: You       don't know about this, because she was certain that if you       knew, you would kill her attacker and go to prison, and it       would be her fault.        To the father of the son who was assaulted by an older man:       I wish I could tell you more about what happened to him, but       he wouldn't tell me, and he definitely won't tell you,       because manliness is important to you, he says.        To all the fathers of all the silent victims: Your children       are quietly carrying these stories, not because they can't       handle the emotions but because they are worried that you       can't.        They are worried that your emotions will have too many       consequences. Or they fear you won't think of them the same       way. Or that you'll be distraught because you didn't protect       them.    These words and stories are powerful, and Ms. Hesse is right. So many  survivors want to protect their loved ones, but Ms. Hesse is also right  that they shouldn't keep their stories in. She urges them, saying:         So, to the rest of you: If you could tell your father in a       way that feels safe, and in a way that would bring you       comfort, tell your father. Tell your brothers. Let them be       uncomfortable; let them share some of your pain. Don't let       them be ignorant.    And once women are able to share their experiences, what should we do  with them? I agree with the author Rebecca Traister, who captured so  much of what I have been thinking lately in a piece called ``Fury Is a  Political Weapon, and Women Need to Wield It.'' This is in the New York  Times. I want to read some of it to you.   Ms. Tracer wrote:         Outside the room where Christine Blasey Ford forward was       testifying on Thursday morning, women were incandescent with       rage and sorrow and horror.        They were getting angry in a new way, a public way, an       unapologetic way--a way that is typically reserved for men,       and that would again serve men well, when afternoon came.        Brett Kavanaugh bellowed; he snarled; he pouted and wept       furiously at the injustice of having his ascendance to power       interrupted by accusations of sexual assault.        He challenged his questioners, turned their queries back on       them.        What happened inside the room was an exceptionally clear       distillation of who has historically been allowed to be angry       on their own behalf, and who has not.        And outside the room was a hint of how it might be       changing.        Most of the time, female anger is discouraged, repressed,       ignored, swallowed. Or transformed into something more       palatable and less recognizable as fury--something like       tears. When women are truly lived, they often weep.        Maybe we cry when we're furious in part because we feel a       kind of grief at all the things we want to say or yell that       we know we can't.        Maybe we're just sad about the very same things that we're       angry about. I wept as soon as Dr. Blasey began to speak.        On social media, I saw hundreds of messages from women who       reported the same experience, of finding themselves awash in       tears, simply in response to this woman's voice, raised in       polite dissent.        The power of the moment, the anxiety that it would be       futile, the grief that we would even have to put her--and       ourselves--through this spectacle, was intense.        Tears are permitted as an outlet for wrath in part because       they are fundamentally misunderstood.        One of my sharpest memories from an early job in a male-      dominated office, where I once found myself weeping with       inexpressible rage, was my being grabbed by the scruff of my       neck by an older woman--a chilly manager of whom I'd always       been slightly terrified--who dragged me into a stairwell.        ``Never let them see you crying,'' she told me. ``They       don't know you're furious. They think you're sad and will be       pleased because they got to you.''        This political moment has provoked a period in which more       and more women have been in no mood to dress their fury up as       anything other than raw and burning rage.        Many women are yelling, shouting, using Sharpies to etch       sharply worded slogans onto protest signs, making furious       phone calls to representatives.        Many of the women shouting now are women who have not       previously yelled publicly before, many of them, white       middle-class women newly awakened to political fury and       protest.        Part of the process of becoming mad must be recognizing       that they are not the first to be furious, and that there is       much to learn from the stories and histories of the lived       women--many of them not white or middle class--who have never       had reason not to be mad.        If you are angry today, or if you have been angry for       awhile, and you're wondering whether you're allowed to be as       angry as you feel, let me say: Yes. Yes, you are allowed. You       are, in fact, compelled.        If you've been feeling a new rage at the flaws of this       country, and if your anger is making you want to change your       life in order to change the world, then I have something       incredibly important to say: Don't forget how this feels.    That is Rebecca Traister's article.   Traister ends her article by endorsing anger and telling women not to  let go of it. She says:         What you're angry about now--injustice--will still exist,       even if you yourself are not experiencing it, or are tempted       to stop thinking about how you experience it, and how you       contribute to it.        Others are still experiencing it, still mad; some of them       are mad at you. Don't forget them; don't write off their       anger. Stay mad for them, alongside them, let them lead you       in anger.    That is what I am left with, Mr. President. Anger. Fury. Disgust. At  a process that could not see the truth of what Dr. Ford tried to tell  us.   The rewriters of truth are already at it. In column after column, on  cable news shows across the country, and even here on the Senate floor,  they are casting Judge Kavanaugh as the victim.   I was asked a few days ago whether the four Democratic women on the  Judiciary Committee had a special responsibility to address the  question of sexual assault. I reject the premise of that question. It  is not just up to the women in this country to stand up. Men have to  join us. They have to hold themselves and other men accountable. They  have to push back against the fear that those with power feel when they  are challenged. We saw some of the ways that this kind of fear operates  just this week among some of my Senate colleagues.   When approached by survivors of sexual assault who waited to talk to  them about the Kavanaugh nomination, they said things like ``Grow up,''  insinuating that the women sharing their painful, traumatic accounts  were there to enjoy themselves. Enjoy themselves?   We saw the President of the United States sink to a level I didn't  think possible. The mocker-in-chief mocked Dr. Ford, a survivor of  sexual assault. He mocked her for not remembering some peripheral  things about the attack. But the thing she said she was 100 percent  sure of was that it was Brett Kavanaugh who attacked her.   In case some of my colleagues don't get it, sexual assault survivors  often  [[Page S6687]]  don't remember how many steps, how many rooms, the kinds of things the  President mocked Dr. Ford about. But they remember the attack itself  with 100 percent accuracy. They remember how it felt, the fear, the  laughter of the attackers.   The kinds of insults that have been hurled at Dr. Ford and others in  her situation are cruel and unnecessary. I am left with anger and  determination, just like millions of people across the country.   I will take Rebecca Traister's advice and commend it to the women of  America and the men who understand their stories. I will stay mad and  let that anger propel us to change. Going forward, I will continue to  listen to women who have shared their stories. I will tell them that I  hear them, I see them, and I want all of us to be the change that needs  to happen in our country.   Before I yield the floor, I want to read a statement from Debbie  Ramirez dated October 6, 2018. She says:         Thirty-five years ago, the other students in the room chose       to laugh and look the other way as sexual violence was       perpetrated on me by Brett Kavanaugh. As I watch many of the       Senators speak and vote on the floor of the Senate I feel       like I'm right back at Yale where half the room is laughing       and looking the other way. Only this time, instead of drunk       college kids, it is U.S. Senators who are deliberately       ignoring his behavior. This is how victims are isolated and       silenced.        But I do have corroborating witnesses speaking for me,       although they were not allowed to speak to the FBI, and I       feel extremely grateful for them and for the overwhelming       amount of support that I have received and continue to       receive during this extremely difficult and painful time.       There may be people with power who are looking the other way,       but there are millions more who are standing together,       speaking up about personal experiences of sexual violence and       taking action to support survivors. This is truly a       collective moment of survivors and allies standing together.        Thank you for hearing me, seeing me and believing me. I am       grateful for each and every one of you. We will not be       silenced.        We stand in truth and light, Debbie Ramirez.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, yesterday, we heard our colleague from  Maine express the hope that his ``nomination is where the process has  finally hit rock bottom.'' On this, I agree. I hope we never again  reach a place where women are as disrespected, ignored, and  disregarded, as they have been throughout this confirmation process.   My colleague also observed that ``[w]e live in a time of such great  disunity'' that ``people bear[ ] extreme ill will toward those who  disagree with them.'' While that may be true for some, I think many of  us who have strongly spoken out about our concerns about Judge  Kavanaugh's nominations do not bear any ill will against those who  disagree with us. In fact, being able to strongly disagree with others  and voice our opinions without being told to ``grow up'' or called a  ``loud mouth'' reflects a respect for the American values of democracy  and respecting women. It is in that spirit, I would like to clarify  several misunderstandings raised by my colleague.   As my colleague from Maine noted, she cares about protecting women's  reproductive rights. Given this concern, I feel compelled to clarify  her description of Judge Kavanaugh's record on  [[Page S6688]]  reproductive rights. She referenced, without naming, Judge Kavanaugh's  dissenting opinion in favor of a religious organization, Priests for  Life. In that case, he argued that religious employers could deny their  women employees access to healthcare coverage of contraception because  filling out a 2-page form was too burdensome for them.   Despite this conclusion, my colleague described Judge Kavanaugh's  decision as ``seeking to ensure the availability of contraceptive  services for women while minimizing the involvement of employers with  religious objections.'' It is hard to see how blocking access to  contraceptives for women by finding a 2-page form too burdensome is  truly seeking to ensure access to contraceptives.   She claimed that his critics ``frequently overlook'' the fact that he  wrote that ``Supreme Court precedent `strongly suggested' that there  was a `compelling interest' in facilitating access to birth control.''  But that ignores the fact that regardless of this rhetoric, Judge  Kavanaugh has consistently demonstrated hostility to women's  reproductive rights, including in the very case that she referenced,  Priests for Life v. Department of Health and Human Services. Moreover,  if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court, Judge Kavanaugh can make clear  to the entire country that facilitating access to contraceptives is not  a compelling interest.   I am also very concerned that my colleague failed to mention the key  case addressing Judge Kavanaugh's views on women's reproductive rights,  Garza v. Hargan. In that case, a 17-year-old undocumented immigrant  sought release from HHS custody to obtain an abortion. In his dissent,  Judge Kavanaugh mischaracterized the case as one of ``parental  consent'' case to reach his desired outcome, denying this young women  access to her constitutional right to an abortion. Parental consent was  not at issue at all in that case. The young woman had already received  a proper judicial bypass from a Texas judge. That case is troubling not  only because it shows Judge Kavanaugh's complete disregard for a  woman's right to make her own decisions about the most intimate aspects  of her life, but also because it reveals his willingness to  misrepresent the law and facts to reach his partisan, desired outcome.   Although some of my colleagues have tried to hang their hat on Judge  Kavanaugh's generic statements about his respect for precedent, even  his own colleagues have criticized him for ignoring precedent, when  expedient. In one case, United States v. Anthem, his colleagues in the  majority sharply criticized his dissent, stating that their  ``dissenting colleague applies the law as he wishes it were, not as it  currently is.''   My colleague from Maine also noted Judge Kavanaugh's ``rave reviews .  . . as a judge, including for his judicial temperament.'' She pointed  to the fact that the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on  the Federal Judiciary, ABA, ``concluded that `his integrity, judicial  temperament, and professional confidence met the highest standard.' ''  But I would be remiss if I didn't further note that the ABA informed  the Judiciary Committee yesterday morning that it was reopening its  evaluation of Judge Kavanaugh because of ``[n]ew information of a  material nature regarding temperament during the September 27th hearing  before the Senate Judiciary Committee.'' This new information includes  Judge Kavanaugh's angry, partisan screed on September 27, when he  accused Senators of ``orchestrat[ing] a political hit'' as ``revenge on  behalf of the Clintons'' and ominously said, ``what goes around comes  around.''   These statements, which were not mentioned by my colleague, directly  contradict Judge Kavanaugh's statements of nonpartisanship that my  colleague quoted in her remarks. But the most important clarification  that I feel compelled to make is my colleague's discussion of Dr.  Christine Blasey Ford's testimony. My colleague stated that she ``found  [Dr. Ford's] testimony to be sincere, painful, and compelling.'' She  also said that she ``believe[s] [Dr. Ford] is a survivor of a sexual  assault and that this trauma has upended her life.''   But these statements of support were followed in the caveat,  ``Nevertheless.'' ``Nevertheless,'' it was said, ``the four witnesses  [Dr. Ford] named could not corroborate any of the events of the evening  gathering where she said the assault occurred.'' My colleague raised  questions about the fact that no one came forward from this small  gathering in the summer of 1982 to say that they were at the party or  that they gave Dr. Ford a ride home that night. Point by point, these  statements sought to poke holes in Dr. Ford's testimony based on little  details.   In the midst of the questions raised about these little details in  Dr. Ford's testimony, the bottom line message was clear: Dr. Ford was  not to be believed. She was mixed up, mistaken. By contrast, Judge  Kavanaugh was to be believed because he ``forcefully denied the  allegations under penalty of perjury.'' But there was no mention of the  fact that Dr. Ford also testified until penalty of perjury and said she  was ``100 percent'' certain it was Brett Kavanaugh who sexually  assaulted her in the summer of 1982.   In contrast to the claim that there was a ``lack of corroborating  evidence,'' there was significant corroborating evidence, as my  colleagues have already entered into the Record. To highlight just a  few, Dr. Ford's account was corroborated by Dr. Ford's therapist,  results of a polygraph examination, and other witnesses who were told  about Dr. Ford's account of her sexual assault, even before Judge  Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court.   In contrast to my colleague's description of this process as a  dysfunctional ``frenzy'' of special interest groups spreading  ``outright falsehoods,'' I believe what we have heard over the past few  weeks is democracy in action. Across America, women and men have been  sharing their painful experiences of sexual assault and why it matters  that someone who commits sexual assault should not be rewarded with a  seat on the highest court in the land. They are saying character,  credibility, candor, and temperament matter. Those are the American  values we will be rejecting today, if Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to  the Supreme Court.
