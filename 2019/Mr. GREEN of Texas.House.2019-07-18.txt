 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise with love of  country in my heart, understanding that, Mr. Speaker, we have gone from  ``lock her up'' to ``Jews will not replace us,'' to now ``send her  back.''   ``Send her back.''   Mr. Speaker, bigotry, hate is on the rise in the country, and I am so  proud of the 95 persons who, yesterday, voted against bigotry and hate.  We must not allow this to continue.   We now are moving on; we are marching on until victory is won. We  first had 58, then we had 66. Now, we have 95. We are marching on to  212.   And, Mr. Speaker, let me close with this: This is an important time  in our country. These are dangerous times. Every Member of this House  needs additional security. I am going to file a bill asking for more  security for the Members of this House.   Leadership has adequate security. Members do not have adequate  security. I want to thwart the efforts of those who might want to harm  a Member of this House.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have  voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 495.
