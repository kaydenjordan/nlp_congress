 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our 13  fallen servicemembers who made the ultimate sacrifice to save the lives  of Americans and allies in Afghanistan at the Kabul Airport at the end  of August.   These brave men and women, including southern California marines  Lance Corporal Dylan Merola, Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui, and Corporal  Hunter Lopez, were young--many in their twenties--and incredibly brave.  They valiantly put their lives on the line for others. Their courage  and heroism in the face of danger will never be forgotten.   I am proud that the House of Representatives came together to honor  their memory and posthumously award these fallen heroes a well-deserved  Congressional Gold Medal.   Mr. Speaker, we remember their names and their stories always, and we  continue to rally with our new Gold Star families.                            ____________________
