 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas (Mr.  Brady) for yielding and for his great leadership on this bill.   Today, America is in a crisis. Not since the Spanish flu of 1918 has  the world faced a global pandemic of such epic proportions. This virus,  which came out of Wuhan, China, has created fear and devastation across  the globe.   COVID-19 has infected more than 2.6 million people around the world  and killed nearly 200,000. It has paralyzed our economy, forcing more  than 26 million Americans into unemployment in just a few short weeks.  And that is why we took the risk, Madam Speaker, to fly back here today  so we can do our job and vote for this important legislation.  [[Page H1928]]    This rescue package throws a lifeline to small businesses and the  American worker to keep them whole during this hard time. It provides  much-needed funding for testing and for our hospitals that need it  desperately.   In closing, I want to take this opportunity to thank the brave  American heroes who are on the front line today: our doctors, nurses,  and first responders who are risking their lives every day. We honor  their sacrifice to our Nation.   At the end of the day, as Americans, we are all in this together, and  together we will get through this hard time and be stronger than ever  before.
