 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the objection.    Madam Speaker, first, I do want to acknowledge the  devastating events of the last 12 hours and to express my deep  appreciation for those who have worked to secure this building and  safeguard our democracy. On behalf of my colleagues, we are all  grateful for your service.   I ran for this office on a platform of civility and decency, and many  of my colleagues and constituents know that I am a third-generation  veteran, and I grew up in a military household.                                time  0120    Madam Speaker, what you may not know, though, is that I grew up in a  divided household. Throughout my childhood, one parent voted Democrat  and the other Republican. In my purple household, I learned that duty  to country was far more important than party allegiance. With each  election, my father would say: ``And when the election is done, we  salute smartly and we carry on.''   Now I live in and I serve in a community that has a lot in common  with the home that I grew up in. It, too, is a purple place that honors  civility and decency. Pennsylvania's Sixth District is, in many ways, a  microcosm of the Commonwealth and of our Nation. Our voter registration  in Chester County is 40-40-20, R, D, and I. Voters across my district  commonly split their ticket, some voting for President-elect Biden  while also voting down the ballot for Republicans for our State  legislature.   What some of my colleagues are arguing today is that those very  ballots are illegitimate. My colleagues cannot honestly believe that.  In fact, just this week they joined me on the House floor to be sworn  in to this hallowed body, and they trusted that the votes cast in their  favor were legitimate. And they are right. If those votes counted, then  so too must the votes for President-elect Biden.   We have also heard today concerns about mail-in ballots. I am not a  lawyer, but I am an engineer and, therefore, a student of numbers. It  wasn't just Democrats who voted by mail. It was not a free-for-all, as  it was described earlier. Madam Speaker, 600,000 Republicans in  Pennsylvania across the State voted by mail. By questioning the  election results, you are telling those Pennsylvanians that the hours  they spent in line to cast their ballot or the trip they took to the  post office in the middle of a pandemic just didn't matter.   Alan Novak is a man who served as the chair of the Republican Party  in Pennsylvania for nearly a decade. I will say that again. The Chair  of the Republican Party of Pennsylvania for a decade is one of those  voters I am talking about in Pennsylvania. He lives in my district, and  he split his ticket. He voted for me as his Member of Congress and also  for President Trump. And he eloquently said:         What makes America great, exceptional, and enduring is our       commitment to our government of laws, our orderly       constitutional process that settles our election disputes,       and our peaceful transfer of power with respect and civility.       It is easy when it is pretty and the outcome is not       controversial. But when it is not pretty and there is       controversy, then it is even more important that we respect,       honor, and abide by our revered and tested process for the       orderly transfer of power. Perhaps that may be all that we       can agree on, and it is the need for grace, respect, and       civility.    So I ask my colleagues across the aisle: Are you willing to  disenfranchise people like Mr. Novak and the more than 400,000 people  in Pennsylvania's Sixth District?   Perhaps some of the independent and pragmatic spirit that is so  prevalent among voters in my community comes from the history of the  place that we call home. Many Americans have visited Philadelphia and  our historic sites, but very few make it out to my community, which is  the home of Valley Forge. Here, General George Washington led the  Continental Army to winter quarters. The war had not been going well  for our young soldiers, and that winter was harder still. It was  bitterly cold, and food shortages and smallpox were abundant. Many  people died.   We remember what happened there because it was a test of our  endurance, a demonstration of devotion to mission and to our country  over ourselves. Coming out of that awful winter experience, our troops  emerged better trained, united, and ultimately victorious. In those  harsh, dark times, they found their common ground and their fortitude.   Just like then, it is in these trying moments when we learn who our  leaders truly are. They are the ones who don't just represent the  people or give orders or ready us for a fight. They are those who  educate and who speak truth. They inspire confidence and unity rather  than sowing division and strife. There is a striking parallel between  our nascent country and what they endured in Valley Forge and what we  are enduring right now: A hard winter of division, illness running  rampant, and an uncertain future.   Today, our country's resolve is being tested, and I know that we will  pass this test together and be made stronger. We now have the  opportunity and the responsibility to do that tonight by upholding the  will of the people, by voting to certify the results of this electoral  college and by moving forward with a servant heart and a common resolve  to preserve this great experiment that is the United States of America.
