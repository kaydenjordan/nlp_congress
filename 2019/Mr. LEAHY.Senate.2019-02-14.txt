 Mr. President, as someone who has been here for some  period of time, I was glad to see Republicans and Democrats, both in  the House and the Senate, come together in the past few weeks,  especially this week.   We ignored the distractions and tweetstorms coming from the White  House. We reached an agreement to fund our government and make  responsible investments for the American people.   Not one of us--none of the final four who did the negotiations,  sitting in that room, felt that this was an agreement that any one of  us would have individually written.   There are things in this bill that I support and things I disagree  with, but that could be said by all four of us, Republicans and  Democrats. You try to find as much common ground as you can. Everybody  had to give something, but we ended up with a bipartisan compromise. We  had to deal with facts that are based on reality, not rhetoric based on  political fantasy.   Democrats have always supported border security, but we support smart  border security, targeted strategies that address the real problems  facing us at our southwest border. That is what we tried to accomplish  here. We stood together. We rejected the toxic and hate-filled  immigration tweets coming from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.   The agreement does not fund President Trump's wasteful wall. After  all, he gave his solemn promise to the American public that Mexico  would pay for it, so let them work on that. It does not fund President  Trump's requested deportation force, and it rejects the unjustified and  dramatic increase in the detention bed levels the President would have  used to enforce his extreme immigration policy.   But just as important as what this agreement rejects is what we were  able to accomplish.   We invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new technology to stop  the flow of illegal drugs through our ports of entry. All Republicans  and all Democrats supported that. We provide funds to hire more judges  to address the immigration backlog in our country. We provide more than  half a billion dollars to support Central American countries,  addressing the root causes of undocumented migration. We included $400  million to improve medical care and address the humanitarian concerns  at the border. Every one of us has seen enough of what is going on  there; we are trying to show that America--the greatest Nation on  Earth, also the wealthiest and the most humanitarian--will address it.   This is what a compromise looks like. This is how the American people  expect our government to function--not by tweets but by reasonable,  reality-based compromise.   Unfortunately, often lost in this debate over border security were  the more than 800,000 public servants and their families who were held  hostage by the Trump shutdown for weeks. They once again lived in fear  and uncertainty that their next paycheck may not come because the  President chose to use them as hostages. This agreement ensures that  these public servants remain on the job doing the important work of the  American people through the end of the fiscal year, and also all those  who are not on a government payroll but support all our different  Agencies that were involved in this. They weren't paid either.   This agreement funds nine Federal Departments. Keep in mind--it is  not just the borders; it is nine Federal Departments and their related  Agencies. I will give a couple of examples. It increases funding for  the Environmental Protection Agency. It supports our national parks. It  rejects the anti-science know-nothingism of the administration by  supporting research and our dedicated scientists.   This is extremely important to me because Senator Crapo and I wrote  the last Violence Against Women authorization. We wrote the expansion  of that law. Our bill today provides the highest funding level ever for  the Office on Violence Against Women to support programs that prevent  domestic violence. It also provides more than half a billion dollars to  combat the opioid crisis. In my earlier career, I saw too many deaths  because of the violence against women. I saw too many deaths of young  people from drug overdoses, and the numbers have only dramatically  increased from the days when I was a prosecutor. Supporting the  Violence Against Women Act brought Republicans and Democrats together.   The agreement invests in rural America, secures our interests abroad,  rebuilds our highways, and supports public housing.   This week, four of us met--first in Chairman Shelby's Appropriations  Committee office and then later into the evening several times in my  office here in the Capitol. Senator Shelby,  [[Page S1363]]  Representative Lowey, Representative Granger, and I proved that we can  set aside the political struggles in Washington to find a path to  progress for the American people--two Republicans and two Democrats who  are four of the most senior Members of the House and the Senate. I  thank them for their effort.   If I can go to a personal matter for just a moment, I want to thank  Senator Shelby for his friendship and his partnership. Senator Shelby  and I come from different parts of the country. We are much different  politically, but he is one of the closest friends I have here. He and  his wonderful wife, Dr. Annette Shelby, my wife Marcelle, and I have  traveled to so many places together. Some were very grim areas of this  world. But we understand how grownups have to act in the Congress and  how they have to work together. We worked together with our House  counterparts--the senior Democrat and senior Republican in the House-- on this conference. We worked together. We didn't pass just Homeland  Security; we passed all 12 appropriations bills on a bipartisan basis.  I hope we do the same thing for fiscal year 2020. I hope that we can  begin very soon, with Senator Shelby and me working together, to pass  the fiscal year 2020 bills. We passed the ones last year out of our  committee virtually unanimously. We were able to get Members of both  parties to join us. I thank him.   I also thank the Appropriations Committee staff on both sides of the  aisle for their hard work. I joke that Senators are merely  constitutional impediments to their staff. Evening after evening,  sometimes into the wee hours of the morning, weekend after weekend, I  saw dedicated men and women in the Appropriations Committee staff  working line by line to try to get us through this.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of their names be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Charles E. Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jess Berry, Jay       Tilton, Hannah Chauvin, Dianne Nellor, Adrienne       Wojciechowski, Teri Curtin, Jean Toal Eisen, Jennifer Eskra,       Blaise Sheridan, Jordan Stone, Ellen Murray, Diana Gourlay       Hamilton, Reeves Hart, Scott Nance, Chip Walgren, Drenan E.       Dudley, Rachael Taylor, Ryan Hunt, Tim Rieser, Alex Carnes,       Kali Farahmand, Dabney Hegg, Christina Monroe, Jordan Stone,       Shannon H. Hines, Jonathan Graffeo, David Adkins, Margaret       Pritchard, Carlisle Clark, Patrick Carroll, Elizabeth Dent,       Hamilton Bloom, Amber Beck, Allen Cutler, Matt Womble, Sydney       Crawford, Andrew Newton, Lauren Nunnally, Brian Daner,       Courtney Bradford, Adam Telle, Peter Babb, Chris Cook,       Thompson Moore, Christian Lee, Leif Fonnesbeck, Lucas Agnew,       Emy Lesofski, Nona McCoy, Clare Doherty, Gus Maples, Rajat       Mathur, Jason Woolwine, LaShawnda Smith, Robert W. Putnam,       Christy Greene, Blair Taylor, Jenny Winkler, Hong Nguyen,       Clint Trocchio, George A. Castro, Elmer Barnes, Penny Myles,       Karin Thames, Shalanda Young, Chris Bigelow, Anne Marie       Chotvacs, Johnnie Kaberle, Gerry Petrella, Meghan Taira.     I conclude by saying it takes a lot of long days and it  takes a lot of long nights to produce a bill of this magnitude. I  appreciate their hard work.   I think we may have others who will want to speak.   Mr. President, how much time do we have before the vote?    I yield the floor.    Madam President, in his tortuous attempt to make a case  for billions of taxpayer dollars to wall off our southern border,  President Trump claimed that a wall would stop human trafficking, which  has been touted as a priority of this administration.   On several occasions, the President has depicted human trafficking as  women and girls smuggled across the border with their hands and legs  tied and duct tape across their mouths. No doubt there are such cases,  but the overwhelming majority of trafficking victims in this country  are U.S. citizens, and among non-citizen victims, nearly 80 percent  cross through legal points of entry. As we have seen time and again,  President Trump makes short shrift of the truth and relies on scare  tactics, rather than evidence, to gamer support for his misguided  policies.   Not only would the President's border wall do next to nothing to  combat the most common instances of human trafficking in the United  States, his administration's policies have actually harmed trafficking  victims, especially non-citizen victims.   Last year, the administration announced that applicants who are  denied a T visa--an immigrant visa that enables certain victims of sex  or labor trafficking to temporarily remain in the United States--may be  required to appear in immigration court, the first step in deportation  proceedings. This policy has reportedly had a self-censoring effect on  victims and victims' advocates who are hesitant to apply or to  encourage their clients to apply for a visa that may ultimately land  them in immigration court.  [[Page S1376]]    The administration also eliminated grant funding for criminal record  sealing or expungement for survivors of human trafficking, previously  made available by the Department of Justice's Office for Victims of  Crime. Survivors may have a criminal record associated with their  trafficking, such as an arrest for prostitution or for a charge  tangential to their trafficking such as loitering or theft. Helping  survivors clear their criminal record is a critical step in their  recovery, one that gives survivors a greater chance at securing stable  employment, affordable housing, higher education, visas and green  cards, and more.   So once again, we are forced to try to reconcile the President's  rhetoric with the actions of his administration. They don't align. If  this White House were serious about combating human trafficking, it  would focus less on creating a false narrative about trafficking across  our southern border and instead devote the resources to ensure that  trafficking victims can come forward knowing they will be protected and  assisted on their path to recovery.                            ____________________     Madam President, I want to commend Senator Klobuchar for  introducing the Freedom to Export to Cuba Act, of which I and Senator  Enzi are cosponsors. I urge other Senators to join us.   This bill is about ending the anachronistic prohibitions in U.S. law  that for decades have limited U.S. engagement with Cuba, including  preventing American companies from exporting their products to Cuba.  The fact that legislation to do so is even necessary is illustrative of  the absurdity of the situation in which we find ourselves. Companies  from Europe, Russia, China, Mexico, and every other country can sell  their products to Cuba, which is just 90 miles from our coast, but  American manufacturers and retailers are largely shut out of the Cuban  market.   For example, Cuba buys rice from Vietnam and powdered milk from New  Zealand, half a world away, not from Alabama, Vermont, or Michigan.  That makes no sense. This bill would enable American companies to  compete, which every believer in a free market should support.   It is also important for Senators to know that punitive actions by  the Trump administration last year to further restrict the right of  Americans to travel to Cuba have had devastating consequences for  Cuba's fledgling private sector, the very people the White House and  supporters of the restrictions profess to want to help. The fact that  they have said nothing about the harm they are causing Cuba's  struggling entrepreneurs demonstrates that they care more about  continuing their failed policy of sanctions, regardless of who they  hurt, than about helping the Cuban people or about protecting the right  of Americans to travel freely.   The latest ill-conceived attempt by the White House to punish Cuba  would permit Title III of the Helms-Burton Act to go into effect. This  would allow, among others, individuals who were Cuban citizens when  their property in Cuba was expropriated half a century ago to sue in  U.S. courts any Cuban, foreign, and even American company whose  business in Cuba today uses that property. That could be an airport,  port, warehouse, hotel, restaurant, you name it. Virtually every  American and foreign company investing in Cuba would suddenly be liable  for treble damages.   The purpose, as the law's authors made clear when it was enacted 23  years ago, is to harm Cuba's economy by making it completely  inhospitable for foreign investment.   As my friend in the House, Representative Jim McGovern, has pointed  out;         ``It's no mystery why Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama, and       Trump blocked Title III from going into effect every six       months for the past 23 years.        It is hypocritical--it penalizes companies for doing what       American companies do all over the world.        It is contrary to international law, which recognizes the       right of expropriation and requires compensation.        It is an extraterritorial sanction that guarantees a       response from our trading partners, like Canada, Spain and       the EU, including complaints at the World Trade Organization.        And if you care about agriculture, be warned: It will open       a new front in the trade war, with all the repercussions that       can bring.        It will allow Cuba to claim victim status and rally       international support.        It will clog our courts with lawsuits.        It will make it impossible to negotiate compensation for       U.S. claims in Cuba, and, in the end, hurt the very Americans       who seek compensation for the property they lost.        It will divide us from friends and allies who are now       working for a peaceful solution in Venezuela.        And it will guarantee that new investment in Cuba will come       from the Russians, Chinese and others who are hostile to the       United States, and whose state-owned companies can't be sued       in U.S. courts.''    I agree with my friend in the other body. What the White House is  considering would trigger an avalanche of unintended consequences that  would bring U.S. commerce with Cuba to a halt, harm relations with our  allies in this hemisphere and beyond, and make resolving property  claims more difficult. I ask unanimous consent that a piece by William  Leogrande on Title III of the Helms-Burton Act published in the  February 13, 2019 issue of OnCubaNews be printed in the Record  following my remarks.   Like many issues, Members of Congress have strong feelings pro and  con about U.S. relations with Cuba. It is no secret that, after more  than half a century of a policy of isolation that has achieved none of  its objectives and primarily hurt the Cuban people, I, like Senators  Klobuchar and Enzi and many others in this body, favor closer  relations.   Conversely, there are those in Congress and the Trump administration  who believe strongly that we should ratchet up the pressure on the  Cuban Government in an attempt to achieve those elusive goals.   I have often spoken publicly about the lack of political freedom and  civil liberties in Cuba, but I also think it is important to try to be  objective: to criticize when called for and to acknowledge positive  changes when they occur.   I recognize that those who favor maintaining the failed economic  embargo have a longstanding, visceral antagonism and resentment toward  the Cuban Government. While they rarely, if ever, mention the corrupt  and brutal Batista regime that enjoyed unqualified U.S. support until  it was overthrown in 1959, they have legitimate reasons to criticize  the mistreatment of the Cuban people by the current government and its  support for the corrupt and repressive Maduro regime in Venezuela.   But they too should acknowledge that threatening and bullying Cuba  has not worked. In fact, it has made the situation worse and provided  an excuse for the Cuban Government to blame its own failures on us.  They should also acknowledge positive changes in Cuba, but they never  do--not ever. It is almost as if they are psychologically,  ideologically, or emotionally incapable of saying one positive thing  about the Cuban Government, no matter what positive things it does.   Perhaps they are afraid that, if they did, they would alienate their  donors in the Cuban-American community. Of course, we know that Cuban- Americans are divided about the U.S. embargo. Some are hardcore  believers in the embargo, and they always will be. But at least as  many--and increasing numbers--oppose the embargo, especially those who  were born after the Cuban revolution.   I wonder what the pro-embargo isolationists would say if the Cuban  Government were to stop harassing and abusing dissidents who favor a  more democratic system. Would those who oppose the embargo say anything  positive?   What if the Cuban Government decided to embrace a free market economy  and let private businesses flourish? Would those who oppose the embargo  say anything positive?   I doubt it. I doubt it because no matter what positive reforms occur  in Cuba, they will continue to defend the embargo until Cuba is a full- fledged democracy and those who currently hold power either die or are  voted out of office.   We all want Cuba to become a democracy, where civil and political  rights are respected, and the sooner the better, but those same  defenders of the embargo support billions of dollars in U.S. aid--and  weapons sales--to countries that are led by authoritarian, brutal, and  corrupt dictatorships and monarchies, some of which have held power for  decades or generations.  [[Page S1377]]    How do the pro-embargo diehards reconcile that? They don't, and they  can't.   The fact is, Cuba is changing--not nearly as fast as we and the Cuban  people would like, but it is changing in ways that few would have  predicted not very long ago.   Last year, Raul Castro's hand-picked successor, Miguel Diaz-Canel,  became President, and he promised a government more accessible and  responsive to the people's needs. How he delivers on that promise  remains to be seen.   Since 2010, after the Cuban Government recognized that the internet  is essential if Cuba wants to be part of the modern world, internet  access has exploded. The government has opened hundreds of public Wi-Fi  hot spots and cyber cafes in the past 5 years, and home internet access  became legal and available in 2017. Today, almost half of the Cuban  people have personal cellphones that were illegal just a decade ago.    As others have pointed out, these changes have encouraged new forms  of communication, networking, and organizing via social media.   But change does not come easily in Cuba, as it does not in many  countries. Last July, the government announced onerous new regulations  on the private sector, covering a wide range of issues: food safety,  labor contracts, procurement, taxation, limits on the size of private  businesses. The new rules were an attempt by hardliners to crack down  on the private sector, which was criticized for black marketeering.   But private entrepreneurs resisted, and they challenged the  regulations as contradictory to the government's own plans that  recognizes the private sector as important to economic growth and  employment. They appealed to government officials and spoke publicly  about the harm the new rules would have on their businesses.   When the final regulations were issued, several that had caused the  most resentment were dropped. According to the Minister of Labor and  Social Security, the decision to revise the rules was due to ``the  opinion and experiences of those directly involved.''   The government also retreated on a new law--Decree 349--requiring  artists, musicians, and performers to register with the state and pay a  large commission on their earnings from private engagements, and it  banned work with objectionable content and empowered inspectors to shut  down any offensive exhibition or performance. Clearly, an attempt to  further limit free expression.   Since the 1980s, Cuban artists have had more freedom to be critical  of the government than other social sectors, and so it was not  surprising that Decree 349 ignited widespread protests. After social  media was used to mobilize opposition within the Cuban arts community  and among artists abroad, the government agreed not to enforce the law  until implementing regulations are drafted in consultation with the  arts community.   According to one observer, ``during [the latter half of last year],  nearly 8.9 million Cubans debated the draft of a new constitution in  their workplaces, neighborhoods and schools. Communist Party members  were told not to argue with even the most radical proposals for  amendments, and the ensuing debates were freewheeling, often lasting  past their scheduled time. Among the main topics: whether the president  and state governors should be directly elected by voters; whether the  concentration of wealth and property should be allowed; whether term  limits and age limits for leaders were a good idea; and whether the  Communist Party should be subordinated to the constitution and hence  the law.'' Not long ago it would have been unthinkable to openly debate  these issues, especially as part of a constitutional reform process.   One article that attracted intense debate recognized same-sex  marriage and was promoted by Raul Castro's daughter, a long-time  activist for LGBTQ rights. The proposal sparked strong opposition from  evangelical churches supported by the Catholic Church. Gay rights  advocates countered with campaigns of their own. The chance of a  significant ``no'' vote on the entire constitutional reform led the  government to drop the provision from the final draft of the  constitution with a pledge to consider it later.   This surge in mobilization by well-organized constituencies utilizing  social media to resist government policy, from burdensome private  sector regulations to gay marriage, is unprecedented in Cuba. The  government's willingness to not only tolerate these organized  challenges but to change policies in response to them is significant.   As has been noted, none of these issues dealt with the rigid  structure of the Cuban system. Cuba remains a one-party state, in which  those who challenge the system are treated as criminals, but the  precedent of organized interest groups mounting successful campaigns to  challenge and change government policy is now established, which is  positive.   None of the longstanding critics of the Cuban Government in the U.S.  Congress or the Cuban-American community have acknowledged any of this,  nor are they likely to. For them, anything less than a wholesale change  of government in Cuba is unworthy of mention, even though they apply a  very different standard--a double standard--to other authoritarian  governments. In fact, they would ridicule anyone who regards such  changes as positive or worthy of recognition.   As we know from our own experience, political reform is difficult.  Our own Electoral College, an anachronism designed to protect a slave- holding minority, remains in effect more than two centuries later. Five  times, in the world's oldest democracy, it has prevented the winner of  the most popular votes from being elected President.   The Cuban people want to live better and they want a lot less  government control over their lives. Armed with cellphones and the  internet, they are going to make increasing demands of their  government. This is happening at a time when Venezuela's economy is  collapsing and the survival of the Maduro regime, Cuba's closest ally  in the hemisphere, is in question. Not surprisingly, the Cuban  Government is trying to limit the pace of change and to secure other  benefactors. It is turning increasingly to Russia, Algeria, Iran, and  other countries that welcome the chance to challenge U.S. influence in  this hemisphere.   This is a time for the United States to be actively and visibly  engaged in Cuba, for Americans to be traveling to Cuba, for expanding  educational, cultural, and professional exchanges between the U.S. and  Cuba, and for American companies to be competing in Cuba. It is not a  time to return to a failed policy of threats and ultimatums, driven by  domestic politics rather than by what is in our national interests.   That is why I am cosponsoring the Freedom to Export to Cuba Act, and  it is why I intend to support other bipartisan legislation to replace  our failed Cuba policy with one that serves America's interests, not  the interests of a shrinking minority, and not the interests of Russia  and other countries that are reaping the economic benefits of our self- defeating policy of isolation.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      [From OnCubaNews, Feb. 13, 2019]   President Trump Risks Alienating Allies over Cuban American Property                                   Claims                         (By William M. LeoGrande)         The Trump administration is seriously considering whether       to allow Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic       Solidarity Act (Helms-Burton) to go into effect in March,       according to National Security Adviser John Bolton. On       January 16, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that he       was suspending Title III for just 45 days instead of the       usual six months while the administration reviews whether its       implementation would promote democracy in Cuba. He warned       foreign companies doing business on the island that they had       better ``reconsider whether they are trafficking in       confiscated property and abetting this dictatorship.''        Title III allows U.S. nationals to file suit in U.S. courts       against anyone ``trafficking'' in their confiscated property       in Cuba--that is, anyone profiting from it. If President       Trump allows Title III to go fully into effect, he will open       the door to as many as 200,000 law suits by U.S. nationals,       most of them Cuban Americans, whose property was taken by the       Cuban government after 1959. U.S. courts would be swamped,       the ability of U.S. companies to do business on the island       would be crippled, and allies abroad might retaliate for U.S.       suits brought against their companies in Cuba. Once the suits       have been filed, there will be no way to undo the resulting       legal chaos and the tangle of resulting litigation could take       years to unwind.        The U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission has certified       5,913 claims of U.S. nationals whose property was seized.       These are  [[Page S1378]]       the claims that Cuba recognizes and that the United States       and Cuba had begun to discuss during the Obama       administration. But Title III takes the unusual position of       allowing naturalized Cuban Americans who lost property to       also file suit against alleged traffickers. Normally,       international law recognizes the sovereign right of       governments to dispose of the property of their own citizens.       According to the Department of State, by including Cuban       Americans who were not U.S. citizens when their property was       taken, Title III creates the potential for an estimated       75,000-200,000 claims worth ``tens of billions of dollars.''        Back in 1996, when the law was being debated in Congress,       angry opposition from U.S. allies Canada, Mexico, and the       European Union, whose companies doing business in Cuba would       be the targets of Title III law suits, led President Bill       Clinton to insist on a presidential waiver provision in Title       III. As a result, the president has the authority to suspend       for six months the right to file Title III law suits, and he       can renew that suspension indefinitely. Every six months       since the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act was       passed, successive presidents, Democrat and Republican alike,       have continued the suspension of Title III.        U.S. allies have denounced Title III's extraterritorial       reach. Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the European       Union all passed laws prohibiting compliance with it. The       European Union also filed a complaint with the World Trade       Organization, which it did not pursue after President Clinton       suspended Title III. In fact, the principal justification       both President Clinton and President George W. Bush offered       for continuing the suspension was the need to maintain       cooperation with European allies.        If President Trump does not renew the suspension, all these       old wounds with allies will be reopened as U.S. claimants try       to haul foreign companies into U.S. courts for doing business       in Cuba. We already have enough tough issues on our agenda       with Mexico, Canada, and Europe without adding another one.       At this very moment, Washington is trying to muster their       support in dealing with the Venezuelan crisis, support that       could be endangered if the administration picks a fight with       them over Title III.        U.S. businesses would not be exempt from potential       liability. A Cuban American family in Miami claims to have       owned the land on which Jose Marti International Airport was       built, so any U.S. carrier using the air field could       conceivably be sued under Title III. Another family that       owned the Port of Santiago could file suit against U.S.       cruise ships docking there.        Moreover, it would be almost impossible for a U.S. or       foreign company to know in advance whether a proposed       business opportunity in Cuba might become the subject of       Title III litigation. ``This will effectively end for decades       any attempt to restore trade between the U.S. and Cuba,''       attorney Robert Muse told the Tampa Bay Times.        When President Trump announced new sanctions on Cuba back       in June 2017, senior administration officials said they were       designed ``to not disrupt existing business'' that U.S.       companies were doing in Cuba. If the president fails to       continue the suspension of Title III, business relations will       be disrupted far more severely and irreparably than they       would be by any regulatory change.                            ____________________
