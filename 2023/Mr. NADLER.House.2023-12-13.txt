 Mr. Speaker, we all know why we are here today.   The majority has no accomplishments to speak of. Their own Members  have said so, and the rightwing is getting restless.   So since they can't legislate and run on anything positive, they have  decided to tear down President Biden instead. They have no evidence, of  course, to support this inquiry, but since this majority never lets  facts get in the way of a good set of FOX News talking points, here we  are.   Dozens of witnesses have sat for transcribed interviews. Every one of  those witnesses tells us the same thing: There was no political  interference in the Hunter Biden case. Nobody at the Department of  Justice ever blocked the special counsel from bringing charges.  Unfortunately, the American public does not have most of this story  because Chairman Jordan refuses to release the transcripts from our  interviews.   In fact, of the 85 interviews our committee has conducted so far, he  has released exactly one transcript. He knows if he releases any more  than that, his preferred narrative will crumble. The evidence simply  does not support these baseless charges. Why is the MAGA wing of the  Republican Party resorting to this political stunt? Two words: Donald  Trump.  [[Page H6882]]    The likely nominee of the Republican Party, who faces 91 criminal  charges in various courts, was also impeached not once, but twice, and  we had evidence. Whenever the former President is accused of  wrongdoing, his favorite move is to accuse his opponent of doing the  same.   For this to work, of course, he needs President Biden to be  impeached, too. Therefore, he asked his enablers in Congress to invent  an impeachment, even if there is not a shred of evidence to back it up.  Even if everything Chairman Comer said were true, which none of it is,  an impeachable offense committed by Vice President Biden would not be  under our Constitution grounds for impeaching President Biden.   This is political hackery, not serious work. We should be focused on  doing the work of the American people and not be distracted by  pernicious nonsense.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``no'' on this ridiculous  resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I once again rise in strong support of any  and all serious and meaningful efforts to combat antisemitism.  Unfortunately, it's clear that the resolution on the floor today was  drafted with the sole intention of scoring political points, not  protecting Jewish students from antisemitism.   Last month, the House passed a resolution condemning antisemitism on  college campuses and calling for campus administrators to ensure Jewish  students and faculty are protected. Since then, I have urged the  Majority to move past mere lip service and instead make meaningful  contributions to the fight against antisemitism on college campuses.   If the Republican Majority truly cared about protecting Jewish  students and faculty, they would have spent the last month implementing  the Biden Administration's National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism  and providing robust funding for the federal office working to protect  Jewish students--the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights.  Instead, they put a spending bill on the floor that cuts the Department  of Education's Office of Civil Rights' budget by 25 percent.   If the Majority truly cared about protecting Jewish students and  faculty, they would pass a bill increasing funding for the Nonprofit  Security Grant Program, which provides critical funding to safeguard  our nation's synagogues and Jewish centers.   If the Majority truly cared about protecting Jewish students and  faculty, they would stop echoing racist `great replacement theories'  and ignoring antisemitism emanating from the right--including  antisemitic comments coming directly from the leader of their party.  It's telling that the sponsor of this resolution has chosen to remain  silent about former President Trump--whom she has endorsed--dining with  a man who is calling for the genocide of ``perfidious Jews'' and other  non-Christians.   Finally, if the Republican majority truly cared about protecting  Jewish students and faculty, they would work with Democrats on this  issue in a good-faith, bipartisan fashion instead of blatantly  plagiarizing the work of a Jewish Democrat.   Mr. Speaker, the rise of antisemitism in the United States and across  the world--particularly on college campuses--is a real and growing  problem. I hope that someday, the Majority will use its power to  actually do something about it instead of playing partisan political  games. I continue to stand ready to work with the Majority if they are  ever ready to address this issue in a serious, bipartisan fashion.  However, I can not support this attempt to score political points  masquerading as a resolution to protect Jewish students and faculty.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution.                                time  1600
