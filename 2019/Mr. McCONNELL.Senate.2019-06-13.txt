 Mr. President, this week the Senate has been  remarkably productive in confirming more of the President's well- qualified nominees. We have confirmed nine newly minted judges to fill  vacancies on the Federal bench.   Today we will turn to the executive branch and confirm David Stilwell  to serve as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific  Affairs and Edward Crawford to serve as Ambassador to Ireland.   Remember, earlier this spring, we put in place a modest reform to  Senate rules so we could consider these uncontroversial, lower level  nominations at a more reasonable pace. That had been the Senate's  normal tradition until very recently, and so we restored it.   At the time, I recall my friends across the aisle insisting that the  majority would use these more efficient procedures to push through all  kinds of polarizing and controversial people. That is what they  argued--if we made this modest rule change, we would be pushing through  all these polarizing and controversial people.   Well, here are a few of the rollcall votes the Senate has taken on  nominations this week: 91 to 5, 62 to 34, 77 to 19, 85 to 11. Yesterday  afternoon, on a procedural vote for Mr. Stilwell, it was 93 to 4. A  pretty controversial bunch.   So virtually all of us can remember a time when nominations of this  sort would have passed the Senate on a voice vote. These days,  Democrats are making us file cloture and spend floor time on each, but  at least our new Senate rules are helping us get these thoroughly  bipartisan nominees through at a more efficient pace.                            ____________________     Now, on another matter, later today the Senate will  vote on two resolutions that would undermine U.S. influence and  credibility in the Middle East and ultimately make the region a more  dangerous place. Some of our colleagues seek to block arms sales to two  of the closest partners of the United States in the region--Bahrain and  Qatar.   These resolutions are misguided. They would make the United States a  less reliable partner, weaken the influence we have with our friends,  and open the door to other more unscrupulous powers like Russia and  China.   There is this small matter that neither of these resolutions would  even solve the problem that seems to have motivated them. I understand  many Members of this body are genuinely concerned about some of the  actions of our Saudi partners in Yemen. Fortunately, the Senate has  repeatedly expressed these concerns directly  [[Page S3452]]  through our legislative and oversight authority. As I stated in the  past, Members should share their concerns and discuss these matters  directly with members of our administration or with Saudi officials.   If Senators are upset about the State Department's recent invocation  of a national emergency to advance arms sales to Saudi Arabia, they  will have an opportunity to vote on that matter later. So the Senate  has ample opportunity to make our voice heard about Riyadh's behavior,  but the two resolutions we vote on today are not that opportunity. It  is something else.   Whatever frustrations my colleagues may feel with the course of the  conflict in Yemen, taking swipes at our relationships with Bahrain and  Qatar is certainly not the response. Bahrain's involvement in the Yemen  conflict has been limited to defensive border security operations and,  for the past 2 years, Qatar has been completely uninvolved. Moreover,  both Bahrain and Qatar provide absolutely essential support to our  military operations in the region, without which our ability to project  power and protect U.S. interests would be severely challenged.   I assume everyone knows Qatar is home to the U.S. Central Command's  forward headquarters in the region, with 10,000 U.S. personnel and  upward of 100 aircraft. It is the hub for many of our ongoing efforts  against ISIS and other regional threats.   In Bahrain, you will find the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth  Fleet. That is another 7,000 U.S. personnel, plus assets, responsible  for command and control of over 3 million square miles of international  waters.   So I would remind our colleagues of the briefing we received recently  about the growing Iranian threat in the region. I would encourage them  to reflect on recent attacks, probably by Iran or its proxies, against  civilian vessels in UAE, against civilian airports in Saudi Arabia and  UAE, and near our Embassy in Baghdad. In fact, literally just hours  ago, two more commercial shipping vessels were apparently attacked off  the coast of Oman. These attacks may appear directed at the countries  that use them to export petrochemicals or at the international owners  of the vessels, but the fact is, they threaten the very underpinnings  of the global trading system and customary Law of the Sea that ensures  freedom of transit on the seas.   We don't know who is responsible for these latest attacks--not yet,  anyway--but it is not unreasonable to suspect an Iranian hand in them.  I hope, in coming days, we have clarity about who is responsible, but  what is clear is the growing tension and instability in that region.   So at a time of growing threats to U.S. personnel, interests, and  partners posed by Iran, do we really want to send this kind of signal  to our partners?   If we turn our back on them, can we continue to count on the  significant support they provide us or the freedom of maneuver our  large presence in their countries affords us?   As the State Department has announced, the proposed sales that are at  issue today would provide each of these host nations with important  enhanced security capabilities, including antiaircraft systems and  support equipment. They will also tie these nations closer to the  United States at a time when our adversaries would happily--happily-- sell comparable weapons at less cost and with fewer restrictions.   In recent years, we have seen both Republican and Democratic  administrations seek to reduce the U.S. military footprint in the  region and have our partners assume more responsibility for their own  security. So it is curious that Senators would want to not only sever  security ties with these partners but also limit their ability to  defend themselves.   In each of these cases, the U.S. arms sales in question have followed  normal procedures; they have been properly screened and vetted; and  they have been reviewed and approved by both the chairmen and ranking  members of the Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs  Committee.   Let me say that again: The chairman and ranking members of these  committees reviewed and approved these arms sales. That is bipartisan,  bicameral support.   So in sum, I would ask my colleagues who support these resolutions  whether they have even spoken to the Bahraini or Qatari Ambassadors to  discuss any concerns. I would encourage them to visit Doha and Manama  to confer with the leaders of these countries and speak with thousands  of American sailors and airmen based there.   I would encourage my colleagues to ask our own senior military  officials whether we will be better off if our partners purchase  Russian or Chinese military systems instead of ours. I would encourage  them to ask our diplomats whether America will have more or less  influence with our partners if we capriciously block their purchase of  American weapons.   I strongly urge each of our colleagues to reject these resolutions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, all this week, I have been calling  attention to the fact that the Democrats over in the House spent 6  weeks ignoring the urgent need for more funding on the crisis on our  southern border. I have recited one quotation after another from the  administration leaders who are responsible for securing our Nation and  caring for individuals while they are detained. They are pleading with  us to act.   ``We are at a full-blown emergency. . . . The system is broken.''  That is the Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. It  couldn't be more clear.   ``We are running out of money. We are functionally out of space.''  That one is from the Secretary of Health and Human Services.   I have also run down the underlying statistics. The flood of people  attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border has continued at historic  levels. Our border agents are overwhelmed. Our facilities are filled  beyond capacity--in some cases, with more than seven times more men,  women, and children than their intended capacity.   This is a full-fledged crisis, and everybody knows it. The status quo  cannot hold. Already, the Department of Homeland Security is having to  move people and money away from other important efforts to triage more  help toward the border.   The administration has been saying this is a crisis. The officials on  the ground have been saying this is a crisis. My Republican colleagues  and I have been saying repeatedly this is a crisis. And lest anyone  think this is some partisan exercise, the New York Times editorial  board has been saying it is a crisis. There were two editorials over  the last several weeks. The first headline says: ``Congress, Give Trump  His Border Money,'' and ``When Will Congress Get Serious About the  Suffering at the Border?''   Those are headlines in the New York Times, not frequently allied with  this administration. Everybody seems to understand that, except  Democrats over in the House.   It is not as if our House colleagues are too busy working on  pragmatic, bipartisan legislation with any shot at becoming law. No,  here is what they are up to. One House committee spent yesterday  holding a hearing on pathways to single-payer health insurance--in  other words, barking up the tree of Medicare for None, their big  proposal to take away every American's private health insurance, to  take away Medicare as we know it, and force everyone into a new,  untested, one-size-fits-all government system. That is what they are up  to over there. That is the score. They have no time for the border  crisis but plenty of time for socialist daydreams.   Even my colleague the Democratic leader has admitted the Democratic- controlled House is the problem here. We have even heard it from House  Democrats themselves. One told reporters that his progressive  colleagues weren't convinced the emergency funding was necessary. One  Democratic Congressman says progressive colleagues were not convinced  that emergency funding was necessary.   So it seems ``the resistance'' has convinced Washington Democrats  that they need to come down to the left of the New York Times editorial  page. There is not much space over there to the left of the New York  Times editorial page.   But Senate Republicans are not going to be deterred. The crisis at  the border hasn't gone anywhere, and neither has our resolve to address  it. Next  [[Page S3453]]  week, the Senate is going to move forward. The Appropriations Committee  will vote again. I hope Democrats in the House of Representatives will  finally realize ``the resistance'' doesn't pay the bills. No more  political posturing, no more automatic knee-jerk opposition to  absolutely everything the administration asks for--it is way past time  for action.    Will the Senator from Texas yield for a question?    As a member of the Judiciary Committee involved in  this, is there any indication there might be bipartisan support for  authorizing this legislation that you all are working on in committee?    I would say to my friend that the answer here is not  just the money but an actual adjustment of U.S. law to more directly  affect the crisis that we have. We need to do both, correct?    Would it be safe to characterize this as a situation  in which we are actually getting more cooperation from the Mexicans  than we are from the Democrats in Congress?    I would just add that I hope there is success in the  Judiciary Committee to achieve some kind of bipartisan consensus so  that we can solve the entire problem, not just the humanitarian crisis.   I thank the Senator from Texas.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 222.
