 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2430, the FDA  Reauthorization Act of 2017 to reauthorize four important user fee  programs: the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the Medical Device User  Fee Act, the Generic Drug User Fee Act, and the Biosimilar User Fee  Act. These critically important laws have improved patient access to  important therapies and expedited the FDA's approval times while  upholding the most rigorous standards for patient safety.   The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was enacted in 1992 when  drug review times were lagging and FDA simply couldn't keep up with the  flood of new drug applications. Through user fees paid by applicants,  PDUFA gave FDA the resources it needed to hire and support more staff.  The program has been successful in reducing review-time backlogs and  expediting safe and effective therapies to patients.   My legislation created the Medical Device User Fee Act (MDUFA), which  was enacted in 2002 and has resulted in significant changes to the  medical device industry and within the medical device center at the  FDA. Through this user fee program, the device center has improved its  efficiency and reduced the time it takes to bring effective medical  devices to market. This legislation builds on the progress made in  previous user fee agreements and will produce important developments  for the medical device industry.   The Generic Drug User Fee Agreement (GDUFA) was enacted in 2012 and  takes important steps to bring lower-priced drugs to the market more  quickly for the American people. Finally, the Biosimilar User Fee  Agreement (BsUFA), which was first enacted in 2012 through legislation  I authored, is critical to supporting the nascent biosimilar industry  and will lead to meaningful progress, breakthroughs and cures for the  American people.   Previous user fee reauthorizations have included significant gains  for pediatric populations. Before the Better Pharmaceuticals for  Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), which  I authored, the vast majority of drugs (more than 80 percent) used in  children were used off-label, without data for their safety and  efficacy. Today, that number has been reduced to 50 percent because of  my legislation. Both programs were permanently reauthorized in 2012,  and while this agreement includes important changes to BPCA and PREA,  there remains a need for more meaningful improvements. This legislation  lays important groundwork and provides the foundation for future  progress.   Finally, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up this  legislation swiftly. It's imperative that both houses of Congress pass  this legislation and send it to the President in a timely manner for  him to sign into law in order to provide essential resources to the FDA  so they can continue to do their critical work.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 23 because  it upends decades of State and federal water law and needlessly pits  water users against one another. On the heels of the worst drought in  California's history, this bill mandates that certain interests come  out ahead of others.   California has just recently emerged from six years of a punishing  drought that forced every resident to conserve water, caused millions  of acres of agricultural land to be fallowed, and dramatically  increased our State's risk of major wildfires. The drought was a  massive disaster and Congress should respond by investing in long-term  resilience against future droughts such as water conservation,  recycling, groundwater recharge, and desalination. What Congress should  not be doing is using the drought as an excuse to permanently upend a  century of water law and countless protections for threatened and  endangered wildlife.   H.R. 23 weakens or overrides decades of State and federal law,  including the State and federal Endangered Species Acts; the National  Environmental Policy Act; the Central Valley Project Improvement Act;  and the San Joaquin River Settlement Act. This list should set off  alarm bells for any proponent of States' rights or cooperative  federalism. For over a century, the Federal Government has deferred to  State water law whenever possible. The GROW Act unwinds that history  entirely.   By discarding a century of water law and species protections, this  bill will decimate the San Francisco Bay-Delta ecosystem, drive the  Delta smelt to extinction, and accelerate the decline of the wild  salmon and steelhead runs which have been an important part of the  Northern California economy since the mid-19th century.   This irresponsible bill also overrides science-based management of  the delicate Delta infrastructure and would gut several of our most  bedrock environmental laws. For these reasons I strongly oppose this  legislation and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Hill). All time for general debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule.   It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose  of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a  substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-24. That  amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read.   The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as  follows:                                  H.R. 23         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(a) Purpose and Findings.--        (1) Purpose and findings.--Section 10002 of the San Joaquin       River Restoration Settlement Act (Public Law 111-11) is       amended to read as follows:       ``SEC. 10002. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.         ``(a) Purpose.--The purpose of this part is to authorize       implementation of the Settlement.        ``(b) Findings.--Congress finds that since the date of the       enactment of this Act, the following conditions now persist       with regard to implementation of the Settlement:        ``(1) Millions of dollars of economic damages have occurred       due to seepage from rivers flows and other impacts to third       parties affected by the Settlement and San Joaquin River       Restoration Program and such impacts will continue for the       duration of the Settlement and Restoration Program       implementation.        ``(2) Estimated costs of implementing the Settlement have       more than doubled from the initial estimates for implementing       the Settlement, from a high-end estimate of $800,000,000 to       more than $1,700,000,000, due to unrealistic initial cost       estimates, additional, unanticipated cost increases related       to damages to land from seepage and to infrastructure from       subsidence, and from increased construction costs to complete       channel improvements, and other improvements not originally       identified, but anticipated in the Settlement as necessary to       implement the Restoration Goal.        ``(3) Achievement of the Settlement's Water Management       Goal, to reduce or avoid water supply impacts to Friant       Division long-term contractors, including the Friant-Kern       Canal and Madera Canal capacity restoration projects have not       progressed and are likely impossible given available and       likely future funding and regulatory constraints.        ``(4) Implementation of the Settlement's Restoration Goal       has already fallen short of the schedule agreed to by the       Settling Parties and Congress, which required the       reintroduction of Spring-run and Fall-run Chinook salmon in       the river by December 31, 2012, and the majority of Paragraph       11 improvements construction to be complete by December 31,       2013, with the remainder of the paragraph (11) improvements       to be completed by December 31, 2016, neither of which       deadlines have been met and the Secretary has now made       findings that such improvements will not be completed until       2030 at the earliest and likely beyond that timeframe, which       schedule assumes full funding of the Restoration Program,       which has not occurred.        ``(5) Catastrophic species declines in the Sacramento-San       Joaquin Delta and other changed conditions have affected the       Friant Division's water supply in ways unimagined during the       time of the Settlement's signing, resulting in additional       reductions in water supply for the Friant Division beyond       what was agreed to in the Settlement.        ``(6) Recent scientific assessments of likely future       climate change suggest that no amount of additional flow in       the San Joaquin River will sustain Spring-run Chinook salmon,       one of the target species for maintaining a self-sustaining       population below Friant Dam.        ``(7) In consideration of existing conditions, it is not       reasonable, prudent and feasible to implement the Settlement       as originally authorized.''.        (2) Definitions.--Section 10003 of the San Joaquin River       Restoration Settlement Act (Public Law 111-11) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(4) The term `Exchange Contractors' means San Joaquin       River Exchange Contractors Water Authority, whose members are       the Central California Irrigation District, Columbia Canal       Company, the Firebaugh Canal Water District, and the San Luis       Canal Company.        ``(5) The term `Governor' means the Governor of the State       of California.        ``(6) The term `Gravelly Ford' means the Gravelly Ford       gaging station in the San Joaquin River located at       approximately River Mile 230.        ``(7) The term `Restoration Area' means the San Joaquin       River between Friant Dam and the Merced River confluence, and       generally within 1,500 feet of the centerline of the river.        ``(8) The term `Restoration Flow' means the hydrograph       flows (as provided in paragraph 18 and exhibit B of the       Settlement), buffer flows of up to 10 percent of the       applicable hydrograph flows, and any additional water       acquired by the Secretary of the Interior from willing       sellers to meet the Restoration Goal of the Settlement.        ``(9) The term `Restoration Fund' means that fund       established by this part.        ``(10) The term `Sack Dam' means a low-head earth and       concrete structure with wooden flap gates that diverts San       Joaquin River flows into the Arroyo Canal at approximately       River Mile 182.1.        ``(11) The term `Warm Water Fishery' means a water system       that has an environment suitable for species of fish other       than salmon (including any subspecies) and trout (including       all subspecies).        ``(12) The term `third party' means the Exchange       Contractors or any member thereof, current or former members       of the San Joaquin Tributaries Authority, and current or       former members of the San Luis and Delta Mendota Water       Authority.''; and        (3) Implementation of settlement.--Section 10004 of the San       Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act (Public Law 111-11)       is amended--        (A) in subsection (f), by striking ``pursuant to the       Settlement and section 10011'' and inserting ``or other       species for any reason'';        (B) in subsection (g), by inserting ``or the implementation       of the Settlement and the reintroduction of California       Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon or any other       species,'' after ``nothing in this part'';        (C) in subsection (h)--        (i) in the header by striking ``Interim'';        (ii) in paragraph (1)--         (I) by striking ``Interim Flows'' and inserting ``Flows''       each place it appears;        (II) in subparagraph (C)(ii), by inserting ``which shall be       implemented'' after ``significant''; and        (III) in subparagraph (E), by striking ``as a result of the       Interim Flows'' and inserting ``or State laws as a result of       Flows.''; and         (iii) by striking paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) and       inserting the following:  [[Page H5515]]         ``(2) Conditions for release.--The Secretary is authorized       to release Flows--        ``(A) if all improvements and mitigation measures are       completed or implemented, including all actions necessary to       mitigate impacts on landowners, water agencies, and water       users; and        ``(B) if such Flows will not exceed existing downstream       channel capacities.        ``(3) Seepage impacts.--(A) The Secretary, in implementing       this Act, shall not cause material adverse impacts to third       parties. The Secretary shall reduce Flows to the extent       necessary to address any material adverse impacts to third       parties from groundwater seepage or levee instability caused       by such flows identified based on the monitoring program of       the Secretary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary       shall not directly or indirectly cause groundwater to rise       above 10 feet below ground surface and shall provide at least       10 feet below ground surface as a minimum threshold elevation       for groundwater beneath any fields where permanent or other       deep rooted crops are grown, and at least 6 feet below ground       surface as a minimum threshold elevation for groundwater       beneath any fields where annual or shallow rooted crops are       grown. These minimum thresholds shall be adjusted yearly       based upon information provided by individual landowners       regarding the minimum threshold that they will need in order       to grow their crop(s) that year. If during the course of the       year the landowner informs the Secretary that detrimental       seepage is being experienced or is reasonably likely to occur       despite the adherence to the minimum threshold, the Secretary       shall reduce Restoration Flows to a volume sufficient to       reduce seepage impacts by reducing the occurrence of       groundwater to a non-damaging level below ground surface.        ``(B) If Flow reduction alone is not sufficient to mitigate       for seepage impacts the Secretary shall mitigate by real       estate transaction or installation of physical measures,       whichever option is requested by the landowner.        ``(C) Any water that seeps onto private property shall       thereupon become the property of that landowner if the       landowner takes control of the water including by re-      diverting it to the San Joaquin River.

The Secretary is       further authorized to work with the California Department of       Fish and Wildlife for the improvement or replacement of the       Hills Ferry Barrier in order to prevent the upstream       migration of any protected species. If third parties south of       the confluence with the Merced River are required to install       their screens or fish bypass facilities in order to comply       with the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Secretary shall       bear the costs of such screens or facilities, except to the       extent that such costs are already or are further willingly       borne by the State of California or by the third parties.

The enactment       of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act, together       with findings in this legislation including the Settling       Parties and agencies of the State of California tried to       implement the Restoration Program for ten years and the       Bureau of Reclamation has stated it will take at least       another 15 years to implement assuming full funding is       provided, even though that full funding has never been       provided since the Settlement was executed or the Restoration       Act enacted, and that absent implementation of that funding,       there is no possibility of establishing a viable self-      sustaining salmonid population and the restoration of the       upper San Joaquin River has proven infeasible on terms       originally conceived by the parties to the Settlement and       Congress in the Restoration Act. Therefore, notwithstanding       that the United States and water users and agencies within       the Friant Division are released of any existing or future       obligations with regard to the Restoration Program, or any       similar program, no responsibility for achieving the goals of       the Restoration Program, including the provision of flows and       the re-introduction of salmon, or other fish species to the       San Joaquin River, shall be imposed on the United States,       upon the Exchange Contractors or any of its members nor shall       the rights to delivery of water reserved to the Exchange       Contractors by any agency of the  [[Page H5516]]       United States or the State of California be abridged or       impaired.        ``(i) Absence of Agreement.--In the absence of an agreement       with Friant Division long-term contractors, in the event the       State of California, acting through the State Water Resources       Control Board or otherwise, or any other party requires the       flow of the San Joaquin River below Friant Dam to exceed the       amounts stated in Exhibit B of the Settlement, then the       authorization to implement the Settlement as provided in this       Act shall terminate and the Secretary of the Interior shall       cease any action to implement this part and the Stipulation       of Settlement (Natural Resources Defense Council, et al. v.       Kirk Rodgers, et al., Eastern District of California, No.       Civ-S-88-1658 LLK/GGH); provided, further, the Secretary       shall also cease to collect or expend any funds from the San       Joaquin River Restoration Fund.''.        (b) Review and Determination.--San Joaquin River       Restoration Settlement Act (Public Law 111-11 et seq.) is       amended by adding at the end the following:       ``SEC. 10012. REVIEW AND DETERMINATION.         ``(a) Determination Required.--The Governor and the       Secretary, shall determine, in consideration of the overall       public interest of both the State of California and the       Nation, if it is reasonable, prudent, and feasible to       implement the Settlement as provided in section 10014(b) and       shall submit a joint report to Congress not later than 1 year       after the date of the enactment of this Act, stating their       findings and recommended action, including--        ``(1) financial considerations;        ``(2) available scientific evidence;        ``(3) water temperature in the lower reaches of the upper       San Joaquin River; and        ``(4) alternative uses for the funds required to implement       the Settlement.        ``(b) Absence of Timely Determination.--If the Governor and       the Secretary, do not provide a joint recommendation within       the time specified in subsection (a), then it shall be deemed       that implementing the Settlement consistent with section       10014(b) is not reasonable, prudent, and feasible, and the       Secretary shall proceed to implement the Settlement       consistent with section 10014(a).       ``SEC. 10013.

The Secretary's final decision       on any action, including flows, can deviate from the       Restoration Administrator's recommendation provided that the       Secretary's final decision is based upon sound and objective       science, and is otherwise consistent with this title.        ``(6) Restoration flows.--The appropriate level of       Restoration Flows under any circumstance shall be no greater       than that set forth in the hydrographs attached as exhibit B       to the Settlement, and shall be no greater than the real-time       fishery needs required to meet the Restoration Goal. The       Secretary shall make the final decision as to the appropriate       level of Restoration Flows and other actions regarding       implementation of the Restoration Program. The appropriate       level of Restoration Flows shall at a minimum not exceed       channel capacity, cause seepage damage, or be inconsistent       with any other requirements in this section. The Secretary's       decisions and those of the Secretary of Commerce shall be       fully supported by the best commercial and scientific       information available, shall be made in an open and       transparent manner, and shall be based on objective       information capable of replication.        ``(7) Fish reintroduction.--No fishery shall be introduced       or placed for any reason in to the San Joaquin River upstream       of the Merced River, until Reclamation has released       Restoration Flows down the San Joaquin River in each       hydrologic year type: wet, above normal, below normal, dry,       and critically dry and determined that the improvements are       fully functional and that seepage impacts have been fully       mitigated. At least 180 days before the introduction of       spring run Chinook salmon the Bureau of Reclamation shall       submit a report to Congress that provides a critical       examination of the impact of Restoration Flows on seepage and       the improvements, and the likelihood of success in restoring       a salmon fishery that is viable, sustainable and capable of       volitional passage.        ``(8) Protected species.--Any protected species migrating       into the Restoration Area shall be deemed to be a       nonessential experimental population. Congress finds that due       to human-caused physical changes to the pathways of the San       Joaquin River upstream of the confluence of the Merced River       the San Joaquin River is  [[Page H5517]]       deemed a distinct and separate geographic area and no agency       shall take any action pursuant to any authority or       requirement of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C.       1531 et seq.) or any other Federal or State species       protection law that will have an adverse impact on landowners       or water agencies within the Restoration Area unless such       impacts are incurred on a voluntary basis.        ``(9) Subsidence.--Prior to implementing any other actions,       the Secretary shall work with local water districts and       landowners to ensure the actions include appropriate       solutions to past and likely future subsidence.

TITLE III--WATER RIGHTS PROTECTIONS       SEC. 301. OFFSET FOR STATE WATER PROJECT.         (a) Implementation Impacts.--The Secretary of the Interior       shall confer with the California Department of Fish and       Wildlife in connection with the implementation of this title       on potential impacts to any consistency determination for       operations of the State Water Project issued pursuant to       California Fish and Game Code section 2080.1.        (b) Additional Yield.--If, as a result of the application       of this title, the California Department of Fish and       Wildlife--        (1) revokes the consistency determinations pursuant to       California Fish and Game Code section 2080.1 that are       applicable to the State Water Project;        (2) amends or issues one or more new consistency       determinations pursuant to California Fish and Game Code       section 2080.1 in a manner that directly or indirectly       results in reduced water supply to the State Water Project as       compared with the water supply available under the smelt       biological opinion and the salmonid biological opinion; or        (3) requires take authorization under California Fish and       Game Code section 2081 for operation of the State Water       Project in a manner that directly or indirectly results in       reduced water supply to the State Water Project as compared       with the water supply available under the smelt biological       opinion and the salmonid biological opinion, and as a       consequence of the Department's action, Central Valley       Project yield is greater than it would have been absent the       Department's actions, then that additional yield shall be       made available to the State Water Project for delivery to       State Water Project contractors to offset losses resulting       from the Department's action.        (c) Notification Related to Environmental Protections.--The       Secretary of the Interior shall immediately notify the       Director of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife in       writing if the Secretary of the Interior determines that       implementation of the smelt biological opinion and the       salmonid biological opinion consistent with this title       reduces environmental protections for any species covered by       the opinions.       SEC. 302. AREA OF ORIGIN PROTECTIONS.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior is directed,       in the operation of the Central Valley Project, to adhere to       California's water rights laws governing water rights       priorities and to honor water rights senior to those held by       the United States for operation of the Central Valley       Project, regardless of the source of priority, including any       appropriative water rights initiated prior to December 19,       1914, as well as water rights and other priorities perfected       or to be perfected pursuant to California Water Code Part 2       of Division 2.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1  printed in part C of House Report 115-212.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment made in order under the  rule.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 63, strike line 19 through page 64, line 2 and insert       the following:        (d) Program for Water Rescheduling.--The Secretary of the       Interior shall develop and implement a program, not later       than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, to       provide the opportunity for individuals or districts that       receive Central Valley Project Water under water service or       repayment contracts or water rights settlement contracts       within the American River, Sacramento River, Shasta and       Trinity River Divisions to reschedule water, provided for       under their Central Valley Project water service, repayment       or settlement contracts, within the same year or from one       year to the next.        Page 64, strike lines 3 through 12, and insert the       following:        (e) Definition.--In this section, the year type terms used       in subsection (a)    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 431, the gentleman  from California (Mr. LaMalfa) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. McClintock for managing this bill  and for his help on this.   I am pleased to support the bill, the GROW Act, which, contrary to  some claims, protects northern California water rights and keeps more  water in the north than the status quo. I should know because I  represent the source of the overwhelming majority of California's  usable water.   The underlying bill improves water efficiency by allowing junior  water contractors in the Sacramento Valley to carry over water supplies  from one year to the next in Lake Shasta, retaining access to those  supplies the following year, which promotes efficiency when you are  banking that additional water for future use.   This amendment improves the bill by ensuring that all Federal water  contractors in the Sacramento Valley have the same ability to  reschedule their water supplies.   Mr. Chair, under the current system, water contractors are forced to  use it or lose it. If water allocations are not fully used each year,  the ability to access that water is lost.   Now, around Washington, D.C., that use-it-or-lose-it attitude usually  means a lot of money that sits in certain agencies' bank accounts or in  their pots, it is just used up. Why would we want to do that kind of  thing with water? We need to be banking it and saving it, where  practical, to be usable in the next year or to pass to others who could  use it as well.   During wet years, farms and ranches may choose to reschedule a  portion of their water for the following year. This bill and this  amendment will significantly improve planning and delivery of water  supplies by ensuring maximum flexibility, flexibility which we need,  and allowing water to be accessed when it is needed most.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
