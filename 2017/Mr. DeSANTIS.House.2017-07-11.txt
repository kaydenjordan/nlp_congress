Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.  [[Page H5400]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 702, the Federal  Employee Antidiscrimination Act of 2017, introduced by my colleague on  the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the ranking member,  Elijah Cummings.   I should note that Mr. Cummings is unable to be with us here today  for this important bill. He is recuperating from surgery, and we wish  him a speedy recovery.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 702 amends the Notification and Federal Employee  Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002, or the NO FEAR Act, to  better identify and correct issues of discrimination throughout the  Federal Government. Ranking Member Cummings introduced H.R. 702 in  response to problems identified in the Baltimore office of the Social  Security Administration.   The bill requires Federal agencies to establish a system to track  Equal Employment Opportunity complaints from beginning to end. This  system must also track any disciplinary action that resulted from a  finding of a discriminatory act.                                time  1615    The bill also requires both the disciplinary action and the reason  for the action to be included in the employee's personnel record.   Mr. Speaker, this bill implements notification and reporting  requirements for instances of discrimination within Federal agencies.  Agencies must provide a notice on an internal website if the agency or  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission finds that a discriminatory or  retaliatory act has occurred.   The bill requires agencies to submit a report to the EEOC if such an  act has occurred. The report must include any disciplinary action  initiated against an employee for discrimination or retaliation against  another employee.   Lastly, the bill bars agencies from using nondisclosure agreements to  restrict Federal employees from reporting waste, fraud, and abuse to  Congress, the Office of Special Counsel, and Inspector General.   I thank Mr. Cummings for his work on this piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I wish  Mr. Cummings a speedy recovery.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5401]]         Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1988) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 1730 18th Street in Bakersfield, California, as the  ``Merle Haggard Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1988         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. MERLE HAGGARD POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 1730 18th Street in Bakersfield,       California, shall be known and designated as the ``Merle       Haggard Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Merle Haggard Post Office Building''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1988, which designates a  post office in Bakersfield, California, as the Merle Haggard Post  Office Building.   Merle Haggard once sang about being a ``branded man out in the cold''  because, having served time in prison, ``no matter where I travel, the  black mark follows me, I'm branded with a number on my name.'' He  lamented that: ``If I live to be a hundred, guess I'll never clear my  name.''   Well, Merle didn't quite make it to 100, but it is safe to say that  the people of Bakersfield will appreciate seeing the post office bear  the name of Merle Haggard. Merle can hold his head up and be proud of  who he was.   Now this will be a time for celebration, but remember: ``We don't  smoke marijuana in Muskogee; we don't take no trips on LSD.'' So in  honor of the Okie from Muskogee, illicit substances will be prohibited  at the Haggard Post Office. It will be okay to just stay there and  drink, but keep in mind that tonight could be the night the bottle  let's you down.   We would also appreciate if people refrain from burning draft cards  on Main Street, and please don't let your ``hair grow long and shaggy''  at the Merle Haggard Post Office. Waving Old Glory down at the  courthouse will, of course, be encouraged.   Now, Merle didn't always make it easy for people, particularly his  mother. His mother did everything she could to raise him right, but  Merle didn't listen. So, like others, he turned 21 in prison, doing  life without parole, and that left only Merle to blame because ``Mama  tried, Mama tried.''   Merle appreciated all our fighting men and women who fought and died  to keep America free. Merle was right to ask if we can really count on  being free if we have to depend on ``some squirrely guy who claims he  just'' doesn't believe in fighting.   Merle was a patriot who loved this country. If you don't love it,  then just leave it. But be warned: ``When you are running down my  country hoss, you are walking on the fighting side of  me. . . . ''   May God bless Merle Haggard.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished majority  leader.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
