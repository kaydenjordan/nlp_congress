 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to  Thomas L. Bowlin, Colonel, USAF, Ret., who in addition to a  distinguished career in the U.S. Air Force, has served as the first  Director of Government Affairs for the North Carolina National Guard. I  thank him for his many years of service to the great State of North  Carolina and our great Nation.   Colonel Bowlin began his military career with the U.S. Air Force in  1975. He has served across the United States, as well as in Germany,  Hawaii, Pakistan, and Alaska. He was the first USAF officer to attend  Pakistan's War College and served in a number of key assignments with  increasing levels of responsibility.   Following his retirement from the U.S. Air Force in 2001, Colonel  Bowlin continued his dedication to service by beginning a second career  and becoming the first Director of Government Affairs for the North  Carolina National Guard. He served as an essential component of North  Carolina National Guard leadership for nearly two decades where he has  advised the adjutant general directly and interfaced with local, State,  and Federal officials.   Colonel Bowlin has served roughly 11,500 citizen soldiers and airmen  in the North Carolina Army and Air National Guard through many  deployments overseas and harrowing natural disasters at home. Tom's  contribution to advancing the overall readiness and operational  capabilities of the North Carolina National Guard has been vital in  maintaining an effective and resilient reserve force. Through  operations including Inherent Resolve, Enduring Freedom, and Freedom's  Sentinel, as well as during Hurricanes Irene, Matthew, Florence, and  Dorian, Colonel Bowlin has ensured that the men and women of the Guard  had the utmost preparation of every mission that they embarked upon.   Colonel Bowlin has worked tirelessly on a number of both Federal,  State, and local priorities and policy reforms for the North Carolina  National Guard. Just to name a few, these range from appropriations for  facilities, programs, and assets, family readiness, GI Bill  transferability, TRICARE expansion, tuition assistance, occupational  licensing, rental agreement protections, and many more, which will  continue to benefit National Guard servicemembers and their families  for years to come.   As a U.S. Senator, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,  and a North Carolinian, I am pleased to congratulate Colonel Bowlin on  his retirement from the North Carolina National Guard and for his  impressive career of military service and steadfast commitment to our  country.                            ____________________
