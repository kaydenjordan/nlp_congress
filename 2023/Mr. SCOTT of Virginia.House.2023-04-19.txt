 Mr. Chair, this bill is a mean-spirited attack  on transgender women's and girls' participation in sports.   It essentially requires women and girls to prove their gender. In  Kansas, where a similar bill was passed, students could be forced to  have invasive inspections of their body parts.   The bottom line is, we should let parents, doctors, and sports  organizations do their jobs to protect student athletes. For example,  the NCAA supports a sport-by-sport approach to  [[Page H1870]]  transgender student participation, and high school leagues are also  dealing with the issue.   We should focus our time on ensuring that children in America reach  their full potential through high-quality public education.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 734.
