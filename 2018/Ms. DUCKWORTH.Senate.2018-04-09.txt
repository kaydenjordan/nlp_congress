 Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the  ``Strength and Honor'' event being hosted by Naperville Responds to Our  Veterans on April 11, 2018. This event aims to honor and give thanks to  veterans around the community. This year's feature speaker, Mike  Barbour, is a well-known Army veteran who has devoted his life to  advocating for those who have so bravely fought for our country. I  encourage veterans around the community to attend this event, enjoy a  free lunch, and be paid the respect they so well deserve.   I applaud the commendable work being done by Naperville Responds to  [[Page S2011]]  Our Veterans and hope they have a successful event.                            ____________________
