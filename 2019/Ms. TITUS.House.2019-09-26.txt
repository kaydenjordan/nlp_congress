 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I  thank the Member across the aisle for his bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent Las Vegas; it is the  entertainment capital of the world.   Last year, almost 50 million people passed through the gates of  McCarran International Airport in my congressional district. They were  tourists, business travelers, and friends and family of my ethnically  diverse constituents. Many of them were from international airports of  destination. They came from all parts of the world, and they didn't  speak English.   Yet, much of what TSA communicates to travelers and transportation  workers is through signs, announcements, and videos that are all in  English.   Let's be clear. As you have heard the speakers before me say, you  shouldn't have to worry about missing a plane at an airport in the  United States just because you don't speak English.   That is why I am excited that the House is passing the TRANSLATE Act,  which I introduced to make sure that TSA goes the extra mile in Las  Vegas and at airports all across the country to communicate with the  traveling public. It is a basic courtesy.   I know we all appreciate seeing signs in English when we are  traveling abroad, so there is no reason we shouldn't make U.S. airports  as welcoming as possible to those who don't speak English or who may be  visually impaired.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for supporting this bill.
