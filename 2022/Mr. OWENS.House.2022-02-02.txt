 Madam Speaker, the so-called America COMPETES Act is not a  genuine attempt to hold Communist China accountable for its aggressions  toward American security and prosperity.   If you ask the Democrats, they will say this bill takes strong action  to combat the Chinese Government. But in reality, this bill includes  zero measures to hold Communist China accountable for the cover-up of  COVID-19, human trafficking, torture, forced sterilization, or slave  labor. Yes, slavery is alive and well today in Communist China.   This bill provides no resources to enforce our sanction laws or  increase our military strength. It omits provisions on export controls,  security assistance, to our allies, and it fails to curtail Communist  China's military modernization and weapons development.   If there was ever a bipartisan issue, this should be it. This $325  billion, 3,000-page do-nothing bill developed behind closed doors fails  in multiple ways to protect America's interests.   I call upon my colleagues to support meaningful legislation that will  achieve enforceable laws and show real results.   This should be called the America concedes act; no question; another  spend and waste of taxpayer money.
