 Mr. President, I was unable to attend yesterday's vote on  the nomination of Scott Stump, of Colorado, to be Assistant Secretary  for Career, Technical, and Adult Education, Department of Education.  Had I been able to attend, I would have supported the nomination.                            ____________________
