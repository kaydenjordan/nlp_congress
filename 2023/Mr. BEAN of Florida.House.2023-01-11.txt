 Mr. Speaker, I wish a very good morning to you  and to the House of Representatives.   I am Aaron Bean. I am one of the new guys. Aside from a motion to  adjourn earlier this week, this right now is the very first time I am  speaking on this floor, and I want to say what an honor it is to be  with everyone in this body.   To the people of northeast Florida--and specifically the brand new  Fourth District of the free State of Florida--I say that I am humbled  and grateful that you sent me here to be your voice on this floor.   I am keenly aware of the amazing opportunity it is as well as the  responsibilities it comes with.   I am also, Mr. Speaker, keenly aware that our country and Nation have  challenges--lots of them. The border and our growing deficit are just  the tip of the iceberg.   So I say to all the Members here, I look forward to working with you,  tackling these challenges, and making America more secure, safer, and  stronger.   Mr. Speaker, let's go get `em.                            ____________________
