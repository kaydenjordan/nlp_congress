 Madam Speaker, I was 11 years old when the police beat  the crap out of me. Eleven years old, sixth grade; what threat did I  pose, other than that of a child who was horseplaying in the street?   My mother and I did not feel empowered to take any recourse, because  in our community, the police, unfortunately, operate as an occupying  force.   I thank God that I am alive to tell this story. Unfortunately, George  Floyd is not alive. Philando Castile is not alive. Tamir Rice is not  alive. Aiyana Jones slept in her apartment on her couch. She was 7  years old. Police came in with a no-knock warrant and murdered her.   This is about transparency and accountability, and we should pass the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in a bipartisan way.
