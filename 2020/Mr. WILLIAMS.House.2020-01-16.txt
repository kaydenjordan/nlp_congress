 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  the 2019 Westlake High School Chaparrals football team on winning their  second State championship title.   For Texans, high school football isn't just a sport, it is a way of  life. Each week in the fall we gather under Friday night lights and  cheer our team on to victory. The young men, women, and coaches on our  team spend countless hours running drills, watching film, and getting  ready for their moment in history.   During the 2019 season, Westlake's dedication paid off as they posted  a 24-0 shutout over Denton Guyer at AT&T Stadium for their second State  title.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 25th Congressional District in Texas, I  congratulate the Chaps on their victory and wish them the very best in  their bright futures.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
