 Madam President, as you and I both know, we are in the  process of talking about the spending bills, long overdue. We are in  our fiscal year as of October 1. Well, here comes the end of October,  and we are still laboring over how we are going to spend money for the  next fiscal year from October 1 to September 30 of the year 2024.   And there is debate back and forth between the House and Senate,  debate on the Senate floor, and some issues are becoming priorities. I  would like to address one of them that doesn't get a lot of attention,  and it should.   I don't agree with former President George W. Bush on many things,  but I have given him credit repeatedly for making the United States a  leader in stemming the HIV/AIDS epidemic in some of the poorest parts  of the world.   Twenty years ago, the program was called the President's Emergency  Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, what Bono once said was ``the most  eloquent expression of American values anyone can think of in recent  times.''   You see, PEPFAR, and its companion effort, the Global Fund to Fight  AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, dramatically curtailed the AIDS  epidemic that was ravaging the world. It has saved more than 25 million  lives so far.    Both of these programs provided retroviral drugs for those with AIDS,  allowing them to live productive lives and prevent the spread of  disease through childbirth.   They have been so effective that some might have forgotten just how  devastating AIDS was in certain parts of the world. At one point, it  was killing more than 2 million people a year globally and leaving 14  million orphans in sub-Saharan Africa. In some of the most highly  affected countries, life expectancy had dropped 20 years.   PEPFAR and the Global Fund dramatically improved outcomes for  millions of people across the world. These programs are not only the  right thing to do, they are also one of the most effective examples of  America's soft power and the international development effort and a  stark contrast of what China and others are displaying in many parts of  the world.   So imagine my concern and surprise that there is currently an effort  by extreme Republicans in the House of Representatives to block the  reauthorization of this hugely successful, bipartisan George W. Bush  program over a false and manufactured abortion concern. Taking the  extreme position of  [[Page S5222]]  blocking this lifesaving program is as shortsighted and nihilistic as  siding with Vladimir Putin and failing to help Ukraine.   Just last week, the Bush Institute and a group of more than 30  retired Ambassadors and foreign policy leaders urged Congress to  swiftly reauthorize PEPFAR.   They wrote:         Abandoning it abruptly now would send a bleak message,       suggesting we are no longer able to set aside our politics       for the betterment of democracies and the world.    With this, I agree completely. Right now, America's reputation on the  global stage is being threatened by House Republicans' internal  politics, but reauthorizing PEPFAR is common sense to reassure the  world that Americans can push past partisanship and use our influence,  resources, and power to save lives. Some things are simply beyond  politics.   Former President Bush acknowledged this when he wrote in the  Washington Post recently:         We are on the verge of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic. To       abandon our commitment now would forfeit two decades of       unimaginable progress and raise further questions about the       worth of America's word.    I couldn't agree more, and I call on my Republican friends to help  reauthorize this historic, bipartisan, lifesaving effort without  further delay.    I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fetterman) is necessarily absent.
