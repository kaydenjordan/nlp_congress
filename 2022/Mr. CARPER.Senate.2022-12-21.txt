 Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague and       partner on the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Shelley       Moore Capito, to celebrate passage of this year's Water Resources       Development Act, or WRDA, as it is affectionately known. And the       Presiding Officer and I have talked about this legislation many times,       as he has provided input to the bill, along with 97 other U.S.       Senators--all 100. All 100 Senators, all 50 States provided input to       this legislation.        As our colleagues may recall, the Water Resources Development Act--we       call it WRDA. The Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act,       known as NDAA, by a vote of 83 to 11. I will say that again. The Senate       passed the National Defense Authorization Act, known as the NDAA, by a       vote of 83 to 11. It is not often that we pass legislation with that       level of bipartisan support.        Having said that, the committee that Senator Capito and I lead--we do       that kind of thing often--often--and I am pleased that we did       especially because this Defense bill included the Water Resources       Development Act of 2022, also known as WRDA. In fact, our WRDA bill       became the vehicle through which we advanced the Defense bill. That       doesn't happen every day, but we            [[Page S9741]]            are proud of that and delighted that it has worked out this way.        The water resources bills authorize--people say: What do they do?       What does the water bill do? Well, it authorizes the activities of the       U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.        I am a Navy guy, but I have huge respect for the Army--different       uniform, same team--but especially for the folks at the Army Corps of       Engineers.        WRDA 2022 continues the 2-year cycle for the Water Resources       Development Act, and our committee has had a decade--five WRDA bills in       a row in the last 10 years--of completing these reauthorizations on       time--on time.        This year's WRDA is historic. Not only is WRDA 2022 an ambitious       water resource bill, but it is also the product of a steadfast       commitment to bipartisanship, and Senator Capito and I have sought       input to get every Senator involved--100 Senators--when we started       working on WRDA last year. The final legislation represents an       agreement between the two Chambers of Congress on our respective Army       Corps reauthorization legislation.        Before delving into what we accomplished in WRDA 2022, let me just       say how proud I am to have coauthored this legislation with Senator       Capito, along with Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves on the       House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.        I also want to recognize Senators Cardin and Cramer, as well as       Representatives Napolitano and Rouzer, and the subcommittee chairs and       ranking members on the Senate EPW and House Transportation and       Infrastructure Committees, respectively. Their leadership was       instrumental in helping us develop this legislation.        I cannot overstate just how important the Corps' work is to our       Nation's economic growth. The Corps is the principal steward of our       country's water infrastructure. The Corps' responsibilities include       improving our ports and waterways to enable trade with other nations,       restoring our ecosystems to support fisheries, to support tourism,       support recreation, and advancing flood management solutions to make       communities more resilient to climate change and to extreme weather.        Without these WRDA bills, our Nation's economy would suffer, and our       future would be diminished.        WRDA 2022 enables the Corps to continue to operate and maintain       America's water highway--a 12,000-mile-long system of inland waterways,       with 209 locks that are vital to the domestic and international       commerce of our Nation.        Each year, more than 500 million tons of commodities move through       this system. Think about that. Over 500 million tons of commodities       move through this system, including 60 percent of our Nation's       agricultural exports. Operating and maintaining this system results in       economic benefit to our country of nearly $14 billion dollars each       year.        WRDA 2022 also supports safe and reliable and efficient navigation at       our coastal ports. And as we have seen over the past 2 years, navigable       shipping channels are essential to keeping global supply chains moving.        More than 99 percent of U.S. overseas trade volume moves through the       13,000--13,000--miles of coastal channels maintained by the Corps,       which, together, support over 30 million jobs across our country. WRDA       2022 recognizes the economic importance of our Nation's commercial       ports and shipping channels.        As a recovering Governor, I often say that it is our responsibility       as elected officials to help create a nurturing environment for job       creation and job preservation. We don't create the jobs. What we do is       help create the nurturing environment that leads to job creation. But       maintaining our ports and waterways is a cornerstone of that nurturing       environment.        Addressing the impacts of climate change is also essential to the       task of building our Nation's prosperity--economic prosperity--for all       of us. Climate change is fueling extreme weather, which threatens our       coastal and inland communities alike. WRDA 2022 makes the most       significant boost ever made to the Army Corps' authority to conduct       climate resilience work.        Climate resilience work is urgently needed. It is not a matter of if       the next storm is coming, but it is a matter of when. And with this in       mind, the Water Resources Development Act of 2022 recognizes the       critical role that the Corps plays in helping communities adapt to       climate change.        This bill allows the Army Corps to better design and implement       projects by accounting for the direct impacts of climate change. It       will make a big difference in States like Delaware, like Florida, like       Texas--just to name a few--where we continue to see extreme weather       like hurricanes and other storms batter our beaches and coastal       communities.        In addition to overhauling the Corps' project design authorities,       WRDA 2022 improves the Corps' abilities to make our shorelines, our       riverbanks, and our streambanks more resilient to extreme weather.        In addition to better positioning the Corps to address threats like       climate change in WRDA 2022, we also work to rectify historical       inequities for Tribal and disadvantaged communities. The legislation       establishes a new advisory committee to help the Corps more effectively       deliver projects, programs, and other assistance to historically       underserved communities.        This bill also reauthorizes the Corps' Tribal Partnership Program and       makes a series of targeted improvements to increase opportunities for       Tribal communities to partner with the Corps on essential projects in a       more cost-effective way for the Tribe. And, finally, WRDA 2022       establishes a new workforce development and STEM outreach program at       the Corps with a priority to recruit new engineers from underserved and       disadvantaged communities.        Before I yield the floor to Senator Capito, I just want to take a       moment to thank some of the staff members on both sides of the aisle       for their hard work and determination in drafting this legislation.        Senator Capito and I, along with some of our other colleagues, have       the privilege of having the legislation bear our names, but she knows       and I know, that we are only as good as the people we have around us.       She has just a terrific group of men and women on her staff and in our       committee, and we believe--I believe--we have the same on our side.        But on Senator Capito's staff I would especially like to recognize       Adam Tomlinson, a fellow West Virginian, as am I, along with Max Hyman,       Haden Miller--in fact, I think all three of these people are native       West Virginians, if I am not mistaken--and Kim Townsend, Libby       Callaway, Katherine Scarlett, and Murphie Barrett for their steadfast       dedication and partnerships.        On my staff, I would especially like to recognize Mary Frances Repko,       staff director, Tyler Hofmann-Reardon, Mayely Boyce, Jordan Baugh,       Janine Barr, and especially John Kane, who works like a demon, like a       tiger, in leading our water team on our committee.        I also want to recognize Mark Mazone and Deanna Edwards of the Senate       Legislative Counsel, and David Wethington, Amy Klein, and Nicole       Comisky of the Army Corps of Engineers Congressional Affairs staff.       Folks at the Legislative Counsel do a lot of the writing--the       legislative writing--and they are invaluable.        The Corps and the Senate Legislative Counsel are the unsung heroes of       making this legislation happen, though, from filling in the need for       numerous project updates and helping draft the legislation to providing       technical assistance, and we are grateful. We are grateful. Both of us       are extremely grateful for the efforts of all of you.              Sometimes, I know people watch television or watch the news and they       say: Why don't they ever find--why don't they ever work together in       Washington and in the Congress? And this legislation is just about as       clear evidence as you will ever find that we do work together. We do       work together. We put this bill together in a bipartisan way. We       debated it in a bipartisan way. We reported it out in a bipartisan way.       We debated on the floor, worked with the House and with the       administration--with the administration--in a way that I think most any       American could be proud of the way the democratic--this is the way the       democratic process is supposed to work, and right here, especially with       our committee. And with this legislation, we have done that.            [[Page S9742]]              But in this holiday season and this season of giving, the Water       Resources Development Act of 2022 reminds me of a saying by Winston       Churchill. Churchill used to say, ``Never give in except to convictions       of honor and good sense,'' and on this bill, I can proudly say that we       have acted on both convictions. We have delivered for our colleagues,       we have delivered for our country, and we have done so by enacting       important, commonsense policies.        With that, I am delighted to yield the floor to the Senator Capito.         Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?         That's good. I ask unanimous consent for another 30       seconds.         I am reminded, Senator Capito, that we are both West       Virginia kids. But I am reminded of something that comes out of another       continent, Africa. And one of the African proverbs over there is:                   If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go            together.              And we have gone together. We have gone together, not just the two of       us and not just our committee, but the entire United States Senate has       had the opportunity to work together. And we came up with a great       product and are grateful to everyone who has been a part of it. I am       looking forward to the President signing this and doing good things for       all of our States.        I yield the floor.         Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for       the quorum call be rescinded.         Mr. President, during this break in the action this       evening, I rise today to recognize not one but two members of my staff       who are going to be leaving us this month.        Larry Windley is retiring from my staff as a true public servant for       the people of my home State of Delaware and the people of our country.        Larry was born and raised in a place called Seaford, DE. Seaford, DE,       was the home of the first nylon plant in the world, built by DuPont;       4,000 employees. It is a great town, a town that is actually going       through a rebirth these days, and we are very proud of that.        Larry Windley was one of three sons. His father Bill Windley worked       for DuPont and earned something like 25 patents during his tenure there       for that            [[Page S9757]]            company. One of those three sons is Larry, who was raised to work hard,       spending summers working on poultry farms that are common in that part       of our State. That hard work would later drive him in his 41-year       career in public service.        Larry's career started when he was a young man in college at the       University of Delaware. He and I were introduced in 1982 by Jim Soles,       a legendary political science professor whom we both greatly admired       who would later run for the U.S. House of Representatives for our at-      large seat.        I had been Delaware State treasurer, came out of the Navy and moved       from California to Delaware at the end of the Vietnam war. I got an MBA       and went to work in economic development and got elected to State       treasurer at 29.        Six years later, I was running for Congress. We have one seat in the       House of Representatives, and I was running for that seat. I needed a       right-hand man who could not just keep up the pace of a campaign but       could actually get behind my Plymouth Horizon and drive it all over the       State, to be my driver and my body man in my campaign for the U.S.       House of Representatives.        A story about Jim. When Jim Soles, the professor of political science       who had run unsuccessfully for Congress in 1972, I think, he asked--      when I was State treasurer and running for Congress, Professor Soles       said to one of his students, Larry Windley: Larry, how would you like       to be Tom Carper's driver?        Larry was pretty excited about that. Finally, Larry said: To be       honest, I don't know who Tom Carper is.        Jim explained that I was the State treasurer and running for       Delaware's at-large seat. Lo and behold, Larry said yes. He dropped out       of school at least for a while--he was at university as a junior--and       he helped me get my campaign into high gear, and we were fortunate to       win.        Larry went from driving with me around the State to traveling all       over the world, representing the First State as he worked to attract       trade and business opportunities for Delaware.        Larry had a few different roles over the course of his career. One of       his most impactful has to be his work on economic development. Early in       his career, Larry worked for the State of Delaware's Economic       Development Office, where he helped create the Delaware Strategic Fund       and the Community Redevelopment Fund, providing millions for nonprofit       public service organizations and economic revitalization.        He also helped create something called the Brownfield Initiative to       redevelop contaminated sites and established the Green Industries       Initiative to help businesses reduce, recycle, or reuse waste.        After serving 10 years in the House of Representatives, I ran for       Governor of Delaware, and Larry rejoined my team to help me craft my       economic development platform, the Carper Growth Agenda. We focused on       attracting smaller companies and helping existing companies to grow.       That was in the 1990s, so we had a strong focus on attracting       technology companies.        Once I was elected, Larry helped lead the Delaware Economic       Development Office as its policy director and director of planning.       Then, in 1996--this was the beginning of my second term as Governor--he       was appointed assistant secretary of state and director of the Division       of Corporations for Delaware. It turns out that is a very big job. Half       of the Fortune 500 are incorporated in Delaware. Half of the Fortune       500, half of the New York Stock Exchange are incorporated in the State       of Delaware, and the Division of Corporations helps to service all of       those corporations from around the world.        The person who ran that office was Larry Windley, and that office       provides about a third of the State's revenues. The reason why Delaware       doesn't have a sales tax is because of all the revenues that come       through the Delaware State Department that Larry ran for a number of       years. His jobs included running a division that raised something like       half a billion dollars a year for our State and today raises a whole       lot more.        In 2004, he left State government to become Delaware State director       for Senator Joe Lieberman during Joe's Presidential campaign. Then, in       2006, I was lucky enough that he rejoined my team to work on special       projects. At this time, I had been elected to the U.S. Senate and       served here, as I do today.        Over the last 17 years, Larry has been a vital part of my senior       leadership team. He has not only helped to be my eyes and ears in       Delaware, but he has also mentored the next generation of men and women       who want to follow in his footsteps and to work to move Delaware in the       right direction.        He is going to be leaving soon. We have something called Carpertown.       I don't know who came up with the word ``Carpertown,'' but it is the       people who have worked with me in the Navy and when I was State       treasurer and when I was a Congressman, Governor, and now in the U.S.       Senate. There are actually, I think, thousands of folks who fall in       that category, but Larry is one and may be the charter member of       Carpertown.        There is a great song by the Eagles called ``Hotel California,'' and       it has lyrics that say, ``You can check out . . . but you can never       leave.'' That is pretty much how Carpertown works. Larry is going to be       checking out, but he will never really leave. He is going to be joining       the University of Delaware and doing much needed work there. We look       forward to being able to continue to work with him.        Thanks to him, Delaware is a better place to live, and it is a better       place to work and to do business.        I just want to convey, his parents are deceased, but I knew them well       and have thanked them many times--especially his mom--for bringing him       into the world and his mom and dad for raising him and sharing him with       the people of our State.        He now has a son of his own, Michael, and Michael's wife Lindsay,       along with his daughter Tara and her husband Glen and a brandnew       grandson, whose name is Cayden.        I am reminded of a great line from a Detroit Tigers baseball player,       the outfielder Kirk Gibson. When he was ready to retire from the       Tigers, he called a press conference. Sometimes people are ready to       retire and retire at the beginning of the season. Sometimes they retire       at the end of the season. They just don't want to do it anymore. Kirk       Gibson retired in the middle of the season, and he held a press       conference in the dugout at Tiger Stadium. The reporters all gathered       around him, and he told the press--he said that he had been traded back       to his family--traded back to his family. In a sense, Larry is being       traded back to his family, but we know that he is going to still       continue to do a lot of good work for the people--not just for the       University of Delaware but for the people of our State. We are grateful       for that.                                        Tribute to Christophe Tulou              Mr. President, I know I don't have much time remaining, but I just       want to also recognize the service of Christophe Tulou, who serves as       our senior counsel on the Environment and Public Works Committee.        Christophe is retiring at the end of the year as well to become the       executive director of the Center for the Inland Bays in Delaware, a       wonderful nonprofit organization that is committed to preserving our       natural beauty and natural resources, including our inland bays and the       southern part of our State.        I call him Tophe, T-O-P-H-E, and I have known him ever since we hired       him. He was the second person I hired to work for me in the U.S. House       of Representatives.        I had gotten on the Banking Committee. As a freshman, I had gotten on       a committee called Merchant Marine and Fisheries, which included       oceanography and a bunch of issues that are of great interest to an       ocean State like Delaware. We needed somebody to handle that portfolio,       and we found a fellow who was a Sea Grant fellow and who was interested       in serving in Congress, and his name was Christophe Tulou. He came on       board.        He was the second person I hired to help me in the U.S. House of       Representatives. I ended up serving there for 10 years. Christophe       would become not just my legislative adviser for a portfolio of       issues--environmental issues and others--but he also ended up for a       short while as my legislative director within the office. Later on,       when I was the subcommittee chair of the Economic Stabilization       Subcommittee,            [[Page S9758]]            he was the director of that subcommittee for me in the House of       Representatives and did a great job in each one of those categories.        I don't have time tonight to go through some of the things we are       especially proud of that we worked on together, but there are a lot of       them, and I will provide those for the record. All in all, he served in       my House of Representatives office for a decade, and I, frankly, don't       know what I would have done without him.        After serving in the House for 10 years, I had a chance to run for       Governor. I did and was lucky to win and became Governor of Delaware to       serve not one 4-year term but two 4-year terms.        We were looking around for someone to serve on my cabinet as       Governor. We needed somebody to be our cabinet secretary for the       Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. I asked       Christophe Tulou if he would do the job, and he agreed to do so.        We had a complicating factor, and that is, he and his wife lived in       DC. She had a good job and was not anxious to give that up. For the       next 4 years, Christophe Tulou--his wife continued to live in       Washington, and he would come home on weekends to her and to their home       here in the District of Columbia. But the rest of the time, he would be       in Delaware working as a cabinet secretary at the department, which       really needed the leadership he provided, his extraordinary leadership.              We had a history in Delaware of the department that has jurisdiction       over natural resources and environmental control and the Delaware       development office, which is tasked with creating jobs and attracting       businesses to our State--those two departments had a history of bad       blood and not working together and not being collegial.        At the end of the day, Christophe, who would come to Delaware every       Monday morning and go to work and leave on Friday afternoon, Friday       night, to come back to DC--he and another fellow, who was in charge of       the Delaware Economic Development Office, ended up finding a house       together and rooming in the same house in Dover.        The fellow who was running economic development, his wife--his name       was Bob Corey. Great guy. Great guy. His wife Carol worked for Hershey,       the candy company, the food company in Hershey, PA, and they had a       house there. She continued to live there and work there, and he would       go home on Friday evenings and then come back to work in Delaware on       Monday.        But, anyway, the two departments had for years a hard time getting       along--the department of natural resources and the Delaware division of       economic development. We put the two agencies in the same house as       roommates during the week, and amazing things happened. The two       departments learned how to work together, to be collaborative and       figure out how we strengthen and improve our environment, our water,       our air, and so forth, how we do that and at the same time create jobs       and economic opportunity.        During the 8 years I was privileged to be Governor, I am told there       were more jobs created in those 8 years than in any 8-year period in       the history of the State of Delaware, and part of it is because of the       partnership that I just described between Christophe Tulou, the       secretary of the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental       Control, and Bob Corey, who was running economic development--two       roommates who found common ground and helped their departments find       common ground. We ended up better, with a better place to live.       Frankly, they did a lot better jobs, as it turns out.        But I think I probably talked long enough. I just want to say of       Christophe, after he left me--he bailed on me, but he went to work in a       number of, I think, important jobs. One was as the director of the       District of Columbia's Department of Environment in Washington, DC. It       is like being a cabinet secretary in a State. He did that for       Washington, DC, for a number of years.        He followed that service with a stint as a senior adviser on the       Chesapeake Bay to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Director Gina       McCarthy.        When I became the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works       Committee here in the Senate after the 2016 elections, Christophe came       back and joined us and helped us at EPW from the very beginning. He has       a strong, unwavering commitment to the environmental protection of our       Nation and our planet.        Tophe and his wife Debi are lovely people whom I have been privileged       to know for, gosh, almost four decades, and I will be fortunate to see       him regularly during my visits to Sussex County, one of the three       counties of our State, where he will be working to protect the special       Chesapeake Bay resources of our State.        These are two very decent human beings. I don't think they have a       mean bone in their body. They are smart as whips, and they love the       State of Delaware. They love this planet that we work on. They love       helping people. And they have made our State and, I think, our country       a better place in which to live.        They, as I mentioned, have been members of Carpertown for quite a       while, and since they can check out but they can't leave, they are       going to remain that for us, and we will be able to stay in close touch       with them.        As they get ready to set sail, we are going to leave the light on for       them and provide a warm welcome whenever they come back.        With that, Mr. President, thank you for the time.        I suggest the absence of a quorum.
