 Mr. Speaker, as we prepare the next  farm bill, I rise today to speak about the impact that agriculture has  on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, our farmers, our economy, and our  communities.   Agriculture is the number one industry in the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania. We proudly boast 58,200 farms, totaling more than 7.7  million acres of farmland. These farms contribute to a total economic  impact of $45 billion from production, food processing, marketing,  transportation, and manufacturing.   Mr. Speaker, the farm bill affects everyone in Pennsylvania in  various ways, just as it does families throughout the United States of  America.   It provides a safety net for farmers and ranchers during difficult  times. It supports infrastructure and economic development in rural  communities. It incentivizes good conservation practices to protect our  farmland and our environment. It helps provide access to nutritious,  quality food for the least fortunate among us, as well as breakfasts  and lunches for our schoolchildren.   The farm bill's effects can be felt beyond the ag industry. In 2015,  the USDA rated the market value of all agricultural production in  Pennsylvania at $8.7 billion, and agricultural exports contributed $2  billion to the State economy.   The strengthening impact that agriculture has on the Pennsylvania  economy is significant and undeniable, yet it is only one example of  agriculture's vast influence on the lives of everyone in the  Commonwealth. Agriculture employs our residents, provides better health  for our communities, and promotes agricultural exports.   Agriculture touches the lives of millions of Americans, and not just  those who work as farmers or ranchers.   Pennsylvania's farmers look to the farm bill to protect their  livelihood from weather disasters, to provide them a safety net when  times are hard, and to ensure their ability to support their families  and their communities.  [[Page H6473]]    Over 6 years, the USDA has invested more than $1.4 billion in  Pennsylvania for programs that promote new markets for farm and ranch  products. These programs provide revenue and price loss payments to  eligible producers.   This legislation ensures that eligible acres are afforded disaster  assistance in light of natural disasters and droughts, providing our  farmers with a safeguard against the unpredictable elements of weather.   Beyond supporting our farmers, the farm bill fortifies Pennsylvania's  infrastructure. The bill provides funding for the expansion of  telecommunications, the improvement of water and wastewater  infrastructure, and the construction of community facilities like fire  stations, hospitals, and libraries.   It promotes growth in the community, the health of our children, and  the well-being of Pennsylvania families. In 2016, more than 65 million  breakfasts were served to more than 386,000 children in the School  Breakfast Program. Last year, the State served more than 173 million  lunches to 1 million students who participate in the program.   Programs such as WIC, the Women, Infants, and Children program; and  SNAP, the Supplemental Food and Nutrition Program, help people in need  put food on their tables. The farm bill truly impacts the lives of so  many.   Mr. Speaker, as vice chairman of the Agriculture Committee and  chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, I look forward to producing a  strong farm bill that will promote sound policies for agriculture in  Pennsylvania and throughout the country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Marienville Volunteer Fire Company as it celebrates  125 years of service on Saturday, August 19. The  [[Page H6479]]  Marienville Volunteer Fire Company began in 1892 at the home of Dan  Moriarty as a small group of men with a wagon, a pump, and a  determination to keep their community safe.   In 1902, a great fire ripped through the area, destroying a  substantial section of Marienville. In response, the company came  together to raise money for better equipment, and soon became a well- organized department with official uniforms, its first fire truck, and  a firehouse on North Forest Street.   As the team grew, a new building was built on North Forest Street  that still houses the company today. Today there are about 40 active  members under the direction of President Randall Parrett and Fire Chief  Greg Geyer.   As a state-certified firefighter, EMT, and rescue technician myself,  I know these firefighters are always ready to answer the call.   Mr. Speaker, I proudly congratulate the Marienville Volunteer Fire  Company on this outstanding milestone, and I thank each member of the  company for their service.                            ____________________
