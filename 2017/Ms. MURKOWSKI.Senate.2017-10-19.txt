 Mr. President, before I speak on an amendment that is  expected to be voted on later this afternoon, I wish to take just a  brief moment and thank my colleagues, the Chairman of the HELP  Committee and his ranking member, Senator Murray. The work they have  done to knit together this compromise--and we all recognize it is a  compromise--is such an important one, and it comes at such an important  time.   It is not only good from a policy perspective to ensure that we don't  pull out the underpinnings on the individual market here, but it is  good, from the perspective of the health of our institution, to be able  to demonstrate that, at a time when things are a little tense, let's  just say, on issues that are highly emotional, highly personal, and  highly, highly complex, we can come together and we can demonstrate the  ability to govern. It doesn't come without great patience and  persistence, and these two individuals, these two leaders, have really  helped guide us here in the Senate to find a better path, not only when  it comes to how we deal with access to healthcare, reducing costs,  reducing premiums, and providing for better levels of care but also a  better path for the Senate.   So I want to acknowledge and show my genuine appreciation for their  leadership.   Mr. President, as chairman of the Energy Committee, I come to the  floor today to urge every Member here to vote against amendment No.  1301, which will be voted on later on this afternoon.   The fiscal year 2018 budget resolution instructs the Energy Committee  to raise $1 billion over the next decade. That is all that it does. It  just says: Go out and find $1 billion over the next decade.   I appreciate Chairman Enzi's willingness to include this instruction,  and I have every confidence that our committee will be able to meet the  instruction. There are good reasons why we should be able to meet it,  and, really, very good reasons why we should oppose an amendment that  would preemptively strike it.   I think it is fair to say that we have opportunities within the  energy sector to help advance this country when it comes to our energy  security, our national security, and our economic security. But we need  to be able to move forward with that.   So what we are able to do within this instruction, which is pretty  wide open, is to focus on those areas where we might be able to see  increased energy production that could bring us new wealth--that could  create new wealth in this country.   I am going to be the first to agree that some of our options within  this open instruction are better than others. Some will create jobs.  Some may end jobs. Some will reduce energy costs as opposed to raising  them. Some will increase our energy and mineral security as opposed to  sacrifice or selling it off.    What I hope Members will do is look at this instruction as an  opportunity to do something constructive for the country. The best  example of that is to expand energy development in our Federal areas  where we have seen decline in recent years.   I think we recognize that responsible development not only will  reduce our immediate deficits, but it is about jobs and job creation.  It is about wealth and wealth creation, about allowing us to build new  wealth and create prosperity. It will help energy affordability for our  families and businesses. That is something I hear about all the time.  It will strengthen our national security and our competitiveness.   This is a point that needs to be emphasized over and over again. It  is not only energy security, but it is national security. When we are  dependent on other nations for our energy resources, there is an energy  insecurity and vulnerability. We also realize energy production will  ensure the type of growth we need to finally begin reducing the Federal  debt, which is now over $20 trillion.   In short, what we will be able to do with this energy instruction is  allow us to create new wealth. Why wouldn't that be something we would  all embrace? I think the instruction will allow us to see some enduring  benefits that will be felt all across our country. I think it is  important to recognize and to state that this does not come at the  expense of our environment. This is not an either/or proposition.  Anyone familiar with modern development can recognize that as the scare  tactic it is.   Senator Sullivan, my colleague from the State of Alaska, was on the  floor earlier this morning, and he spoke to the outdated, stale  arguments we have heard repeated on the floor and why we must reject  them.   The amendment we have in front of us, 1301, simply strikes the  section in the resolution that would provide for the Energy Committee  instruction. The purpose perhaps takes it a little bit further in  mentioning and bringing out the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR.  There has been a lot of discussion on the floor about ANWR already.   Senator Sullivan, when he spoke earlier, spoke to the broader  opportunities we have seen in the Arctic with Arctic development in  general. I want to raise a few facts about ANWR more specifically,  since it clearly has been put out there for discussion.   As an Alaskan, and one who has been part of these debates for many  years now, not only on the Senate floor but in Alaska, we know what we  are talking about when we discuss the issue of Arctic development. We  know and understand what ANWR is, where the wilderness area is, and  what the 1002 area is.   I think it is important to put it into context. ANWR is an area of  19.3 million acres. It is about the size of the State of South  Carolina. Included in this ANWR area are 8 million acres of Federal  wilderness. You have wilderness area, you have refuge area, but you  have nonwilderness area designated as the 1002 area. That is this area  on the coastal plain. This is an area of 1.5 million acres. Delaware is  about 1.3 million acres. The 1002 area is what was specifically set  aside under ANILCA that would allow for consideration for its oil and  gas potential. When ANWR was established, it was recognized that there  were areas that were appropriate for wilderness, and there were areas  that were appropriate to be reviewed and considered for their  exploration and production potential.   That is what we are talking about within the 1002 area. Even within  this area that was specifically set aside, we are not asking to develop  all of the 1002. We are asking to develop just 2,000 Federal acres  within it, effectively one ten-thousandths of the refuge area.   You can't see it, but that little red dot is basically what we are  talking about. We can say this. We can say we don't need to do more  than 2,000 acres, in this 19.3 million-acre area that has been set  aside specifically for oil and gas production, because of what has  happened over the decades with regard to our technologies, how we have  worked to reduce the footprint since Prudhoe Bay opened over 40 years  ago. Well pads on the North Slope have shrunk by over 80 percent in  these intervening years. We are talking now about pad areas that are 12  acres in size--10, 11, 12 acres in size.   We have reduced the footprint dramatically, but what we have expanded  [[Page S6610]]  dramatically is the subsurface reach. The new technologies have allowed  us to increase the ability to reach out under the surface to an area  125 square miles--125 miles. We have increased it by 4,000 percent, in  the years we have been producing, exploring, and innovating up north,  due to the technologies we use for exploration. Senator Sullivan showed  the ice roads we use that reduce the impact on the surface and avoid  the need for permanent roads.   We use forward looking infrared cameras to survey for polar bear dens  so we can avoid them. There was actually a story just this spring about  a polar bear that was denning. We found where she was by using the  technologies that we know and literally working around where that polar  bear was until she emerged from her den with her cub in the spring. It  is working with the technologies we have to allow for the activity but  with minimal disturbance to not only the land but to the wildlife  there.   Caribou. We all know about the caribou in the North Slope area. What  we have learned is that over the years, the caribou that occupy these  areas have not suffered. In fact, they have thrived. When oil  development first began, we were looking at herds in the numbers of  about 5,000. Just this last year, the caribou herd is numbering about  22,000, and it has maintained steady and substantial levels.   When you understand what the 1002 area really is and what development  would actually look like, it is not hard to understand why you have  Alaskans' support. Over 70 percent of Alaskans support responsible  development there.   I want to give you one of the best examples. Matthew Rexford is the  president of Kaktovik Inupiat Corporation, KIC, which is a member of  the Voice of the Arctic Inupiat. This is a group of community leaders  from our North Slope. He wrote a great opinion piece not too long ago,  explaining why he supports responsible development in the 1002 area.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Matthew  Rexford's op-ed.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:            [From the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, Oct. 2, 2017]                    Alaskans Say Yes to Drilling in ANWR                            (By Matthew Rexford)         The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the largest wildlife       refuge in America. Spanning more than 19 million acres, it's       an area larger than 10 U.S. states. This vast expanse is home       to caribou, fox, bears and other species. Much of that land       is also home to the Native Inupiat, and our people have used       the resources it has blessed us with for more than 10,000       years. One of those natural resources lies beneath this great       land--oil and gas, and lots of it.        The debate over opening ANWR to drilling gained headway       nationally in 1980, when President Jimmy Carter set aside       less than 8 percent of the refuge for potential oil and gas       development. This section of ANWR became known as the 1002       area, after a section of the Alaska National Interest Lands       Conservation Act.        Since then, Alaskans and the oil and gas industry have       fought unsuccessfully to open the 1002 area to drilling,       which literally requires an act of Congress. At the same       time, Lower 48 lawmakers, special interest groups across the       country, folks and organizations around the world have waged       war on the idea, citing the disruption of wildlife and the       pristine Arctic environment.        As ANWR debates occur, the views of the Inupiat who call       the area home are oftentimes left out. The wishes of the       people who live in and around the refuge's coastal plain       frequently are drowned out by people who live hundreds--even       thousands--of miles away, many of whom have never bothered to       set foot anywhere near the Arctic. Well, today is a new day.        Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, an organization with 21       members from across the Arctic Slope region, including       members from Kaktovik located inside ANWR, have voted       unanimously to pass a resolution supporting oil and gas       development in the 1002 area. This is an unprecedented show       of unity by community leaders of the North Slope--those who       live in and around the coastal plain of the refuge--and       should send a clear message to America that we support       development of a portion of the coastal plain.        My fellow Inupiat and I firmly believe in a social license       to operate, and perhaps no other potential project in the       history of America has called for such a blessing from local       indigenous peoples more than this one.        When oil was first discovered on our land in 1969, the       Inupiat were worried of industry activities and fought hard       for self-determination to protect our subsistence resources.       So we fully understand the trepidation from outsiders: the       fear that the presence of industry on the coastal plain of       ANWR could disrupt wildlife and affect America's manufactured       perspective of our land and culture.        However, we also have the benefit of decades of experience       working with the oil and gas industry to implement stringent       regulations to protect our lands, and the industry       consistently has lived up to our standards. Prudhoe Bay, the       largest oil field on the continent, located 60 miles west of       the coastal plain of ANWR, has demonstrated for four decades       that resource development and ecological preservation can       coexist in the Arctic.        The oil and gas industry supports our communities by       providing jobs, business opportunities and infrastructure       investments, has built our schools and hospitals, and has       provided other basic services most Americans may take for       granted. Our region recognizes its importance to our local       and state economy, and we believe that development can be       done responsibly in a portion of the 1002 area. We are not       alone.        During the past 35 years, the Alaska Legislature has       consistently passed resolution after resolution supporting       the opening of ANWR to drilling. During that same time, each       Alaska member of Congress and every Alaska governor has       supported responsible development of the 1002 area.        More recently, in January, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski       introduced Senate Bill 49--the Alaska Oil and Gas Production       Act--to allow development of 2,000 surface acres in the       refuge's coastal plain. This legislation served as the       catalyst for the Inupiat people coming together to make an       informed, united decision on whether or not to support       drilling in ANWR.        As Inupiat, we stand to be unarguably the most affected by       oil and gas activity in the Arctic. Therefore, we have the       greatest stake in seeing that any and all development keeps       our land and subsistence resources safe. We know it can be       done, because it's being done.        Now is the time to open ANWR to drilling.     In part, Matthew states:         As ANWR debates occur, the views of the Inupiat who call       the area home are oftentimes left out. The wishes of the       people who live in and around the refuge's coastal plain       frequently are drowned out by people who live hundreds--even       thousands--of miles away, many of whom have never bothered to       set foot anywhere near the Arctic. Well, today is a new day.    He goes on to speak to the Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, which has  members from across the Arctic Slope who have voted unanimously to pass  a resolution supporting oil and gas development in the 1002 area. He  goes on further to state:         When oil was first discovered on our land in 1969, the       Inupiat were worried of industry activities and fought hard       for self-determination to protect our subsistence resources.       So we fully understand the trepidation from outsiders: the       fear that the presence of industry on the coastal plain of       ANWR could disrupt wildlife and affect America's manufactured       perspective of our land and culture.        However, we also have the benefit of decades of experience       working with the oil and gas industry to implement stringent       regulations to protect our lands, and the industry       consistently has lived up to our standards. Prudhoe Bay, the       largest oil field on the continent, located 60 miles west of       the coastal plain of ANWR, has demonstrated for four decades       that resource development and ecological preservation can co-      exist in the Arctic.        The oil and gas industry supports our communities by       providing jobs, business opportunities and infrastructure       investments, has built our schools and hospitals, and has       provided other basic services most Americans may take for       granted. Our region recognizes its importance to our local       and state economy, and we believe that development can be       done responsibly in a portion of the 1002 area. We are not       alone.    I am with Matthew and a strong majority of Alaskans are. These are  the voices we need to be listening to. My answer on this discussion is  yes. Opening the nonwilderness 1002 area to development is an option to  meet the instructions to the Energy Committee, but it is not the only  option. I will tell you, it is the best option, and it is on the table.   We should be clear, amendment No. 1301 is not a vote to open the 1002  area or to keep it closed. It is about whether this instruction should  stay in the budget resolution, and it is about whether we are going to  recognize the substantial benefits that await us or whether we are  going to ignore our future energy needs and once again wind up in a  situation where we see prices rising, families hurting, and everyone is  wondering: Why didn't you act when you had a chance?   I think we all recognize that we are enjoying some benefits of lower  energy prices, and some have suggested here: Hey, we are all fine. We  don't need to do anything. A few have even said that  [[Page S6611]]  because we are exporting oil now, we don't need to do more for  ourselves here. It is truly an open invitation to ignore the supply  side. That is just a bad idea. Quite honestly, we have been down that  road before, and we know enough not to be in that place again.   The EIA, the Energy Information Administration, projects that in  2040, the world will be using more oil, not less. They project that our  country will still be importing about 7 million barrels a day on a net  basis. They project prices will be back above $100 a barrel. There are  other experts who are already pointing to other signs. The  International Energy Agency recently found that ``global oil supply  could struggle to keep pace with demand after 2020, risking a sharp  increase in prices, unless new projects are approved soon.''   My point here is we have an opportunity. We have an opportunity not  only to help America create jobs, to allow for opportunities not only  in my home State but around the country, we have an opportunity to  ensure a level of energy security while at the same time broadening  this to enhance our national security.   So what I am asking my colleagues today is to not preempt this very  important conversation. Give us a chance to consider this instruction  within our committee. We will have an opportunity for hearings, and we  will be able to put these options out on the table and understand more  fully how we can do more when it comes to energy production in this  country. Let the Energy and Natural Resources Committee do its part in  helping. Let's not pull the plug even before we get going.   Given everything that we have heard here on the floor about  strengthening our economy and protecting the middle class and making  life better for people whom we serve, I think we really have to ask the  very legitimate question: Why? Why would one leave energy out of this  debate? Why would we limit our opportunity to create new wealth in this  country?   I would again urge the Senate to reject this amendment. It would  deprive us of a substantial opportunity to benefit our country and  ensure that we have great prospects and possibilities in front of us.   The Energy and Natural Resources Committee wanted to see this  instruction in the budget resolution. I have every confidence that we  can meet it, so I would urge Members to vote no on the motion to strike  when that comes up later today.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to soundly reject  this amendment. Those who support this amendment will deny us the  opportunity to do something constructive in this country when it comes  to our opportunities to produce energy, to produce wealth.   We need to be expanding our energy development in our Federal areas.  This helps us reduce our deficit, build new wealth in this country,  strengthen our national security and our competitiveness. We can and we  must do more as a nation to responsibly develop our resources, our  energy resources providing economic security, energy security, and  national security. The Energy Committee is prepared to meet this  instruction to raise a billion dollars over the next decade.   I urge Senators to reject this amendment, which would deprive us of a  substantial opportunity to benefit our country at the same time that we  care for our environment.   Thank you.
