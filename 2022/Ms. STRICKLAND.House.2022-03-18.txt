 Madam Speaker, I rise today as a member of the  Washington State delegation to honor the service and sacrifice of  Pierce County Sheriff's Deputy Dom Calata.   He was killed in the line of duty after pursuing a man wanted for  second-degree assault.   I have been told that he had a tireless work ethic and was someone  who went above and beyond in his commitment to our community and to our  Nation.   In addition to his role as a deputy, he was also in the National  Guard and previously served in the U.S. Army.   But his and his family's commitment to the community doesn't stop  there. He was also an organ donor. It is just  [[Page H3846]]  one more way that he and his family have stepped up to support others  in need.   Dom is nothing short of a hero. His loss is a devastating blow to our  community, and I am thinking of and praying for the Pierce County  Sheriff's Office and Dom's family, friends, and loved ones.   I hope all of us in this House will take a moment to remember Deputy  Calata and his contributions to our community and to our Nation.                            ____________________
