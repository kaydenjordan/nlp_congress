 Mr. Speaker, President Trump has declared today to be  National Agriculture Day, a time of celebration and gratefulness to our  Nation's farmers and ranchers. Whether we realize it or not,  agriculture is a part of all of our daily lives from morning until  night. In fact, each American farmer feeds over 144 people, providing  vital nutrition, and helping us better connect with our God-given  resources.   Every $1 of United States agricultural products and food exports  creates another $1.27 in business activity. Our country's agricultural  exports are valued at more than $100 billion, including $4 billion from  my own home State of Florida. Every $1 billion in exports supports  approximately 8,000 American jobs. That is over 8 million jobs created  by agriculture.   While celebrations such as these mark tremendous achievements for  U.S. agriculture, we must continue to construct policies that supports  and strengthens all of our farmers and ranchers. As lawmakers, let us  make this celebration a time of action and work towards initiatives  that continually uplift our ag industry.                            ____________________
