 Mr. President, first, let me make a comment about the  remarks from my friend from Nebraska.   It happens that I was in Hong Kong when that happened, and I saw the  people, knowing what was going to happen to them after all the promises  that were made. Everything that we suspected and dreaded has now  happened.   I appreciate the fact that there is somebody who cares enough to  bring all of this to the American people.    Yes.    Thank you very much. Thank you. I appreciate that.   It has been a tough time here. I would say that he has made my day    Mr. President, I thank the leader, and I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to legislative session and resume  consideration of S. 4049.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at a time to  be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the  Democratic leader, the following amendments be made pending en bloc and  the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the order listed, with  a 60-affirmative vote threshold for adoption, and that there be 2 hours  of debate on each amendment, equally divided between the two leaders or  their designees, prior to the vote in relation to each amendment. Those  amendments are: Schatz No. 2252, Inhofe No. 2411, Sanders No. 1788,  Cornyn No. 2244, Shaheen No. 1729, and Tester No. 1972, as modified.  [[Page S4184]]     Further, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be adopted en bloc and that the Senate vote on adoption of  the amendments en bloc with no intervening action or debate.   Mr. President, I will read the entire list so that each Member knows  the status of his or her amendment: Moran No. 1694, Hyde-Smith No.  1881, Romney No. 1883, Peters No. 1753, Warner No. 1803, Coons No.  1808, Portman No. 1891, Kennedy No. 1987, Warner No. 1907, Romney No.  2018, Sullivan No. 2391, Tester No. 1968, Bennet No. 1977, Johnson No.  2077, Smith No. 2058, Wicker No. 2178, Cortez Masto No. 2186, King No.  2215, Merkley No. 2251, Fischer No. 2231, Cantwell No. 2255, Risch No.  2238, Cantwell No. 2256, Gardner No. 2241, Hirono No. 2269, Portman No.  2243, Menendez No. 2270, Inhofe-Reed No. 2248, Peters No. 2275, Toomey  No. 2277, Inhofe No. 2204, Cantwell-Manchin No. 2417, Jones No. 1797,  Lankford No. 1825, Loeffler No. 1878, Tester No. 1966, Tester No. 1971,  Kennedy No. 1991, Markey No. 2053, Cruz No. 2138, Durbin No. 2168,  Feinstein No. 2217, Heinrich No. 2220, Rounds No. 2235, Brown No. 2257,  Sasse No. 2287, Boozman No. 2298, Harris No. 2317, Klobuchar No. 2319,  Inhofe No. 2326, Young No. 2327, Shelby No. 2331, Wyden No. 2341,  Blackburn No. 2370, Blackburn No. 2378, Moran No. 1693, Inhofe No.  2418, Sanders No. 2419, Lee No. 2084, Van Hollen No. 1849, Hassan No.  2103, and Rubio No. 2422.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me just  make a comment first.   This is a first step. We have a lot of things happening after this.  We are going to be on the Senate floor for hours and hours. You will  have ample time to entertain your amendment, and I would be very happy  to assist you in that.   For that reason, I would not want to jeopardize those 60 names and  amendments that I have already offered, to jeopardize their efforts by  adding your language, and so I do object.
