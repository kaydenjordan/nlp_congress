 Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve the truth.   Over the past year, Republican and Democrat lawmakers have worked  together to provide temporary and targeted assistance to the American  people. Five times, we passed bipartisan legislation, totaling $4  trillion, to help families get back on their feet and our country get  back to work.   Which begs the question, Mr. Speaker: Why now are Democrats, who  control Congress and control the White House, abandoning bipartisanship  to jam through this partisan legislation without a single Republican  vote?   I will tell you why. It is because this is not COVID relief. It is a  $2 trillion blue State boondoggle and a Trojan horse for their reckless  partisan policies.   It is because Speaker Pelosi is throwing your tax dollars at Democrat  cronies like a float captain throws beads at a Mardi Gras parade:  bailouts for union pensions, bailouts for cash-flush States like  California, bailouts for schools that still refuse to open their doors  to struggling students.   This massive spending bill, masquerading as COVID relief, will  bankrupt the country. It will not rescue the country. It will bankrupt  it and saddle our children with insurmountable debt.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.                                time  1215
