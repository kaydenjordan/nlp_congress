 Mr. Speaker, it is probably appropriate that you will be  hearing on this last full day before the midterms about statehood for  the District of Columbia. I am going to speak about why that is the  appropriate way for us to go into midterms, as I represent 700,000  Americans who are number one--please remember this number--number one  in taxes paid to support the Federal Government, but also have the  distinction of having no final vote on this House floor and having no  representation in the Senate of the United States.   It is very clear--if you want a history lesson, I am not going to  offer that lesson in the time allotted to me this afternoon--but it is  absolutely clear  [[Page H9399]]  that the Framers and the Founders of our country did not go to war with  the slogan of ``Taxation Without Representation'' in order to allow  that slogan to apply everywhere but in their Nation's Capital.   For that reason, we want to thank the Democrats, almost the full  caucus, who have already become cosponsors of the D.C. statehood bill.   I hasten to add that I do not yet have my Republican friends. I  believe that will occur. Meanwhile, Democrats have to plow ahead.   I must thank my colleagues for the support they have given me,  because we are very close to 100 percent here in the House on our DC  statehood bill.   I have to offer my thanks as well to Senator Tom Carper, because he  is the lead sponsor in the Senate, and he has gotten more than 60  percent of the Democrats in the Senate to support D.C. statehood.   If I could mention the last Democrat before we go home--and there  will still be time before the end of this session for the few who  remain off the bill--I do want to thank Eric Swalwell, because he is  the last one before we go home. I had sent out a message: Don't go home  without signing for D.C. statehood. He heard that message.   There will be a few stragglers. I mention stragglers because when I  meet people who aren't on the bill, they say: Oh, my goodness, I  thought I was on the bill.   So that doesn't mean that because we don't have 100 percent, we can't  get 100 percent. It just means Members overlook it and haven't yet come  onto the bill. So we will get to you before the end of the 115th  Congress.   I also want to explain, particularly since we don't have Republican  cosponsors yet, that signing onto the bill is going to help the  District of Columbia, in any case, because we are the first to concede,  with no Republican sponsors yet, that D.C. statehood is an uphill  climb.   I am here today to say we are prepared to make that climb. I think we  are showing that, as I so indicate.   Getting cosponsors is going to help us in the next Congress. We are  almost sure it is going to help us to get what the Congress can give us  now, even without statehood, as more people awaken to the injustice of  Americans who don't have democratic representation--a small ``d''--in  their Congress.                                time  1330    It is going to help us get incrementally to statehood. For example,  the District's local laws, even its final budget raised entirely in the  District of Columbia, have to come here and be signed off by the  Congress.   That is an insult to us, frankly. Most Members aren't interested,  don't know anything about DC's local laws or budgets. A waste of time.   That is the kind of thing that, even without statehood, I think we  can get in the short run and getting more cosponsors for statehood can  only help us get that.   I do want to mention what my colleagues already know. There is not a  poll, not a single poll, that does not show that Democrats will, in  fact, be in the majority in the next Congress. That means, at the very  least, the uphill climb will begin, even if statehood is not around the  corner.   If ever there was an incentive for District residents to keep going  in the streets, going around the Congress to get statehood co-sponsors,  this chart shows it. This chart illustrates what I have just said about  the District of Columbia's paying the highest Federal taxes in the  United States.   If you live in California, to name a big State, if you live in New  York--and I can go down the line--we do have a chart that shows where  each State ranks. They are all beneath the District of Columbia.   What am I talking about? Almost $12,000 per resident in taxes paid by  the people I represent to support the government that does not give  them full representation.   I don't have all the States listed here, but you can see how the line  goes down until it gets to Mississippi, which has the lowest Federal  taxes, whose citizens pay the lowest Federal taxes in the United  States. Yet Mississippi has two Senators, I don't remember how many  Representatives, paying far lower taxes to support the Federal  Government than the Americans I represent, yet they have full  representation in the House and the Senate.   So, some may say, well, you've got 700,000 residents. Is that a lot  of people? It is more residents than two of the States. Vermont and  Wyoming each has one Representative, just like D.C., except that  Representative can vote on this floor, and two Senators. But Vermont  and Wyoming are representative of about seven States in the United  States that have about the same number of residents as the District of  Columbia.   I picked these two out only because they rank below DC. We are equal  in population or near equal in population to seven States.   Perhaps it can be understood when you see that ranking, not to  mention the ranking on per capita taxes, why we seek statehood for the  District of Columbia.   This is not the first time I have sought statehood. I did so when I  first came to the Congress. In 1993, I got the first and only vote on  statehood. Let me tell you the results of that vote and why it is  important that that threshold has been laid.   I was new to the House, and even the most fervent advocates for  statehood did not predict that the vote would be 153 for statehood, 277  against. So I come, candidly, to tell you that we have gone on the  floor for statehood before, and we didn't get it.   Indeed, only 40 percent of the Democrats supported us. How could that  be when you say, Congresswoman Norton, that you have almost all of the  Democrats now on the bill? The difference, of course, is that it was a  very different Congress.   For 40 years, the Democrats had control of the Congress, and that was  in no small part because of Southern Democrats.   By the way, Southern Democrats voted with the District on many, many  bills. And in many ways, I would welcome them back. But, of course,  they were more conservative Democrats than the Democrats now in the  House.   Democrats fully recognize that when we get the majority--and I say  ``when'' and not ``if,'' because I fully expect we will have the  majority in the next Congress--that there will be some Democrats who  are more conservative than I am and perhaps than the average Member of  the House, and that is to be expected, if you want to be in the  majority.   So I am not lamenting that we got only 40 percent in that first and  only statehood vote. I am trying to make the case how votes come and  why they come. We were very proud of that vote, because it was many  more than had been predicted. There was dancing in the House galleries  up there because the vote came far above what the press was predicting  the District was going to get and what even the District and its  residents were predicting.   I hasten to add that, as I have already shown, the District is  already a State in all but name and representation in this Congress.  For example, when time comes for appropriation, unlike the  territories--and I do want to distinguish us from the territories--they  are our sisters in many ways, but Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin  Islands, and the rest don't pay Federal income taxes, so note that  difference. Some of them--in fact, almost none of them have come  forward to request statehood.   There is now some interest in statehood by Puerto Rico. But the  reason that most of the territories don't come forward and ask for  statehood is very clear. There is a quid pro quo for them. In exchange  for not paying Federal taxes, they don't have the votes in Congress. We  pay Federal taxes, and we have no vote in Congress, making us unique in  the union.   So, my friends, or at least virtually all my friends, in the  territories don't even ask for statehood. Sometimes they say, yes, we  want statehood, but they understand that, for them, it is more  difficult.   It is certainly true that, this late in the history of the United  States, one has to wonder why the word ``territory'' is there and to  hope for equality for the residents of the territories. That has to be  up to them, so I don't come here to speak for them. I only want for  them to be treated equally with other Americans.   When I say the District is already a State in ways that many count as  [[Page H9400]]  States, I even point to how the House does its appropriation. The  District gets a per capita appropriation, in other words, based on our  population. So if our population is 700,000, we will get the same as  others who have that population.    It is not true for the territories. Their basic complaint is that  they do get Federal funding, but they don't get the per capita funding  that States get.   There is a reason D.C. gets that per capita funding. It is because of  tax funding we give to support our government.   So the government has recognized the District's contributions in some  ways. It simply has not given us the representation that a democratic  country owes all its citizens.   Some may believe that the reason the District does not have statehood  is that it needs help from the Federal Government. Far from it. It is  the District that helps the Federal Government because of the strength  of the city's local economy. That local economy outstrips in its  strength many of the local economies of the States.   For example, the District's own local budget is more than $12  billion. That is larger than the budget of 12 States that already have  full representation in this Congress. These days it is hard to find a  sizable surplus in the States, but the District's surplus is almost  $200 billion. That is money that the District puts away in taxes and  other revenue it gets, mostly from its own citizens. That would make  it, just that surplus, the envy of the country.   The District's per capita income is higher than the per capita income  of any State. This is not a poor city asking for help from the Federal  Government. This is a city that helps the Federal Government with taxes  paid without representation.   That taxation without representation is, of course, the largest  grievance. But it is also true that Republicans, who fancy themselves  the local control party in the Congress, try their very best here in  the House and in the Senate to take away what home rule or self- government that the District now has.   The District, in 1974, after almost 100 years, got the right to elect  its own Mayor and city council. The last time it had that right,  Republicans were in charge right after the Civil War when the  Republicans gave the District what we call home rule.   It is Democrats who took away that local self-government. It is the  Democrats, my party, who were in charge most of the years we were  without local government, that took it away. Many of them were more  conservative or Southern Democrats. But there is no escaping that they  were Democrats, and they were often in control of this House.   So, Republicans who come to this floor on both sides to argue even  against Federal intervention even that is authorized by the  Constitution and by Federal law. Isn't it amazing that the party of  local control would persistently interfere with the local control that  the District of Columbia has had since 1973, but that is what we see.   I just want to cite not all but to give examples of some of this  interference and to indicate why I think this interference takes place,  because it doesn't take place as to the laws of the District of  Columbia. What this does mean is that the Congress uses the fact that  the District does not have statehood to intrude itself to try to  overturn some laws in the District of Columbia that they happen to  disagree with.                                time  1345    Now, the District of Columbia is a big city. Like most big cities,  even within the States, it is more progressive than other parts of our  country.   So, although they have nothing to gain, Republicans try to make  political points back home by intruding and trying to take away laws  passed by the D.C. Council. I want to give examples of some of those  laws and even to indicate some of the Members who helped me get rid of  the attempts to overturn our laws.   For example, our laws that have legalized recreational marijuana,  that makes D.C. one of nine jurisdictions. Now, that is controversial,  but the Congress has done nothing about those States that have departed  from Federal law and legalized marijuana. The Republican Congress has  done nothing about it.   But each and every Congress, the Congress keeps the District of  Columbia from commercializing marijuana. I say ``commercializing''  because those States are now taxing marijuana. Marijuana is consumed  everywhere in the United States. Nobody gets arrested for it anymore.   So these States have simply said, ``What is pro forma law shall be  law, and we will tax marijuana.'' Well, the District of Columbia passed  a law to legalize marijuana, and Republicans made an attempt to  undermine that law, simply erase it. They were not very smart in the  way they did it, and, thus, 2 ounces of marijuana is still legal to  possess in the District of Columbia.   And it is interesting that, as marijuana laws have become more  widespread in the United States, Republicans have not come back and  attempted, yet again, to overturn our marijuana law.   The reason that the District was adamant about our marijuana law is  the enormous disparities between who got arrested for marijuana  offenses, which are misdemeanors but give you a record. They turned out  to be largely African Americans. So we did not have the usual  recreational marijuana reason for wanting to legalize marijuana. We had  an additional reason of great importance to our city.   Republicans failed to overturn the law, but they left us without the  ability to commercialize marijuana, and look what that has done. That  means that as The Washington Post reported--and we call them  ``riders.'' ``This amendment is a ``license,'' quoting a drug dealer,  for me to print money.'' Some call it the ``Drug Dealer Protection  Act'' because, with no ability to commercialize marijuana, the drug  dealers have not gone out of business here as they have in the States  that have legalized and commercialized marijuana.   I want to name just a few other examples. We have a bill. Only one  State--and two other localities have similar bills. It is called the  ``Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Act.'' It says that you can't  discriminate against one of your own employees or families based on the  reproductive health decisions they make.   The Republicans are deep into the business of individuals by looking  at such matters. For example, firing or declining to hire a woman for  having had an abortion, even if it was due to rape--and maybe that is  why they knew about it in the first place because I don't understand  how you could even know about such private business--or declining to  hire a woman for using in vitro fertilization.   Now, the reason that you have the District of Columbia and two other  cities with similar laws is there have been some matters brought to the  attention of their local legislature. This is an amendment, unlike the  marijuana commercialization law, that I have been able to get removed,  but it is an example of one that continues to come back.   One of the most troubling is the District's abortion law. Mr.  Speaker, 17 States use their own local funds on abortion for poor  women. Federal funds for abortions have long been barred by the  Congress, so these 17 States spend their own funds, except for the  District of Columbia, which to this day cannot do so. There is a local  nonprofit organization which helps women because of this amendment, but  you can see what I mean about intruding in the most private of affairs.   I am not asking people to support the choices made by the District of  Columbia. I am certainly not asking the Congress to do that. I am  asking Congress to get out of our lives, to give us equality by our own  citizens in choosing our laws, however controversial.   Another example that is controversial--and I point this out because  our laws sometimes are controversial and because other States have  passed similarly controversial laws. It is called, ``D.C.'s Death with  Dignity Act.''   The Congress has tried to bar, unsuccessfully, the District law that  is law in six other States that allows self-administered lethal  medication for people who have 6 months to live and who doctors have  said are in such terrible pain or misery that these people, not the  doctors, should be allowed to give themselves a lethal medication.  [[Page H9401]]    Talking about a private matter. I don't know where most Americans  stand on this. I am told that most approve it, by the way. But I know  where the people I represent stand, and I know it is up to them and  only them, and it offers another reason why we fight for statehood.   Look, I have been able to keep this attempt to take away our law, our  D.C. Death with Dignity Law from, in fact, becoming law. But it does  give you an indication of the kind of continual fight that has to be  made here for the District of Columbia, and this is in addition for all  the work that I, like other Members, have to do on the national bills,  the bills that are legitimately introduced in this House.   I suppose at least one more ought to be mentioned. How could I not?  That is, the District has a local budget autonomy law. Republicans  tried to abolish it. It gives the District the ability to have its  local law go into effect without coming here to the Congress where they  do nothing about it except try to use it as a bill allowing them to  attach what we call ``riders.''   If you want to do an amendment, there has to be a bill. So they want  our budget over here so that they can do amendments like the one I just  discussed on marijuana. Well, we want to get rid of that by giving the  District budget autonomy so that its local laws will not have to come  here in the first place.    The Congress has tried to overturn the budget autonomy law and has  been unsuccessful. The District went to court. The court said our local  budget autonomy law was, in fact, constitutional and legal. Although  the Congress has not overturned it--and we are grateful for that--the  Congress does pass a law saying the District's local budget is now law  anyway.   So you see how redundant that is? They don't do anything about it,  but they pass a provision and say, ``We made it law. DC says it is  already law.'' But, you see, until we get to the point where they don't  have anything to say about our local budget, we will not be the equal  of the States.   What makes all of this interference particularly painful to the  District of Columbia is how the District is viewed by those who have no  axe to grind, and the best examples of those would be the rating  agencies. For example, Moody's has given the District a AAA rating. I  would like to quote what Moody's says about the District of Columbia  and its economy and how its government is run.   ``The dynamism of the District's economy has led to the largest  population in 40 years and strong growth in the tax base. Financial  governance''--I repeat the words--``Financial governance is exemplary.  Reserves are robust.''   Talking about people who have nothing to gain except seeing it as the  data reports it. That was Moody's speaking about how the District's  financial governance rates.   Let me quote Standard & Poor's. Here is what Standard & Poor's has to  say. This is very important because it is a critique, in effect, of  this Congress. By the way, they have given DC a AAA rating.   ``We continue to have concerns about the role of the Federal  Government in future District budgets. We view this as an ongoing  factor that has a negative effect on the District's finances and as a  slight offset to the District's otherwise very strong management  practices.''   In effect, what Standard & Poor's is saying is it costs the District  money--money in how the District pays--and I use that word advisedly-- the District pays in dollars and cents because of congressional  interference. And how the Congress interferes affects how investors  view the District's economy.                                time  1400    It is a price to be paid, literally, in dollars and cents by the  residents of the District of Columbia.   Now, I do not want to be misunderstood. I do not stand here and say,  if you don't give us statehood, there is nothing we can do. But I do  want to illustrate what we have to do. Yes, we have been successful  sometimes in being treated equally with the States.   For example, just look at last year. We had to defeat 15 attempts to  overturn the District's local laws. There were three attempts that we  had to defeat to eliminate the District's gun safety laws. This is the  District of Columbia, where there are Members of the House and Senate,  like Senator Marco Rubio, who continues to put in a bill that would  eliminate every single gun law in the District of Columbia.   Imagine what that would mean in the Nation's Capital here, where some  of the most controversial figures in the country and the world are seen  on our streets, in our restaurants, and public places, if anybody can  come in with a gun.   Well, we have tight gun laws in this town. I have had to fight very  hard, and, yes, we have succeeded even without statehood. That is no  argument against statehood. That reinforces the notion that we need  statehood because those things should not have happened, should not  have taken my time on the floor or the time of residents to come here  to say, please, don't do this to us.   There is another favorite of the Republicans: to put private school  vouchers on the District of Columbia. Let me indicate why that is  particularly outrageous. The District of Columbia does, in fact, have  its public school system, and it has an almost equal number of students  in what are called charter schools, which are not a part of the D.C.  public schools. DC has done that on their own.   When the education bill comes before the Congress, and a national  charter school bill is, in fact, on the floor, some Members of Congress  vote against charter schools while others favor them, except there are  Members who don't have charter schools.   We have charter schools. We have improved our public schools as well,  but they are our public schools. They are paid for by our tax dollars.   However, there is always an education bill that has private school  vouchers in it that we very much oppose private school vouchers because  the jurisdiction has no control on how well the children are even doing  in those schools. We do have that kind of control over how well  children are doing in charter schools and in public schools. But if  they go to any private schools--and some of these private schools are  fly-by-night schools, but even those that are not are private and,  therefore, not subject to regulation and oversight.   So, when vouchers are a part of the education bill that comes before  us every few years, vouchers for schools in the United States, that  bill is voted down every time. So that makes the District of Columbia  the only jurisdiction that does have private school vouchers; and we do  have school vouchers, but they are for a very small number of students  because most students choose our charter schools and our public  schools.   As I speak, I hope I will be successful. I believe I will be  successful again in getting D.C. tuition access grants.   Now, DC is unusual because the District does not have a university  system. It simply has one public university. I have been able to get  tuition assistance grants so that our youngsters go to universities and  colleges in every State, all 50 States. And it is interesting, I do  have a lot of support for this bill because there is not a Member that  doesn't have D.C. students going to college in their States.   The Federal Government pays for the difference between what the  student pays and the higher cost that would otherwise be charged as  out-of-state tuition, DC students pay the same in-state tuition, and  that has been a help. And it is help from the Federal Government, and  it is supported by many Members in this Congress who know that their  own public universities have benefited from it.   I don't maintain that we don't get anything from the Federal  Government. I have already indicated that we get the same per capita as  the states, and I don't indicate that if I don't have statehood I can't  get any bills passed. People will come to the District of Columbia  today and they will find, on both waterfronts, the Southeast  waterfront, the Southwest waterfront--the Southeast waterfront is  called Capital Riverfront; the Southwest waterfront, The Wharf. There  are, essentially, whole new neighborhoods on those waterfronts. And,  yes, I got those without statehood.   But I dare Republicans to say, well, since you can get things like  that for your District without statehood, what are you crying about? I  am crying  [[Page H9402]]  about taxes without representation is what I am crying about.   Yes, I know we can get funds, for example, for things my legislation  for the Arlington Memorial Bridge, which brings people from the south  to the Nation's Capital.   Yes, I am grateful that, even in a Republican Congress, I have been  able to get the Wharf bill passed. I have been able to get the  Southeast waterfront bill, or Capital Riverfront as it is called,  passed, that we got money for the Arlington Memorial Bridge.   And I bring those up because I don't want to hear, well, if you are  able to get things done, what is your problem?   My problem is what I have been discussing here. It is undoing what  our city has done, undemocratically, and it is failure to give us the  same representation in the Congress of the United States as every other  taxpaying American.   Yes, sometimes I have to do the very unusual. There is a tax bill,  for example, that just went through here. It is interesting to note it  is not very popular with the American people, and I certainly was  against it. I couldn't vote for it or against it.   But if there is a bill going through here and I can find a way to get  my District in it, I am going to try and get in it. So there are parts  of this bill that promote incentives and investment in some of our low- income parts of the city, that promote private and affordable housing  in the District of Columbia, so I am in the tax bill.    But I opposed the tax bill. In that way, I am like many other  Democrats who voted ``no'' on this floor but, yet, tried to get in the  bill and did get in the bill. That is how the Congress works.   Finally, nothing makes the case for D.C. statehood better than this  chart showing the District war casualties in the 20th century when we  fought our major wars: in World War I, more casualties than three  States. Korean War, by that time it had gone up to more casualties than  8 States. By World War II, we were seeing more casualties than four  States. Remember, the District is smaller than most States. And the  Vietnam War, perhaps the very worst, more casualties than 10 States.   Since then, we have eliminated the draft, but this chart and these  tombstones make the best case for equal treatment for the residents of  the District of Columbia. Even as I speak, the residents of this city  have volunteered and serve in a volunteer army.   These statistics illustrate the United States when we had a draft. So  we don't have a draft now, and, yet, District residents are found in  every part of the country--forgive me--every part of the world where  our troops are.   It is time that our country recognized our city and its residents  and, particularly, those who now serve, those who served before them,  and those who have died in service of their country.   We are now in the 21st century. It seems impossible we have gotten  here: 217 years since the District of Columbia has been the Nation's  Capital; 217 years of inequality in your own country; 217 years of  paying taxes without representation; 217 years of going to war without  benefit of equal treatment even by those who served.   This is why, for those reasons, the residents, the American citizens  I represent, cannot possibly give up on seeking equal treatment: first,  by perfecting what is called home rule, or self-government; but  certainly, by becoming a State like every other State, by no longer  being treated, as Frederick Douglass said, as aliens, not citizens, but  subjects.   We are Americans. That is why we insist that the American citizens in  the District of Columbia become citizens of the 51st State of the  United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 2 o'clock and 15 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Tuesday,  October 2, 2018, at 12:30 p.m.                            ____________________
