 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 10, the  Financial CHOICE Act, replacing the harmful Dodd-Frank Act, with  reforms that help all Americans.   The CHOICE Act keeps the promise to my constituents to remove Obama- era regulations, increase choice for consumers in my community, and  impose the toughest penalties in history for financial fraud.   Strong communities like the ones I represent in north Texas are based  on the strength of their local businesses. Under Dodd-Frank, America  loses an average of one community bank every day. The Financial CHOICE  Act will help businesses on Main Street reform business on Wall Street  and fuel economic growth throughout the country.   I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 10.                            ____________________
