 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, rewards the political class, not the working class; that  should be the name of this bailout plan.   When our Democrat colleagues got together to describe how to proceed  on additional COVID-19 spending, they could have done a number of  things.   They should have followed the bipartisan precedent set over the past  year and worked across the aisle. Instead, they chose a purely partisan  process to jam through a radical agenda, putting the political class  ahead of America's working class.   They could have looked at the data coming out of the Congressional  Budget Office. Had they done so, they would have seen that, absent any  new funding, the economy is projected to reach prepandemic levels of  real GDP growth by the middle of this year. Further, they would have  seen that without this bailout, America is already projected to see its  largest GDP growth in 15 years. Instead, they ignored the data, just  like they have ignored the science. And they now hope that their  bailout plan gets credit for an economic recovery that CBO tells us is  already underway.   They could have accounted for the approximately $1 trillion in COVID- 19 money Congress already appropriated in a bipartisan approach but  which has not been spent yet. Instead, they ignored calls to provide an  accurate and thorough accounting of unspent funds. Now, they are  charging American taxpayers another $2 trillion.   They could have focused on timely and targeted relief to support  those  [[Page H1260]]  that are most in need, to reopen schools in our communities and  storefronts on Main Street, and to crush the virus and put shots in  Americans' arms. Instead, less than 9 percent of this bailout goes to  crushing the virus and dispensing vaccines. Only 5 percent of the K-12  education funding will be spent this year, even as Americans are told  this money is needed to reopen their children's schools.   Of course, Democrat leaders are more than willing to spend hundreds  of billions to bail out States, sending a disproportionate share of  that money to those States run by their political buddies that will  reward and incentivize further lockdowns.   Just look at how they changed the State funding formula. California,  where revenues are, in fact, up, and they are sitting on a surplus of  $10-plus billion, will now get billions more than they otherwise would  have, a direct reward to the Speaker and Vice President's home State.   It was all so predictable, really. From the very beginning of this  process, Republicans have been saying that this bailout was never about  COVID relief but, rather, about Democrats trying to notch some wins for  their political base, to appease their allies rather than help  Americans.   Amazingly, Democrats are not even shy now about admitting that fact.  The White House Chief of Staff has called this bill the ``most  progressive domestic legislation in a generation.''   Leader Schumer, in the Senate, called it ``one of the most  progressive pieces of legislation . . . in decades.''   We are here today, Mr. Speaker, because Democrats made a choice, a  choice to put their own partisan political ambitions ahead of the needs  of the working class, ahead of the needs of the American people. When  our Democrat colleagues speak of unity, they mean keeping their party  together, not pulling this country together.   That is why we have before us this wrong plan at the wrong time for  so many wrong reasons.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from  California. I will remind her that if this bill were enacted, her  State's 6 million seniors would see a cut of Medicare of over $44  billion in the next 10 years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  Nevada. I will remind him that with this bill, if it is signed into  law, his 500,000 seniors will face a $3 billion cut to Medicare. So his  vote today will cost a $3 billion cut to the seniors of Nevada.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  South Carolina, and I will remind him that if this bill becomes law,  the 1 million seniors in his State will face a $7 billion cut over the  next 10 years to Medicare.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  California, and I will remind him that his State has 27 percent of the  homeless population in the United States. But under this bill, the CBO  projects that precisely zero dollars of the $5 billion will be spent  this year. Wrong plan at the wrong time for so many wrong reasons.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Good).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that, under  President Trump, we had the lowest poverty rate since 1959 in 2019. The  lowest poverty rate since 1959 came under President Trump. Thank you to  President Trump.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.  Feenstra).     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from  Texas, and I will remind her that, while this legislation provides her  State government with another $40 billion, it fails to include any  language to ensure that the 5 million K-12 students in her State are  back in open schools anytime soon, does nothing to open schools.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from  New York, and I will remind him that, with passage of this bill, his  State's 3 million seniors could see a cut to Medicare of $27 billion  over the next 10 years.   I would also like to remind Mr. Jeffries that the CBO says that,  without any additional stimulus, our economy later on in this year will  be the highest GDP growth that we have seen in 15 years. So that help  of extra government spending is not necessary to bail out your friends  and allies who are in the Governor's mansion in New York or California.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from  New York, and I would like to remind her that, in her home State, she  has 16 percent--16 percent--of the country's homeless population in the  United States; but under this bailout, the CBO projects that precisely  zero dollars--zero dollars--of the $5 billion that is in this bill will  go to help the homeless population this coming year.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), the leader of the working class party.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the Republican whip.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to make sure. This  Chamber may not have heard, but under the leadership of President  Trump, in 2019, we hit the lowest poverty ever--lowest poverty. So  thank you, President Trump.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from the great State of Colorado (Mrs. Boebert).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute the gentleman  from Mississippi (Mr. Guest).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1271]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, there is this popular phrase that our Speaker is known  for that we must pass the bill before we know what is in it. Well, the  other side also said that you must poll the bill before the American  people know what is in it. After they figure out what is in this bill,  they won't like it.   We have looked at this bill. We have read it.   Less than 9 percent of all funding of this bill goes for healthcare  spending to crush the virus and to put vaccinations in the arms of  Americans. More than 20 percent of this bill goes to policies that harm  jobs and reduce employment, and $36 billion will be cut from Medicare  just next year alone because of this bill. Over $360 billion will be  cut from seniors in 10 years because of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, when the facts are polled, the American people will know  that this is a progressive wish list forced down by the Democratic  Party.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
