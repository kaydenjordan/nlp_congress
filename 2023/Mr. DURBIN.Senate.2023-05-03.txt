 Mr. President, the National Institutes of Health here in  the Washington, DC, area is the leading health research Agency in the  world--in the world. And we are very proud of that fact.   One of the leaders of the NIH, through Presidents of both political  parties, was Dr. Francis Collins, who still is part of the Biden  administration. But as head of NIH, he really brought the research  capacity of that Agency to a historic high.   I visited him about 6 years ago and said: What can I do as a Member  of the Senate to help you when it comes to medical research?   He said: Well, the researchers that we count on to come through with  the breakthroughs in medical research are never sure what Congress is  going to do. Are you going to fund us this year as much money as last  year or are you going to cut our budgets? Some of the researchers give  up even on promising projects because they are uncertain about the  future. He said: The best thing you can do, Senator, is to get 5  percent real growth in the spending at the National Institutes of  Health year in and year out.   I said: Dr. Collins, I will take you up on that.   I came back here to the Senate and discovered that the person I  needed to win to my point of view on this was Republican Senator Roy  Blunt from Missouri. He chaired the Appropriations subcommittee, which  funded that Agency. So I went to Roy, and I said: Here is what Dr.  Collins said. We all respect him. For a man who discovered the human  genome, we should respect him. He thinks 5 percent real growth can make  a difference.   Roy Blunt, Republican, said: I need to have Lamar Alexander and  another Republican Senator on my side, and you need to make sure Patty  Murray is on your side. I said: I am sure she is, but I will double  check.   So we put together a team of four of us--two Democrats, two  Republicans--and we did it--5 percent real growth in the budget of  NIH--about 6 years ago.   The response was positive across the Nation. Researchers said: If  this is going to be the future, we are going to stick with our research  to see what we can find to help people alleviate suffering.   So our team put together an effort that raised the annual budget of  the National Institutes of Health from $30 billion to $40 billion. It  was a bipartisan effort and a good effort. Luckily, some of the  research that they had undertaken was of practical value to families  across America during the coronavirus epidemic. So we felt pretty good  about it.    Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to confirm  Orelia Merchant to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  New York.   Ms. Merchant received her B.S. from Dillard University, an M.A. from  the College of William and Mary, and her J.D. from Tulane University  Law School. She began her legal career as assistant regional counsel  for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.   Ms. Merchant then served as a Special Assistant U.S. Attorney in the  Eastern District of Louisiana before transferring to the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. She spent 17  years in the civil division of the U.S. Attorney's Office, handling  matters involving asset forfeiture and various forms of fraud including  environmental, healthcare, and mortgage fraud.   Since 2019, Ms. Merchant has worked in the New York Attorney  General's  [[Page S1478]]  Office as chief deputy Attorney General for State counsel. In this  role, she manages 250 attorneys and oversees more than 8,000 active  cases, including prosecution and defense actions in State and Federal  court on behalf of State officials, the State legislature, and State  agencies. Nearly the entirety of Ms. Merchant's practice has involved  litigation and the vast majority of her experience has been in Federal  court. She is a seasoned litigator whose expertise will be an asset to  the Eastern District of New York. The American Bar Association has  rated Ms. Merchant as ``qualified,'' and she has the strong support of  Senators Schumer and Gillibrand.   I will be supporting her nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do  so as well.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) is necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 48, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 107 Ex.]                                  YEAS--51       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Fetterman      Gillibrand      Graham      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--48       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Britt      Budd      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Mullin      Murkowski      Paul      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Vance      Wicker      Young                               NOT VOTING--1               Feinstein           The nomination was confirmed.
