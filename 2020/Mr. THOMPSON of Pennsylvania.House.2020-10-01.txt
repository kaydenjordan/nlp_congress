 Mr. Speaker, I rise as a former State  certified firefighter one from Pennsylvania. As we kick off the month  of October, I mention that next week is Fire Prevention Week.   In 1925, President Calvin Coolidge established Fire Prevention Week,  and today it is the longest running public health observance in the  Nation. It is celebrated each year during the week of October 9 to  commemorate the devastating Great Chicago Fire.   This is an opportunity to educate one another on simple measures we  can all take to prevent fires at home. You can bolster your family's  safety by testing your fire alarms monthly, giving home heaters  appropriate space, and having an escape plan if, God forbid, your home  does catch fire.   We must also do more to prevent wildfires. As former chairman of the  Subcommittee on Conservation and Forestry, I have been a part of many  conversations, meetings, and hearings about how we can better prevent  forest devastation as a result of wildfires.   We continue to see devastating wildfires on the West Coast. Homes,  businesses, and forests are burning to the ground. The air quality is  dangerous, and millions of Americans are at risk.    For decades, the health and resiliency of our national forests have  been in decline due to a lack of management and, more recently, extreme  environmental policies.   With nearly 90 million acres of forestland in need of urgent  treatment, Congress needs to finally act and provide the tools and  authorities to enable the Forest Service to proactively manage. Doing  so will directly help prevent wildfire outbreaks, support our local  communities, and restore the health of our Nation's forests. And a  healthy forest is one of the largest carbon sinks in the world.   The 2018 House-passed farm bill contained bipartisan, commonsense  forest management provisions to help prevent loss of life and property  from these fires. These bipartisan authorities were created with input  from the U.S. Forest Service under both the Obama and Trump  administrations. These were ideas that were well vetted through  hearings and markups and supported by the House Agriculture Committee  and on the floor.   However, Senate Democrats have refused to even discuss these needed  reforms. Since these provisions were rejected, 3.5 million acres of  Forest Service land have burned.   Wildfire response and recovery efforts should not be a partisan  issue. We are blessed as a nation to have hundreds of millions of acres  of beautiful forestlands, and the best way to prevent forest fires is  through a well-managed forest.   Mr. Speaker, well-managed forests, again, are the largest carbon  sinks in the world and the greatest filters for our watersheds that  originate in those forests. Our forests provide great opportunities for  outdoor recreation, but they are also unparalleled environmental tools.  Our national forests serve as some of the Nation's largest carbon  sinks.   This Fire Prevention Week, I would like to encourage everyone to  brush up on their fire safety measures, and I reiterate just how  crucial healthy forests are in preventing wildfires.   I thank the brave men and women who are on the front lines fighting  those devastating fires out West.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, last week, I introduced  H.R. 8332, the Plugging Orphan Wells and Environmental Restoration Act,  or the POWER Act. This bill would authorize the Federal orphan well  remediation program under the Energy Policy of 2005 for 5 years at $50  million per year.   The POWER Act would also establish a grant program for environmental  restoration and reclamation of orphaned wells on State as well as  private and Tribal lands, authorized at $400 million per year for 5  years.   It is estimated that Pennsylvania has more orphaned wells than any  other State. Pennsylvania is the birthplace of the modern petroleum  industry, and the Commonwealth's oil and gas industry has helped lead  America to energy independence.   We have both an economic and environmental responsibility to ensure  abandoned wells are plugged, and the POWER Act would ensure these  legacy sites are appropriately handled to protect the environment,  while also stimulating jobs in the oil and gas sector. This will be a  win-win for America and a win-win, certainly, for Pennsylvania.   I thank Guy Reschenthaler, my colleague from Pennsylvania, for  joining me on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support oil  and gas well remediation through the POWER Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman) for hosting this Special Order on wildfire.   Mr. Speaker, over the past decade, there has been an average of  64,100 wildfires and 6.8 million acres burned every year.   With over 10 million acres burned, we saw the highest number of  Federal acres burned in 2015--and nearly that amount in 2017.   But this year, it has been even worse. 2020 has been an extremely  difficult wildfire year for our firefighters, our responders, and many  rural communities in and near the forests.   As of today, October 1, over 44,000 wildfires have burned nearly 7.7  million acres this year alone.   In addition to the destruction of these forests, homes, and property,  we sadly continue to see lost lives.   Over the past 25 years, active management has plummeted across the  national forest system; consequently, it is no coincidence that the  larger, more intense fires are happening on Federal lands, where there  is less management, versus State and private lands.   More individual fires occur in the East, but the wildfires in the  West are larger and burn more acres. Wildfires also have significant  impacts on eastern forests because of the budgetary effects on the  Forest Service's ability to manage and personnel.   We must be encouraging more active forest management across the  National Forest system. This includes thinning, prescribed fires, and  hazardous fuels reduction, especially in the roughly 19 million acres  of Federal lands that are already known to be at high risk.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Westerman, for his great work  during the last farm bill and his leadership with the Resilient Federal  Forests Act and the Trillion Trees Act.   Through the next farm bill, I am hopeful that we can continue to  build on those commonsense reforms, and we will provide more  authorities to help the Forest Service better manage and encourage more  partnerships.
