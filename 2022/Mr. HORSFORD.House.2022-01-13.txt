 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor a great son of Nevada,  Senator Harry Mason Reid.   Senator Reid was raised in a home with dirt floors in Searchlight,  Nevada. And even as he rose to the highest levels of power, including  this Chamber, he never forgot his small-town roots.   In the Senate, he fought for all of us. He championed the DREAM Act  and brought young Dreamers to Capitol Hill. He fought against Yucca  Mountain. And because of his work to pass the Affordable Care Act, 31  million Americans have healthcare today.   Most people don't know this, but long before he was a Senator, he  paid his way through law school by serving with the U.S. Capitol  Police. He protected this Capitol, and he defended our democracy.   Senator Reid, thank you for your lifetime of service. May you rest in  peace.                            ____________________
