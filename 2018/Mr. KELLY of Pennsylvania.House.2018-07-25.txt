 Mr. Speaker, obviously we live in  alternative universes.   Mr. Speaker, America is winning again, and before we embark on the  August recess, let's take into account what just 18 months of unified  Republican government has meant for the American people.   According to the IMD World Competitive Center's 2018 rankings, the  United States of America has overtaken Hong Kong as the world's number  one most competitive economy thanks to faster economic growth and a  supportive atmosphere for scientific and technological innovation. Our  entire stock market is hovering around all-time highs.   Our national unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in 18  years. Female unemployment has reached its lowest levels since 1953.  That is over 65 years ago. Black and Hispanic unemployment have reached  their lowest levels ever.   More than 3.7 million new jobs have been created since President  Trump took office, including 358,000 new jobs in manufacturing. In  contrast, more than 16,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide were lost in  2016, the year before President Trump took office.                                time  1115    In 2017, an average of 16,333 manufacturing jobs were created per  month; and last month, 26,000 new manufacturing jobs were created,  bringing it to a total of 358,000 new jobs in manufacturing since  President Trump's inauguration in January of 2017. And it continues to  grow today.   The U.S. currently has 6.6 million job openings. It is at an all-time  high. There are now more job openings than there are job seekers in the  United States for the third straight month. In May, new hires rose to  5.75 million. That is the highest level in 17 years and the second  highest level on record. An all-time high of 155.6 million Americans  now have jobs.   Now, back home in Pennsylvania's Third Congressional District, which  is soon to be its 16th Congressional District, the unemployment rate  has dropped significantly in all seven counties. In Erie County,  unemployment is now at an 18-year low, and in Crawford County, it is at  a 42-year low. Wages for workers in Pennsylvania and across America  have grown steadily by almost 3 percent over the past year and are  continuing to climb.   Jobless claims, which are also known as unemployment benefit filings,  have reached a 48-year low. That is half a century. Customer confidence  has reached its highest level since 2001. Job market confidence and  small business confidence are at their highest levels ever.   Since President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December of  last year, businesses have created more than 1.3 million new jobs for  American workers. And thanks to the tax cuts, more than 650 companies  and counting are reinvesting billions of dollars into their businesses  and have given more than 4.5 million American workers and counting  major bonuses or pay raises or benefit increases.   In my home district, this has included employees for NexTier Bank,  Erie Insurance, PNC Bank, Walmart, Starbucks, McDonald's, Chipotle,  Home Depot, the National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation, and many  more. Nationally, more than 100 United States utility companies have  lowered bills for customers in 48 States. Since February of this year,  90 percent of American wage earners have been opening bigger, less  taxed paychecks with more take-home pay.   In my home district, the average tax cuts for individuals is $1,230.  For families of four, it is $2,427. Those are hardly crumbs. In over 10  years, households will enjoy an average of more than $18,000 in take- home pay, and these are dollars that they have earned and now they get  to spend it the way they want to as opposed to sending it to the  government for the government to spend it the way the government would  like to.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has also established the brand-new  opportunity zones, a program to incentivize private investors to make  long-term investments in communities that have faced economic  hardships, which means even more jobs are on the way. The New York  Times has called this provision the first substantial Federal attempt  to aid those communities in more than a decade.   Mr. Speaker, in every measurable way, all Americans are better off  now than we were just 2 short years ago. In every measurable way,  America is winning again.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  including my bill, H.R. 6305, the Bipartisan HSA Improvement Act of  2018, in H.R. 6199, the Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing  Health Savings Accounts Act.                                time  1615    This important legislation expands access to and enhances the utility  of health savings accounts, also known as HSAs.   My legislation gives employers more flexibility to offer quality  healthcare in the setting that is best for them, like onsite or retail  clinics. Employers around the country are offering innovative ways to  deliver healthcare to their associates, and this provision makes sure  that individual health savings accounts can utilize these same  services.   It also fixes the spouse penalty by allowing individuals to make  health savings account contributions if a spouse has a flexible  spending account, while preventing double-dipping in tax benefits.   Lastly, it makes it easier for people to save for their healthcare by  streamlining the conversion of other tax-preferred accounts to health  savings accounts.   Ultimately, this bill modernizes healthcare delivery and gives  employers the freedom to innovate and improve their employees' health.   I am also very pleased to see that the PHIT Act was included in this  package. I strongly support adding more of an emphasis on exercise and  wellness to build a healthy American population.   We spend an incredible amount of money on healthcare but very little  on maintenance, like exercise and wellness, before we get sick. The  PHIT Act will better incentivize healthy lifestyles.   Mr. Speaker, we are trying to improve healthcare for all Americans.  [[Page H7656]]  This means giving consumers a choice in their healthcare by  incentivizing wellness and exercise. This is a preemptive effort to  build a healthier, stronger America and the freedom to design insurance  products that work best for them.   If you want to keep healthcare costs down, let's just make sure  people are healthier. That is the best way to do it.   And do you know what? I really like this debate because we talk about  how the deficit has grown. And for my colleagues on the other side, I  wasn't here at the time, but I watched the deficit grow in the  beginning of the Obama administration from $9 trillion to $20 trillion,  and I am glad that, finally, somebody has awakened to the fact that we  are working with huge deficits.   Now, this bill was passed by the Ways and Means Committee in a  bipartisan fashion, and I want to thank my friend Earl Blumenauer for  working on this issue.   This issue is extremely important for the 175 million Americans who  get their health insurance from their employer. I strongly urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of H.R. 6199.
