 Mr. President, I wanted to come down to the Senate  floor for a couple reasons, but first I want to talk a little bit about  what happened in Alaska last weekend--actually, a really important  meeting between the United States and China, our senior diplomats,  their senior diplomats. It took place in Anchorage, and let's just say  the meeting was as frosty as the Alaska air.   It was a tough meeting. The Chinese came out, kind of took a little  advantage of being extra verbose in their opening statements, going  against the 2-minute, agreed-upon time limit.   It was a bit of a tongue-lashing, I think, of the U.S. team, our  Secretary of State, Tony Blinken. I think our team pushed back  appropriately--the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan; Kurt  Campbell, who also works at the National Security Council. But this was  the first face-to-face meeting between the United States and Chinese  diplomats with the Biden administration.   What we saw was a very confident China, a very aggressive China that  showed up in Alaska. For example, they were talking about ``Chinese- style democracy.'' We also know that as a dictatorship.   Earth to the Chinese Communist Party: There is no democracy in China.  You run an authoritarian regime, so don't try to fool anybody. It is a  dictatorship, not a democracy.   But the bigger issue is this: Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist  Party clearly believe that it is rising, that its rise for this century  is unstoppable, and that the United States--and the West but  particularly the United States, our country--is declining and there is  nothing we can do to stop this. They say this in private. They say it  in public. And they believe it. They are confident to the point of  being cocky, as we saw in Alaska, to the point of calling their  dictatorship a democracy, which, of course, it isn't.   Now, my view--and I think it is the view of every Senator here; I  certainly hope it is; I think it is--is that it is never a good idea to  bet against the United States. Every major power in the world that has  done so has lost that bet. That is a fact, but we clearly have work to  do. We have a lot of work to do as it relates to this challenge.   I have been coming to the Senate floor for the last 6 years talking  about this issue, talking about this challenge, talking about some of  the things that we need to do to address the biggest U.S. strategic  challenge for this century. It is the rise of China.   Now we have a new administration in power, and it was clear from the  Alaska meeting that the Chinese Communist Party plans to aggressively  challenge the Biden administration.   Now, I have a lot of disagreements already with the Biden  administration, especially the way in which they are treating my State.  I have been speaking on the Senat floor--eight Executive orders focused  on Alaska, shutting down our economy, killing jobs. And I will fight  them hard on this. But, on China, I believe it is imperative that we  all work together, not as Democrats and Republicans but as Americans,  as we have done when other major powers have threatened the United  States.    The Communist Party of China clearly sees one of our major weaknesses  as our political divisions. They write about it. It is in all the  intel. They talk about it. Look, we are a democracy. We are  transparent, unlike them. Our political divisions are on full display.  You see them tonight. By the  [[Page S1780]]  way, we have had political divisions since the founding of the  Republic.   China doesn't share their political divisions with the world, but  they have them, no doubt about it. But here is a fact. Here is a fact,  and we all need to know this. Every American needs to know this. Xi  Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party's worst nightmare is seeing a  determined, long-term, bipartisan, strong U.S. strategy to deal with  the rise of China, to deal with the rise of China for what they are:  our No. 1 geostrategic challenge for this century. That is why we need  to work together on this issue. It is something I have been calling for  for a long time. And here is the good news: It is something that is  starting to happen. It is something that is starting to happen.   Now, I had a good opportunity to meet with Secretary Blinken, to meet  with National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and his top China national  security official, Kurt Campbell, when they were in Alaska. I also was  able to get a good debrief from Secretary Austin about his visits in  Asia, particularly in India.   The Secretary of State and the National Security Advisor talk about  dealing with China from what they call positions or situations of  strength--situations of strength. They actually took that term from  former Secretary of State Dean Acheson when he was doing something that  they are currently trying to do now: putting together a coalition, a  long-term strategy, in 1947, 1948, 1949 to deal with the Soviet Union,  and they did it with Democrats and Republicans. NATO, the strategy of  containment--these were all things that came together in this body.   So I want to talk very briefly about some of these positions of  strength that the administration is trying to put together as it  relates to China, and I think it is in our interest to help them.   First of all, I think it was important and, of course, as an Alaska  Senator, I was glad that meeting took place in Anchorage, but it was  also a symbol. One of the things that the Chinese Communist Party  frequently states--Xi Jinping frequently states it--is that Asia should  be for Asians. The subtext of that is, we are trying to kick the United  States out of Asia.   Well, here is more news for the Chinese, for the Communist Party of  China: We are an Asian nation. We have been an Asian nation for  centuries. My hometown of Anchorage, where this meeting took place, is  closer to Tokyo than it is to this city, Washington, DC. The Aleutian  Island chain goes to the other side of the international dateline. We  are an Asian nation. We are not leaving. We have been there 200 years;  we will be there 200, 300, 500 more.   So that is No. 1, and I am glad they held the meeting in Alaska for  that reason, on American soil, and they chose to do that purposely. But  let me talk about a couple of other positions of strength that I think  it is incumbent upon us to try to help this administration with, help  our country with. Some are going to be up to the Senate and the House.  A lot more are going to be up to the President and his team. Where we  can influence it, we should.   As I mentioned, politically being unified on issues that relate to  China is exactly what the Chinese Communist Party fears the most, and  it is starting to happen. Legislation to outcompete China  economically--critical, critical. The more that we can do that, the  more that we can show we are united, the more important what we do here  is going to matter in the long-term competition with regard to China.   Let me give another one. Allies. Allies. The United States is an  ally-rich nation. China is an ally-poor country. They have very few  allies: maybe North Korea; Russia maybe, maybe not. China doesn't  really have allies; they have customers.   We have a network, and it is one of our most important strategic  advantages. We need to build upon that network of allies, deepen it,  expand it. And I will give the administration a lot of credit for  setting this up in an important way for their first meeting, the  leaders of the quad.   The quad is the United States, Japan, Australia, and India, started  by President George W. Bush, taken to another level by President Trump,  and taken to a really high level by President Biden, the leader level.  It was a really smart move. The quad can help anchor our alliances in  the region in a critical way. Three of the four biggest economies in  the world are part of the quad. Some of the best militaries in the  world are part of the quad. So to have that meeting, even though it was  virtual, with the leaders--the President, Prime Ministers--of the quad  was smart and something I think they should be commended on. Then to  have the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense go to Korea,  go to Japan; continue on, the Secretary of Defense, to India--also very  smart.   The Chinese know this is a huge weakness of theirs, and it is a huge  strength of ours. As Senators, the more that we can do to encourage  this on our own, go to these countries, reinforce the importance of  these alliances--it is clearly a position of strength that the  administration is off to a good start with.   Let me give another one, a position of strength. Our military. Our  military. This is going to be pretty simple. If we see dramatic cuts to  our military--and right now the Biden administration is debating this.  There is a real fight going on internally: Where is the budget going to  be? We can't see cuts.   The second term of the Obama-Biden administration cut defense  spending by 25 percent. They gutted readiness. The Chinese and the  Russians were applauding that whole period. We have worked hard to  build that up under the Trump administration and Republican Senate.  They need to keep it going.   And here is going to be a test. Last year in the NDAA, we put in the  Defense bill a bipartisan piece of legislation called the Pacific  Deterrence Initiative. The admiral in charge of the INDOPACOM region  testified in front of the Armed Services Committee very recently. His  replacement testified yesterday. All of them said we need to fully fund  the Pacific Deterrence Initiative--a bipartisan part of the Defense  bill last year--and $4.6 billion is what they think we need to reorder  the balance, particularly in the area of the Taiwan Strait. That is  public.   The administration is debating this right now. They need to fund it.  This body will approve it. That is going to be a position of strength  that is up to them, but people are watching. We are watching, our  allies are watching, and, of course, the Chinese Communist Party is  watching.   Let me give one more, one more that I think is critical: taking  advantage of America's resources, critical minerals: Yes, energy; yes,  natural gas; yes, oil. Prior to the pandemic, we were the world's  energy superpower, largest producer of oil in the world, largest  producer of natural gas in the world, largest producer of renewables in  the world.   This is a good thing for our country. Our allies in the region know  it; the Chinese know it. And again, there is a debate within the  administration right now on energy.   The President has recently told some of our great Union leaders he is  ``all in for natural gas.'' We should do that. That is the reason we  reduced greenhouse gas emissions over the last 15 years, more than any  other country--big country--in the world because of the revolution of  natural gas. Our allies need that. They know it is a national security  strength that we have.   On the other hand, we have other elements in the administration that  clearly want to unilaterally give away our energy comparative  advantage, restrict production of oil and gas. It makes no sense.   So energy, energy is another position of strength that we should be  encouraging, and I certainly am encouraging the Biden administration to  recognize it as something good for our economy, good for jobs and, yes,  really good for our national security and really important in our  competition with China. The Biden administration national security team  knows this. I think they recognize it. But again, we will be watching.  It is important.   This is going to be an issue that we are going to be focused on here  in the U.S. Senate, in my view, for the next 50 to 100 years, if we are  doing it right. If we work together, if we work from positions of  strength, as the Secretary of State and National Security Advisor have  mentioned, are focused on, the way this is going to end is the way it  ended with other major powers that  [[Page S1781]]  have challenged the United States. I am very confident of that, and I  think most of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are. We need to  get working together on that.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is not Thursday yet, but it is almost  Thursday, and that is when I love to come down to the floor of the U.S.  Senate to recognize an Alaskan who is doing something great for our  State. And as many know here, we call this person our Alaskan of the  Week.   Now, it is one of my favorite times of the week. I know that a couple  of Hill watchers like it too. I want to give a shout-out to Chris  Cioffi from Roll Call. He actually did a piece in Roll Call today about  the ``Alaskan of the Week'' series. So thank you, Chris. I hope you are  watching. It is a little late, and it is not Thursday. But anyway, I  appreciate the shout-out in your series today.   I am going to get to the punch. Our Alaskan of the Week tonight, this  week, is Rod Boyce, a friend of mine, a former longtime editor of one  of my favorite--actually, it is my favorite newspaper in Alaska, the  Fairbanks Daily News-Miner. He clearly is deserving of this great,  important award.   But before I talk about Rod, let me give you a little update about  what is going on in the State. First, some good news, something we are  all very proud of in Alaska. The economy is hurting; we are not proud  of that. But in terms of the pandemic, the health elements, our State  continues to be the No. 1 State vaccinated per capita of any State in  the country. This is a minimiracle, by the way, because we are a really  big State, and we are really spread out, a really small population. And  yet, the Federal Government, Tribal healthcare system, VA, State of  Alaska, everybody coming together is making it happen.   About 3 weeks ago, we announced that anyone over 16 could get a  vaccine. And some communities are hitting 60, 70 percent vaccinated  already in Alaska. Really important. We are opening up. If you are  watching, and you don't live in Alaska, come visit. It is going to be  safe, but we are very proud of that accomplishment because it has taken  a lot of work.   Of course, it is cold in Alaska, but the Sun has been shining. The  snow has been amazing. We have had a lot of it recently. The spirits  are up. We have an Iditarod winner. Congratulations to Dallas Seavey on  your fifth Iditarod win. Incredible, incredible.   You know, some may take issue with the claim that Alaska is the most  unique State in the Union, but consider this: Every year, teams of  mushers and their dogs barrel hundreds of miles across the State toward  the city of Nome, in some of the harshest conditions, rugged conditions  on the planet Earth.   Certainly, these are the kind of events that we think make Alaska  unique and a big sense of community. I have said it before: Alaska  isn't always the easiest place to live. It is far from the lower 48.  The weather can be extreme, very tough. But as a result, the people and  communities bond, and they work together, particularly in some of our  most remote communities. We are one big community in the great State of  Alaska, as my colleague from Nebraska knows.   Every community in Alaska, in America, needs to be able to share  reliable, credible information. On that topic, of course, there has  been a lot of negative attention in the past couple of years paid to  some in the national media, particularly in the last few years. But the  vital role, the vital role of local journalism and how that role that  plays in different communities across our country, in my view, hasn't  had nearly enough attention, and it is a positive role, our local  reporters.   So our Alaskan of the Week, Rod Boyce, who, until just a few weeks  ago was the longtime editor of the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner, spent  nearly his entire career, 35 years, ensuring that Alaskans stayed  connected through local news.   Now, Rod himself hasn't made huge headlines in the State. As a matter  of fact, that is one of the reasons for the Alaskan of the Week, to do  a shout-out to someone wh has not gotten a lot of recognition. The only  time Rod has gotten a lot of headlines was one instance of a mushing  mishap. I am going to talk briefly about that. But as an old-school  newsman, he liked to stay behind the headlines, behind the scenes.    But he has been behind the scenes of so many of those headlines in  our State. For years, he worked tirelessly--first at papers across the  State and then for 27 years at the News-Miner--to keep the great  community of Fairbanks and North Pole, AK, the interior part of our  State, connected and informed.   So here is a little bit about Rod. Born in London, England--I have  known Rod for many years, but I did not know that fact. Born in London,  England, his family moved to Southern California in the 1960s. His  father designed and engineered refineries. And Rod's father and his  wife--Rod's mom--raised both him and his sister.   He wasn't sure what he wanted to do in life, but he was inspired by a  trip he took to England early in his college career, came back with a  camera that he actually found on a bench in the Heathrow Airport. It is  an interesting detail. And he found his calling in journalism. He was  the editor of the school newspaper at Humboldt State University and did  some stints at small papers, landed at the Sacramento Union--the oldest  paper in the West, by the way--one that Mark Twain used to write for.  It was his first experience with a good old-fashioned newspaper war.  The younger, afternoon paper, the Sacramento Bee, decided to take on  the establishment Sacramento Union. Eventually, the Bee won. But by  then, Rod had made his way to the great State of Alaska to enter  another, even bigger newspaper war: the Anchorage Times, the  established paper, versus the upstart Anchorage Daily News.   Any person in news in Alaska who has been around a while will talk  about that newspaper war with something of awe in their voice. Both  papers then were fully staffed up, at least 30 reporters each, bureaus  all across the State, even bureaus here in DC, pre-social media days,  pre-Twitter days. Reporters spent their days on the streets, knocking  on doors, stealing each other's scoops. It was called shoe leather  reporting, and some great journalism in Alaska emerged.   Eventually, the upstart, the young Anchorage Daily News--still  around--won the war. So Rod was on the losing team. He began to work  for a small chain of six or seven rural papers called Alaska  Newspapers, Inc. It was here that Rod got his first glimpse of rural  Alaska. He learned about fisheries issues, ate his first piece of  muktuk. That is whale blubber. He experienced the beauty and became  aware of the heartbreak of rural Alaska, the true spiritual soul of our  State, one of the spiritual souls of America, I would argue.   After a few years with Alaska newspapers, he took the job that he has  been so good at for almost three decades, editor of the Fairbanks Daily  News-Miner, which is my wonderful wife Julie's hometown. It is the  first city I lived in with Julie and our brandnew daughter of ours,  Meghan, and, of course, I can still consider the News-Miner to be my  hometown newspaper.   As I mentioned, Rod was an editor for 27 years for this great  interior Alaska paper. The News-Miner is small but mighty in Alaska,  punching way above its weight, winning numerous journalism awards,  breaking important stories on health crises, injustice, scandals,  economic opportunities, everyday stories about everyday people, the  kind of stories that draw us together as communities.   As Rod said, ``It's not just national journalism that matters. Local  journalism matters [too].''   To that end, it was his policy, until he just retired a couple of  weeks ago, to have at least 95 percent of the front page of the News- Miner devoted to local news. That is a great idea.   So many Alaskans have interests, hobbies, lifestyles that many here  in the lower 48 just don't understand, Rod included. For many years, he  spent his days in the newsroom and his evenings and weekends mushing  dogs. And he still mushes. He loves it. It is a family affair. He and  his wife Julie used to put their daughter, Edie, in a sled when she was  just in diapers. And Edie is still doing it. The most dogs they have  ever  [[Page S1782]]  had now is 27. It is down to 18. This is hard work. It is tons of work.  My wife Julie and her family also raised sled dogs. It is really hard  work, particularly in the cold, interior Alaska winters. And it is also  dangerous, as Rod can attest.   In 2000, when competing for the first time in the 200-mile Tustumena  200 Sled Dog Race on the Kenai Peninsula, he took a wrong turn. It was  snowing hard. It was difficult to see. The trail got obliterated. And  he couldn't figure out how to get back on the trail. So he staked his  dogs and hunkered down on a ridge to build camp. He had some candy,  Reese's Pieces, dried lamb for the dogs. He had a cooker, thermos, some  fuel, some twigs. He had bunny boots, fortunately, but not a parka.   He spent his days exploring, going as far as he dared to try to find  the trail at night. At night, he could hear the helicopters above,  looking for Rod, but they couldn't see him through the cloud cover.   What was going on turned out to be one of the largest land search and  rescue missions in Alaska history, trying to find Rod Boyce, the  intrepid editor of the News-Miner. But he didn't know that. He just  knew that his days were ticking away. Rod's wife Julie was worried  sick, of course, but kept it together throughout. On the sixth day-- sixth day--almost a week, when the sky cleared, he headed out again and  a snow machine came his way. ``I think I am the guy you're looking  for,'' he told the driver, Ron Poston. Ron gave him a candy bar and a  ride to safety.    That night, he and his wife celebrated with a beer and a  cheeseburger. His feet were in bad shape, but otherwise he was  unharmed. When he made it back to the newsroom, his fellow reporters  put up markers that led from his parking space into the building in  case he got lost again. He thought it was pretty funny.   On January 22, Rod Boyce left the News-Miner to take a job as a  science writer and public information officer at the very cool and  esteemed Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.  He spends his days now writing about Tsunamis and the skies and the  heavens. He said:         It is a nerd's dream . . . I had a good 35-year run in       newspapers and was very fortunate to experience the things       that I did and interact with all sorts of public officials       and regular folks on the street. I got to see them at their       highs and lows, their tragedies and their happiest moments.    He still has hopes for local news. ``A local news outlet can tie a  local community together and that is super important. I hope that never  changes,'' said Rod.   Me, too, Rod. Here is to local journalism. Here is to the mighty  Fairbanks News-Miner, and here is to Rod Boyce. Thank you for being the  guy behind the headlines all these many years. Thank you for keeping  our communities and interior connected, and congratulations on perhaps  one of the biggest awards you have ever received, our Alaskan of the  Week.   I yield the floor.
