 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to ask the House to  pass my amendment to pull the funding for the war in Ukraine.   I am the proud daughter of a Navy combat veteran who served in the  Vietnam war. I am also a grateful American for the freedoms I have the  great honor to possess, and I fully respect our country's brave men and  women who have fought and those that died so that Americans can be  free.   I believe that in order to achieve world peace, America must have the  strongest military in the world but only cautiously use our tremendous  force when our national security is threatened.   In recent years, we have seen our great military and those who serve  our country be used too often for the defense of foreign nations, and  we have far too many veterans today who suffer physically and mentally  from the foreign wars they were sent to fight. We have seen too many  American flag-draped caskets return home to grieving families.   While our troops are not yet on the ground in Ukraine, fighting to  defend another country's border that is not our own, most Americans  fear that could soon be the case because they know Washington's  bloodlust for war is an addiction that seems almost impossible to be  undone.   While Americans struggle with the record-high inflation caused by  failed government policies, many hardworking Americans can barely pay  their bills. After decades of America-last policies that have built up  other countries' economies while destroying American manufacturing,  sending our jobs overseas, and crippling the middle class, creating the  massive divide between the rich and the poor, Americans no longer want  to pay for and go fight Washington's forever foreign wars.   Yet, disconnected from the will of Americans just over a year ago,  Congress voted to send $113 billion to Ukraine, a sum of money that is  approximately 10 times the cost of building our own border wall. Today,  we are debating the National Defense Authorization Act that contains  even more money to be sent to Ukraine while the $113 billion already  authorized has not yet even been spent.   The amendment I am offering today will pull the $300 million in  funding to Ukraine from the National Defense Authorization Act.   The National Defense Authorization Act is one of the most important  funding bills that Congress passes year after year. This is the funding  of our Nation's defense. This is the funding for the Department of  Defense. This is the funding for the good men and women who serve in  our military.                                time  1515    The Department of Defense's website makes its mission clear. It says  that its mission is to deter war and protect our Nation's national  security.   With the Department of Defense mission being very clear in stating  what the mission is, no money funding and fueling the Ukraine war  belongs in our National Defense Authorization Act because this is for  our Nation, not for another nation, not for Ukraine. Ukraine is not the  51st State.   Sending money to fund a war in a foreign country does not deter war,  it continues it. It causes it. It enables it and it allows it. Sending  money to fund a war in a foreign country against a nuclear-armed nation  does not protect our national security, it endangers our national  security. It endangers every single American. It endangers the entire  world. We do not want World War III.   I rise today to encourage all of my colleagues to consider that they  can pass another funding bill to fund money going to Ukraine without it  being in our National Defense Authorization Act. I ask my colleagues  and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I again remind Congress that  Ukraine is not the 51st State of America. This is not a NATO ally, and  this is our National Defense Authorization Act, for our Nation, for the  United States of America with 50 States.   I would also like to remind Congress that the Department of Defense  has failed its audit every single year, year over year. Last year  alone, they could not account for over 61 percent of their assets.   The Department of Defense is not doing a good job with the money that  Congress allows for it to have for our Nation's defense, and I think  that it is important, again, for everyone in Congress to realize the  American people don't work hard every single day to pay for other  countries' borders to be defended. They want our border defended.   We have 300 Americans dying every single day from fentanyl poisoning  that is coming from China and the Mexican cartels. If our Department of  Defense wants to defend America, we should be defending our border and  not proclaiming our righteousness talking about a war in Ukraine.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to address the House  about our National Defense Authorization Act. I want to remind the  House that the National Defense Authorization Act is to fund the  Department of Defense, whose mission is stated on their website. That  says that their mission is to deter war and protect our Nation's  national security interests.   My amendment is to stop cluster munitions or cluster munitions  technology from being sold or transferred to Ukraine. Cluster bombs are  brutal and inhumane weapons that cause lasting harm to civilians in  areas where they are used.   When a cluster bomb is deployed, it launches multiple different  submunitions, which are smaller bombs, in all different directions. The  impact radius of cluster bombs varies but can be as high as several  football fields. This causes more widespread destruction, imposing a  greater risk to civilian areas, which kills lives. It doesn't save  lives.   Also, this is an escalation in war. It doesn't deter war.   The dud rate varies per bomb, and the dud rate is very important.  They can typically be anywhere between 2 percent and as high as 40  percent. These bombs are very unreliable, which makes them very  dangerous.   Congress even passed a law in 2009 that says the U.S. cannot deploy  or transfer cluster munitions with a dud rate higher than 1 percent,  but the President can sign a waiver to bypass this restriction.   The Biden administration says that they will not deliver cluster  bombs to Ukraine with a dud rate higher than 2.35 percent. Again, the  dud rate is known to be anywhere between 2 percent and as high as 40  percent, which means we do not know.   Also, over 120 countries are party to the Convention on Cluster  Munitions banning the use, production, transfer, and stockpiling of  these weapons, including most of the U.S.'s NATO allies, which is  extremely important. I remind the House that Ukraine is not a NATO  member nation.   What is next? Chemical or biological weapons? Nuclear weapons?   Again, this is an escalation of war that does not belong in our  Nation's funding bill for the Department of Defense.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Jacobs).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Mr. Chair, I urge the House to pass this  amendment. Our National Defense Authorization Act is for the funding of  the Department of Defense. It is for our Nation, for the United States  of America, and there should be no funding for a foreign war. There  should be no weapons sent that increase war.   As a matter of fact, it leaves bombs behind for generations to come.  That hurts the Ukrainian people.   For anyone to say that this must be done to help the Ukrainian people  doesn't care about the innocent Ukrainian lives that will be killed for  years to come from these cluster munitions.   Mr. Chair, I urge the House to pass my amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
