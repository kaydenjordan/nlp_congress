 Mr. President, since President Biden took office just a  little over 2 years ago, more than 348,000 unaccompanied children have  crossed our southern border. To be clear, these 348,000 children did  not arrive in the United States by themselves. Children often make this  dangerous journey with friends, neighbors, or other relatives, and, of  course, in the custody of transnational criminal organizations--or what  are otherwise known as coyotes--that get paid to smuggle people into  our country.   The sad reality is that many of these children come to the country in  the care of these cartels, human smugglers, coyotes. Parents pay  smugglers thousands of dollars to bring their child to the United  States, but the truth is, the money doesn't guarantee their safety. The  journey to the southern border is not easy or safe. Children are  subjected to violence, exploitation, and sexual abuse on the way to the  United States. Why in the world would anybody think, if I turn my child  over to a criminal organization that will smuggle them into the United  States--how in the world would they ever have the confidence that they  would be safely transported here? So it, sadly, is not surprising.   As folks along the southern border in our border communities in Texas  will tell you, trying to help these migrant children when they get here  is no small task. There are laws that spell out how long a child can  remain in custody, as well as the resources they must receive, things  like, of course, food, water, medical care, and adequate supervision.  And I believe we do have a responsibility, once those children get to  our border and into our custody, to make sure they are safe and well  cared for.   Given the huge number of children crossing the border every week due  to the administration's open border policies, that job--caring for  these unaccompanied children--has gotten nothing but more difficult,  and we have seen the harrowing consequences.   At the start of the Biden administration, holding cells in detention  facilities were lined with children and other teens sleeping on gym  mats, with only a thin aluminum blanket to keep them warm. Thousands of  children were stuck in Border Patrol facilities, which were never  designed to hold children in the first place, but many were detained  out of necessity beyond the 72-hour limit contained in the law at  massive public facilities like the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio.  These were used as emergency shelters because there was nowhere else to  put them.   But, unfortunately, most of the public lost interest in these  children after that point. Certainly, the Biden administration appears  to have lost interest in these children once they made it past the  border and were released from these various detention facilities,  because once children were placed with sponsors in the United States,  save for a couple of isolated reports that should have served as  warning beacons, Congress and the public didn't have any information  about how they were doing, whether they were healthy, whether they were  being treated appropriately--anything about their well-being.   Well, that information deficit was recently filled by an  investigative story by the New York Times. In February, the Times  published its first story detailing the widespread child exploitation  of migrant children. It includes stories of unaccompanied migrants who  were working in dangerous jobs that violate child labor laws--for  example, a 15-year-old girl who packages cereal at night in a factory;  a 14-year-old boy who works on a construction job instead of going to  school; a 13-year-old child day laborer; children working in meat  processing plants, commercial bakeries, and for suppliers for  automakers. This is all documented in the investigative report by the  New York Times. We aren't talking about part-time gigs after going to  school; these are grueling and dangerous full-time jobs that are meant  for adults, not children.   So the big question is how they got there. How on Earth did the Biden  administration allow so many vulnerable children to be exploited? After  all, the  [[Page S1282]]  administration should have been aware of the history of migrant  children being exploited by their sponsors.   In 2014, the Office of Refugee Resettlement placed eight children  with members of a human trafficking ring who posed as family or  friends. These children were forced to work on an egg farm in Ohio with  no pay for 12 hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week. They lived in deplorable  conditions and were threatened with violence unless they complied. It  was a disgusting and heartbreaking case of abuse that rightfully  garnered a lot of attention. Given the sheer volume of cases the Biden  administration has managed the last 2 years, it should have been on  alert for similar stories and similar cases.    The percentage of sponsored children who could not be reached a month  after their release increased from 20 percent in 2020 to 34 percent in  2021.   Let me say that again. These children are supposed to be placed with  sponsors checked out by the administration, by Health and Human  Services, but in 2020, 20 percent of those children were unaccounted  for 1 month later, and in 2021, it was 34 percent.   Unfortunately, these warning signs went ignored, and the Biden  administration did nothing to try to correct the problem.   As the Biden border emergency crisis ramped up, emergency shelters  were filling up, and the administration had a major public relations  problem on its hands. Its top priority wasn't, apparently, the safety  of these children but the speed at which they could be moved from the  border to sponsors, with no followup.   The Biden administration wanted to get these children out of the  shelters and into the care of these sponsors as quickly as possible. To  make that possible, Health and Human Services loosened vetting  requirements and urged case managers to move faster, with little regard  for the danger that was created for these migrant children.   In a staff meeting last September, Secretary Becerra reportedly told  employees:         If Henry Ford had seen this in his plants, he would never       have become famous and rich. That is not the way you do an       assembly line.    This is the Secretary of Health and Human Services, a person who is  leading the Agency that is meant to care for these children, and he is  telling his employees to create a manufacturing assembly line. He  deliberately pushed for speed, speed, and more speed because of the  public relations problems that the administration was experiencing.   Just 1 year earlier, during Secretary Becerra's tenure, nearly a  dozen managers from the Office of Refugee Resettlement sent a memo  expressing their concerns about labor trafficking--exactly the problem  the New York Times investigation exposed. They said they feared that  the Office had come to reward speed over safety. But apparently nothing  changed.   Earlier this week, the New York Times published yet another story  with even more details on the administration's failure to protect  migrant children. One of the most startling revelations was the sheer  scale of the crisis.   This chart shows the number of calls to Health and Human Services  each month reporting trafficking, neglect, or abuse of migrant children  who have been placed with sponsors by the U.S. Government--specifically  by the Biden administration's Health and Human Services Department. As  you can see, the Department was receiving fewer than 50 calls a month  back in 2018, but that number climbed in 2019 and 2020, and starting in  2021, the number of calls skyrocketed. And of course these weren't just  cases in which somebody spotted abuse and spoke up. We have no idea how  many cases went unreported. But it has become breathtakingly clear that  this widespread abuse wasn't caused by missteps; it was a result of  intentional policy decisions from top administration officials.   As it turns out, the White House and Federal Agencies were alerted  again and again that these children were at risk and did nothing.   In 2021, the most senior career member of the Office of Refugee  Resettlement sent an email to her bosses warning them that children  were likely to be placed in dangerous situations. When her warning was  ignored, she filed a complaint and requested whistleblower protection.  Not long after, she was moved out of her position. She then filed  another complaint arguing that she was retaliated against--a move that  is against the law.   Sadly, this is not an isolated event. Within Health and Human  Services, at least five staffers have filed complaints and said they  were pushed out of their jobs for sharing concerns with their  leadership about this extraordinary crisis of abuse or neglect.   Well, the Labor Department was aware of child labor violations too.  Last year, investigators identified major instances of child labor  violations that took place in auto parts factories and meatpacking  plants. As they continued to uncover more and more cases of migrant  children being exploited, the Department shared its concerns with the  White House. Former Labor Secretary Marty Walsh confirmed that the  Department included details about these situations in its weekly  reports to the White House, so the White House was clearly informed  about these issues. In December, the Labor Department even released a  public report showing a 69-percent increase in child labor violations  since 2018.   Well, miraculously, the White House now claims to have no knowledge  of this disturbing trend. Susan Rice, who serves as Director of the  White House Domestic Policy Council, which oversees virtually every  aspect of domestic policy affairs, claims no knowledge of this problem.   We know that when the border crisis reached its fever pitch during  the summer of 2021, Ms. Rice's team received a memo from Health and  Human Services' managers about labor trafficking. Two people confirmed  that Ms. Rice was told about the contents of the memo, but the White  House now disputes that claim.   Health and Human Services also provided the White House with frequent  updates on a group of children being exploited in Alabama, but the  White House now says senior officials were never made aware of this  situation.   Again and again, the Biden administration was told but failed to heed  the warnings of these migrant children being exploited.   And, now, after major investigative reporting has been done by the  New York Times, they refuse to accept responsibility and apologize.  Instead, they have decided the blame game is what they need to do. So  HHS blames the Labor Department for failing to enforce child labor  laws. The Labor Department says it shared information with HHS and the  White House, but they failed to respond. The White House blames both  Departments because, even though they passed along information about  potential abuse, they somehow didn't mark it as urgent.   Well, to state the obvious, the Biden administration shouldn't need  to be told that potential child exploitation is an urgent matter and  deserves attention. It is self-evident. Given the history of migrant  children being exploited and the massive scale of President Biden's  border crisis, the administration should have been on top of this from  the beginning. Clearly, they weren't, and they still aren't.  Ultimately, the children they claim to be helping are the ones paying a  terrible price.   As the New York Times makes clear, the Biden administration knew the  children were being exploited and willingly failed to act. It  repeatedly brushed aside warnings and continued to prioritize speed  over safety.   So the American people need to know: Is this an example of gross  negligence, of whistleblower chilling, or, just simply, a willful  violation of the law by the Biden administration?   Right now, the answer to all of those questions appears to be a big  and resounding yes.   We need answers from Secretary Becerra, the Secretary of Labor, and  Susan Rice on how this could possibly be allowed to happen and how it  could continue to happen as I speak. We need accountability, and we  need to see proof that there are changes being implemented to prevent  this from happening in the future.   Time and time again, the Biden administration has claimed that its  approach to the border and immigration is fair, orderly, and humane.  But there is nothing fair about putting children in the care of people  who will exploit them. There is nothing orderly about ignoring warnings  of child labor violations, and there is nothing humane  [[Page S1283]]  about the way migrant children are suffering in silence across America.   Every Member of this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats alike, should  be absolutely outraged by the Biden administration's abdication of  responsibility--of their obligation and our obligation--to protect  these migrant children.   I hope, now that the New York Times has detailed the abuses that are  occurring, that it will somehow finally get the attention of the Biden  White House, and they will finally take appropriate action to protect  these children they claim to be helping but who are, in fact, being  sacrificed to those who would exploit them and take advantage of them.
