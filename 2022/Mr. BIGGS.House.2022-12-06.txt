 Mr. Speaker, it is really an incredible thing to be here.  Before I came to Congress, I had heard of Louie Gohmert. I had no idea  that he would be a friend nor how iconoclastic he is. He is a one-of-a- kind American.   I have a volume of stories. I mean, the way he eats a doughnut, for  instance. We could talk about all of these things. I won't do that.   He is larger than life. He is a fearless conservative. He has been on  the front lines fearlessly fighting.      Thomas Massie was talking about his memory. It is copious. It is  encyclopedic. You can never go wrong with saying, ``Hey, Louie, what  happened here?'' Because he is going to know.   He has been a friend of the friendless and a champion who offers the  balm of Gilead to those who have a lost cause. He has just been an  iconoclastic individual. He is going to be missed terribly.   I tell you what, Louie, we are going to miss you, your personality,  your fun, your joie de vivre--that is French, Louie; you might not have  recognized that--your love of life, all the things that you brought to  us. But we are going to miss your guitar playing--a little bit, anyway.  We are really going to miss your ribs. I don't know if anybody else is  going to be able to smoke some ribs up on the balcony of the office  building over there. Maybe not. But we are sure going to miss them. We  are sure going to miss you, my friend. God bless you. Godspeed.
