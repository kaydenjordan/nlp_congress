 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for as much time as I may consume.    Mr. President, as we begin the markup--that is what we  are going to be starting on right away. We have already had an initial  meeting with the Senate Armed Services Committee on the National  Defense Authorization Act. I want to express my deep concern over the  continued malign behavior by the overtly hostile nation of North Korea.   I often talk to people, and they shake their heads in disbelief about  a country that is run by a mentally deranged individual who is rapidly  developing the capability of hitting the mainland United States with a  missile. I think it is important that we immediately get to our Defense  authorization bill, so we can start addressing this and many other  problems that we have.   It is important to us in the Senate to communicate to the American  people the incredibly grave situation we are facing right now in North  Korea. The Kim Jong Un regime has expressed a desire to destroy the  United States of America. Normally that wouldn't be a concern because  he wouldn't have the credibility, but right now we are seeing progress  being made in their technology and their ability to actually hit major  areas.   In April, North Korea's official newspaper relayed the threat of a  preemptive strike to ``completely and immediately wipe out not only  U.S. imperialists' invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding  areas but the U.S. mainland and reduce them to ashes.''   That is a threat--a threat that has come directly from the leader of  North Korea. This is the most recent in a long line of threats by that  individual.   In addition, North Korean leaders constantly threaten our friends and  allies in South Korea and Japan. These threats are not just hollow  words any longer. North Korea's capabilities are rapidly improving to  meet their long-stated intent.   We thought that Kim Jong Il was bad, but in 6 years, his son Kim Jong  Un has conducted as many as 75 ballistic missile tests. In comparison,  over a 17-year period, his father conducted about 30. In other words,  he has done over twice as many in a fraction of the time.   Additionally, Kim Jong Un has sped up North Korea's nuclear program  since taking power in 2011. North Korea's nuclear technology is  advancing at an alarming rate. For example, the bomb North Korea tested  in its most recent test last September was 10 times more powerful than  what the regime could have produced in 2006--10 times more.   At the same time, North Korea has actively worked on miniaturizing  nuclear weapons so that they can deliver by way of a ballistic missile.  Earlier this year, analysts detected activity at a North Korean nuclear  test site, indicating another nuclear test may be imminent.   Intelligence and military experts have repeatedly argued that it is  prudent to assume that North Korea has successfully miniaturized their  nuclear weapons. That means the only technology they need to conduct a  nuclear strike on the U.S. mainland--that is us; that is right here-- would be a functional intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM.   In January, Kim Jong Un said North Korea is in the ``final stage in  preparations.''   Let's make sure we understand what we are talking about. We know that  their capability is getting very close to it, and they have already  said that they would send something over to the mainland United States.   Unfortunately, when you talk to people in the real world, they can't  believe this could be true--that one guy who is mentally deranged could  be heading up a country that has the capability of blowing up an  American city. Yet we know this is going on right now.   Recently, in the Armed Services Committee--and I was in attendance at  that time--the Defense Intelligence Agency Director, Lt. Gen. Vincent  Stewart, told the Armed Services Committee: ``If left on its current  trajectory the [North Korean] regime will ultimately succeed in  fielding a nuclear-armed missile capable of threatening the United  States homeland.''   That is a direct quote by the guy who knows more about this than  anybody else. Lieutenant General Stewart added that ``the North Korean  regime is committed and is on a pathway where this capability is  inevitable.''   I will say that again. Our intelligence experts assessed that,  unchecked, North Korea will inevitably achieve the capability to strike  the U.S. homeland with a nuclear missile.  [[Page S3714]]    Even without the ICBM capability, the missiles we know they already  have can range U.S.--that means it can reach the United States-- military personnel and other citizens in South Korea, Japan, Guam, and  many other areas.   North Korea's known missile inventory now includes a missile that  North Korea successfully tested for the first time on May 14. That  missile represented a major breakthrough in North Korean ballistic  missile technology. The reports indicate the missile traveled over  1,300 miles at an altitude and successfully exited and then reentered  the Earth's atmosphere--a key requirement for nuclear capable ICBMs.   If fired at its maximum range, the missile could reach Guam. Though  the missile itself was not an ICBM, the technological breakthrough  demonstrates a significant advancement that North Korea has made in  their ballistic missile capability. This is actual. This is happening.  This is today. This is reality.   Another significant advancement that occurs to me is the solid- fueled, road-mobile missiles the regime is developing. Kim Jong Un has  successfully tested two such missiles already this year--one in  February and another last month on May 21.   Solid-fueled missiles mounted on mobile launch vehicles can be  prepared ahead of time. They can build up an inventory and come back  and use that inventory whenever they desire to do so.   What can we do? It is clear that North Korea does not respond to  international pressure. All of these ballistic missile tests violate  multiple U.N. resolutions. Yet North Korea carries them out, despite  sanctions and international condemnation. The normal type of  negotiation doesn't work with those guys. Furthermore, conventional  wisdom has led us to believe that China--North Korea's main trade  partner in that region--holds significant sway over the regime. That  conventional wisdom has been called into question recently. I commend  the Trump administration for recognizing this and for working with  China on this issue, but we can't assume that China will be able to  help us close the deal in a diplomatic way.    Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to take all appropriate steps to  defend ourselves from this threat that exists today. We have to keep in  mind that as we formulate this year's National Defense Authorization  Act--that is what I am talking about now--we have to do it. For 53  consecutive years, we have passed the Defense authorization bill, and  right now there is some doubt as to whether we will get enough  cooperation from those in this Chamber to make that happen again.   I remember 4 years ago, when I was ranking member on the Senate Armed  Services Committee, we didn't get this done until the latter part of  December. If you wait around until the latter part of December and it  passes midyear, we will have our soldiers over there not getting what  they need to be getting in the way of hazard pay and other things. It  would be an absolute disaster. Right now, they are watching us. Our  kids are over there watching us now to see what we will do with the  most important bill we pass every year.   We are going to get started. I applaud the President for the fiscal  year 2018 budget request that calls for increases to defense spending  and aims to fill critical readiness gaps. Right now, in Congress, we  need to build on that even further.   First, we need to bolster our national ballistic defense capabilities  to address the threats we face from North Korea. That is a no-brainer.  We all understand that. Since 2006, the Missile Defense Agency budget  has fallen 23 percent when adjusted for inflation. While we have taken  positive steps in recent years, we need to ensure our last-resort  defenses are airtight.   We should heed the recommendations of defense experts like Gen. Lori  Robinson, commander of the U.S. Northern Command, who testified in  April before our committee. I am quoting her now, Lori Robinson: ``As  adversaries continue to pursue credible and advanced capabilities, we,  too, must evolve our missile defense capabilities to outpace  increasingly complex threats.'' I think that is a recognition by her-- the one who probably knows more about it than anyone else--that we are  not keeping pace right now.   Simultaneously, we have to boost our military. Our forces are smaller  than the days of the hollow force. I chaired a committee not too long  ago that had the Vices of all four services. They all came in. The  conclusion was--even though some of them were not old enough to  remember, as I remember, the 1980s at the end of the Carter  administration, but they made the statement that we are in a situation  now that we have never been in before and that we are, in fact, a  hollow force, just as hollow as we were back in 1989 after the Carter  administration.   We really owe our brave service men and women better. We owe them an  obligation. It is our obligation to let them know what we are doing.  Our forces are smaller than the days of the hollow force in the 1980s.  Our equipment is aging, and our base infrastructure requires critical  maintenance and upgrades. We went through 8 years of the Obama  administration. We paid our price in not really giving our brave young  warriors the equipment they needed. Through this year's NDAA, we ought  to prioritize across the board end-strength increases and additional  investments in maintenance to fill gaps in existing formations and to  get our existing equipment back to par. The first thing that happens  when you are on a starvation diet is you let your maintenance and  modernization go. We have done that.   I hear people say defense spending is out of control. The truth is,  defense spending, as a proportion of total government spending, has  steadily decreased since World War II. How many people are aware that  in 1964, we spent 52 percent of our total resources on defending  America? Today, it is 15 percent. No one seems to care about it because  they don't know about it. Nonetheless, that is where we are today.   In the recent years, despite waging multiple wars and facing  unparalleled global threats, our spending has decreased to about 15  percent of our total spending. The Chief of Staff of the Army, General  Milley, said it best when it comes to funding our military. This is  really significant now when people are talking about spending too much.  He said:         The only thing more expensive than deterrence, is actually       fighting a war. And the only thing more expensive than       fighting a war, is fighting one and losing one . . . We're       expensive. We recognize that. But the bottom line is, it's an       investment that is worth every nickel.    So we have to immediately make up for the damage done by the years of  the dangerous defense cuts and recognize what the government is really  supposed to be doing. I refer to that old document nobody reads anymore  called the Constitution. You read that, and it tells us what we are  supposed to be doing here; No. 1, defending America; No. 2, they called  it post roads back then but infrastructure. That is what we are  actually supposed to be doing.   The good news is, under the leadership of President Trump, we have  already started that process working. The appropriations bill last  month stopped the decline in Army strength. Instead of the planned  460,000 Active soldiers, we now have 475,000. We added 1,000 marines, a  few hundred airmen. In total, we currently have 24,000 more  servicemembers than we would have had under the previous  administration.   More good news is that we have exceptional patriots like the airmen  at Tinker, Vance, and Altus Air Force Bases and those who are  protecting the skies with F-16s out of my city of Tulsa. Soldiers like  those in Fort Sill and in Oklahoma's 45th Infantry Brigade, who are  right now in Ukraine training our allies there.   People don't know that the policy we are following under this new  administration is, we are using our resources to help others train  themselves. In the case of Ukraine--what happened in Ukraine should  never have happened. Ukraine had this great parliamentary election. I  happened to be there at the time, about 4 years ago. For the first time  in 96 years, Ukraine doesn't have one Communist in its Parliament. They  did that because they love us. They love the West. Consequently, when  Putin came in right after that--this is back during the Obama  administration--he started killing the Ukrainians, who were seeking  their freedom--our best friends over there--and our administration  refused to let us even send defensive weapons over there.  [[Page S3715]]    We are correcting that. In fact, the bill we are talking about right  now, the Defense authorization bill, is one where we are going to be  addressing that problem.   I am optimistic we will rise to the occasion and meet the challenge  presented by the agnostic North Korean regime and confident President  Trump has taken the appropriate steps to address this threat  diplomatically. We, in Congress, need to follow his lead to ensure that  our men and women in uniform have the resources required to answer the  call quickly and effectively. We don't have the luxury of time. Just  think of the statement I read a minute ago, where Gen. Vincent Stewart  told the Armed Services Committee a week ago: ``If left on its current  trajectory the regime will ultimately succeed in fielding a nuclear- armed missile capable of threatening the United States homeland.''   While we have a lot of problems right now on this floor--and we are  trying to address these problems--the No. 1 problem is what is  happening to our military and the absolute necessity of getting a  defense authorization passed very rapidly. We are starting today.    I yield the floor.
