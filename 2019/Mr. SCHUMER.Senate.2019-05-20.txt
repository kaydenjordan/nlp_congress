 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we have two bits of sad news about long- time Senate employees.   David Miles Knight, a beloved barber in our barbershop and one of the  Senate's master barbers for the last 36 years, lost a lengthy battle  with cancer.   His most noticeable and notable trait was kindness--not just  friendliness but actual kindness--and a generosity of spirit. He was  always eager to ask about a customer's day or a colleague's weekend and  was just as eager to regale those folks with stories about his family-- of Joanne, his wife; of his three sons; of his eight grandchildren; and  of his two great-grandchildren. Dave's life was filled with these  people--his friends and his family.   I offer my prayers to them now--to Dave's family, his friends, and  his Senate family. He was considered a member of the Senate family and  had been here for decades. He was beloved. We miss him.   Berner Richard Johnson III, a staff member for 30 years, known to all  here as ``Bud,'' also passed away last night. He was a victim of a  violent crime last week in DC and recently succumbed to the injuries  this crime involved.   Bud was beloved by his Senate family, the softball team he coached,  and his many friends and family. I offer my prayers for Diane, his  partner; for Bo, his son; and for all who loved him and who will miss  him.   May the memory of these two men be a blessing to their loved ones and  a reminder to all of us that life is fleeting and to hold tight to  those we love.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on disaster relief, millions of Americans  have waited long enough for their government to provide relief in the  wake of recent natural disasters. We have 1 week left in this work  period. This is crunch time. It will be an awful conclusion to this  work period if we leave without passing a relief package. We must focus  on concluding our negotiations and reaching consensus on our final  legislation.   That is why I am alarmed by rumors that the Republican majority may  attach a simple extension of the Violence Against Women Act to the  disaster bill rather than to the new reform bill that was passed by a  huge bipartisan majority in the House. That is a formula for deadlock  when we pass it here and send it to the House, but they will not vote  for it.   Why do we have to load up the disaster bill with extraneous  provisions, especially those that might bring conflict?   We must be very careful not to allow this and other extraneous  provisions to get on the bill that have opposition from Members. It  would only imperil the success of bipartisan disaster relief. We have  come to a conclusion on Puerto Rico, and I am glad our Republican  friends have finally seen the light and have not treated Puerto Rico  unfairly so that we can move forward with all disaster relief.   The President sent over a proposal on the border, and we have sent  back a counter proposal with many of the things--but not all--that he  included. Some are objectionable. That is extraneous, but we might be  able to come to an agreement on that.   These other extraneous provisions? Our Republican leader has said  that he wants to get this done Thursday. Well, a surefire way of not  doing it is jamming the House, filling it up with provisions that would  not pass the House.   So let's all roll up our sleeves, get to work, refrain from our  desires to put other things on this must-pass bill, and get disaster  relief done. We Democrats will work in good faith to resolve all the  remaining issues. But before the week is out, let's get a bill we can  vote on. Let's deliver relief to disaster-stricken Americans and put an  end to what has been a needlessly partisan episode.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on women's health and a woman's right to  choose and the judges we are appointing, the past week marked a low  point for our country on the issue of women's reproductive rights.   While an overwhelming majority of Americans want to keep Roe v. Wade,  a total of 30 States have now sought to restrict the rights of women to  make their own healthcare decisions, and some would either directly or  virtually undo the Roe v. Wade decision. Alabama's Republicans have  passed the most extreme example--that is the one I was talking about-- but Republicans in Missouri and Texas are not far behind. And this is  not merely a few fringe politicians making a statement way out of the  mainstream; this is a systematic effort by Republicans in State  legislatures to restrict women's reproductive rights and ultimately  overturn Roe v. Wade, even though the vast majority of Americans don't  want that to happen.   Meanwhile, here in the Senate, Leader McConnell has lined up a  conveyor belt of far-right judges who have reprehensible records on  women's rights.   Last week, the Republican majority considered a judge, Kenneth Lee of  California. Here is what he said about sexism. He said it is  ``irrelevant pouting.'' Tell that to women who have been discriminated  against in so many different ways that we read about. How about Ms.  Wendy Vitter? All of our Republican friends voted to put this woman on  the bench. She once promoted the idea that contraceptives cause cancer  and claimed that Planned Parenthood kills 150,000 women a year. Both  were confirmed to lifetime appointments. It is incredible. These are  people way on the extreme--way on the extreme.   And here comes another one. The Senate is voting on yet another judge  with a horrendous record on women's rights--Mr. Daniel Collins,  nominated to the Ninth Circuit over the objection of both of his home  State Senators. He has defended the rights of pregnancy clinics to  withhold from their patients that they don't provide abortion services  and filed an amicus brief in support of the Hobby Lobby's petition to  deny its female employees contraceptive care. He is a longtime donor  and member of the Federalist Society, and he has ensconced himself in  one of the most anti-choice organizations in the entire country. Let's  make no mistake about it--to read some of the articles about the  Federalist Society, it was formed with the goal of curtailing women's  rights. Many of its advocates believe that Roe v. Wade should be  repealed.   Let me just call out my friends on the Republican side. When the  Alabama law came about, the vast majority of my friends on the other  side stayed silent about the extreme anti-abortion measure in Alabama  and some of the other States, and then some  [[Page S2954]]  said: We oppose what Alabama does. At the same time, they are  rubberstamping judges who would do the same thing--repeal Roe. There is  a direct contradiction here. There is hypocrisy. Republicans who say  they don't like the Alabama decision and then vote for judges who would  ratify and repeal Roe or cut back so dramatically on Roe that it hardly  exists are engaged in subterfuge. They say: Watch this hand. I am  saying that I am not that extreme. Don't watch this hand where I am  putting extreme judges on the bench who will do exactly what I say I am  opposed to.   It is outrageous. They will be caught. It is outrageous that they are  on the bench.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, on Huawei, there is positive  news about an administrative action. I am in full support of what the  Commerce Department did on Huawei, and I want to give a shout-out to  Google for joining in and urge all other American companies to join as  well. The administration issued an Executive order laying the  groundwork to ban the purchase of telecommunications equipment from  China's state-controlled firms. The decision, as I said, is having an  impact because of Google. We are waiting for other companies to join  in.   For years, China has prevented great American technology companies  like Google, Facebook, and so many others from operating in China. They  put barrier after barrier in the way because we are better, and they  know American firms would capture the Chinese market. They put barriers  in the way, they steal our technology and then develop it, and then  even try to sell it back here. It has happened with computers. It has  happened with so many other things that America and American know-how  developed.   Huawei is a national security concern. It is a Chinese company that  could pry into all of us. But it is also an excellent weapon to get  China to finally start treating us fairly, which they haven't done for  30 years. We have lost tens of millions of good-paying American jobs  and trillions of dollars because of what China has done to us. I have  to say that both Democratic and Republican administrations in the past  just sat there under some guise of free trade, which wasn't free or  fair at all. And now we have some weapons.   A lot of these folks--these pundits, these critics, these editorial  writers--say tariffs is the wrong way to go. Talking is the wrong way  to go. It got us nowhere. But one other way to go is reciprocity.   China, we are going to treat some of your companies the way you treat  our companies.   That is what we did with Huawei. It was the first time I have seen  something very strong. I hope the President doesn't back off. He did  with ZTE because President Xi asked him to. The head of China asked him  to.   Don't back off, Mr. President.   This is the right thing to do, and I have been advocating for  decades. I asked President Bush and President Obama to use reciprocity  as a tool to stop China. It is another tool in our toolkit and an  effective one.   If China won't let our most productive companies compete in its  markets, we shouldn't let China's state-driven companies compete in  ours. They get subsidies from the state.   We should not give Huawei--particularly Huawei, which is a security  concern as well--free reign in the United States. China has to learn  something. It has to open up its markets if it wants access to ours.  They talk about, oh, we are an affront to China because we are asking  for fairness? Give me a break. Give me a break. We know what fairness  is.   I believe the administration's decision to put pressure on China to  reform its economic policies was very smart, and I am really glad they  did it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1552         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
