 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I get into my remarks about the  impending action of the Senate with regard to the so-called nuclear  option, I would just point out that the attacks yesterday on innocent  men, women, and children should not have come as a surprise. It was in  2013 that the then-Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and the  head of the CIA recommended to the President that we arm the Free  Syrian Army and bring Bashar Assad's barbarity to a halt. The President  of the United States rejected that. Bashar Assad used chemical weapons,  and the President called me and Senator Graham over to the White House  and said: If they cross the redline, I am going to act. We are going to  degrade Bashar Assad and upgrade the Free Syrian Army and have regime  change.   Then, of course, he backed down. You know, there is one thing worse  than doing nothing: It is saying you are going to do something and then  not doing it. That sent a signal everywhere in the world, not just  Syria. The fact is, we knew it would happen again. So we have seen this  movie before. Unless we act, we are going to see it again.   I am encouraged, frankly, that General Mattis, General McMaster, and  the President of the United States have said that this act of  incredible barbarity and cruelty will not go unresponded to. But I can  assure my colleagues this: If we don't respond to this, then there will  be more use of these chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction,  and there will be more innocent people who will die.   Eight years of Obama's failure is what led to the events that just  took place that horrified all of us. That requires us to stand up to  this barbarity, help the Free Syrian Army, establish safe zones, and  make sure that Bashar Assad, propped up by the Russians and the  Iranians and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah, is no  longer able to perpetrate these war crimes on innocent men, women, and  children.   Mr. President, it is also with some sorrow that I regret having to  come to  [[Page S2308]]  the floor to speak once again on the issue of eliminating the 60-vote  threshold on judicial nominations, specifically a nominee to the U.S.  Supreme Court. It is particularly troubling to do so because the  nominee in question, Judge Neil Gorsuch, has impeccable legal  credentials and a strong reputation as a fair- and sharp-minded lawyer  and jurist. The American Bar Association and many others of all  political stripes agree that his distinguished career as a lawyer and a  jurist makes him well qualified for the position of Associate Justice  on the U.S. Supreme Court.   Regrettably, very regrettably, my colleagues in the minority have  decided to filibuster the nomination of this good, decent, highly  qualified man.   Numerous times over the years, the Senate has come to a standstill  over nominees, whether they were judicial or executive branch. That  gridlock has inevitably led to threats from the majority--whichever  party was in the majority--to use the ``nuclear option,'' basically  changing the rules of the Senate of 200 years to strip the minority  party of their right to filibuster certain nominees.   I have been privileged several times to be a part of a group of  Senators who were able to come together and negotiate agreements to end  the gridlock surrounding nominees, avert the nuclear option, and allow  the Senate to move forward with our work on behalf of the American  people. My work in these groups--often referred to as gangs--has won me  both praise and condemnation and has often put me at odds with some in  my own party.   In 2005, I joined 13 of my colleagues in an agreement that allowed  for votes on three of President Bush's judicial nominees who were being  filibustered by the Democrats, who were in the minority at the time.  Part of that agreement addressed future nominees. It stated:         Signatories will exercise their responsibilities under the       Advice and Consent Clause of the United States Constitution       in good faith. Nominees should only be filibustered under       extraordinary circumstances, and each signatory must use his       or her own discretion and judgment in determining whether       such circumstances exist.    In other words, if that nominee is so far out of the mainstream that  it is extraordinary, only then would they seek to block the nomination  and filibuster.   I have had conversations with colleagues on both sides of the aisle  in an attempt to once again come up with a way forward and avoid both a  filibuster of Judge Gorsuch and the nuclear option. Sadly, I learned on  Monday that those efforts had failed and that the Democrats had secured  the necessary votes to successfully filibuster the highly qualified  Supreme Court nominee for the first time in our history. In response,  the majority leader has indicated that he will move to change the  Senate rules and eliminate the ability of the minority to do so.   We are in a terrible place. My colleagues should understand that this  is a historic moment if we move forward with it.   In 2013, then-Majority Leader Harry Reid changed the Senate rules to  eliminate the 60-vote threshold on most judicial and executive branch  nominees. Those in my party, including me, were enraged--rightly so. We  warned that the Democrats would not be in control of the Senate or the  White House forever and that they would come to regret their actions.  We were right.    Their actions came back to haunt them. I believe our actions will  haunt us as well.   In an op-ed on November 27, 2012, Senator McConnell, knowing of the  Democrats' plans to change the Senate rules in their favor, wrote this:         A serious threat has been quietly gathering against one of       the most cherished safeguards of liberty in our government--      the right of a political minority to have a voice. Until now,       this has always been the defining characteristic of the       Senate. That's why all Senators have traditionally defended       the Senate as an institution, because they knew that the       Senate was the last legislative check for political       minorities and small states against the kind of raw exercise       of power large states and majority parties have always been       tempted to wield.        The threat I'm referring to is the effort by some       Democrats, most of whom have never served a day in the       minority, to force a change in the Senate rules.    How soon we forget.   In fact, Chairman Grassley exactly predicted what is about to happen.  In November 2013, he said:         Not too many years ago, my colleagues on the other side       described their fight to preserve the filibuster with great       pride. Today the other side is willing to forever change the       Senate because the Republicans have the audacity to hold       them, the majority party of today, to their own standard.        The silver lining is that there will come a day when roles       are reversed. When that happens, our side will likely       nominate and confirm lower court and Supreme Court nominees       with 51 votes regardless of whether the Democrats actually       buy into this fanciful notion that they can demolish the       filibuster on lower court nominees and still preserve it for       the Supreme Court.    Senator Alexander, on November 21, 2013, when threatened with the  nuclear option by the Democrats, said:         This action today creates a perpetual opportunity for the       tyranny of the majority because it permits a majority in this       body to do whatever it wants to do any time it wants to do       it.    Senator Alexander went on to say:         In my view, this is the most important and most dangerous       restructuring of Senate rules since Thomas Jefferson wrote       them at the beginning of our country.    On November 21, 2013, Senator Shelby said:         Democrats won't be in power in perpetuity. This is a       mistake--a big one for the long run. Maybe not for the short       run. Short-term gains, but I think it changes the Senate       tremendously in a bad way.    The same day, on the same issue, Senator Thune said:         I think Democrats are playing with fire. This is very       dangerous in terms of what it means for the Senate. What goes       around comes around. And someday, they're going to be in the       minority.    Senator Burr said on that same day:         The American people know what they get when the minority       party is stripped of its filibuster rights: they get       unchecked power by the executive branch.    He went on to say:         If sweeping legislation and lifetime appointments cannot       muster 60 votes in the United States Senate, then it probably       is not a good idea to force either on the American people.    My own colleagues on this side of the aisle need to remember our own  words and heed our own warnings. We will not control this body forever.  We will not hold the White House in perpetuity. What we are poised to  do at the end of this week will have tremendous consequences, and I  fear that someday, we will regret what we are about to do. In fact, I  am confident we will.   Having said that, it is hard for me to keep a straight face when I  hear the current righteous indignation coming from the other side.  After reading the comments some of my Democrat friends made in 2013, it  is difficult to have much sympathy for where they find themselves  today.   Senator Merkley, who was perhaps the biggest proponent of changing  the rules at that time, said this:         Without the nuclear option, Republicans are going to       disable the executive branch.        Ending the abusive filibuster on nominations is a big step       toward restoring the functionality of the Senate, and that       matters for all of us.        This is a terrific vote for the U.S. Senate.    Senator Udall said:         I'm just so encouraged now that we're going to be able to--      without filibusters--put people on the courts in an orderly       way.    Senator Warren said on November 13, 2013:         We need to call out these filibusters for what they are:       Naked attempts to nullify the results of the last election.        If Republicans continue to filibuster these highly       qualified nominees for no reason other than to nullify the       President's constitutional authority, then Senators not only       have the right to change the filibuster, Senators have a duty       to change the filibuster rules. We cannot turn our backs on       the Constitution. We cannot abdicate our oath of office.    Senator Sanders on May 14, 2013, said:         If we bring this nomination to the floor and there is a       request for 60 votes, which we're not going to get, I think       it is time for the Democratic leadership to do what the       American people want, and that is to have a majority rule in       the United States Senate.    I did not make up those last quotes. Those are actual quotes. This  isn't fake news.   Elections have consequences, my friends. Elections have consequences.   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle keep this in mind:  Now that we are entering into an era where a simple majority decides  all judicial nominations, we will see more and more nominees from the  extremes of  [[Page S2309]]  both the left and the right. I do not see how that will ensure a fair  and impartial judiciary. In fact, I think the opposite will be true,  and Americans will no longer be confident of equal protection under the  law.   When then-Majority Leader Reid changed the Senate rules in 2013,  there was no one more critical of his actions than the Senator who  stands before you now. I fought hard to convince my colleagues of the  damage those changes would do to this body. I did so because I love the  Senate. I revere this institution and the place it holds in our system  of government. It is imperative that we have a functioning Senate where  the rights of the minority are protected, regardless of which party is  in power at the time.   While what happened in 2013 was infuriating to our side, it was also  heartbreaking. It was heartbreaking because it seemed to me that the  uniqueness of the Senate had been irreparably damaged and, along with  it, any hope of restoring meaningful bipartisanship.   The unprecedented nature of the Democrats' filibuster of a Supreme  Court nominee has left me in the difficult position of having to decide  whether to support finishing what Harry Reid and the Democrats started  in 2013 and eliminate the 60-vote threshold on Supreme Court  nominations. I find myself torn between protecting the traditions and  practices of the Senate and the importance of having a full complement  of Justices on the U.S. Supreme Court.   I am left with no choice. I will vote to change the rules and allow  Judge Gorsuch to be confirmed by a simple majority. I will do so with  great reluctance, not because I have any doubts that Judge Gorsuch will  be an excellent Justice but because of the further--and perhaps  irreparable--damage that it will do to the Senate.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
