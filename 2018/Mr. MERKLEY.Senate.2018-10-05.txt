 Mr. President, I wish my colleagues were here to share  in this dialogue because there is such an absence of other Members  sharing with each other their perspectives. We have a world that is  enhanced by a media world that lives in a different universe that  accentuates the differences between the parties.   I think we are on a course that does deepen the differences across  America. I hope there is some way we can find in this Senate to be able  to communicate across that growing chasm in a more effective manner.   I have heard many of my colleagues speak to the issue of fairness on  this floor. I offer just a brief, couple of sentences of points for you  to consider as to why not all of America shares the perspective that  this has been fair.   When Dr. Ford was invited to come to speak to the committee, she said  that she would like to come, but she wanted some time, and she would  like to have corroborating individuals be able to appear before the  committee. That was denied by the committee, and that bothered many  people in this Chamber a great deal. Even in 1991, Anita Hill was given  that opportunity.   What is also very bothersome to individuals is that Dr. Ford had put  forward a list of eight individuals whom she had asked the FBI to talk  to, to be corroborating witnesses, and the FBI could talk only to those  within the scoping document that comes from the White House because, at  that moment, they are not doing a criminal investigation, they are  doing a background investigation, and they have to follow the  President's instructions. Those instructions, we are told, were not to  talk to any of the corroborating witnesses, not the 8 she put forward  and not the 20 who were put forward by Debbie Ramirez. So 28  individuals were not brought before the committee and not talked to by  the FBI.   I hope we have lots of opportunities to share our perspectives across  the aisle to understand as we struggle with the issue of fairness  because for many of us, fairness has not been achieved. The bigger  message to these two women who came forward to share their journeys, to  share their experiences, is that the U.S. Senate was unwilling to hear  them out, unfortunately.   Thank you.    Mr. President, our Founders had a very clear design for  the ability to put individuals into high posts of great responsibility.  They really wrestled with it. They considered giving the ability to  appoint judges and executive officers to the assembly, as it was  referred to. I think we have to worry a lot about individuals swapping  favors. One person saying: You support my friend, and I will support  yours--that wouldn't lead to those with the best qualities serving in  these key positions.   They concluded after great debate that it would go to a single  individual, the President, to nominate. They realized that the  President can go off track. They thought the President might express  favoritism of a variety of sorts. Alexander Hamilton talked about this  at some length: maybe favoritism to people in the home State, maybe  favoritism to a close group of friends, maybe favoritism to individuals  who were doing favors for the President. Who knows? Therefore, there  had to be a check on the potential abuse of the appointment process.  That is where the Senate came in, to advise and consent--the President,  to nominate; the Senate, to consent. What that meant is that the Senate  could not interfere with the President on the nomination process, and  the President was not to interfere with the Senate in the confirmation  process. Yet we have right now, for the first time in U.S. history, as  far as anyone has been able to ascertain, a case in which the President  of the United States has interfered greatly, first of all by requesting  that the Senate not look at all 3 years in which this individual,  Kavanaugh--the nominee--served as Staff Secretary to President Bush.  Second of all, the President appointed an individual to provide the  stamp of Presidential privilege on documents for when he served at the  White House that they did not want the Senate to see. We have some of  those documents. He said: Those are OK. Yet they censored 100,000  documents with the Presidential privilege stamp. This has never been  done, ever, as far as we can determine.   This body, on a bipartisan basis, requested all of those documents.  This was not a case of the President saying ``Please don't request,''  like with the Staff Secretary; this is a case in which the Senate  together said ``Give us the documents,'' and the President refused.  [[Page S6624]]    This is something we should all stand together and say: Unacceptable.  It is unacceptable that the President stepped across the separation of  powers to interfere with the work of this body to review the nominee's  record. The fact that there have not been loud cries of protests from  the leadership of this Senate is a shame on this institution--that it  has not fought for the separation of powers embodied in the  Constitution. It has not fought for the ability of each and every  Senator to be able to exercise full responsibility when we took our  oath of office to review the records of nominees, engage in the advice  and consent exercise.   Is this to be a precedent for the future because the leadership here  has so shamefully abandoned the core principles of the Constitution and  the responsibilities of this Chamber? I hope not. I hope that,  together, all 100 Senators will find in the future they will make sure  the President cannot interfere with our responsibility.   This is only one of the many problems, the many concerns, about Brett  Kavanaugh. Brett Kavanaugh didn't raise a single voice about the  interference of the President with the exercise of this body. He is  being nominated to the Supreme Court. He is supposed to have read the  Constitution at some point. He is supposed to understand the separation  of powers. He is supposed to stand up for the principles embodied in  that great document, and he did not. That alone should tell you this  man does not belong on the Supreme Court.   Then, of course, there is the fact that he has a view of Presidential  power that is above and beyond the law. Try to find that in the  Constitution.   Among the 25, he was the one who had the most expansive view of  Presidential power. He is the one the President chose. Why is that?  Because the President is under investigation for conspiring with Russia  to fix the election. That is why. He is worried. He is up at night. He  wakes up early. He tweets out to the world--angry, hostile. He wants to  make sure he has a Justice on that Court who can help write a ``get out  of jail free'' card. What a conflict of interest. What a conflict of  interest that this Court might have to rule on whether a President can  pardon himself. It is something we have never had to worry about  before, whether a President can fire a special prosecutor, despite the  writing under the law.   That is not all. We have before us a nominee who has been deceptive  and misleading to this Chamber time after time. Different articles have  put up different lists. They all come down to here is what he said, and  here is the truth. Here is what he said, and here is the truth.   I want to pivot, though, to perhaps the most shameful, difficult part  of this nominee; that is, his record of abuse toward women and the  complete failure of this body to look into that.   I heard earlier on the floor of this Chamber a number of my  colleagues across the aisle use the word ``fairness.'' ``We want  fairness.'' I heard it from one, two, three, four colleagues,  ``fairness.'' Did a single one of them express any regret that when Dr.  Ford came forward and asked for those who could corroborate her  testimony, asked for the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing with  those folks able to testify? Did they express any regret they turned  her down?   Even in 1991, the Judiciary Committee brought forward people to  corroborate Anita Hill's story. Here we are 27 years later, and we  don't treat a woman coming forward to share an experience of sexual  abuse--we don't even allow those individuals who can corroborate to  testify before the Judiciary Committee.   Did I hear a single Republican stand up and say ``I am embarrassed we  treated her so poorly''?   Let's take Debbie Ramirez. She laid out a list of 20 individuals. The  Judiciary Committee had a lot to say about her experience. Did they  invite her to testify and be able to tell her side of the story? No,  they did not. She had a list of 20 individuals who could provide  corroborating information. Did they ask a single one of those 20 to  come before the committee? Did they allow a single one to come? No,  they did not. There was no fairness in that committee. Let's be clear  about that.   Let's not hear more highfalutin arguments about fairness from the  other side of the aisle when these two women were treated in such an  egregious and awful fashion.   Then, there is the phony FBI investigation. I praise my colleague who  insisted that the record be reopened, the background check be reopened  for the FBI to provide an opportunity to check out these experiences  shared by Debbie Ramirez and by Dr. Ford. On a background check, it is  not a criminal investigation, and the FBI can't decide who to talk to.   Did I hear a single Member across the aisle express any embarrassment  about the fact that they let the President constrain the investigations  so not one--not one--of the eight people Dr. Ford asked to be talked to  was talked to? Not one. Zero. You call that fair? That is not fair.  That is not fair to her, that none of the people she asked to be talked  to were talked to.   Did I hear a single person across the aisle express any reservations  about the fact that that FBI investigation was so constrained by the  President of the United States, with advice from the Republican  leadership, that they did not talk to one of the 20 people Debbie  Ramirez asked to be talked to about her experiences in college?   You know, 1 of the 20 was a suite mate of Mr. Kavanaugh's. Well, when  you go through your freshman year and you are a suite mate, you share a  common living area, and there is one bedroom here and one bedroom here,  so you are with each other all the time. You know a lot about the other  folks. Well, that is a pretty powerful association. That individual is  now a professor at Princeton Theological Seminary, and he heard this  story when it happened. He heard about it, and he lived right there in  the suite, and he thought it was horrific.   I heard some colleagues say there was no one who could substantiate  her story. That is simply false, and it is shameful to allege that  there is no one when you know there is. It is unacceptable to call  something fair when you deliberately instruct or encourage the  President to make sure that the people who can provide the information  are not talked to.   This individual, now a professor at Princeton Theological Seminary,  has a very fine reputation. He was so upset about this, he talked about  it with his roommate his first year in graduate school long before Mr.  Kavanaugh ever came close to any type of nomination debate. So you  can't really say that he made it up now when he told another person  about it long ago. And that individual was on the list to be talked to,  but did the FBI talk to him? No, because the President wouldn't let the  FBI talk to him, and the President consulted with the Republican  leadership, and they didn't want anybody talked to who could actually  corroborate these stories.   That is a rigged system. For anyone on this floor to say that is  anywhere close to a form of justice, that is not true.   These women have been horrifically treated by this Chamber. Just as  the country knew Anita Hill was treated so poorly, so will, for decades  from now, people talk about the abuse of power that emanated from my  colleagues across the aisle against these women.   Across this land right now, women have been reliving their own  experiences of abuse. It has been an extraordinarily painful  experience. They have been calling our offices. I am sure they have  been calling all of our offices. I got on the phone and took many calls  today. I heard story after story. It takes a lot of energy out of your  heart to listen to individuals say, I am sharing this with you, and  they start crying on the phone--person after person.   I also have all of the stories that have been written and sent to me  as letters. I thought I would share a few of them with you.   Here is a letter:         What a farce! The disrespect to Dr. Ford and to victims       everywhere. I am sincere in saying that this TRIAL is turning       my stomach. I have fought back tears. I am a victim of       similar offenses. It is no better, and in some ways worse,       that it is a woman going after Dr. Ford in a subtle attempt       to cloud the trust of her experience.    Well, what is she referring to when she says it is a woman going  after Dr. Ford? She is talking about the fact that the leadership on  the Judiciary Committee hired a prosecutor to come  [[Page S6625]]  in and act as if Dr. Ford were a criminal on trial and to interrogate  her as if she were a criminal on trial. That is what this individual  said ``is turning my stomach.'' And it turned my stomach, too, to see  that abuse of power here in the U.S. Senate.   Another letter:         Hello, Senator. It has been 21 years since I was raped. I       had at the time only shared my story with the emergency room       doctors, the police, and my mom. Since it occurred, I have       only shared my story with my husband, until this week on       Twitter with the ``why I didn't report'' hashtag.        With each new accusation against Brett Kavanaugh, it has       forced me to relive all the horrible memories from the night       my assailant raped me. This moment in history and the fact       that the majority of Republican Senators who have either       tried to discredit the women coming forward or victim blame       and shame them has literally made the event so fresh in my       mind; as though it just happened all over again yesterday.        As like Dr. Ford, the details of dates, exact time, exact       clothing, are not extremely forthcoming to my memory,       although I remember the colors of what we were both wearing.       The fear, his actions, what I was feeling, and what was said       during the rape, I will never forget. And I will never forget       the smell of the cologne he was wearing and how it makes me       physically ill when I smell it to this day.        Kavanaugh can have his fake tears and shout his anger all       he wants because I guarantee you, if the man who raped me was       trying to get a job on the Supreme Court, and if I had the       strength to come forward like Dr. Ford did, then he too would       yell and scream at the realization he was being confronted       and that it was about to be taken away from him. Not to       mention, my sexual assault assailant would NOT require an FBI       investigation either.    And what is she referring to there? She is referring to the fact that  Dr. Ford took a polygraph exam, and Dr. Ford asked for an FBI  investigation. Mr. Kavanaugh did not take a polygraph exam, and Mr.  Kavanaugh did not want an FBI investigation. Quite a difference there.   Here is another story:         Five years ago, I was assaulted by a trusted friend in my       dorm room. Although I don't recall some critical details,       indelible in the hippocampus is the humiliation and fear       of retaliation. That is why I never reported, even when       school nurses urged me to.        Years later, I suffered PTSD and rarely feel entirely safe.        Watching Kavanaugh's angry, arrogant performance was deeply       triggering to me--would my attacker act the same way if I       outed him?        And would he also find the support of 33 percent of       Americans, just like Kavanaugh?        Until now, I haven't shared that I am a survivor with even       the closest of my friends and family. But it is too important       to stay quiet now.    Here is another story:         Hello, Senator Merkley. When I was young in the early       1970s, I was raped for an entire year by someone close to our       family. I didn't tell. I didn't tell because his warnings and       threats were too powerful and frightening for the child that       I was.        The man went on to become active in a leadership role. He       was, in fact, in a position to give talks about morality and       principles, all the while knowing how he affected my life.       Because that was the year he took my childhood away.        Watching Dr. Ford's testimony was tough, but I did it.        I always knew if I came forward against the man who did       this, it would be his word against mine and as a female, I       would lose. So I stayed quiet, never naming him publicly and       never will.        But I'm writing today to ask you for two thing, please--if       you hear any of your fellow Senators say ``I know his       character. He would never do that. He's never done anything       like that in front of me,'' please remind them that they       don't like witnesses. For me, there was never a hint of an       assault until he got me alone.        And if you hear your fellow Senators say, ``But it happened       almost 40 years ago,'' please assure them that in the       victim's heart, mind and life, it happened last week. It       happened yesterday. It happened today. Because you never get       past what was done to you. Ever. You can't.    She went on to share that she wrote this letter to me and deleted it  and wrote it again and deleted it several times. She had just deleted  it again when her husband came in the door carrying a statement that  someone had posted on the doors in the neighborhood that happened to  have a quote from me, one of her two Senators, and she took it as a  sign, and she decided to write that letter again and send it.   She said:         Now maybe what happened to me will bring about some good.    I know all of us are getting letters like this.   When she said she never came forward because it would be ``his word  against mine and as a female I would lose,'' she is relating exactly  what happened to Dr. Ford.   It was set up he said, she said, with no corroborating witnesses  called even though Dr. Ford asked for them. And then because it was he  said, she said, my colleagues could stand up and say: Just can't prove  it. Can't prove it.   But why didn't my colleagues stand up and say: It is an outrage that  we didn't call the people she asked us to call. It is an outrage that  there was this phony FBI investigation that didn't talk to any of those  people.   What she was talking about right here is how Dr. Ford was treated in  this Chamber, that she would lose because men in power would rig the  system and find for the man. That is what has happened here.   That is what happened with Ms. Ramirez, Debbie Ramirez. She had  corroborating information from the suite mate of Brett Kavanaugh, but  we here, this Senate, we rigged the system so that that information  could not be considered. That is what this woman is talking about, why  she didn't come forward, because it would be her word against a man's.  The system would be rigged and would find for the man. That is what is  so disturbing to women all over this country--a rigged system, that we  couldn't find in our collective judgment, in our collective process,  the ability to rise against partisanship and give fair treatment, a  fair process, to the individuals who came forward. It may not have  changed the course of events and the final vote, but at least women  would know we have come from where we were. We may not have been  entirely fair to Anita Hill, but we have learned and we have come  further. Instead, we did worse. That is a regrettable, powerful  consequence of what has happened.   Another constituent wrote to say that although he was not a direct  victim of assault, both of his brothers were repeatedly sexually abused  by a Catholic priest who spent 8 years in prison for abusing as many as  150 boys. He went on to say that this priest was in charge of a boys'  choir even though it was known that he had issues with sexual abuse.   His brothers were part of the choir, and he is troubled, he writes,  that his younger brother served in the same choir he did, and even  though he was aware there was a problem, he didn't intervene.   He says, referring to the priest:         He ruined our lives. Though I was not directly a victim of       his abuse, I carry with me the shame of not knowing to speak       up about what I saw.    He says that shame is amplified because his younger brother sang in  the same choir for a time.   He goes on to talk about a culture of power and privilege, where  people think they can abuse others and get away with it.   He says:         We are seeing this behavior being accepted at the highest       level of office in our country.    He goes on to relate that this is similar to the culture of abuse  towards women.   He says:         The culture of abuse towards women is being openly       perpetuated by the leaders of our country. The people we are       supposed to put trust in.    That was the end of his quote.   He went on to say:         I have never felt like it was my story to tell. The only       reason I tell it is because it illustrates how dangerous       these power structures can be and how easily they can be       abused. We have to take great care when choosing who to give       great responsibility to.    Have we in this Chamber recognized how easily our power structure can  be abused? Did we rise to insist on fairness for individuals who  brought their stories forward? Did we insist that they have the  opportunity to have their witnesses and corroborating information  considered by this Chamber? We did not. We failed them. We failed this  country. And when he says that we have to take great care when choosing  who to give great responsibility to, he is saying we should have taken  great care. And we know that in this particular nomination, there are  two powerful pieces of it. One, it is lifetime, so the person will  serve for decades. The second is, it is the top Court.   Are there not individuals in this land of hundreds of millions of  people who have stellar records of character who could serve on that  Court?  [[Page S6626]]    I hope that across America, it will come to great discussion and lead  to changes in how we think and how we behave. I hope that between now  and the vote tomorrow afternoon, there will be some Members of this  Chamber who will decide to take seriously the responsibility that we  had and that we failed to exercise appropriately. We will decide that,  you know what, yeah, we are going to close debate, but we haven't yet  voted to put this man on the bench, and with the committee having  conducted a completely rigged process, we need to stop and rethink what  we are doing and not put Brett Kavanaugh on the Court.    Thank you, Mr. President.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have a lot of concerns about the  possibility of Brett Kavanaugh serving on the Supreme Court. They are  concerns that come from many different directions, but let's start with  the precedent that this body has not reviewed his full record. We  haven't taken any look at all at the 3 years he was Staff Secretary to  President Bush because the President's team intervened and asked us not  to. And a couple Members of this body collaborated with the White House  to deny everybody else here the possibility of looking at his record.   The thing is that each and every one of us has a responsibility to  review the record. This exceptional situation in which a few Members  have made it impossible for anyone in the body to fulfill their  constitutional responsibility is an extraordinary abuse of power in  this body.   Then we have the President of the United States reaching out in other  ways--in ways we have never seen before--and putting the stamp of  Presidential privilege on some 100,000 documents. These were documents  from the time that Brett Kavanaugh served as a White House Counsel. We  received a few documents, and there were a lot of troubling things in  those documents, but 100,000 documents were censored by the President  of the United States.   I will just remind my colleagues that the President is not supposed  to interfere with the work of the Senate in the confirmation process.  It is called the separation of powers. Maybe some of you would like to  pull out your Constitution and study it for a moment and realize that  the President nominates but doesn't get to decide what this body  reviews. Yet that stamp of Presidential power, untested, has done so  for, as far as we can tell, the first time in U.S. history.   Then we have the fact that he asked the same individual whom he had  given the stamp of Presidential power to proceed to make some 140,000  documents confidential so the public couldn't see them. Well, that,  too, was untested. That, too, was an original strategy. That, too, was  a situation of minimizing the conversation that experts could have of  what was in those records.   Of those three phases, I think the one that bothers me the most is  the second one--the use of the stamp of Presidential privilege on  100,000 documents. When Presidential privilege--otherwise known as  Executive privilege--was used in the past, a document was looked at and  it was determined, what constitutional test does this meet for special  treatment? One would think that since these were documents from the  Bush administration, the Trump administration couldn't make any of the  arguments that normally are made about compromising conversations in  the White House, but no explanation was given. This was just straight- out censorship across the board.   I challenged that censorship, and the hearing that was supposed to  take  [[Page S6649]]  place unfortunately won't take place because of this rush to complete  the confirmation before the Senate can get ahold of those documents,  before that hearing can occur.   Why the rush to cooperate with the White House to prevent this body  from seeing those 100,000 pages that were censored by the White House?  What is the President hiding? Is it Brett Kavanaugh's involvement in  the policy of torture? Is it Brett Kavanaugh's involvement in holding  the documents stolen from Senate Democrats, because we know he received  them? Is it his involvement in other nominations where he said he  wasn't very involved? What is in those 100,000 documents that the White  House was desperate that this body not review? That is certainly  troubling. No nomination should go forward without a review by this  body of a nominee's records, certainly not for a lifetime appointment  and certainly not for the Supreme Court.   Then there is concern over the temperament of the individual. Out of  the hundreds of millions of Americans across this land, certainly there  are at least nine who have the temperament to serve. No need to turn to  someone who is belligerent and condescending. No need to turn to  someone who is angry and unstable. But what did we see? That is exactly  what we saw when we heard him testify before the Senate Judiciary  Committee.   He said things like: ``Some of you were lying in wait and had it  ready,'' although he said it in an angrier tone than that.   He said: ``This confirmation has become a national disgrace.'' Well,  I don't actually argue with that because it is a disgrace because of  the compromises of fairness that have occurred in this process toward  the women who came forward.   When he was asked by Senator Klobuchar if he has ever been blackout  drunk, he responded: ``I don't know. Have you?'' Well, interesting  response. Did he respond ``I don't know'' because he can't remember  because he blacked out? Was that his point?   Then we saw the partisan rhetoric: a frenzy on the left to come up  with something, anything, to block my confirmation. Angry and partisan,  all in one moment.   Then he went on to say much more about things being calculated and  orchestrated, about things being a political hit, fueled with pent-up  anger about President Trump. He talked about fear unfairly stoked. He  talked about revenge on behalf of the Clintons.   He threatened the Senate. He said: ``As we all know, what goes around  comes around.''   This man with these quotes is qualified to serve on the special body  known as the Supreme Court of the United States? I don't think so.   He talked about the fact that he didn't drink too much and he didn't  become belligerent. Yet we saw a lot of belligerence when he came  before the body. This is called not having judicial temperament. That  performance of intemperate behavior led to 2,400 law professors noting  that it was improper, inappropriate, simply wrong, that this man should  serve. They wrote a letter October 3rd: ``The Senate should not confirm  Kavanaugh.'' The letter was presented to us the following day. They  said this:         Judicial temperament is one of the most important qualities       of a judge. As the Congressional Research Service explains, a       judge requires ``a personality that is evenhanded, unbiased,       impartial, courteous, yet firm, and dedicated to a process,       not a result.''    The concern for judicial temperament dates back to our founding. In  Federalist 78, titled ``Judges as Guardians of the Constitution,''  Alexander Hamilton expressed the need for the integrity and moderation  of the judiciary.   The letter continues:         We are law professors who teach, research, and write about       the judicial institutions of this country. Many of us appear       in State and Federal court and our work means that we will       continue to do so, including before the United States Supreme       Court. We regret that we feel compelled to write to you, our       Senators, to provide our views that at the Senate hearings on       September 27, Judge Brett Kavanaugh displayed a lack of       judicial temperament that would be disqualifying for any       court, and certainly for elevation to the highest court of       this land.    They continued based on their background--2,400 law professors from  across the country--saying:         The question at issue was, of course, painful for anyone.       But Judge Kavanaugh exhibited a lack of commitment to       judicious inquiry. Instead of being open to the necessary       search for accuracy, Judge Kavanaugh was repeatedly       aggressive with questioners. Even in his prepared remarks,       Judge Kavanaugh described the hearing as partisan, referring       to it as ``a calculated and orchestrated political hit''       rather than acknowledging the need for the Senate, faced with       new information, to try to understand what had transpired.        Instead of trying to sort out with reason and care the       allegations that were raised to him, Judge Kavanaugh       responded in an intemperate, inflammatory, and partial       manner, and he interrupted and at times was discourteous to       Senators.        As you know, under two statutes governing bias and recusal,       judges must step aside if they are at risk of being perceived       as or of being unfair. As Congress has previously put it, a       judge or justice ``shall disqualify himself in any proceeding       in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.''       These statutes are part of a myriad of legal commitments to       the impartiality of the judiciary, which is a cornerstone of       the courts.        We have differing views about the other qualifications of       Judge Kavanaugh, but we are united as professors of law and       scholars of judicial institutions in believing that he did       not display the impartiality and judicial temperament       requisite to sit on the highest court of the land.    Signed, with their respective institutional affiliations, 2,400 law  professors, saying that this man is not suited to serve.   Another concern not mentioned in that letter was his fidelity to the  truth--misrepresentations, inaccuracies, and straight-out whoppers.   Some of our colleagues, like the senior Senator from South Carolina,  said: I have argued to you that when you found that a judge was a  perjurer, you couldn't in good conscience send him back into the  courtroom because everybody who came in that courtroom thereafter would  have a real serious doubt--a real serious doubt over whether the truth  was being told.   Brett Kavanaugh said that all witnesses to his alleged assault of Dr.  Ford refuted her claim or said it didn't happen. What is the truth?  Only one person said it didn't happen: Brett Kavanaugh. All of those  other folks he said refuted it--nobody refuted it. They said they  couldn't remember, but they didn't refute it. And one said that while  she couldn't remember, she believed Dr. Ford. So Brett Kavanaugh, in  the most generous capacity, simply doesn't have the ability to keep the  facts straight on a pretty straightforward thing--big difference  between refuting and not remembering--or he deliberately misrepresented  the facts, in which case he lied.   Brett Kavanaugh said he first heard of the Ramirez allegations in the  period since The New Yorker published the story, but we have had  multiple reports that Brett Kavanaugh and his team were working to  discredit Ramirez before The New Yorker story. Why did he say that he  learned about it after, when he was working to discredit it before? Did  he think this was clever, that he could kind of say: Well, I heard  about the full story in The New Yorker after The New Yorker article was  published. Was that what he was trying to imply--like maybe I can slip  by on that one--because he didn't want people to know that he knew  about it early and had worked to discredit her? Another whopper from  Brett Kavanaugh.   Brett Kavanaugh said he did not travel in the same social circles as  Dr. Ford, who went to Holton-Arms, but what was the truth? His  classmates said they routinely socialized with the Holton-Arms girls.  So much for that statement.   Brett Kavanaugh said he categorically did not receive documents  stolen from Democratic Senators and their staffs by Manny Miranda in  the early 2000s, but in one of those documents that didn't get  censored, that slipped its way through to the Senate, what did we find  out? It shows that he clearly received the stolen documents--another  lie from Brett Kavanaugh.   Brett Kavanaugh said that Judge Pickering's nomination was not one he  primarily handled. Well, let's just say that this is less than the full  truth. Maybe if you emphasize the word ``primarily,'' you find some  shred of accuracy, but it is certainly not a full and appropriate  presentation because it turns out that he was involved in a number of  critical aspects of the Pickering nomination.   Brett Kavanaugh said he did not see or hear anything about President  Bush's warrantless wiretapping program before it was publicly reported,  [[Page S6650]]  but in some of those other documents that slipped through, we find out  that he did know about them, and he emailed John Yoo about the  warrantless wiretapping long before the program became public.   Brett Kavanaugh said the Bush administration did not consider  ideology when selecting or vetting judges, but the truth is that the  documents show that they did consider ideology.   Why did this man, Brett Kavanaugh, feel the need to misrepresent the  truth time after time after time?   He implied that when it came to drinking, he didn't drink excessively  and he did not get aggressive. Yet we have person after person after  person saying that is exactly what happened.   He said the phrase ``Renate Alumnus'' in his yearbook was ``clumsily  intended to show affection.'' Let me repeat that: ``clumsily intended  to show affection.'' And he continued: ``and that she was one of us.''  Isn't it nice that he and his colleagues got together to pick out this  one young lady and show in their yearbooks that they had affection for  her, when everyone else involved said that is not what it was all about  at all? It was about this group of men bragging about sexual conquests.  It may not have actually occurred, but they were laughing over the  prospect of disgracing this individual. What kind of a warped character  goes out of his way to either brag about sexual conquests or to imply-- imply--a character that she did not have, to tear her down? But that is  Brett Kavanaugh.   He went on to tell some real whoppers--that folks in his circle say  the term ``ralphing'' refers to throwing up when drinking. He said: No,  it refers to a sensitive stomach. They are all things that he had  written.   ``Boofing,'' what was that all about? He said that has to do with  flatulence, but everyone around him says: No, that was a crude sexual  activity that he was describing. That is what that word means. I will  not give the details of it.   He said ``devil's triangle'' is a drinking game, when everyone else  says: No, it wasn't a drinking game; it has another sexual connotation.   So he couldn't bring himself to be honest and say: I don't feel  comfortable giving the definition of those in a public hearing because  I am such a nice, sweet guy. But instead, he lied. Lying came so easy-- lie after lie after lie. As my colleague from South Carolina said: When  a person lies once, you don't trust them after that. How would anyone,  after breaking the truth, be believed in the future?   So we have the fact that his character is one of hurting and  attacking others, of lying even to the U.S. Senate. Some 2,400 law  professors note that his temperament, his animosity, and his  partisanship make him unqualified to serve on the Court.   So what is this all about? Why are my colleagues across the aisle so  intent on getting him confirmed? It has to do with his judicial  philosophy and taking no risk that this seat is not filled with this  judicial philosophy--this philosophy for the powerful over the people.   There have been some interesting aspects of this philosophy. One is  that he believes that the President is above and beyond the law and  should not or cannot be indicted or investigated while he is in office.   The Court may well have to make some rulings on how President Trump  conducts himself. President Trump might just fire the special  prosecutor. Is that within his power? The Court may have to decide.   The President may decide to pardon himself--something never done in  U.S. history--given all the investigations into egregious conduct. Why  did the President pick this individual, who has the most expansive view  of Presidential power, to serve on the Court? Maybe he is trying to  write himself a ``get out of jail free'' card. But if you can't find in  the Constitution that the President is above and beyond the law--and I  dare you to try; I dare anyone in this Chamber to find that in the  Constitution, because it is not there--why are we putting a man on the  Court who thinks it is, who is so comfortable twisting and torturing  the words on the page to reach a predesired conclusion?   Yes, he was handpicked by the Federalist Society after Trump promised  to appoint anti-Roe v. Wade judges who would strip away the  constitutional right to a full range of reproductive services. It  bothers me a lot--the idea of a judge who believes the government  should be in the exam room, between a woman and her doctor. The  government does not belong in an exam room, between a woman and her  doctor on difficult medical life issues.   But in every decision--or virtually every decision--Kavanaugh finds a  way to twist the circumstances in order to find for the powerful over  the people. That is what this rush to jam this person onto the Court  is. Does he believe the Court should take on gerrymandering, which is a  huge blight on equal representation of the people? There is no sign  that he does. We currently have a Court where the majority has not  wanted to take on those issues, despite the fact they are the ones who  are supposed to maintain the integrity of the Constitution.   Do we have any sign that he is upset or concerned about the tearing  down of the Voting Rights Act, which this Chamber passed and the House  passed and was law for decades but was torn down by the court? Rather  than letting this Chamber or the House together decide to adjust that  law, they decided to tear it down, saying: We don't have to worry about  this anymore.   Is there any sign that Judge Kavanaugh cares about the desecration of  the opportunity of citizens to vote in this country? No. An offense  against the Constitution, yes. His concern, none.   What about the dark money that is the consequence of a huge  concentration of wealth and influence--a huge concentration of  influence because the Supreme Court opened the door with the case  Citizens United? I found it kind of bizarrely humorous to hear  colleagues across the aisle complaining about dark money, because they  have been absolutely arguing that dark money should be permitted. When  we had the idea of not having dark money and shining a light on it--it  was called the DISCLOSE Act--every single Republican in this Chamber  voted against it. Every single one voted against sunlight. Why is that?  The Koch brothers essentially are the puppet masters of this Chamber.  They invested hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money, thanks to  Citizens United, in making sure that they had control of this Chamber.  Did we hear Judge Kavanaugh have any interest in cleaning up this mess?   Thomas Jefferson was speaking to the core architecture of our  Constitution, and he said that the mother principle--he referred to it  as the ``mother principle''--was that there would be an equal voice  among the citizens. Now, we know it was not the case that everyone had  an equal voice. Communities of color did not have an equal voice and  women did not have an equal voice, but what Jefferson was speaking to  was the distribution of power across the electorate. He said only then  will you have laws that reflect the will of the people.   But Citizens United is the opposite of that. It concentrates power.  If you have an individual like the Koch brothers who can put $100  million into a campaign and you have an ordinary person who can put  $100 into a campaign, then you are granting the Koch brothers 1 million  times the influence. It is the exact opposite of Jefferson's ``equal  voice'' principle.   Does Kavanaugh have the slightest understanding that the construction  of the Constitution was to avoid the powerful--running the government  by and for the powerful? The Constitution was a response to that very  problem in Europe. There is no sign of that, no interest in that--in  fact, quite the opposite.   He has bragged about being the most pure on the First Amendment. What  does that mean? It means that he loves the weaponization of the First  Amendment, twisted as an instrument to give the powerful victories over  the people time and again--decisions against the environment, decisions  against workers, decisions against consumers, decisions against  reproductive rights. That is the rush to put this man, unqualified in  every possible way, to serve on the Supreme Court--not having the  temperament, not having the integrity. That is the rush--to secure and  ensure that Jefferson's concept of equal voice is destroyed.   The most troubling is his conduct toward women. The fact that he  collaborated with other boys to damage the  [[Page S6651]]  integrity of a young woman was troubling. Troubling beyond troubling is  the story of his assault on Dr. Ford, but you might say: Wait. We don't  have any corroborating information about that.   But Dr. Ford asked for her corroborating witnesses to come before the  Senate Judiciary Committee, and how many of those were allowed to come  before the committee? None. None. Zero. The committee was determined to  make it just ``he said and she said,'' without any other information.  That is treating an individual unfairly--absolutely unfairly--to cherry  pick information and only to allow it to support one side of the  argument and to deny her the ability to bring her corroborating people  before the Judiciary Committee. Even in 1991, that was not done with  Anita Hill. This body treated Dr. Ford worse.   Then the sham of the reopened FBI investigation, which was only  opened because one courageous colleague from Arizona said: I am not  going forward unless we really examine these situations that involved  his assault on women. But the decision on how to conduct that FBI  investigation wasn't up to this Chamber. It was up to the President,  and the President does a scoping document and tells the FBI whom to  talk to. Apparently, he consulted with the leadership, it is reported-- the Republican leadership of this Chamber--on whom to let the FBI  consult with, and the result was not to consult or talk to or interview  a single one of those eight people that Dr. Ford asked to be  interviewed.   It would take some time, I guess, to know exactly who said what to  whom. It was the President's decision. So the responsibility rests  there. But in the interest of fairness, was there not one Member of  this body in that conversation who could speak up and say: We want the  facts not a whitewash. We want the facts.   Apparently, no one did. No one insisted on that. They said: No, we  will go forward, even if we hide all of the facts.   Then, there was Debbie Ramirez, who shared her story of being  assaulted, her story from the college dorm. In that case, she said  there were 20 people that the FBI should talk to. Well, she wasn't  invited to appear by the Judiciary Committee at all, and none of her 20  individuals whom she suggested should be talked to were invited. So she  got no hearing--complete exclusion. Yet many Members of this Chamber  attacked her. Do you think that is fair, attacking a person but not  letting her come before this Chamber to give her story? Do you think  that is fair? It is not fair.   Then we have the FBI receive instructions from the White House, after  consultation with the Republican leadership, and the result is they  didn't talk to one of her corroborating witnesses--not one. Why, in  this day and age, where we have been in the middle of a ``me too''  conversation, can individuals in this Chamber on the right side of the  aisle take such joy in being so unfair to a woman coming forward to  share a story? It is even worse because each one knew, if they read the  newspapers, that there was a lot of corroborating information.   Kenneth Appold was in the same suite in the dorm. He lived in the  same suite--two bedrooms, sharing a common space--and he heard the  story. He independently recalled many of the same details that Ramirez  shared, including that a male student had encouraged Kavanaugh as he  exposed himself. The classmate recalled that the party took place in a  common room on the first floor.   I have known this all along, he said. It has been on my mind all  these years when his name came up. It was a big deal.   How come his voice was not allowed to come before the Senate? Why did  the FBI not talk to him and put it into the report? I will tell you  why. It was so Senators could go down and review the report and say,  oh, there is no new information.    Of course, there is no new information. It is because the President's  team reportedly asked the Republicans' leadership what they wanted  done, and apparently it didn't want any of the people who had  corroborating information to be talked to or reported on. That is a  betrayal of justice. That is a complete corruption of justice.   Mr. Appold is a professor now at Princeton Theological Seminary. He  is deeply respected.   He said: ``It had been on my mind all of these years when his name,''  referring to Kavanaugh, ``came up. It was a big deal.'' The story  stayed with him, he said, ``because it was disturbing and seemed  outside the bounds of acceptable behavior even during heavy drinking at  parties on campus.'' He said he had been shocked but not necessarily  surprised because the social group to which Kavanaugh belonged often  drank to excess. He recalled that Brett Kavanaugh was relatively shy  until he drank, at which point he could become aggressive and even  belligerent.   Now, this individual, Kenneth, may be quick to judge, and one may  say, well, he just invented this memory, except here is the problem--he  shared it with his roommate from his first year in graduate school. He  told what had happened that year, so he has a lot of credibility. He is  a professor at a theological seminary. He lived in the same suite. He  heard the story about it shortly after it happened. It disturbed him so  much that he shared it with his roommate from his first year in  graduate school. That is a pretty persuasive substantiation of Debbie  Ramirez's story.   There was another classmate, Richard Oh, an emergency room doctor in  California. Soon after the party, he recalled overhearing a female  student tearfully recount to another student an incident at the party  involving a gag with--well, you know the story--followed by a male  student exposing himself. Was Richard Oh invited to come before the  Senate and tell his story? No, he was not--another transgression of  justice. Did the FBI talk to him? No, because it had instructions not  to talk to these individuals who had corroborating information.   This is situation in which, when a woman comes forward to share her  story, she is treated with disdain by this institution. That is why  these women didn't want to come forward. They thought they were  mistreated. Unfortunately, it turned out to be right, and everyone  supporting and voting for Kavanaugh shares the shame of the  mistreatment of Dr. Ford and the mistreatment of Debbie Ramirez.   Across this land, it has caused women to relive the experiences they  have gone through, with many of them having written to our offices. I  encourage every Senator to read every one of the letters they are  getting before voting late this afternoon on the question of whether  Kavanaugh should serve on the Court. I read five letters earlier, but I  have received a lot of letters. I am going to read more of them now.   This individual writes:         Please do what you can to block the Kavanaugh vote to the       Supreme Court. I was also a victim of sexual assault when I       was in graduate school in the early 1970s. I never pursued       that due to fear of consequences and feeling that this was my       fault.    ``This has to stop,'' she concludes the letter.   Do you think that she got any encouragement from the completely  unjust way this body treated these two women? No. It is exactly the  classic setup and rigged response with which, so often, women have met  when they have had the courage to come forward with their stories.   Another woman wrote:         I cried all the way to work, listening to Dr. Christine.    She is referring to Christine Blasey Ford.         If you can do anything as my Senator, do everything you can       to change the course of our national Court decision. There       isn't much more I can say as a mom, as a professional, as a       sexual assault victim who has never come forward. Please.    I appreciate her writing to me, and I share her concern and the  belief that we should change the course we seem to be on at the moment  because there is nothing like confirming this man without fairly  examining the women who have been courageous enough to come forward. It  is more insulting to all of these women who have gone through the  experiences of being assaulted.   Another Oregonian wrote to me:         I am a survivor of sexual abuse. I was assaulted as a child       by someone my family trusted, then again by a stranger when I       was in college. In both instances, I remember the sinking       feeling I had afterward--the feeling that even if I spoke up,       I wouldn't be believed. I have long felt trapped inside my  [[Page S6652]]       own trauma, but over the past couple weeks, I have drawn such       strength from the sisterhood of survivors who have shown up,       protested, and shouted out their own survivor stories. I have       drawn strength from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony. I       know that because she stepped forward, other survivors will       feel brave enough to speak up too. There is power and comfort       when women come together and speak our truth before the       world.    I say to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, I am sorry you were treated in  this horrific manner by the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate. I  am sorry you were treated so unfairly that not a single one of your  corroborating witnesses was pulled before the committee. I feel  terrible that those at the FBI did not talk to any of the people you  asked them to talk to. It was a rigged system. You were set up. You  were betrayed by the leadership of this body, but your courageous  action in coming forth was not without results.   This woman, like thousands of others, is looking to you and saying  thank you--thank you for the courage you had to share. Even though you  were afraid that you would be treated unfairly, you came forward  anyway, and that gives others courage to share their stories.  Unfortunately, your fears, Dr. Ford, were justified. May it never be  again the case. The only right thing now is for us not to send Brett  Kavanaugh to the Court.    There was an article that appeared in an Oregon newspaper, and I am  going to read the story but, like the newspaper, not share her name.   The newspaper story starts out this way:         The event happened 75 years ago when ``Dorothy''--[not her       real name]--watched the testimonies of Christine Blasey Ford       and Brett Kavanaugh on television, on Thursday, during       Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearings. The memories       came flooding back, and for the first time, she felt she must       tell her story--a story she never told her mother, a story       she didn't tell her husband either.    Dorothy's story is similar to the story Blasey told, on Thursday, in  testimony that was part of the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court  Justice Nominee Kavanaugh. Blasey accused Kavanaugh of attempting to  rape her when they were both at a house party with a group of high  school students. Kavanaugh denied the accusations, which are now the  subject of an FBI investigation.         Dorothy, now 91, was a student at Reedsport High School in       the 1940s. One day, she was at a friend's house where several       kids her age were gathered. She said she was carried into a       bedroom by a popular football player, and before she knew       what was happening, she found herself pinned to a bed,       underneath the boy, who was struggling to get her pants off.       He was both a ``big man'' on campus and ``just big.'' She was       85 pounds.    In some ways, Dorothy's story is different from Blasey's in that she  was carried and not pushed into the room. There was no one in the room  except her and her attacker. Dorothy said she was able to push the boy  enough that he hit his head on the bed's headboard, and with his weight  off of her, she was able to yell for help, and her friend and her  friend's brother rushed in and rescued her.   Dorothy doesn't want The News-Review to use her real name, so she is  being referred to by a name that was given to many girls in the year  she was born. She still has difficulty dealing with what happened to  her in high school. For most of her life, she has refused to think  about it. She has had plenty else to think about. She has raised kids,  been widowed, remarried, widowed again, but it is still with her.   She said:         You try to bury all of that, and you do for a long time.       Then something like this news comes up, and it brings it all       back.    Dorothy started off talking about sexual harassment. It was later  when she felt able to call what had happened to her by a more legally  accurate name--attempted rape. Dorothy said she was naive when she was  16:         I was pretty shy and naive and unsure of myself, I guess. I       don't know if feeling ``inferior'' is the right word. I made       good grades, and I worked in the school office, but I was a       country kid.    She couldn't talk to her mother about sex.         If I tried to ask her anything about sex, she said, ``That       is dirty. We don't talk about that.'' She had a general idea,       enough to understand what her attacker was after. She didn't       know if he and other boys were drinking, but she was not. The       kids had been dancing before it happened. It never occurred       to her to report the incident. That just wasn't done in those       days, and she was ashamed--embarrassed--as if the whole       incident were her fault.        The story got around at school, though, and the other kids       were not sympathetic. You look, and people are kind of       giggling as you walk by. They had heard about it.    Now she wonders if the same boy went after other girls.         It is part of life, and it happens a lot more than people       realize. It probably happened to other girls in the same       school, she said. Many years after the event, Dorothy said       she saw her attacker. He was in a wheelchair, and she       couldn't help thinking, ``Great. He got what he deserved.''    Even though 75 years have passed, she has never forgotten what he  did.         I can still shut my eyes and see that guy packing me over       his shoulder and throwing me on the bed and jumping on top of       me.    Watching Thursday's hearings made Dorothy furious. She believed  Blasey, and she was horrified by the Senators who defended Kavanaugh.         They are so unfeeling, you know? I would hate to be their       wives. If they just sit there and take this guy's word for       it, I feel sorry for the wives of these guys who are so macho       that they can't see a woman's point of view.    The hearing motivated her to come forward.         I just felt now is the time to tell my story, and maybe       other women will come forward, and maybe they will do       something more about the way that women are disbelieved.    She said it was a relief to finally share her secret. ``I am about to  get weepy,'' she said.   Do you think this woman, who is now in her nineties and went to  Reedsport High School, takes any good feeling away from the Senate in  the way the Senate treated Dr. Ford with regard to the fact that it did  not allow anyone supporting her story to appear or with regard to the  fact that leadership was consulted by the White House and that the  result was a scoping document that did not allow the FBI to talk to the  people who had supporting information?   Do you think she takes any good feelings away from the way this  Senate treated Debbie Ramirez in its attacking her and disqualifying  her without even letting her come and tell her story and not talking to  the 20 people she suggested had corroborative information?   Do you think she takes anything good away from the horrific way these  women were treated and the unfair way they were treated? I do not think  so.   You must look at the way the Senate behaved and say that is supposed  to be a distinguished body, that it is supposed to being an esteemed  body. We should expect the best from the U.S. Senate and we got the  worst.   Another woman wrote:         You must stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh, especially       after his angry, abusive testimony today that was full of       lies. I am a sexual assault survivor, and I am absolutely       full of despair this evening.    I am not the only one getting these letters. So, to my colleagues, I  ask: Are you doing anything to address the anger about the way Dr. Ford  was treated? Are you insisting that she get fair treatment before you  vote to send Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States? Are  you insisting those who can corroborate Debbie Ramirez's story,  including a professor at the Princeton Theological Seminary, have the  chance to tell their stories before you send Kavanaugh to the Supreme  Court? Are you?   Another individual wrote:         Please, please, please vote no to elect Brett Kavanaugh to       the Supreme Court. As a victim of domestic violence, I am       full of fear for everyone who would be affected by the       decisions Kavanaugh would have the power to make.    This letter starts out:         Senator, I want to thank you for expressing your concerns       regarding the Kavanaugh issues. I am a survivor of rape by my       best friend's older brother at the age of 10. I also       survived many years of abuse by my ex-husband. While       watching the coverage of the Kavanaugh news, I have heard       Senators make very hurtful comments about the women who       have come forward. I was proud of my Senator for having       the courage to publicly announce that the way this has       been managed by the Trump administration is wrong.        I totally relate to what Dr. Ford describes as being held       down and not being able to breathe. The only word that       adequately describes this type of treatment is torture. I do       not know where my former best friend's brother is; however,       my ex-husband walks around with a religious cross around his       neck. He is a pillar of his church, has the admiration of our       daughter. I never told my  [[Page S6653]]       children, while I am left with years of nightmares and fear.        The Kavanaugh allegations in the news have triggered       memories I have tried to bury for decades.    She says:         Though, your comments have renewed my faith that other than       my older brother, there exists good men who want to support       women who live with the torment of sexual abuse.    I would love it if this letter said: I was afraid that the all-male  majority of the Judiciary Committee would treat Dr. Ford unfairly. I  was afraid but relieved when they heard her out. I was relieved when  they insisted that those who could back up her story were allowed to  testify. I was relieved and pleased they took her seriously enough that  they insisted the FBI--they told the President the FBI has to talk to  those folks for us to have any credibility. I would love for this  letter to say that, but it doesn't say any of those things because this  body, this leadership, let her down and let every woman across America  who has been a victim of sexual violence down.   Another woman wrote and said:         Today's hearing was difficult yet important to watch. As a       victim of sexual assault myself, I applied your support       hearing Dr. Ford's accounts and believing in doing what is       right and just.    Wouldn't it be better if this letter could say: I applaud the Senate,  the Senate leadership, and the President of the United States for  believing in doing what is right and just. We didn't get letters like  that, did we.   Another individual writes:         Today was an extremely difficult day watching the Kavanaugh       hearings. I was so amazed by the bravery Dr. Ford showed       throughout her testimony. Her experience was raw and       credible. As a young victim of sexual assault, I feel       emboldened because of Dr. Ford's testimony. Women need to be       heard and believed. We have to hold the Supreme Court to the       highest standards. Brett Kavanaugh is clearly not a candidate       for the Supreme Court.    Isn't that right, that we should ensure that we have the highest  standards for those who serve on the Supreme Court?   All those district judges across the land writing their decisions,  they get appealed to the circuit courts, and all those circuit court  judges writing their opinions, they get appealed to the Supreme Court,  to nine individuals. Isn't it important that we proceed to ensure that  we ``hold the Supreme Court to the highest standards''? We will not do  that if we confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Court.   We will be setting an abysmally low standard for integrity for all of  the falsehoods he has told and an incredibly low standard for behavior.  We saw the behavior and the partisanship. We didn't see judicial  temperament and impartiality.   He violates basically every standard we set for someone to serve on  the Supreme Court. Yet we are having a vote later today with an  indication that he will be approved.   Here is another letter:         I am a sexual assault survivor. I watched today. The sex       crimes prosecutor looks like she had nailed Kavanaugh by his       own calendar. Dr. Ford testified that it was early evening       and casual. It appears the assault happened at the home that       Kavanaugh and his friends worked out. This is when one of the       majority Judiciary members took over and became angry       partisans.    That is all she writes, but I think what bothered a lot of people was  that the majority chose to bring in a prosecutor--a prosecutor--to  question Dr. Ford, as if Dr. Ford had committed a crime.   She didn't commit a crime, my friends. She is a brave woman who came  forward to share her story, hoping she would be taken seriously and  treated fairly, afraid she wouldn't, and it turned out her fears were  justified. They hired a prosecutor to treat her like a criminal. Wow.  That is insult to injury.   This letter is longer. It is the 16th story I am reading that I  received from constituents back home.         Watching Dr. Ford's treatment in the Senate today, I am       having a hard time getting my own work done. Dr. Ford's       assault experience parallels my own in ways I have not       thought about in years. However, unlike Judge Kavanaugh, my       assailant was able to complete the assaults he set out to do       because we were not inebriated at the time he violated me. He       merely used his size to overpower me, outweighing me by 150       pounds.        Like Brett Kavanaugh, my assailant attended an all-boy's       Catholic school, attended a prestigious university, went on       to become an attorney. I have considered, because of the       types of clients he represents, bringing the multiple       assaults he perpetrated over the course of 2 weeks, while I       stayed with his family across the country from my own, to the       attention of the State bar where he practices or journalists       in the State where he defended Catholic priests accused of       abusing children.        Seeing now what Dr. Ford is being put through, knowing she       was driven from her home and threatened, is now being       assaulted by her colleagues, gives me pause.        My assailant isn't up for any prestigious promotions. He is       not on the short list for a Federal judicial position or       running for any public office. It has been 18 years, and the       statute of limitations in the State where this took place may       or may not have run out, depending on how the acts are       defined. If my assailant decides to follow through with his       goal to become a politician, my calculus may change. For now,       I need you to do what you can to shut this nomination down,       to show the world that you not only believe Dr. Ford but you       honor--honor--her testimony.        Your colleagues, your Republican colleagues, clearly       believe her; they just don't think it matters. Please, as a       survivor and as a constituent, I am begging you, make her       testimony matter.    Are we going to make her testimony matter? We are not going to make  it better if we send Kavanaugh to a seat on the Supreme Court.   Her desire, her interest, her possibility of coming forward is cut  short by the way she saw this Senate treat Dr. Ford. That is a very sad  commentary on the injustice perpetrated by this body.   This is letter No. 17. I have more than 50 letters here. As you can  start to hear, the themes of women being assaulted are very similar;  women hearing in Dr. Ford's story their own experience, and they are  asking the Senate to treat the women who have come forward with  fairness and justice and are being deeply disturbed that they have not  been treated with fairness or justice.   There is still time. There is still time until we vote and send  Kavanaugh forward, if we vote no, as these women asked because an  individual with this record does not belong on the Court. Then we will  admire the courage of these individuals to come forward.    The next letter:         As a survivor of assault, it's important to me that the       nominee for one of the highest offices have an impeccable       record, which Kavanaugh has demonstrated he does not have,       both through his reactionary hearing and the accusations       against him from survivors. I implore you to be a voice of       reason in the chaos.        My first assault happened in 2011. I am so ashamed that the       only way my sister found out was because she found an STD       test I had received from Planned Parenthood and asked me       about it. I was 24. I had nightmares for months. It changed       everything.        My second assault happened in 2015. I was drunk and in an       unfamiliar part of town. An acquaintance offered to give me a       ride when I was leaving a bar and my phone died.    She goes on to describe the attack. She says:         I say this not for shock value, but to emphasize how       painful watching this hearing was and how unsurprised I will       be if Kavanaugh is confirmed.    Unsurprised because she doesn't expect men to treat women fairly who  have been assaulted and have come forward. And everything that has  happened in this Chamber confirms that.   The next letter notes:         As a survivor of sexual assault, this issue is of the       utmost importance. I rarely speak of these events and have       tears streaming down my face just writing this. I was unable       to report my assault for various reasons, including explicit       death threats, fear of exposure by the media, and threats by       several powerful men who had the ability to end my career       before it had even really begun. This situation hits so close       to home that it has been physically painful--physically       painful--for me to watch much of the coverage. I have been       unable to obtain justice for myself, and that is soul-      crushing. But what would be a greater travesty is to allow a       serial predator a lifetime appointment affecting the lives of       every single woman in America. Are we going to be part of a       greater travesty?    Letter No. 19:         As a constituent and a victim, I am writing to you to make       sure that you vote against Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation.       During his hearings, Kavanaugh misled the Judiciary Committee       under oath. He refused to say whether a sitting President       must obey a subpoena and refused to answer whether President       Trump could pardon himself or bribe someone with a pardon.       And now, Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual assault by       multiple women.        Kavanaugh's answers during his confirmation hearings add to       the evidence that Trump nominated him not to protect the  [[Page S6654]]       American people, not to protect the Constitution, but to       protect himself. It was only a few weeks ago that Trump's       former lawyer incriminated him in two felonies. It's becoming       inevitable that a Trump case will reach the Supreme Court,       either over his role in crimes to win the White House or a       subpoena to answer questions from the special counsel.        We already know that Kavanaugh believes sitting presidents       should not be under Federal prosecution or even       investigation. Now, under oath, Kavanaugh isn't even       pretending to be an impartial justice. That is exactly why       Trump nominated Kavanaugh--to be his get-out-of-jail-free       card.    Letter No. 20 begins:         As a rape victim myself, I am livid that this man is even       being considered for a high position. Brett Kavanaugh's views       are extreme. His belligerent behavior during the hearing       shows that he should not sit on the highest court in the       country. I urge you to reject that radical choice of a       justice who would put our basic rights at risk. Use your       constitutional authority of advice and consent to ensure that       the President cannot place unfit extremists in positions of       power that can affect us for decades.        Serving for life on the highest court, justices have the       solemn responsibility to be fair, to be evenhanded, to uphold       the sanctity of our laws and our Constitution, and to keep       faith with the letter and the spirit of the Nation's core,       public health, environmental, civil rights, and labor laws.       His record rejects these principles. Please do all in your       power to stop Brett Kavanaugh's nomination.    Letter after letter reminds us that the Supreme Court is so  important. We should only send individuals to serve on that Bench who  are of unimpeachable character.   Letter No. 21:         I am deeply concerned about Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to       the Supreme Court after hearing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's       story. There is no need to wait to publicly say that you       believe Dr. Ford. She has generously offered more than enough       information for us to fiercely support her.        I, too, am a victim of sexual assault. When I was 21, my       boss at the time raped me, leaving me with a lifelong       disease, and it never was reported. I had no support. I was       embarrassed and humiliated and wanted to just forget about       it. Looking back, I wish I would have tried to report him. I       was a single mother with a 2-year-old child and my 12-year-      old sister present when the assault occurred in the middle of       the night as they slept.        This happened to me in 1974. I am now a 66-year-old woman       who has had relationship problems her whole life and self-      esteem and anxiety and sexual dysfunction ever since.    A lifetime impact from sexual assault.   Each of these women wants us to take seriously the experiences that  were shared, and to take it seriously means we would look into it with  fairness and credibility, but we didn't. The Senate didn't.   Letter No. 22:         It would be beyond unethical to continue with Kavanaugh's       nomination in the wake of Dr. Blasey's story. I am counting       on you. Signed, a MeToo survivor.    Letter No. 23:         As a victim of sexual assault during my military service,       I, too, told next to no one. Why? I wasn't about to subject       myself to being treated the way these courageous women who       have spoken up are being treated. I am counting on you. Thank       you.    We hear this time and again. Women say they didn't speak up because  they thought they would be treated unfairly--unfairly--just the way the  Senate treated the women who came forward and shared their stories  about Brett Kavanaugh. Isn't that a sorry legacy for this body? Isn't  that a shameful result, that women say they didn't speak up because  they thought they would be treated unfairly, just like the Senate is  now unfairly treating Dr. Ford and Debbie Ramirez? Wouldn't it be a  beautiful thing to have done it differently, to have proceeded to say:  Your story matters, so we will talk to those you suggested have  corroborating information. We will report what information there is for  the consideration of the Senate. We do appreciate that you have shared  your experience, and we will look into it.   Wouldn't that have been a very different message to send, an example  to send for everyone across this country--for companies when an  employee reports an assault, for places of worship when a parishioner  reports an assault, for schools, universities, when a student reports  an assault?   Wouldn't it have been great to set an example--a high example of how  to treat an individual fairly? But we did the opposite. We showed  exactly the type of treatment that these women fear--a rigged, unfair,  unconcerned response. But there is time to remedy that by not voting to  confirm.   One of the reasons I am reading these letters is that many of the  women who wrote said they were writing to try to make a difference. My  team called and talked to a number of them, and they encouraged their  letters to be used. They want to be heard. They want to be honored with  our intention that we care about the experiences they have suffered,  that we take them seriously. They want us to think about what we have  done and take Dr. Ford and Debbie Ramirez seriously. That hasn't  happened, but there is still time by not confirming Brett Kavanaugh.   In this letter, the individual says:         How you vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is one of the       most crucial votes you will cast. Please vote no.        Prior to hearing this round of hearings, I was concerned       about his ability to be truthful. Now, as a survivor, I am       fearful for the entire female population. I urge you to vote       no for all of those reasons.    Letter No. 25:         I believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. I do not believe a man       who could have stifled a frightened woman's screams while he       felt entitled to put his hands on her body without her       permission. I do not believe such a person is fit for one of       the highest courts in our country. She took a lie detector       test. He did not. She called for an FBI investigation. He did       not. She was calm and collected. He was not.        As a sexual assault survivor and your constituent, I       implore you to stand with women.    Letter No. 26:         Thank you for fighting. I was a victim of sexual assault at       age 12. I am now 71. I remember it vividly. It has affected       my whole life. If Kavanaugh is confirmed, we will put a       horrible man on our highest court.    Thank you for highlighting the serious deficiencies in the process of  President Trump's nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, to the Supreme Court.   Letter No. 27:         I am heartened by your efforts and like-minded Members of       Congress who have joined the 21st century, many whose eyes,       ears, hearts, and minds have witnessed the scourge of sexual       misconduct. I am a 58-year-old Native American, native       Oregonian. I grew up on a Catholic Indian mission with both       my parents and seven brothers and sisters. Later in life, I       recalled through discussions with my younger sister that my       older brothers had most likely sexually abused me when I was       a very young girl, less than 7 years old. I never reported it       because I didn't recall it until I was in my 40s. My parents       were alive and it would have destroyed them.        I am a sexual assault survivor who never told my best       friend in high school when one rape occurred.    She proceeds to share information about several other assaults when  she was serving in the Army, and she says that each time, she didn't  report it.         All of these incidents left me fearful, feeling vulnerable,       psychologically damaged, PTSD, emotional trauma, physical       trauma, and other problems too incalculable to quantify.    I think these topics are often not discussed. Women in our own lives  may have had experiences they have never shared with us, thinking that  they might be blamed, feeling that they are ashamed, considering that  they might not be believed, anticipating that they might expect that we  would feel they should somehow have prevented it or somehow invited it.  All of these conflicts--they sense they will not be treated with  respect and dignity as the victims they are. Let's treat them with  respect and dignity when they bring forward their stories.         Dear Senator Merkley: I have never taken the time to write       a Senator. With Trump as President, or having Trump as       President has caused depression and anxiety, but I have       gritted my teeth, battened down the hatches, and tried to       weather the storm. However, this saga with Kavanaugh has       mobilized me to speak out and protest a person of his moral       ineptitude.        I am a victim of sexual assault. I am sure you're hearing       the outpouring of messages like mine from hundreds of women.       I am so angry and so bitter about the current environment       that promotes racism, sexism. The things I have seen voted in       make me despair.    Rather than the Senate behave in a way that makes women despair, what  if we behaved in a way that inspired, set an example, had people say:  We didn't think you would rise to the challenge because so often we  have seen mistreatment when they bring forward their stories, but you  shocked us because you took it seriously and you treated these women  fairly. Wouldn't that be a beautiful story rather than the reality of  where we are right now?   Letter No. 29:   [[Page S6655]]              There are a number of viable options for this Supreme Court       seat--individuals not accused of any crimes--and regardless       of innocence or guilt, Kavanaugh has shown himself to be       unqualified to remain impartial as a judge. Furthermore, the       backlash of there being any question of guilt regarding rape       accusations is too great for him to successfully fulfill the       duties of that position and will cause a division between       voters that will likely never be healed.        Speaking as both a concerned voter and rape survivor, there       is no legitimate reason that we cannot find another candidate       for this job. If he is appointed despite these allegations,       it will be all but impossible for a rape survivor to ever       feel safe in the U.S. again. How could we if an accused       rapist is presiding as a member of the highest court in the       country?    She makes a point. There are many other people who can be considered  to be brought forward. Why this individual who demonstrated such  partisanship? Why this individual who bent and, yes, broke the truth  many times before the committee? Why this individual who wrote  offensive, mocking, accusing, disgracing things, attacking a woman in  his yearbook? Why this individual who chose to join a fraternity with a  reputation for assaulting women? Why this individual who chose to join  a secret society with a similar reputation? Why this individual about  whom credible women have come forward and shared their stories of  assault? And why this individual when we had the full opportunity to  have considered the corroborating information from 28 individuals who  they asked that we talk to and we didn't?   There is still time to reject this nomination and somehow restore the  tarnished reputation that is the product of the behavior of this body  during this nomination process.   Letter No. 30:         I am 66 years old, nearly 67. I can tell you exactly what       occurred when I was a victim of sexual assault and attempted       rape at age 16. It was burned into my memory and will forever       be a part of me.        I continue to be shaken to the core that anyone would       explain such behavior as normal, part of young men growing       up. It is unconscionable, unacceptable, and must no longer be       ignored.    Letter No. 31:         Dear Senator Merkley, I am reaching out to you as a       survivor of teenage rape. Like so many other survivors, I       have been following the events surrounding Judge Kavanaugh's       nomination with so much emotion that I cannot really begin to       express it. I do not believe that I need to ask you to say no       when it comes to a floor vote, but I want you to add my voice       to the many who are speaking out in the hope that the country       will listen.        Sexual assault affects millions of girls, boys, women, and       men. Too many of us live our lives in shame and silence,       disbelieved if not outright blamed.        Nearly 30 years have passed since a fellow student in my       small town high school took my innocence, to then proceed to       publicly shame me. People believed him, not me.        This has to stop. People need to realize that we may forget       some details, but we will never, never forget what happened.       And when we know the perpetrator, we will never forget his       name. He may grow old. His appearance may change. But his       name will remain etched in our brains forever.    She goes on to say:         Putting Kavanaugh on the court means telling all of us, the       countless millions, that we do not matter.    She closes by saying:         We matter. I matter.    Yes, you do. And when you say that you are adding your voice to the  many who are speaking out in the hope that the country will listen, I  commend you. I commend you for being brave enough to share your story  and to ask those in this Chamber to listen. But so far, they have not  listened because listening would mean treating with respect and dignity  the women coming forward. Listening would mean giving these women the  opportunity not just to present their case, their experience, but to  have those who can corroborate their information come before the  Judiciary Committee and share their stories. Listening would mean  insisting that the FBI actually talk to the corroborators rather than  not talk to the corroborators.    So you have not been listened to, I am sorry to report, but there is  still time for someone--for several people--to say: We have reflected  on this situation and realize how unfair and unjust we have been, how  much we add to the trauma of millions of women by not listening to the  women who have come forward, not taking them seriously, and rigging the  system, as they feared would happen.   This individual writes:         I have a voice even if those screams were stifled inside of       me so long ago. Today that voice says that Kavanaugh is not       fit to be a member of the Supreme Court.        Beyond the details of what transpired when he was a       teenager, his atrocious display during Thursday's hearing       should disqualify him outright. Integrity, level-headedness,       respect for the rule of law, and lack of partisan bias should       be fundamental requirements of any justice.        Kavanaugh did not display any of those traits. His       confirmation would stain the Senate and the judiciary for       years to come if not permanently.        I will conclude by saying that Dr. Ford's incredible       courage has helped me more than any therapy session. She       spoke. In speaking her truth to power, she spoke for all of       us.        I have shed so many tears watching and following these       proceedings, but finally feel like I can stand tall, that I       do not need to hide or live in shame. Her story is, in so       many ways, my story. The smart girl who loved math and       somehow made it through Stanford, completed a PhD, and       embarked in a career in research despite the trauma that       followed. . . .        All too often we hide behind a smile and mask of strength       so that people do not see that inside we cannot stop shaking.        Lawmakers would be well advised to not underestimate the       strength of our power when we raise our heads, shed our shame       and reclaim our voices. We may tremble, but we will speak. We       will be heard. We will NOT be dismissed.    Letter No. 32:         I am a victim of sexual abuse as a child, rape as a young       adult, and sexual harassment during my professional career. I       am also a successful practicing Child/Adolescent/Adult       psychiatrist, with 20+ years of experience.        Since Ms. Ford's testimony, on Friday I saw two female       walk-in patients, one of whom revealed to me her own sexual       assault, which occurred around the time of Ms. Ford's. She       confessed this is the first time she has told anyone about       this. The other woman I saw that day told a similar story.       From the press I understand crisis lines lit up all over our       nation, doubling their traffic in some cases.        I write because I am worried. The press reports that only       two of the three women making complaints against Mr.       Kavanaugh will be interviewed by the FBI. . . .        I am concerned that only two of the three alleged victims .       . . will be heard. To establish a pattern . . . the FBI must       include as many credible victims and witnesses as possible .       . . particularly given the timelines and deadlines they are       up against.        Statistics on rape in the United States are shockingly       high, higher even than many less developed countries.    She was concerned the FBI would not be able to speak and interview  those who could corroborate the experiences. It turned out far worse  than she could ever have imagined: 0 for 28--0 out of 28. Not, well, we  talked to 5 out of 28. Not we talked to 8 out of 28. The FBI was 0 out  of 28, not because the FBI would choose to do that but because they  could only talk to people whom they were allowed to talk to by the  President's scoping instructions. Those instructions were not to talk  to anyone who had credible supporting information. That is such a  violation of fairness, of due process, of justice.   There is that beautiful set of words carved into the front of the  Supreme Court: ``Equal justice under law.'' Wouldn't anyone who had the  right character to serve there have insisted--insisted--that these  women get fair treatment? But we didn't hear Judge Kavanaugh insisting.  He didn't even want an FBI investigation. He certainly didn't insist on  there being one that actually talked to the people who had information.  If your conscience is clean, if your life experience is clear, you  don't fear an investigation.   This letter goes on:         Furthermore, currently our Congress and Senate do not       reflect the 50.5% of Americans who are female. In fact, in       2017 US female representation by gender in Congress and the       Senate was far lower in the US than Germany, France, United       Kingdom, Sweden, Belgium, Netherlands and Spain.    She cites the source as the Inter-Parliamentary Union Parline  Database on National Parliaments.         As a result we rely on men to understand and act on this       predominantly female problem. American women depend on your       gallantry to ensure our government does right by us.        I plead with you to persuade our leaders to do the right       thing. Think of your mother, your wife, your daughter and the       women you love. Show us we are valued. As you make your phone       calls know American women watch with fear and hope. Don't let       us down.    Did we treat Dr. Ford and Debbie Ramirez in the way we would want our  mother, our wife, our daughter, or the women we love to be treated?
