 Mr. Speaker, in Iowa, the official start of summer  also brings the official start of county fair season.   All 99 counties in Iowa have a county fair that brings together kids,  families, 4H, FFA, farmers, and the broader community for their games,  fair food, arts and crafts, the showing of livestock, concerts, tractor  pulls, and also car races.   The amount of work young people put into raising bottle-to-bucket  calf, hogs, horses, chickens, rabbits, sheep, goats, and even llamas is  incredible. They take great pride in showing their animals at the fair,  and they develop tremendous confidence.   There are also static exhibits, which are arts and crafts. At one of  the county fairs, I met Wesley, who was going into the first grade, and  he showed his pencil drawings, photographs, cupcakes that he baked, and  also his corn for that group. He won 10 blue ribbons at the age of 6.   The fair is such a great opportunity for families to get together and  young people to develop the confidence they need to succeed in life. It  is a wonderful summer educational opportunity packed with hands-on  learning in a fun-filled week.   I encourage everyone to visit a county fair in their own State, and I  applaud all of our children's dedication, compassion, and work ethic.                            ____________________
