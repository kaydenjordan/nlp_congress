 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, yesterday we welcomed the President,  the Vice President, and the family of the late Reverend Billy Graham as  he lay in honor in the Capitol. This is a very rare tribute--even rarer  for an American without government or military service--but it  perfectly suits the remarkable man whose preaching inspired millions  worldwide, who counseled Presidents and world leaders across  generations, and whom an entire nation came to know as America's  pastor.   Billy Graham's powerful preaching and his historic revivals brought  so many closer to God because his work was not ultimately about him.  ``The secret of my work,'' he explained, ``is God. I would be nothing  without him.'' His personal strengths and talents were mighty, but it  was his kindness, his humility, and his total fidelity to faith and  family that defined his life and his ministry.   I am glad that Congress could honor the great Reverend Graham in this  way. Yesterday, thousands--thousands--of Americans packed the Rotunda  down the hall to pay their respects. All across the country, people are  giving thanks for the extraordinary contributions of this good and  faithful servant.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.
