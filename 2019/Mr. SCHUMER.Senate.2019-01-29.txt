 Madam President, hundreds of thousands of Federal  workers are, thank God, returning to work this week to tackle a backlog  that has been building for over a month. Over that time, the U.S.  economy suffered a loss of $11 billion, according to the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office--$11 billion for the President's temper  tantrum, including $3 billion that can never be recovered. That is an  expensive temper tantrum. The individual costs are even harder than the  big numbers.   Who knows how many Federal workers missed a doctor's appointment or  fell behind on their payments because they weren't getting their  paychecks. Federal contractors will not get backpay and may have lost  health insurance entirely during the shutdown. Senator Smith is working  on legislation to fix that problem.   While even Federal employees and contractors are returning to work,  they still might be digging out of the hole that the Trump shutdown put  them in. I hope this serves as a lesson to President Trump and all of  my Republican colleagues--no more shutdown. We cannot repeat this same  nightmare scenario in 3 weeks when the CR expires. We Democrats will  not shut down the government. We hope President Trump has learned his  lesson. He touched a very hot stove. We hope our Republican colleagues  will join us, as they did last Thursday, to make sure there is no  shutdown. Thankfully, I have heard several of my colleagues say that. A  number of them, including some of the most senior Republicans, have  said we shouldn't have another shutdown. So we look forward to working  with you to avoid that in every possible way.   The House and Senate conferees should strive, instead, to find common  ground where it already exists and build from there. The good news is  they begin with plenty to work with. Democrats and Republicans agree on  the need for stronger border security measures at our ports of entry as  well as the need for more humanitarian assistance. That is a good place  to start.   Plenty of column inches have been dedicated to the discussion of  areas where Republicans and Democrats have friction, but several times  over the past 2 years, Congress has come together to reach big  compromises, including two budget agreements and a landmark Russia  sanctions bill. The common theme of those agreements is that the  President stayed out of the  [[Page S726]]  negotiations. Because President Trump gave Congress space to find a  deal on our own, we were able to strike an accord. That is what we will  need again if the conference committee is to succeed, because the  President has no understanding of what the realities are in this Senate  and in the House and no consistency in what he says one day and what he  says the next. As I said, negotiating with President Trump is like  negotiating with Jell-O.   So let Democrats and Republicans, the House and Senate, come to an  agreement, and my guess is we can avoid a shutdown.                                    Huawei    Madam President, on another matter, yesterday afternoon, the  Department of Justice unveiled nearly two dozen charges against the  Chinese telecom Huawei in two indictments--one for the evasion of  sanctions on Iran and another for its attempts to steal sensitive  intellectual property from T-Mobile in the United States.   I am so glad the Justice Department announced these indictments  yesterday. China has been flouting international sanction laws and,  even worse, stealing IP and know-how for the last decade. State- connected telecom giants like Huawei are an example of how China  operates. They are not the exception. They are the rule in China.   When China wants to supplant U.S. dominance in an emerging industry,  it acts rapaciously. It steals. Our law enforcement needs to be  especially vigilant with Chinese telecom companies such as Huawei and  CTE, which intend to displace U.S. communications networks with their  own 5G networks because those could give China access to all kinds of  sensitive information. U.S. authorities should be prosecuting Huawei's  criminal violations to the fullest extent of the law. I give the  administration credit for having this suit go forward, but my message  to President Trump now is this: Don't back down. While the Trump  administration has shown signs of being tougher on China than either  the Bush or Obama administration--which I commend them--President Trump  has also tried the conciliatory approach, particularly at the moment  when the administration is engaged in negotiations with the Chinese.    Just last year, President Trump let ZTE, another state-backed Chinese  telecom that violated trade sanctions, off the hook in the hopes of  achieving concessions from China on North Korea that never  materialized. In December, the President said he would ``certainly  intervene'' in the Huawei case if he thought it were necessary to  achieve a trade deal with China.   President Trump, do not make the same mistake you made with ZTE by  interfering with the Justice Department's prosecution of Huawei. The  United States should not make any concessions unless and until China  makes credible and enforceable commitments to end all forms of theft  and extortion of American intellectual property, which is exactly what  Huawei is accused of.                                Koch Brothers    Madam President, finally, a comment on the Koch brothers. I read a  column with interest today in the Washington Post. The Koch network has  been trying to rebrand itself as less partisan. They are saying: Let's  bring us together. Let's work with both sides.   That is a good instinct, but color me skeptical. The Koch brothers  may sit out the Presidential contest, as they did in 2016, but their  political arm, Americans for Prosperity, continues to support  candidates who are divisive, who do not bring us together. Some of the  ads you see, the very candidates they support, are dividing us. You  can't, on the one hand, say you want to bring us together and use your  political arm to tear us apart. Yet that is what the Koch brothers are  doing.   They support the kind of judges who agree with them on all the  corporate stuff. They don't want regulation, but they are against  voting rights. How does that bring us together? They are against  immigrants. How does that bring us together? At the State level, the  Koch brothers' network of affiliates continues to support so many  different initiatives that divide us. Through support for shadowy think  tanks and pseudoacademic institutions, the Koch brothers continue to  fund studies that sow doubt about climate change and evangelize  deregulation.   It seems their highest priority is still to help the rich and  powerful, no matter how divisive it is, as long as we can get our  corporate taxes cut even further, cut the taxes for the wealthy, and  stop the protections by preventing government regulations for average  folks. As long as they do that, all this talk about coming together and  supporting an occasional bill here and there doesn't mean much.   I hope that this beginning of what the Koch brothers say spreads. I  hope it is not just sort of a figleaf because they are getting such bad  publicity, and America is moving so far away from what they believe.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
