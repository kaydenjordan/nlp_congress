 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   As you know, the difficulty is, when we take away the managing of a  business operation from that underlying business, the incentive to  innovate and to serve consumers is likely to dissipate.   The internet, for decades, has thrived because it was not under the  heavy hand of government. Because of this freedom, we are now on the  brink of accessing the fifth generation of broadband technology that,  when fully implemented, will eliminate the need for net neutrality  regulations because latency for all content will be almost zero.   I don't think you find any disagreement that blocking, throttling,  and paid prioritization are not practices that anyone wants as a part  of the open internet. But classifying broadband internet as a  telecommunications service under title II of the Telecommunication Act  of 1934 will limit the ability of service providers to respond to  consumer demands and potentially result in disruptions due to content  neutrality requirements.   Republicans have introduced three proposals to preserve a free and  open internet. I hope we can work together, going forward, to achieve  that laudable goal.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.   This amendment directs the Comptroller General of the United States  to submit to Congress a report examining the influence of all entities  on the virtuous cycle of the internet ecosystem and whether such rules  protect the access of consumers to a free and open internet.   A portion of a consumer's online experience is through social media  platforms and through other edge providers. Examples of this would  include Facebook, Google, Twitter, and YouTube, among others.                                time  1630    Nothing in the Save the Internet Act reviews all parts of the  internet ecosystem. Yet, so-called edge providers are the services  exercising the most discretion over content delivery.   As we saw last year with testimony in the Energy and Commerce  Committee from Facebook and Twitter, the algorithms written by these  companies are proprietary, and those proprietary algorithms may  manipulate consumer access. We understand the role of these service  providers and how each is weighted against the others. We have  transparency rules for broadband providers, but not for edge providers.   The bill targets broadband service providers by reclassifying them as  utilities under title II of the Communications Act, but we cannot  achieve effective net neutrality principles without including the  influence of edge providers on the internet ecosystem. For this reason,  the amendment simply directs the Government Accountability Office to  study the full internet ecosystem so that we can better understand the  influence of all online entities in order to protect access to a free  and open internet for every consumer.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the valuable ranking member of the full committee.    Madam Chair, again, this bill targets broadband service  providers by reclassifying them as utilities under title II of the  Communications Act, but we cannot achieve net neutrality principles  without including the influence of edge providers on the internet  ecosystem.   For this reason, the amendment simply directs the GAO to study the  full ecosystem so that we can understand the influence of all online  entities and, again, provide a free and open internet for every  consumer.   Madam Chair, I certainly want to thank the chairman of the  subcommittee and thank the ranking member of the full committee for  participating in this amendment discussion.   Madam Chair, I urge an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
