 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the historic  achievements of Ron Klain, one of the best chiefs of staff in modern  American history.   Ron Klain helped craft the American Rescue Plan, finally prioritizing  working families and the middle class.   Ron Klain helped implement the President's vaccine plan that made  Americans return to normal life.   He was key, in a closely divided House and Senate, to passing the  CHIPS and Science Act. He was key to the infrastructure bill, to help  the House caucus come together, progressives and moderates, and  Republicans.   Ron Klain succeeded because he had personal relationships with so  many Members. I believe when history is written, he will be regarded as  one of the best chiefs of staff.                            ____________________
