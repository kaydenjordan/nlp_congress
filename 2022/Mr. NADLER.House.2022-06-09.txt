 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1153, I call  up the bill (H.R. 2377) to authorize the issuance of extreme risk  protection orders, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2377.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, over the past several weeks, we have watched in horror  as gun violence has touched communities across the country and dozens  of people, young and old, have lost their lives. The details of each  case may differ, each tragic in its own way, but there is one theme  that comes up most often; someone deeply troubled, experiencing some  sort of crisis, had easy access to firearms. And all too often, the  warning signs were clear, but nothing was done to keep guns out of  their hands before it was too late.   H.R. 2377, the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act, provides a  sensible means by which someone who is exhibiting dangerous behavior  can be prevented from possessing or purchasing firearms before tragedy  strikes.   This legislation, introduced by Representative Lucy McBath,  authorizes Federal courts to issue an extreme risk protection order, or  ERPO, temporarily removing firearms from a person in crisis and  preventing them from purchasing firearms. This only occurs after the  court determines that there is evidence demonstrating that the person  poses an imminent danger of injuring himself, herself, or others.   The bill also includes legislation by Representative Salud Carbajal,  which provides funding to States to enact ERPO statutes of their own.   We know that extreme risk laws save lives. We have witnessed their  effectiveness in State after State, beginning in 2016, when California  passed the first such law. Since then, 18 other States and the District  of Columbia have enacted similar laws.   An analysis of the first 3 years of California's extreme risk law  found  [[Page H5420]]  that these orders were used for 58 mass shooting threats, including six  in which a minor threatened to target a school.   These orders were also used in response to 82 threats of suicide, and  they worked. No suicides occurred among individuals who were subject to  the orders.   Federal courts have long been bastions of due process and,  accordingly, this legislation includes strong due process provisions  that strike the appropriate balance between protecting the rights of  the gun owner and ensuring community safety. Every court that has  reviewed laws similar to this bill has found that the procedural  safeguards are sufficient.   And as then-Seventh Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett wrote, ``History  is consistent with common sense: It demonstrates that legislatures have  the power to prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns.''   Madam Speaker, the Constitution does not require us to wait until  lives are lost.   As we address the scourge of gun violence, a blight that killed  45,000 Americans in 2020 alone, let us remember that there are no  perfect solutions. We are painfully aware that we cannot do enough to  save every life, and there is no one answer that will solve this  problem.   But we do know that taking guns out of the hands of people who pose a  danger to themselves or others would save countless lives. This  legislation would take meaningful steps to prevent gun violence  tragedies in our communities while, at the same time, protecting the  due process of rights of those individuals in crisis.   I thank Representatives McBath and Carbajal for their leadership on  this issue. I urge all Members to support the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. McBath), the sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an extra 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a June 7, 2022,  Washington Post article titled ``No, red-flag gun laws don't violate  due process rights.''                         [From the Washington Post]           No, Red-Flag Gun Laws Don't Violate Due Process Rights   such laws, also known as `extreme-risk protection orders,' are popular   and are embraced by some republican politicians. but some gun-rights      activists say they violate the fifth and fourteenth amendments.       (Perspective by Joseph Blocher and Jake Charles, June 7, 2022)         ``Red flag'' laws, which allow guns to be temporarily taken       from people who pose a risk of harm to themselves or others,       are one of the few gun-safety regulations that currently have       bipartisan support. ``Tm generally inclined to think some       kind of red-flag law is a good idea,'' Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.)       said last week, after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.       Key senators have told reporters it's possible an agreement       could be reached this week on legislation that would include       a provision incentivizing more states to pass such laws.        There is strong popular support for red-flag laws--also       known as extreme-risk laws--in both parties, and more than a       dozen states have adopted them in the past few years alone       (bringing the total to 19 plus the District of Columbia).       Social science research suggests that they work, most       strikingly in preventing gun suicides.        So what prevents their wider adoption, including at the       federal level? Some gun-rights advocates and their allies in       Congress say they violate the due process clauses of the       Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. ``Depriving citizens of       Life, Liberty, or Property, without Due Process, is a clear       violation of our Constitution,'' Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)       tweeted last week. ``Every member of Congress swears an oath       to `support and defend' the Constitution. Voting for, or       introducing, Red Flag Laws is a blatant violation of that       oath.''        But such criticisms are off base. Politicians considering       red-flag laws, whether in Congress or state legislatures,       should do so based on an accurate understanding of what the       Constitution requires. It indeed guarantees ``due process of       law'' whenever the government seeks to deprive a person of       ``life, liberty, or property.'' But the basic design of       existing extreme-risk laws is fully consistent with       constitutional commands, as we showed in a recent law review       article.        In the states where they exist, here's how red-flag laws       work: A limited set of people--law enforcement officers,       family or household members, and sometimes others--can       petition a judge to issue an ``extreme-risk protection       order'' (ERPO) requiring a person to temporarily surrender       his or her firearms and refrain from acquiring new ones.       Depending on the state, the burden of proof the petitioner       must meet (to establish that the gun owner indeed presents a       risk) varies from ``probable cause'' to ``clear and       convincing'' evidence. If the petition is successful, the       court can enter a short-term emergency ERPO, usually lasting       two weeks or less. In many cases, that's all that is needed--      the crisis can be averted. A longer-term ERPO can only be       entered after a full hearing at which the petitioner again       bears the burden of proof, usually at a higher threshold, and       at which the gun owner can contest the order.        If there is a constitutional flaw in this basic structure,       it has apparently escaped notice of the entire United States       judiciary: Courts have unanimously rejected Second Amendment       and due process challenges to ERPO laws, and for good reason.        Perhaps surprisingly, the Second Amendment has not been the       focus of the constitutional complaints. That's because even       ardent Second Amendment defenders like Justice Amy Coney       Barrett recognize that ``legislatures have the power to       prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns''--as Barrett       wrote in 2019 case, when she was a judge on the U.S. Court of       Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Courts reviewing extreme-      risk laws have upheld them on that very basis. In 2016, for       example, a Connecticut appellate court relied on U.S. Supreme       Court precedent in holding that Connecticut's statute ``does       not implicate the second amendment, as it does not restrict       the right oflawabiding, responsible citizens to use arms in       defense of their homes.''        The crux of the political debate has therefore focused on       due process--although due-process challenges to red-flag laws       have fared no better. Nor should they have. A prime complaint       about red-flag laws is that they allow an order to issue       before the gun owner has an opportunity to contest the       evidence, but the Supreme Court has long recognized that       there are ``extraordinary situations where some valid       governmental interest is at stake that justifies postponing       the hearing until after the event,'' as Justice John Marshall       Harlan II wrote in a 1971 case. Examples include restraining       orders filed by one domestic partner against another, civil       commitments for mental illness and the temporary removal of       children from parental custody in emergency situations (for       instance, when there are credible allegations of abuse). In       situations like these, delaying urgent action until after a       full hearing can lead to catastrophic outcomes.  [[Page H5422]]         Given that the Constitution allows emergency action to       temporarily remove a person's child before a full hearing,       it's hard to argue that it prohibits emergency action to       temporarily remove a person's guns. Quite simply, the       Constitution does not require society to wait until the       trigger is pulled.        Though they vary in their particulars, existing extreme-      risk laws contain several important procedural safeguards       that the Supreme Court has recognized help to forestall abuse       and ensure due process. They impose the burden on the       petitioner to convince an independent third party; they       guarantee active judicial oversight and provide a prompt       hearing focusing on the degree of risk; and many states       provide specific criminal penalties for filing false or       harassing extreme-risk petitions (in addition to existing       punishments for perjury).        Understanding constitutional requirements is important not       only for lawyers and judges, but for those debating gun       regulation in public discourse. Time and again, arguments       based on misunderstandings of the Constitution have been used       to derail reasonable gun regulation. After Sandy Hook, for       example, an overwhelming majority of Americans wanted to       expand the existing system of background checks for gun       sales. Of the minority opposed--some strongly so--the most       common reason was that doing so would violate the Second       Amendment, yet that position has no support in legal       doctrine.        We should not once again make the mistake of blaming the       Constitution for inaction on gun laws. The structure of       extreme-risk laws is entirely consistent with not only the       Second Amendment but also the consitutional guarantee of due       process.     Madam Speaker, I want to excoriate as absolute nonsense,  pernicious nonsense, what we just heard from Mr. Johnson, from Mrs.  Lesko, and what I presume we will hear for the rest of the debate on  this bill.   Red flag laws are in effect in 19 States and the District of  Columbia. Every court that has considered them has found them  constitutional. Every court has said that they meet the requirements of  procedural due process--every single court.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Republican speakers obviously have more regard for their politics and  for the National Rifle Association than they do for the lives of our  children. We see that every moment here, when they keep repeating the  words that this is unconstitutional, when courts in 18 States and the  District of Columbia have found them constitutional, and Supreme Court  Justice Amy Coney Barrett, on the 7th Circuit, said: History is  consistent with common sense. It demonstrates that legislatures have  the power to prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns.   So I don't think we should hear lectures on Democrats don't care  about due process. We do. We also care about children's lives.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson), chairman of the Gun Violence  Prevention Task Force.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on  each side?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, extreme risk laws save lives, it is that simple.  Ultimately, that is what this debate should be about--saving lives.  This legislation strikes a proper balance between protecting the due  process rights of people in crisis and preventing tragedy by ensuring  that those who pose an imminent danger to themselves or others do not  have access to firearms.   Madam Speaker, this debate has been surreal. Every court that has  considered the question has concluded that red flag laws afford proper  due process and are constitutional. We already know that extreme risk  laws work, but less than half the States have those laws in effect.   Madam Speaker, let us pass this legislation today, so we can bring  access to this life-savings tool nationwide. We know it is not enough.  We know we need all the provisions of the bill we passed yesterday, and  we should bring back the assault weapons ban. But what we cannot do  should not block us from doing what we can do. We can save thousands of  lives annually, so let us begin.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
