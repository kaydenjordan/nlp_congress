 Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I want  to highlight a Latina trailblazer, Diana Vesga. This remarkable woman  is the chief operating officer of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,  the largest art museum in the western United States.   Prior of joining the museum in 2014, she worked as an investment  banker and as a senior executive at Univision.   A Colombian immigrant, she is one of the few Latinas in art museum  leadership and only one of a few women to hold a chief operating  officer position among the top art museums in the country. Just 10  percent of museum administrators nationwide are Hispanic or Latino, and  even fewer are Latinas.   Diana grew up in a family of artists and art leaders and has used her  unique perspective to embrace and value all cultures as the museum  expands. As the new Smithsonian Museum of the American Latino is in  development, we could use her wisdom and the wisdom of other Latinas  and Latinos in the industry.   Mr. Speaker, Diana is an inspiration to Latinas everywhere.                           Support Medicaid Funding     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to support funding for  Medicaid, a crucial program saving millions of lives, including Latino  lives.   Eager to balance our budget on the backs of poor people, my  Republican colleagues have proposed extreme cuts to Medicaid. Medicaid  has served and transformed millions of lives, especially in minority  communities. Medicaid has been a vital lifeline for Latino communities  which face disproportionate health crises, from diabetes to mental  illness.   Since 2013, Medicaid expansion has cut the rate of uninsured Latinos  in half, and Latino youth now make up over a third of children on  Medicaid. This is a critical program and critical coverage for Latino  communities.   It means a little boy struggling with chronic depression has access  to mental health care. It means a working daughter can spend more time  at home caring for her mother with Alzheimer's. It means less medical  debt, fewer hospitalizations, and greater access to preventative care.   To cut costs, Republicans have suggested we impose work requirements,  cut funding, or repeal the Affordable Care Act all together. All of  these ideas would strip healthcare coverage from poor Americans who  depend on Medicaid.   Republicans claim they want to balance our budget. In reality, they  want to slash critical programs for underserved groups. The single  mother of three who spends all day taking care of her children should  not lose access to healthcare. The disabled senior who can't survive  outside of an assisted living facility should not lose access to  healthcare. The little girl with leukemia whose immigrant parents can't  afford a cancer screening should not lose access to healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to protect Medicaid and invest in  expanding it. Millions of Americans are depending on it.  [[Page H1473]]                                ____________________
