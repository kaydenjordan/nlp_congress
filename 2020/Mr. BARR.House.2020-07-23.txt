 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to  this appropriations package that highlights the need to use all the  tools in America's tool kit to counter the Chinese Communist Party and  the totalitarian government in Beijing.   My amendment shows bipartisan support for the United States  International Development Finance Corporation and its important work to  counter China's Belt and Road Initiative.   As a member of the House's China Task Force and former chair of the  House Financial Service's Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade  with jurisdiction over the Treasury Department's national security  portfolio, I am keenly aware of the threat that China poses through its  Belt and Road Initiative and direct foreign investment internationally.   While we will never match China dollar for dollar in government  subsidies, agencies like DFC can leverage the unlimited potential of  the private sector to counter China's model of debt-trap diplomacy and  colonialism.   I am proud to support DFC in promoting private investment in  developing countries, its role in advancing U.S. global development  goals and economic interests, and offering an alternative to China's  malign investment overseas.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.
