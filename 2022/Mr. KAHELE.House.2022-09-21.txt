 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Hawaiian  History Month in my home State of Hawaii.   Today, I recognize David La'amea Kalakaua, who was elected king in  1874 and served until his death in 1891. He was the first governing  monarch to visit Washington and circumnavigate the globe.   In 1882, he completed the construction of Iolani Palace, the only  home of royalty in the United States, which still stands today on the  island of O'ahu. A man of science, King Kalakaua outfitted Iolani  Palace with indoor plumbing, a telephone, and electric lights. Iolani  Palace even had electricity before the White House.   A patron of Hawaiian music and dance, Kalakaua is fondly known as the  Merrie Monarch. In my hometown of Hilo, the annual Merrie Monarch Hula  Festival is held in his honor and attracts thousands from around the  globe. This year marks the festival's 60th anniversary.   We are forever grateful to King David Kalakaua for inspiring the  continuation of our people and our Native Hawaiian culture.                            ____________________
