 Mr. Speaker, I will be brief, and I will  speak at the end of the Special Order as well if there is time.   Mr. Speaker, in 1973 the U.S. Supreme Court abandoned women and  babies to what is now the multibillion dollar abortion industry, and  almost 63\1/2\ million unborn children have been killed, a staggering  loss of children's lives that is more than the entire population of  Italy.   Now, by at least affirming the constitutionality of the Mississippi  law after 15 weeks, which we are all hoping and praying for, the  Supreme Court may finally take a powerful step towards inclusion,  respect, and justice for the weakest and most vulnerable nearly 50  years after the infamous findings of Roe v. Wade.   Tomorrow thousands will march for life here in the capital and across  the country.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris), who is a medical  doctor, an anesthesiologist at Johns Hopkins, and co-chairman of the  Pro-Life Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Mrs. Fischbach), co-chair of the Pro-Life Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Fischbach for her  powerful and eloquent witness for life, both in the legislature in  Minnesota and now in the U.S. House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot). I would  note that he is the prime author of two breakthrough laws. One is  called the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, which is law, and the Born- Alive Infants Protection Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Bergman), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership.   I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), a  distinguished attorney before coming to Congress and number four in the  line of leadership in the Republican Party.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership.   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), a medical  doctor. So many of our leaders in the pro-life effort both in this  Congress and legislation across the country are medical doctors and  healthcare professionals.    Thank you very much, doctor, for your  leadership and eloquence.   I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Cline).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  strong statement.   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  sharing that beautiful story about his son Freddie.   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), another good  friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his  comments.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  remarks and wish her congratulations.   I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Rosendale).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  comments and leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert),  a good friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much  for sharing that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Fulcher), my  good friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta), and I  thank him for his leadership on his pending bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo),  my friend and colleague and leader in the pro-life movement as well.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very  much.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  reminding us that the Chinese Communist Party and North Korea both have  policies like ours, especially as it relates to up-to-birth abortions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership all these many years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    I now yield to the distinguished gentlewoman  from Tennessee (Mrs. Harshbarger), who is also a pharmacist.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt), a friend and colleague for several  decades.    I now yield to the gentleman from Kansas  (Mr. Mann).    I now recognize the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson). As I said before, there are doctors who  are outspoken in their defense of life, Dr. Thompson is one of those.     Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald), a good friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, today, after decades of noble  struggle and sacrifice, pro-life Americans are hopeful that government- sanctioned violence against children and the exploitation of women by  abortion may be nearing an end, although in a very real way the  struggle to defend innocent human life now enters a critically  important new phase.   Because of the Dobbs case, because the Supreme Court has finally  seemingly accepted a relook at Roe v. Wade and subsequent decisions,  the Federal Government and the States-based suit have new authority to  protect the weakest and the most vulnerable among us. Protection for  unborn children is at a tipping point. In 2022, the Supreme Court can  begin dismantling the culture of death that it has imposed on America.   Mr. Speaker, for decades and right up to this very moment, abortion  supporters have gone through extraordinary lengths to ignore, to  trivialize, and to cover up the battered baby victim. With stolid  resolve, they defend the indefensible.   Why does dismembering a child with sharp knives, pulverizing a child  with powerful suction devices, chemically poisoning a baby with any  number of toxic chemicals--one method euphemistically called medical  abortion--why does all of this fail to elicit so much as a scintilla of  empathy, mercy, or compassion from the so-called pro-choice crowd?   Have the physical and emotional consequences of women been  underreported? You bet they have. I have been in the pro-life movement  for almost 50 years. Both my wife, Marie, and I do work with a lot of  women who have had abortions. They tell us stories of agony that, just  like the fact of the unborn child's worth and dignity, has been  trivialized by the other side of this issue.   Mr. Speaker, why are children born alive during some late-term  abortions not given the same standard of care and respect as premature  infants born at that very same age? They are left to die, or they are  just killed after they are born.    President Biden understands the gruesome reality of abortion and this  injustice. At least he once did. As Senator Biden wrote to constituents  in explaining his support for the Hyde amendment, for example,  prohibiting taxpayer funding for elective abortions, he said it would  protect both the woman and her unborn child. He stated at the time he  had consistently, on no fewer than 50 occasions, voted against Federal  funding of abortions. Further, those of us who are opposed to abortion  should not be compelled to pay for them.   Today, the President has weaponized the entire Federal bureaucracy to  aggressively promote abortion on demand at home and overseas, including  full court press to force taxpayers to fund abortions on demand  including the repeal of the Hyde amendment.   Last September, the House passed a bill, the abortion on demand until  birth act. Of course, it had a different name that just cloaked the  misery that it would impose. That bill would not only codify late-term  abortions, it would also nullify nearly every modest pro-life  restriction ever enacted by the States including a woman's right to  know laws in 35 states, parental involvement statutes in 37 states,  pain-capable unborn child protection laws in 19 states, sex-election  abortion bans in almost a dozen states and waiting periods in 26  states. By his words and his deeds, the President has become the  abortion President. I think he wants to own that.   Mr. Speaker, this all comes at a time when ultrasound imaging has  made unborn babies more visible, with a greater clarity than ever  before. Breakthrough research has now found that unborn children can  feel pain at a gestational age of 15 weeks and maybe earlier.                                time  1345    Today modern medicine treats an ever-increasing number of unborn  children with disability and disease as patients in need of diagnosis  and life-enhancing treatments before birth. Unborn babies are society's  youngest patients and deserve protection, not death by abortion.  Science informs us that birth is merely an event--albeit a very  important one--in the life of the child. It is not the beginning of his  or her life.   As most people know, after the ultrasound the grandparents, the  parents, and the friends get pictures of the child in utero. The  ultrasound pictures are the first baby pictures that are now plastered  on all of our refrigerators in great expectation for that event called  birth.   The right to life is the first human right, and it must be guaranteed  to everyone regardless of race, age, sex, disability, stage of  development, or condition of dependency. Life is not just for the  planned, the privileged, or the perfect.   We need to protect these innocent children.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
