 Madam Speaker, I thank the esteemed congressman  from Texas, who has been quite a champion on this issue.   Madam Speaker, no nation in the history of the world has been more  welcoming to immigrants than the United States. And no nation in the  history of the world is more diverse or has provided more opportunity  for people of all races and ethnic backgrounds than the United States.   That is why millions of immigrants of all races and ethnicities are  seeking to come to America. In fact, billions of the world's 7 billion  non-U.S. population would come here, undoubtedly, if they could.   I sincerely believe that most Americans, if not most elected  officials, understand that the lack of an effective immigration policy  is one of the most important threats to our country. However, President  Biden's decision to reverse the Trump policies that successfully  secured our border is dangerous to the future of our Nation and driven  solely by a need to pander to the left.                                time  1345    Make no mistake, President Biden's policies created this very crisis  today, his promise of amnesty made it worse, and his administration is  now ignoring it.   You would think in the absence of leadership, Congress would try to  step in and address the Biden border surge crisis.   Instead, we are expecting to take up two liberal amnesty bills in the  House this upcoming week, including H.R. 6, the American Dream and  Promise Act.   H.R. 6 would provide amnesty to roughly three million people, which  would be a slap in the face to everyone who ever has or currently is  navigating our legal immigration system.   Even worse, it would incentivize more illegal immigration at a time  [[Page H1342]]  when we have no operational control of our southern border.   Even more bizarre, this bill allows for criminal aliens, people who  have committed crimes in American communities, to be eligible for  amnesty.   The bill specifically allows for an individual who has committed up  to two misdemeanors or one crime of moral turpitude to gain a pathway  to legal status.   Some may say, well, misdemeanors aren't that serious. Well, here are  a few examples of crimes that are only misdemeanors in States such as  California: Domestic violence, prostitution, drunk driving.   Worst of all, this legislation provides a waiver for people who would  technically not otherwise qualify for this amnesty. This waiver  specifically covers: Human smuggling offenses, voter fraud offenses,  and communicable diseases.   I urge this Congress not to worsen this crisis, and to instead debate  legislation that makes America safer and honors our legal immigrants.   Instead of providing amnesty to criminals, we should debate my  legislation, H.R. 398, the No Asylum for Criminals Act, which would  prohibit dangerous criminals from qualifying for asylum in the U.S.   When it comes to legal immigration, people of good faith can debate  on what overall immigration levels are prudent for our country, how to  best balance the needs of American citizens with the desire of  immigrants who are simply seeking a better life for themselves and  their family, how to cultivate patriotic assimilation, how to protect  jobs for American workers while providing labor for our businesses, and  the merits, or the lack thereof, of issues such as chain migration,  birthright citizenship, diversity visas, and other unique features of  America's immigration system.   But there should be no debate on the rule of law. We should be united  and bipartisan on the critical importance of enforcing our laws and  eliminating illegal immigration.   There is simply no honest debate regarding the fact that barriers,  whether walls or fences, work. Just look around D.C. to see  confirmation that our House Democratic leadership believes this.   There should be no debate regarding the fact that illegal immigration  is a significant threat to our national security, our economic  security, and our health security.   Illegal immigration further burdens our economy, our social services,  our healthcare system, and our education system.   Illegal immigration also enriches Mexico's organized crime and the  cartels that control everyone and everything that comes across the  southern border.   The individuals illegally coming across our southern border suffer  dangerous and sometimes deadly hardships and are often victimized by  the Mexican cartels.   Individuals who cannot afford to pay the smugglers are often extorted  into carrying drugs and other illicit material into the U.S. Others are  abused as indentured servants to the cartels if they make it across.  Many must live the rest of their lives with existential threats to  themselves and their families.   Moreover, illegal immigration places our law enforcement and our  citizens living near the border in immediate danger when drugs and  other preventable materials are smuggled across the border with  impunity. We are risking turning every community into a border town and  making our Nation a sanctuary Nation.   We must commit to completing the wall, enforcing our existing laws,  ending catch and release, requiring mandatory E-Verify, fixing our  biometric entry/exit systems, and taking amnesty, unlawful employment,  and citizenship off the table.   The future of our country is clearly at stake with how we manage or  don't manage immigration.
