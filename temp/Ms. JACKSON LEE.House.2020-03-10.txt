 Madam Speaker, I have always said that the role of  the Federal Government is an umbrella on a rainy or stormy day. The  Nation now faces the storm of coronavirus, and we should be the  umbrella and be prepared and not panic. It is imperative that we  provide widespread information on just the basics of how Americans can  care for themselves.   I have organized a bipartisan task force on the coronavirus that  includes an emergency doctor with experience, Dr. Ruiz from California,  and our colleague, Congressman Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania. We want  to emphasize  [[Page H1581]]  an opportunity for Members to talk about the issues within their  congressional districts and try to ensure that the American people are  well taken care of.   Unfortunately, the administration got a very slow start. In a hearing  that we just had, one State had the ability to test only 472 people;  another State had the ability to test only 350. Obviously, we need to  be able to ramp up the number of test kits to help the American people,  and we need the equipment to protect our medical professionals.   Madam Speaker, I end by saying, as hospitals face a crisis and  clinics face a crisis, the American people must look to the Federal  Government to do their job correctly.                            ____________________
