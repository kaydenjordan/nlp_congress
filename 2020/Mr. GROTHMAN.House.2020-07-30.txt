 Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Bernell Trammell.   Bernell was one of 10 children of Delores Jackson, born in Milwaukee,  Wisconsin, who attended Milwaukee Lincoln High School in its heyday. He  followed the steps of his grandfather, Cecil Ballenger, who was one of  the first African-American businesses in Milwaukee when he founded  Expressions Printing.   He was well-read and liked to read the books of Abraham Lincoln and  Malcolm X. He was not afraid to speak the truth. He liked to show us  signs of Bible verses and signs supporting Trump. He was killed with  his Trump sign a little over a week ago.   I would like to read a short Bible verse, which is one of the ones he  is pictured with. Matthew, chapter 12, verse 38:         Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him saying,       Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you. And he answered       them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but no       sign will be given it.    Again, I rise today in honor of Bernell Trammell, who was murdered  with his sign a little over a week ago.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan amendment would transfer  $21.3 billion from the procurement account to the Marine Corps' JLTV  and transfer it from the funds from the Defense-wide operation and  maintenance account.   We want to make sure the JLTV is delivered to our servicemembers on  schedule and on cost. I have come to understand that, last year, the  Marine Corps had substantially higher fielding costs than they  anticipated for this vehicle, so they had to transfer funds from  purchasing more vehicles to fielding the vehicles they had.   I understand why the Appropriations Committee, being fiscally  responsible, saw that they shifted money and therefore gave them less  of these new vehicles than they thought they needed. However, the  Marine Corps had two options: pay the incurred costs or not pay for  these costs and not have operational JLTVs. The Marine Corps has  demonstrated the need for these trucks and requested funding for 752 of  them to be appropriated in FY21.   My bipartisan amendment will accomplish this. I think we in Congress  can work with the Marine Corps, the least-funded branch of the armed  services.
