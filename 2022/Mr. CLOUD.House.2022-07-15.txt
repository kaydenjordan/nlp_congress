 Madam Speaker, the pro-life issue used to be a bipartisan  issue in this Chamber even as we recognized that our essential  liberties of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were  inalienable rights given to us not by government but by God, and the  claim that the left is making that our attempts to protect life are  somehow criminalizing women could be nothing further from the truth.   Setting aside the fact that the left can't even define for the moment  what a woman is, 50 years of scientific evidence have unveiled to us  the mystery and the amazing thing that is happening in the development  of a child. We know so much more--even the fact that a child feels the  pain of abortion. We will always stand with life.
