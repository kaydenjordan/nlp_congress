 Mr. Speaker, it is appalling what is  happening today on the House floor. It appears to be: let's just pass a  bill, no matter what it does or who gets hurt with it.   TrumpCare is nothing more than broken promises and mean-spirited  policy. It would mean higher healthcare costs for more than 24 million  hardworking Americans losing their health coverage, key protections are  gutted, older Americans are hung out to dry, the end of Medicaid as we  know it, and cuts in Medicare.   If TrumpCare passes, Americans with preexisting conditions could be  pushed off their insurance and sent in the high-risk pools that are not  affordable. High-risk insurance pools do not work when everyone in the  pool is a high risk. I was a State legislator when we did that. You  have to have high-risk pools that share the wealth, so to speak.   People will be left with soaring costs, worse coverage, and rationed  care. It is a frightening future where millions of Americans who need  affordable, dependable health care are left out in the cold.   There is an obvious, irresponsible reason why this vote is being  rammed through without even a Congressional Budget Office estimate or  an opportunity for Members to even know what is in it. They don't want  people figuring out the real-world consequences and the devastation it  means to our American families. History will not be kind to the people  who support this awful bill.   I urge my colleagues to do what is right and vote ``no.''
