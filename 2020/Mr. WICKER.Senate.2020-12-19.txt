 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on this  nomination for 1 minute.    Mr. President, Chase Johnson is the nominee here. This is  a cloture vote. He is a marine. He is a Marine Reserve veteran. He is  an accomplished attorney. He was reported from the Commerce Committee  on a unanimous, bipartisan vote. The distinguished ranking member who  just spoke made the motion that Chase Johnson be reported.   We are the victim this afternoon of some absences. We are also the  victim this afternoon of some discussion and some differences that have  arisen over extraneous issues, and I would just urge my colleagues,  both on and off the committee, to remember that this was a unanimous  vote out of the committee.   This is an outstanding candidate, and he deserves to be confirmed.  With that, I ask for a yes vote.   And, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum  call be waived.
