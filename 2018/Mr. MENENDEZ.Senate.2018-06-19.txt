 Mr. President, today I rise in condemnation of the  Trump administration's heartless, cruel, and inhumane policy of  separating children from their parents when they seek asylum at our  southern border.   I do so as the son of refugees who fled their homeland and came to  this country because they longed to be free. I do so as a Catholic  appalled by what is being done in the name of my Christian faith. I do  so out of concern, as the ranking member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, that the cruelty being conducted in the name of  the U.S. Government may cause lasting damage to America's reputation in  the  [[Page S4029]]  world. I do so as a parent who knows that there is no love more  powerful, no love more universal than love for your child, and it is  love that has driven these families to seek asylum in the United  States.   Seeking asylum is not a crime. It is a cry for mercy, an act of  desperation. The trauma being inflicted on these children and the  anguish being inflicted on these parents is a direct result of the  Trump administration's decision to criminalize asylum seekers and  persecute families fleeing for their very lives.   President Trump is lying to the American people when he says that  family separation is the law of the land. He is lying when he says that  Democrats put a law on the books mandating that children be terrorized  in this way.   Under the policies of previous administrations, families remained  together while waiting for their asylum claims to proceed through our  immigration courts. But this President has broken with the basic  standards of decency that have guided past administrations, Republican  and Democrat alike.   The criminalizing of asylum seekers is in fact a newly unveiled  policy. Attorney General Jeff Sessions calls it a zero tolerance  policy. I say it is a zero humanity policy, a zero compassion policy.   This policy of persecuting families fleeing for their lives comes  straight from the White nationalist fringe. It has been in the works  for over a year, going all the way back to when Chief of Staff John  Kelly was Secretary of Homeland Security. Back in March of 2017, then- Secretary John Kelly said that the ``name of the game is deterrence.''  He said that if the administration began separating kids from their  parents, they could deter migrants from traveling to our southern  border.   We have since heard Attorney General Jeff Sessions double down on  this theme of deterrence. He said:         If people don't want to be separated from their children,       they should not bring them with them. . . . If you bring       children, you'll still be prosecuted.    To those who spout this perverse notion of deterrence, I ask: How do  you deter a mother trying to protect her child from the brutality of  forced servitude? How do you deter a father trying to protect his  daughter from being raped and tortured? How do you deter a family so  fearful for their safety that they are willing to embark on a perilous  journey and travel thousands of miles--thousands of miles--to reach the  United States?   The answer is that you can't, not without addressing the root causes  of this forced migration.   Most of these families come from Guatemala, El Salvador, and  Honduras--the countries collectively known as the Northern Triangle. It  is a region plagued by transnational gang violence, weak institutions,  and poverty. Young boys are forced into servitude by gangs. Young girls  are beaten and raped. Any parent who resists is killed. These countries  suffer from some of the highest homicide rates in the world, and the  violence against women is particularly appalling.   In El Salvador, a woman is murdered every 19 hours, and in Honduras-- the country with the highest homicide rate for women in the world--a  woman is killed every 16 hours.   To be blunt, these families face a stark choice. It is either stay  and die or flee for a chance to live.   The facts show this policy of deterrence isn't deterring anyone. That  is because it is hard to deter people who are fleeing for their lives.  In recent months, we have seen the number of people seeking safety in  record droves. There were 36,682 apprehensions at the border in  February. By April, that number jumped to 50,924. In May, the number  rose again to nearly 52,000.   If we aim to reduce forced migration, we must improve the conditions  in the region. Our only hope of doing so is by working with the  governments of the Northern Triangle by exercising smart diplomacy, by  working together to find solutions to promote the rule of law, provide  public safety, and free communities of terror from transnational gang  violence. Yet, just a few hours ago, President Trump threatened to cut  off aid to Central America and Mexico because ``they are not sending  their best.''   In other words, he would have the policy of the United States be to  make the dire conditions in Central America even worse--driving even  more families to flee their homes in search of asylum. Let's be clear.  These individuals are fleeing of their own accord. They are not being  sent. They are fleeing. Their choice is stark: stay and die or leave  and have a shot to live.   We know USAID initiatives that support economic development and good  governance make a real difference. We have heard directly from young  people who have found hope and safety through these programs. Now is  not the time to recklessly abandon these programs. It is a time to  invest in them.   The administration claims to be for law and order, but it deals in  chaos and discord. President Trump lies with such frequency and such  confidence because he knows the muddier the waters, the harder it is  for the rays of truth to shine through.   This past weekend, some rays of light shone through when former First  Lady Laura Bush made her voice heard. As she wrote in the Washington  Post, ``Our government should not be in the business of warehousing  children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent  cities in the desert outside of El Paso. These images are eerily  reminiscent of the internment camps for U.S. citizens and noncitizens  of Japanese descent during World War II, now considered to have been  one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history.''   She couldn't be more right.   This isn't a PR crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis, and it is a  moral crisis for our country. That is why even members of the Trump  administration are struggling to defend this policy. It is  indefensible.   Years from now, will we look back on this policy and be proud? No. We  are going to look back and see it for what it is--another dark period  in our history, in which we as a country failed to live up to the  values that make America a beacon of hope and a leader among nations.   It is despicable to see President Trump inflict trauma on innocent  children just to score political points with his base or to somehow use  children as a leverage for some negotiating point. That is what is  happening here.   President Trump and his Republican enablers in Congress have one  strategy left in their playbook for 2018. They cannot run on being  fiscally responsible; their trillion-dollar corporate tax cuts have  exploded the Federal deficit. They cannot run on delivering the  American people more affordable health because under their watch,  healthcare premiums are soaring, and prescription drug costs are  surging. They cannot run on raising wages because under their policies,  most of the Nation's economic gains continue to go to big corporations  and to the top 1 percent instead of working families and the middle  class. The only thing they have left to run on is fear.   In 2018, the Republican Party has one message. It is a message that  says, as the President said earlier today, that these migrants aim to  ``infest our country''; that babies and toddlers and middle schoolers  pose a threat to our public safety and our national security; that  Latino families who are fleeing unthinkable violence are nothing more  than pests.   Let me be clear, Mr. President. Running to save the lives of your  child doesn't make you a criminal. It makes you a parent. Tearing  innocent children away from their parents is shameful, it is cruel, and  it is un-American.   President Trump is calling on Congress to fix a policy of his own  creation. There is no law that instigates the President and his  administration to do this, none at all. He chooses to do it.   House Republicans are trying to pass a so-called immigration  compromise, when as far as I can see, the only thing it compromises is  our time-tested system of legal, family-based immigration in this  country.   Contrary to Speaker Ryan's claims, this will do nothing to end the  separation of families at the border. It doesn't address the issue of  the President's zero tolerance policy or put an end to the  administration's cruel practices. Instead, the bill removes protections  for asylum seekers and gives the administration license to lock  families into detention for indefinite periods of time.  [[Page S4030]]    President Trump and ideologues like Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller  want to use the tears of innocent children as leverage in their quest  to end legal immigration, as we know it, and to force the American  people to pay for a ludicrous $25 billion border wall.   The President, the Attorney General, the DHS Secretary, and the White  House Chief of Staff are practicing a doublespeak tactic in the hope of  confusing the American public, but there is nothing confusing about  separating children from their parents. The America I know doesn't put  children into cages. The America I know doesn't rip newborn babies out  of their mothers' arms. The America I know doesn't treat families  fleeing from criminals like they are criminals.   President Trump could end this despicable policy today without a law.  He can order U.S. Customs and Border Control to stop tearing babies  from their mothers' arms today. He can correct course and restore  America's commitment to basic human rights today.   They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but the audio released  yesterday by ProPublica is worth a million tears.   How do you submit the cries of innocent children to the Congressional  Record? I don't know how you do that, but you can hear it.   (Inaudible audio.)   You can hear it. I know we don't want to hear it. I know we don't  want to hear it, but those are the cries of innocent children. I can't  replicate it. I can't replicate their pain: ``Papi, papi. Donde estas,  papi?''   It is time this Senate has its conscience pricked, that it moves to  action, and that it challenges the President on this horrific policy.   With that, I yield the floor.
