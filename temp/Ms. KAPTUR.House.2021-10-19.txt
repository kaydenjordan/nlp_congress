 Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to call attention to  the needs of our Great Lakes region, including communities I represent  like Lorain, Ohio, which my colleagues on the Select Committee on  Economic Disparity and Fairness in Growth visited yesterday afternoon  on a bipartisan basis.   During the hearing, we heard from union members, the business  community, community leaders, and local officials about how decades of  underinvestment and outsourcing have devastated our region; 10,000  steel jobs gone just in that industry.   As we advance our Build Back Better agenda, it is vital we deliver  robust resources and support to these communities, ones that too often  have been left behind.   These historic investments in infrastructure and good-paying jobs  must reach every corner of our Nation, especially those where middle- class workers and their families have been denied full participation in  the American Dream.   Let's make sure that these communities and those in the Great Lakes  receive their fair share and are set upon a path for a more prosperous  tomorrow.                            ____________________
