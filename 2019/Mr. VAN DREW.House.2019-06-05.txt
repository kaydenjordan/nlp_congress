 Madam Speaker, the Pennsville Veterans of Foreign Wars  dedicate their time and their attention to their community through  multiple acts of service.   Comprised of veterans and those active in the military, the  Pennsville VFW doesn't just talk about how they help others, but they  actively engage in service projects that better the lives of their  community.   When local EMTs needed a battery-operated stretcher, the Pennsville  VFW provided it; when the Pennsville Police Department needed  bulletproof vests, they provided them as well; and when a disabled  veteran needed a ramp to get into his home, they also provided that.   In addition to these specific acts of service, the members of the VFW  have offered annual events to bring their community together as a  whole. Every year, the Pennsville VFW members organize a dinner and a  pheasant hunt for disabled veterans, as well as an annual Memorial Day  parade to honor those who have died for our great United States of  America.   We are immensely grateful to the services of all New Jersey  organizations that help those who have served our country.   Madam Speaker, I especially want to thank the Pennsville Veterans of  Foreign Wars, whose countless acts of service make an incredible impact  on our community as well as our country. We are proud of them, and we  love them for what they have done.                            ____________________
