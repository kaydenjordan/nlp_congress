 Mr. President, today I wish to honor and recognize  the Maine Employers' Mutual Insurance Company, MEMIC, a workers'  compensation company based in Portland, ME. MEMIC was recently  recognized as the best workers' compensation company in the country  according to a New York nonprofit that analyzes health insurance  companies. A cause for celebration in itself, MEMIC also celebrates its  25th anniversary this year.   One of the greatest success stories in Maine's history, MEMIC  revolutionized workplace safety by focusing directly on case management  and results. Prior to its incorporation, the workers compensation  system was in peril, negatively affecting Maine's economy and workplace  environment. Insurance companies that offered workers' compensation  were steadily bailing, as costs of writing policies increased.  Liability costs climbed as work-related injuries reached peak in the  early 1990s. MEMIC's mission was founded on a need for change; both  employees and employers need to feel protected from mishap and  accidents.   By prioritizing fair and equal treatment of all stakeholders, MEMIC  helped Maine's economy avert a crisis. In 1993, Governor John McKernan,  Jr., signed legislation that reformed worker safety and appointed a  board of directors to set attainable goals and accountability. By its  third year, workplace injuries in Maine had dropped to the lowest level  in over 16 years, leading to a significant drop in premiums. By its  fifth year, MEMIC was able to partially return investment capital to  its policyholders with a promise to return the rest within the next 5  years. In addition to lowering costs, reducing fraud, and boosting the  economy, MEMIC reinforced transparency, social accountability, and  market stability for business leaders. That trend continues to this day  when, in November 2017, MEMIC announced that approximately 18,000  employers who purchased insurance through MEMIC would share in a $21  million dividend, the highest shareholder return in history, and a true  reward for improving workplace safety and helping injured workers get  well and back to work as soon as possible. That is money going directly  back into Maine's economy through private, public, and nonprofit  sectors in all 16 counties. Since 1998, MEMIC has returned more than  $240 million to Maine policyholders, a truly remarkable track record  and testament to its integral role and value in strengthening Maine's  workforce and economy.   With a 25-year foundation of success, MEMIC's current management and  leadership team continue this strong commitment to a work environment  conducive to innovation, as well as workplace safety and fair claims  management. I commend MEMIC for its groundbreaking history, stabilizing  Maine's economy and revolutionizing the workers' compensation  industry.                            ____________________
