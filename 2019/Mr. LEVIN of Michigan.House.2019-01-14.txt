 Madam Speaker, on Friday, several of my  Democratic colleagues and I met with hardworking Americans who are  living with the consequences of the ongoing Trump shutdown.   We met an FAA employee, working without a paycheck, who has two kids  in college, and they need money for books as the new semester begins.   We met a Customs and Border Patrol employee who said his friends  think he is on vacation, but a vacation does not include calling your  mortgage lender and your auto loan company to tell them you may not  make a payment. He said he never expected to get rich as a public  servant, but he thought he would be able to buy formula for his 5- month-old daughter.   We met a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration employee who  told us weather forecasts for the Great Lakes will be impacted for  months, which will, in turn, impact shipping.   We are on day 24 of the longest government shutdown in American  history. Estimates say we are letting GD growth take a hit of $1.2  billion every week.    The President has to stop holding the health, safety, and paychecks  of the American people hostage and reopen the government immediately,  because 5,200 Federal workers in Michigan are working without pay or  are furloughed. I guarantee you that every one of them has a story like  the ones I shared.                            ____________________
