 Madam President, I rise today to recognize my good  friend Mr. Bob Fee as he nears the end of his term as the 116th  chairman of the Nation's largest insurance association, the Independent  Insurance Agents and Brokers of America--IIABA--also known as the Big  ``I.'' He was installed as chairman of the Big ``I'' in September 2021  in Kansas City. Over the past year, he has done a remarkable job  leading the association as a strong and thoughtful leader for  independent insurance agents and small businesses across the country.   Bob is a graduate of the University of Kansas and the USF&G School of  Insurance in Baltimore, MD. He is currently the president of Fee  Insurance Group in Hutchinson, KS. He joined his family's agency in  1987, continuing a long family tradition of serving the community. The  Fee Insurance Group can trace its roots back to 1883 in its hometown of  Hutchinson and now has four locations throughout the State.   At the national association level, Bob has been a member of the Big  ``I'' government affairs committee and the Trusted Choice board of  directors, including a term as the Trusted Choice board chairman. He  received the Big ``I'' Chairman's Citation in 2011. At the State  association level, Bob served on the Kansas Association of Insurance  Agents--KAIA--board of directors and as the Kansas director on the  national association board. He has also served on several KAIA  committees, including the government affairs committee, and was the  2007-2008 KAIA president.   As chairman of the Big ``I,'' Bob has represented his country, his  industry, and the great State of Kansas with distinction.   The State of Kansas is proud of Bob Fee and wishes him and his wife  Annie well following his successful term as chairman of the Big  ``I.''                            ____________________
