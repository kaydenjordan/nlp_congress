 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Electronic Message Preservation  Act of 2017, and I want to thank Mr. Gowdy, our chairman, for getting  this bill to the floor as he has today.   I introduced this bill with the goal of modernizing the Federal and  Presidential Records Acts. This bill would require the Archivist of the  United States to issue regulations mandating that all Federal agencies  manage and preserve their email records electronically. This bill would  help ensure that email records from Federal agencies and the White  House are preserved.   According to an October 2017 report from the National Archives and  Records Administration, approximately 46 percent of agencies continue  to print and file paper copies of email messages. These records are  more likely to get lost and are harder for agencies to retrieve during  record searches under the Freedom of Information Act.   This bill would put into statute what agencies are already required  to do under a directive issued by the Archivist and the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget.   In 2016, the National Archives issued a document for agency records  officers titled: ``Why Agencies Need to Move Toward Electronic  Recordkeeping.'' The document identified a number of reasons, including  long-term cost savings, information security, and more efficient and  effective implementation of the Freedom of Information Act.   This bill also would require the Archivist to establish standards for  the preservation and management of email records that are Presidential  records and to certify annually that the White House has records  management controls in place that meet those standards.   Under this bill, the Archivist must report 1 year after a President  leaves office on whether the controls used by the President met the  required standards. This legislation would provide accountability to  encourage every President to have the controls in place that are  necessary to preserve emails and other electronic records.   This bill has been passed by the House with bipartisan support  several times before. I urge my colleagues to support the bill again  today, and I hope that the Senate will act on the bill and send it to  the President's desk before the end of the year.   Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman from North Carolina and I have  laid out very nicely exactly and eloquently what this bill is all  about. It is very important that we modernize all of our systems in the  Federal Government, and recordkeeping is so important.   We see it, particularly in our committee, the Oversight and  Government Reform Committee, because we are constantly trying to get  records and requesting records and occasionally subpoenaing records. So  this is a way, I believe, to make that whole process more effective,  efficient, and transparent.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank Mr. Walker for introducing  this well-thought-out bill and very important bill.   I support this bill, which would increase the transparency and  accountability of Federal agencies. The bill would require agencies to  include in their budget justifications to Congress a summary of the  recommendations made by GAO or the agency's inspector general. Agencies  would also be required to explain what steps they are taking to address  these recommendations or, if they disagree with them, why they  disagree.   GAO and inspectors general provide critical oversight of the  executive branch. Knowing what agencies are doing or not doing to  address GAO and IG recommendations will assist Congress in conducting  its constitutional oversight role. This is, indeed, a commonsense  measure that I strongly support. I just want to urge the House to pass  this bill.   One of the things that has concerned many of us in the Congress is  the issue of accountability. Accountability is so very, very important.   We all have a tremendous amount of respect for the inspectors general  and for GAO. Over and over again, they make recommendations, and the  question becomes: Whatever happens to those recommendations? Are they  placed on a shelf and never to be seen again, or are they put into  place? After all, the American people are spending a lot of money with  regard to the research and the investigations conducted by the IG and  the research conducted by the GAO.   And so, Mr. Speaker, we are very supportive of this legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  4890, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 9801 Apollo Drive in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, as  the ``Wayne K. Curry Post Office Building.'' I thank my colleague from  Maryland, Congressman Anthony Brown, for his leadership in introducing  this bill, which I am proud to co-sponsor.   Wayne Curry was an exceptional leader whose vision and commitment led  to many of the groundbreaking developments that have helped make Prince  George's County such a vibrant and dynamic county today. He was also a  trailblazer committed to opening the doors of opportunity for African  Americans in business and government.   Mr. Curry was a graduate of Western Maryland College and of the  University of Maryland Law School in Baltimore. He worked for many  years in commercial real estate and then eventually led the Prince  George's Chamber of Commerce. Early in his career, he served as an aide  to former County Executive Winfield M. Kelly.   Mr. Curry was elected the County Executive of Prince George's County  in 1994--one of the first African Americans to be elected to lead a  county in the nation--and was re-elected in 1998. As County Executive,  he was a fierce advocate for Prince George's County and for its  residents, and fought to increase funding for public schools, to ensure  that economic development in the county benefited all residents, and to  ensure that minority contractors had a fair chance to compete for  government-funded contracts.   The Washington Post wrote that Mr. Curry was ``A champion of black  affluence'' who ``believed that economic power was the last milestone  of the civil rights struggle.''   We are blessed to have the memory and example of Wayne Curry to help  lead us as we continue to fight to reach that last milestone and  achieve the equality of economic opportunity that is essential to  making the American dream a reality for minorities across this nation.   I urge all Members to support H.R. 4890 and again thank Congressman  Brown for his work on this measure.
