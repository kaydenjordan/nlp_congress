 Mr. Speaker, today, on this day that lives in infamy,  we recall MacArthur's message from the Philippines. He said famously:         From the Far East, I send you one single thought, one sole       idea written in red on every beachhead from Australia to       Tokyo: There is no substitute for victory.    Mr. Speaker, I ask the Corps of Cadets at the United States Military  Academy to remember that on the football field on Saturday.   Go Army. Beat Navy                            ____________________
