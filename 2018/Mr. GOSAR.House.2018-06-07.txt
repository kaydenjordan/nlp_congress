 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the ARPA-E program first began receiving  funding through the 2009 Obama stimulus and is currently unauthorized.   ARPA-E grew out of those years' overly optimistic perception of the  Federal Government's ability to lead in areas of commercially viable  energy research and technology, particularly in renewables.   The obvious problem with this premise is that the government, unlike  our Nation's industries and corporations, has never been in the  business of cost-benefit maximization, as other blunders from that  period, like the Solyndra scandal, demonstrated.   This is because the Federal Government is competent and accomplished  in the areas of basic, early-stage scientific research but poorly  positioned to move research from concept to market. And ARPA-E provides  even further demonstration of that. The Subcommittee on Energy and  Water Development and Related Agencies defunded the program in their  FY18 draft passed bill.   The administration and the Republican Study Committee have both  advocated eliminating this stimulus-era program and have continually  indicated that the proper role of government in energy research is at  the level of basic research taking place in existent, well-funded  programs like the Office of Science and the applied energy research and  development program.   Those DOE programs that they point to are more worthy recipients of  Federal dollars, are effective, and produce results because they focus  on the right goals.   For this reason, the administration is also strongly opposed to  continued funding for the ARPA-E program. The White House stated in its  fiscal year 2019 budget proposal:         Appropriations for ARPA-E were only authorized through 2013       under the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010. In       addition, there has been concern about the potential for       ARPA-E's efforts to overlap with research and development       being carried out, or which should be carried out, by the       private sector.        No new appropriations are requested in 2019. The Department       would request reprogramming of prior-year unobligated       balances for program closeout activities to ensure full       closure of ARPA-E by mid-2020. Any remaining contract       closeout and award monitoring activities would be transferred       elsewhere within DOE.        This proposed elimination reflects both a streamlining of       Federal activities and a refocusing on the proper Federal       role in energy research and development.    In a May 15 view letter to House Appropriations on the Energy and  Water bill, the White House stated: ``The Administration is  disappointed that the bill does not eliminate ARPA-E. The Committee is  encouraged to explore options to incorporate certain ARPA-E attributes,  such as cross-cutting research coordination and enhanced flexibility,  into the Department of Energy's primary research efforts within the  Office of Science and Applied Energy Research Programs rather than  maintain a separate program through ARPA-E.''   In a June 5 Statement of Administration Policy, the White House  stated: ``The Administration believes that the continued funding of  ARPA-E makes little strategic sense given the existence of applied  energy research elsewhere within the Department. The Congress is urged  to eliminate ARPA-E and incorporate its more successful elements, such  as coordination with industry and cross-cutting research, into the  Department's applied energy programs.''   The innovations ARPA-E supporters crow about must come from the  market or from academic research institutions, because the Federal  Government's track record of responding to commercial incentives in a  cost-beneficial way to the taxpayer is absolutely poor.   The proper Federal nexus for research is the early-stage work being  done at the existing Office of Science and the applied energy research  program, not projects foisted onto the government that weren't  compelling enough to receive private funding.   Heritage Action, Freedomworks, Club for Growth, and the National  Taxpayers Union are key-voting this amendment. The amendment is also  endorsed by the Americans for Limited Government and Taxpayers for  Common Sense.   I urge adoption of this amendment that supports President Trump's  agenda.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, any program that receives this much funding  has individual successes proponents can point to. The problem with this  program is that the ratio of successes to the failures is far lower  with this one than comparable Federal research programs.   It also targets an area of research that is inappropriate for Federal  research. Basic early-stage research is a profit avenue for Federal  dollars to go, not late-stage research on projects approaching  commercialization. If a concept or technology is nearing  commercialization, that is the right nexus for private industry to get  involved.   Our country's major companies in tech, engineering, and energy are  flush with cash, and projects that they think are commercially viable  are getting more funding than ever before. Failure by the government to  salvage a project means that the projects, on the whole, aren't worth  being salvaged by government, industry, or anyone.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, this is an unauthorized program  and it treads on existing jurisdictions at the Department of Energy,  specifically, the Office of Science and Applied Energy Research  program. It is a program in search of justification.   Let's take, for example, Solyndra. That is a wonderful success.  Really? Private sector couldn't do that? They could do it a ton better  than that type of application.   I ask my colleagues to vote for this amendment. This is sound.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment that  utilizes the Holman rule to hold WAPA Administrator Mark Gabriel  accountable.   On Gabriel's watch, millions of taxpayer and customer dollars were  flushed down the drain on fraudulent and improper transactions while a  culture of fear from the highest echelons of the agency enforced  silence as to the true nature and scope of these misdeeds.   Wasteful and fraudulent expenditures by WAPA in recent years include  things like ammunition; specialized weapons, including numerous  purchases of $1,200 rifle scopes; an unauthorized ATV at a cost of  $14,000; a John Deere lawn tractor; personal clothing; prohibited  purchases of $349,000 to accessorize personal cars; $271,000 at book  stores; $102,000 to deck out motorcycles from shops and dealers; and  questionable expenditures from one employee to the tune of $50,000 per  month.   Now, in response, the Western Area Power Administration slow-walked  investigations, covered up the fraud, and intimidated anyone bold  enough to call it out.   A 14-year Federal employee who once worked for the U.S. Attorney's  Office told reporters: ``Instead of aggressively going after  corruption, WAPA's bosses slow-walked the investigation, retaliated  against those who uncovered fraud, and failed to protect them from  threats.''   Unfortunately, this employee is not alone. A former WAPA vice  president for procurement went on record to state that, during his 30  years of Federal service, he had never seen anything like this and  certainly had never felt unsafe at work until he worked at WAPA on a  daily basis.   Disturbingly, 20 complaints of violence in the workplace occurred  over the last 3-year period. The mismanagement, corruption, and culture  is so bad at WAPA that an independent consultant did a violence  assessment in late 2015 and found: ``Multiple employees reported having  been threatened directly or heard others being threatened regarding the  current investigations. . . . Several indicated they had not bothered  to report the incidents for reasons of fear and/or the belief upper  management would not act. Because of past failures to address these  issues more seriously, it is very likely the incidents will increase in  number and severity.''   Assessors also reported: ``Employees mentioned bosses who actively  seek to intimidate employees, especially women, and who tolerate and  perhaps promote a culture of unacceptable behavior in their teams.''   Equally troubling, Administrator Gabriel is routinely and publicly  insubordinate as an agency head. At an April 12, 2018, budget hearing,  Mr. Gabriel took a public position contrary to that of the current  administration, advocating for tip funding even though the budget  proposal proposed to eliminate such funding.   This commonsense amendment seeks to hold this rogue bureaucrat  accountable to the American people and the victims who have suffered  under his tenure.   I am pleased to have the support of FreedomWorks, who is key voting  this amendment; Club for Growth, who is key voting the amendment; the  Tea Party Patriots; Americans for Limited Government; Texas' Michael Q.  Sullivan; the Grand Canyon State Electric Cooperative Association; the  Mohave Electric Cooperative; the Sulphur Springs Valley Electric  Cooperative; Arizona Pork Producers; New Mexico Cattle Growers  Association; New Mexico Wool Growers; Sulphur Up North Jobs,  Incorporated.   Numerous customers and Federal employees no longer want Mr. Gabriel  in charge, having understandably lost faith in his leadership. It is  far past time that the Department of Energy clean house and show this  Obama administration holdover the door.   Mr. Chair, I commend the chairman and the committee for their efforts  on this legislation. I urge support of the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have left.    Mr. Chairman, the current application of the Holman rule  authorizes three specific uses in an appropriation bill: the reduction  of amounts of money in the bill, the reduction of the number and salary  of officers of the United States, or the reduction of the compensation  of any person paid out in the treasury of the United States.   Let's go back through this. Look at this fraud. Look at these 20  complaints of violence.   I have to tell you: Are you sure you want to defend this guy?  Inconceivable. Inconceivable that we are going to allow this. We owe it  to the Federal employees under this gentleman to have an employment  environment to be well taken care of.   Mr. Chair, I ask for the Members to vote on behalf of this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Yes.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Chair, this isn't a jurisdictional aspect of power  across the West. This is fraud. This is workplace violence--20. This  has nothing to do with jurisdictional application of water or power.  This is an unsafe application within the workplace. This is a bully in  an agency who is weighing in and doing unwanted things.   We have an obligation, an absolute obligation, to rein somebody in  like this. That is what is wrong here. If we can't do this to a swamp  creature of this magnitude, then what can we do.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, on July 19, 2010, President Obama signed  Executive Order 13547 and sought to implement a new National Ocean  Policy. According to the House Committee on Natural Resources: ``In  this unilateral action, he established a top-down Washington, D.C.- based approval process that will hinder rather than promote ocean and  inland activities and cost American jobs. . . . This has the potential  to inflict damage across a spectrum of sectors, including agriculture,  fishing, construction, manufacturing, mining, oil and natural gas,  renewable energy, and marine commerce, among others. . . . Over 80  national and local organizations representing agriculture, forestry,  energy, fishing, boating, mining, transportation, and construction  wrote to then Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers requesting a  prohibition on funding for the implementation of the President's  National Ocean Policy.''   Our oceans are home to a variety of industries, and it is critical  that we maintain our offshore environments and promote a robust  offshore economy. The National Ocean Policy represents the previous  administration's heavyhanded, top-down approach to Federal land and  water management and does not reflect the realities of our working  oceans and coastal communities.   Our offshore assets contribute billions to the U.S. economy, and the  National Ocean Policy's vague directive sharply discouraged the  development of American energy, sustainable fisheries, and our coastal  economies. Policies like this cause industries to turn outside of the  U.S. to do their business.   Adding duplicative layers of permitting and consultation to our  already highly regulated ocean industries and subject all parties to  virtually unlimited legal exposure, we are seeing this firsthand in the  Northeast, where direct conflict in the ocean user groups has resulted  in litigation. This is the exact thing that this policy is supposed to  alleviate. Years into implementation, this policy is incapable of  achieving its stated goal.   U.S. oceans industries are major global players, and we need to keep  our industries competitive. The National Ocean Policy does the  opposite. As such, I strongly oppose this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Simpson).    Mr. Chairman, I ask for a ``no'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
