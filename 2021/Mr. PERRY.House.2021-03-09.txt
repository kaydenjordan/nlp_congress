 Madam Speaker, I heard the majority leader speak about  something that happened in 1870 and 1880, like the Pinkertons are still  running around union busting.   Well, it is not 1870. It is not 1880. It is not even the time of  President Obama. But during President Obama's time, he proposed the  ambush election rule, and that is in this bill.   What does that mean? That means the employer must give up the  addresses, the contact and personal information, and the working  schedule of everybody in their facility. And they don't get to say no.  The people who work there don't get to say no. Even the Obama NLRB said  that they would be subjected to harassment, coercion, or robbery--or  robbery.   Madam Speaker, I offered an amendment, which the majority refused, to  close the loophole that exempts union violence, coercion, and  extortion. Think about that, union violence.   If they have the information of the employees and are prone to  violence, and if you live in Philadelphia, you just go back to the  helpful union guy, the helpful union guys, the thugs and the  presentment.   Reject this. This is the PRO Act, indeed--protecting corrupt union  bosses from their own failures. Vote ``no.''    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind screens  and back in the classroom.
