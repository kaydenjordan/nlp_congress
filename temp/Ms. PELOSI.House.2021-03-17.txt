 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. It is  wonderful to see Members of Congress wearing white today to observe the  fact that we are making history by passing legislation about equality  in our country.   I thank Congresswoman Jackie Speier for her relentless championing of  this equal rights amendment in terms of the date that the distinguished  chair of the Judiciary Committee referenced. I also thank Carolyn  Maloney for her long-term advocacy of the equal rights amendment. I  thank Chairman Nadler for enabling us to have this legislation on the  floor today and for his leadership on this issue over time.   Madam Speaker, 100 years ago, in 1921, a solemn promise was made to  the women of our country, one honoring our most fundamental truth as a  nation, as the equal rights amendment was first introduced. When it was  first introduced, it said: ``Men and women shall have equal rights  throughout the United States and every place subject to its  jurisdiction.''   Simple, clear, fair, and just. Yet, a century later, that promise  remains unfulfilled. The equal rights amendment still has not been  enshrined in the Constitution, and American women still face inequality  under the law and, therefore, in their lives.   In recent years, American women have renewed the legal fight for the  equal rights amendment. Women of all backgrounds--students, mothers,  seniors, communities of color, indigenous women, et cetera--have taken  up the mantle of the suffragists before them, standing on suffragists'  shoulders as they marched, mobilized, protested, and picketed for their  rights. Because of their courage and commitment, 38 States have now  ratified the equal rights amendment.   But one final barrier remains: removing the artificial, arbitrary  time limit for ratification. As the distinguished chairman pointed out,  that deadline timetable is not in the Constitution. Until we remove  that arbitrary time limit, the ERA cannot become part of our  Constitution.   Last year, the House passed legislation to remove this arbitrary time  limit, but unfortunately, the Senate failed to do so. So, today, the  House will, once again, pass this legislation and send it to the Senate  for a vote. We are proud to be doing it in Women's History Month.   We salute again Congresswoman Jackie Speier, our champion on the  legislation on the floor today, and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, who  has been our lead sponsor of the ERA for 25 years now.   Madam Speaker, I thank Members from both sides of the aisle,  including cosponsor Representative   Tom Reed from New York, for their  bipartisan support in the Congress, which reflects the overwhelming  bipartisan support in the country. A full 94 percent of the public  supports the equal rights amendment, including 99 percent, nearly  unanimous support, among millennials and Generation Z.   Let us not forget that, in 1972, the equal rights amendment was  passed with bipartisan supermajorities in both Chambers of Congress,  and it enjoyed the strong support of President Nixon, who wrote in 1968  that ``the task of achieving constitutional equality between the sexes  is still not completed'' and pointed out that all Republican National  Conventions since 1940 have  [[Page H1423]]  supported the longtime movement for equality.   There is no reason why today, after 80 years of Republican support,  the ERA should not have full bipartisan support in the Congress. The  resolution on the floor today will pave the way to passage of the equal  rights amendment, which is one of the most important steps that we can  take to affirm and ensure women's equality in America.   The text of the equal rights amendment states: ``Equality of rights  under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or  by any State on account of sex.''   ``On account of sex'' recalls to mind the beautiful documentary about  Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   Passing the equal rights amendment will create essential avenues for  legal recourse for people who face discrimination under the laws on the  basis of sex. It will ensure that the Supreme Court applies the same  standard of review for sex discrimination cases as it applies to cases  of discrimination based on race and national origin. It will help  Congress pass laws for better legal protections against injustice,  including those related to sexual assault, domestic violence, and  paycheck unfairness. It will confirm the rightful place of gender  equality in all aspects of life.   There are some who say that the equal rights amendment is not needed.  To them, I quote the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who said: ``Certainly  the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex.  The only issue is whether it prohibits it. It does not.''   These are not just words. This is the daily reality for America's  women who face inequality and injustice in so many arenas of life, from  a massive wage gap, to pregnancy discrimination, to sexual harassment  in the workplace, to economic disparities that have worsened during  coronavirus.                                time  1100    Passing this resolution, and then the ERA, will not only help women,  but by unleashing the full economic potential of women, it will help  families and boost our economy, all while advancing justice and  equality in America for everyone.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote on this strong step  toward equality for women, progress for families, and a stronger  America--affirming the truth, Madam Speaker, that you have espoused  that when women succeed, America succeeds.   I commend the leadership on this issue, the distinguished chairman,  and the sponsors of the resolution, Jackie Speier and Carolyn Maloney.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and,  again, for his extraordinary leadership.   Madam Speaker, this is quite a day for the chairman, with the  Violence Against Women Act and the ERA, among other pieces of  legislation that he is bringing to the floor. I thank him for the very  prolific and excellent work of the Committee on the Judiciary.   Madam Speaker, here we are dressed in white because it is Women's  History Month, and we are wearing the color of suffragists as we come  to the floor on these two important pieces of legislation--earlier  today, the equal rights amendment, and now the Violence Against Women  Act.   It is a historic day as the House passes two landmark, potentially  lifesaving pieces of legislation on behalf of America's women. We do  so, again, during Women's History Month. I sing the praises of  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who has been a relentless, persistent  advocate for this legislation over time; Karen Bass, one more, and our  distinguished chair of the committee.    Madam Speaker, we are particularly proud to be passing this  legislation under the leadership of one of its strongest champions,  President Joe Biden. In the Senate, he was the guardian of this law, as  he was the author of it. As a new-ish Member of Congress at the time, I  was proud to follow his lead and the lead in the House, then, of Leader  Schumer, now the distinguished majority leader in the Senate. So this  is an opportunity that we have for legislation, whose provenance goes  way back into the 1990s.   At that time, I was an appropriator. And after we passed the bill  that had the Violence Against Women Act, it was our responsibility to  make sure that it was funded properly, and that has been part of the  continuing advocacy.   Madam Speaker, in 2013, the legislation was last reauthorized under  the Presidency of Barack Obama and the Vice Presidency of Joe Biden,  who, again, was taking the lead for the reauthorization of the  legislation. It was a tough time. The bill passed first in the United  States Senate. Bipartisan in the United States Senate, the bill was  passed. They sent it to the House. The House refused to take it up-- Republican-controlled House refused to take it up.   And then they had their own bill, which said: We are against violence  against women, unless you happen to be a Native American or an LGBTQ  woman or an immigrant woman.   Well, these are the most vulnerable in terms of using violence  against women. So what happened was we persuaded the then-Speaker, Mr.  Boehner, to bring both bills to the floor. Of  [[Page H1462]]  course, the Senate-passed bipartisan bill prevailed. We had a big  ceremony, participated in by the Native American community, our law  enforcement community, Vice President Joe Biden, and signed by the  President.                                time  1215    So here we are, unable to get it reauthorized 5 years later, in 2018  under the then-majority and President, and here we are today, finally  able to bring bipartisan legislation to the floor.   And as I mentioned, for nearly three decades, the Violence Against  Women Act has been a transformative force for safety and security of  American women. Since its passage, domestic violence rates have  declined by nearly two-thirds in America. Millions of women have gained  access to protections from violence and abuse, and millions of  survivors, to essential services and justice.   But we cannot be complacent: One in three women today face domestic  abuse. Isn't that a stunning figure? You wonder, how could it be? And  partner violence is on the rise during the coronavirus pandemic, as  many women are forced to quarantine in homes that are not safe.   Every time the Congress has reauthorized VAWA, we have strengthened  its protections for women, based on extensive consultation with  survivors, victim service providers, Indian country, law enforcement,  and other experts. The authorization on the floor today continues that  progress.   And as has been said by Mr. Doggett, we have to recognize the danger  of the, shall we say, provisions in the bill that protect women from  gun violence specifically.   Among its many life-saving provisions, this reauthorization makes  vital new investments in prevention, improves services for victims of  domestic violence, makes improvements in the criminal justice system's  response to gender-based violence and to the healthcare system's  response, prevents intimate partner homicide, and expands protections  for victims and survivors, whether they are men or women. This is not  just about women, it is the Violence Against Women Act, but it does  protect anyone.   Democrats are particularly proud that this reauthorization improves  the essential protections that I referenced that were objected to on  the Republican bill in 2013, including women immigrants, LGBTQ, and  Native American women, and it specifically supports communities of  color in a culturally sensitive way.   This reauthorization is bipartisan, happily, and it is supported by  more than 200 organizations representing women, women's groups, faith- based organizations, law enforcement, the public health and medical  communities, civil rights groups; the list goes on.   While it is unfortunate that we don't know what will happen in the  Senate, we are optimistic that the reauthorization can be successful on  the other side of the Capitol, and on the other side of the aisle.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote for this  reauthorization, so that we can advance justice, safety, and dignity in  America.   Madam Speaker, the term VAWA has become synonymous with justice,  Violence Against Women Act. I urge an ``aye'' vote.
