 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment codifying the  Boots to Business program and authorizing it for 5 years.    The men and women who ably serve our Nation with honor deserve our  support as they transition from military to civilian life. Many of our  servicemembers have the temperament, drive, and skills to excel in  small business. They excel as small-business owners and as  entrepreneurs, but they oftentimes lack the industry-specific  experience to turn their dreams into reality.   The Boots to Business program helps bridge this gap by offering  exiting servicemembers and military spouses a 2-day in-person course on  business ownership, followed by more in-depth instruction through an 8- week online course.   Since the program launched in 2013, more than 50,000 veterans have  participated.   Earlier this week, the House Small Business Committee held a hearing  on veteran entrepreneurship. We had the chance to hear from veterans  who turned their careers as small-business owners successfully after  benefiting from the programming and training provided by the Boots to  Business program.   Codifying this important program is a bipartisan effort, and I urge  my colleagues to join us in support of the Boots to Business program  and more opportunities for our veterans.
