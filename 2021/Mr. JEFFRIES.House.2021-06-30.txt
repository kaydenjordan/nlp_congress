 Madam Speaker, the hypocrisy coming from some in this  Chamber is extraordinary. The radical right consistently claims to be  the party of law and order, but they refuse to sign off on an  investigation into the January 6 violent attack on the Capitol, which  embodied lawlessness and disorder.   They have chosen party over patriotism. They have chosen autocracy  over democracy. They have chosen the big lie over the rule of law. They  have chosen conspiracy theories over the Constitution. And, yes, they  have chosen the most corrupt President in American history over the  peaceful transfer of power.   But truth crushed to the ground will rise again, and we will uncover  the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth whether you like  it or not.
