 Would the gentlewoman from Connecticut yield for a  question for the purposes of a colloquy?    Does the gentlewoman support the Senate version of a CR?    The difference between the Senate version and this  version is that this version does not include Ukraine funding. Are you  telling me that you would shut down the government if there is not  Ukraine funding?    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time.    Today, on the last day before a potential government  shutdown, Speaker McCarthy will be putting a 45-day clean CR with  disaster relief on the floor.   I will vote in support of this legislation so that we can keep the  United States Government funded and open while we finish our  appropriations bills.   Anyone, Democrats or Republicans, who votes against a clean CR with  disaster relief is voting to shut the government down.   Whether it is Ukraine funding, securing the border, or reducing  spending, all of which I support, it will have to be negotiated during  the appropriations process.   All of us have a responsibility to lead and to govern. In a divided  government, none of us will get everything we want.   To shut the government down would be disastrous for the American  people, our military, and our economy. The time has come for everyone  to put the American people above all interests and continue to do our  work as responsible, reasonable, and serious legislators.   For anyone to vote ``no'' on this bill, they are voting to shut the  government down. If you are saying that you support the Senate CR but  you don't support this one, the only difference is Ukraine.   If you are telling the American people with a straight face that you  will shut the American government down over Ukraine, shame on you.
