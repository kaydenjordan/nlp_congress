 Madam President, today, February 7th, 2022, marks the 60th  anniversary of the day the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba first  went into effect. Just think of that--60 years. It is three  generations, 12 Presidents, 60 sessions of Congress, six  transformational decades ago, and dating all the way back to the middle  of the Cold War.   The goal of the embargo, which has been expanded multiple times, was  unmistakable. It was to depose the Cuban Government by imposing a vast  web of punitive sanctions designed to crush the Cuban economy and  incite a popular uprising. In fact, to be precise, in a declassified  April 1960 State Department memo confidently entitled ``The Decline and  Fall of Castro,'' they said the purpose was ``denying money and  supplies to Cuba, to decrease monetary and real wages, to bring about  hunger, desperation, and the overthrow of [the] government.'' What a  remarkable, humanitarian attitude on the part of people who had  absolutely no idea of what history is or what might happen.   Sixty years later, hunger and desperation are pervasive in Cuba, but  the Cuban Government remains under the firm grip of the Communist  Party. No opposition party has been allowed to function or to challenge  it. Free and fair elections are as elusive as they were 60 years ago.  Political dissent is not tolerated.   But the U.S. embargo, which we proudly and consistently have kept, is  opposed by every other nation in this hemisphere. In fact, it is  opposed by every other nation in the world except Israel. In other  words, after 60 years, we have convinced only one other government-- just one--to join us and not a single government in our own hemisphere.  This failed attempt to isolate Cuba succeeded only in isolating  ourselves.   Those responsible for this administration's policy toward Cuba have  apparently decided that, despite Candidate Biden's pledge to the  contrary; despite the failure of the embargo to achieve any of its  objectives, which the CIA acknowledged in a declassified report back in  1982; despite a worsening human rights situation; and despite  contributing to the misery of the Cuban people, whom the White House  insists it wants to help, there is no reason to change course.   Today, hard hit by COVID and the administration's cutoff of  remittances and restrictions on travel by Americans to Cuba, life for  most Cubans is an increasingly desperate struggle. Popular protests  against the government's mishandling of the pandemic, mishandling of  the economy, and autocratic rule have been met with a fierce crackdown,  summary trials, and lengthy prison sentences, including for young  people.   I have spoken many times about the stark disconnect between the  administration's policy toward Cuba and the reality in Cuba, so I am  not going to repeat what I said before. I am as outraged by the  crackdown on protesters in Cuba as anyone. Unlike many others, I have  actually said that to Cuban authorities. No one condones acts of  vandalism or violence, but provocations and abuse of peaceful  protesters are inexcusable.   I also know that trying to bludgeon the Cuban authorities into  submission does not work. What is the proof of that? We tried it for 60  years, and it hasn't worked. It has only made things worse. It  emboldens the hardliners in the government who can then blame the  United States for their own failed policies.   They are determined to hold on to power, and if they fail at  something, they just blame it on the United States.   But it hurts the Cuban people, impeding their ability to obtain  medical supplies as basic as syringes and masks to fight COVID and  preventing small businesses from accessing U.S. products.   I visited a lot of those small businesses. They actually want to deal  with America, and we are cutting them off. It flies in the face of our  belief in the power of diplomacy through engagement with countries  whose governments we disagree with, especially a country 90 miles away  whose people we share so much in common with.   Sooner or later--and I hope it is sooner--the administration needs to  face the fact that continuing Donald Trump's policy of punitive  sanctions and vitriol has backfired. The longer they delay that day of  reckoning, the worse it will be. And we can do better than this. We can  defend human rights, as we should. We can stand up for the right of  people to choose their leaders in free and fair elections, as we  should. We could also do what we do with virtually every other  government in the world with which we disagree: find areas of common  purpose for the benefit of the people in both countries.   So on this 60th anniversary of a Cold War policy of sanctions and  isolation that has failed in every conceivable way, let's dedicate  ourselves to a new way forward that our allies and partners in this  hemisphere will support, that the American people support, that  supports the Cuban people, and most importantly, that we can show the  rest of the world it is worthy of the United States, worthy of us. What  we are  [[Page S538]]  doing right now is not. We can do better. We must do better.   I think of so many young people I have talked to and met in Cuba who  want a different world and can't understand why the United States slams  the door on them. We can do better. We have to do better. I pray we  will do better.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, serving in the U.S. Senate for as long as I  have, I have seen dedicated, talented staffers come and go from my  team. Some come to my office fresh out of college, spend some time, and  move on to other opportunities or to further their education. Some have  come to stay for years. And others join my team, already seasoned  veterans of the Senate--and leave for higher office.   So is the story of my dear friend, Sonceria Ann Berry, the 34th  Secretary of the Senate, and my former deputy chief of staff. It was  with great pride when, on March 1, 2021, I administered the oath to Ann  as she became our own Madam Secretary. And it should come as no  surprise that Ann brought to the esteemed position decades of  experience in the Senate. A seasoned professional who has seen changes  in leadership through the Congresses, Ann has counseled and mentored,  quite literally, hundreds of staffers young and old. Her appointment as  the Secretary of Senate was a source of great pride for me, and I am  sure the other Members for whom she worked, including Senator Carper  and former Senator John Edwards, as well as the late Senators Daniel  Patrick Moynihan and Howell Heflin, share that pride.   Secretary Berry is a 1978 graduate of the University of North  Alabama, where she earned her bachelor degree in education. She  recently returned to the University of North Alabama to deliver the  fall commencement address. I found her words inspiring to the new  graduates she addressed and instructional for those embarking in  postgraduate life.   I would like to ask unanimous consent that Secretary Berry's  commencement remarks be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     Commencement Address--Sonceria Ann Berry, Secretary of the Senate             fall 2021 commencement, university of north alabama         Thank you for that wonderful introduction, and let me begin       by congratulating the Class of 2021 for sticking with it,       overcoming unprecedented challenges, and graduating with a       well-earned degree in resilience, in addition to what you       majored in.        College graduation is always a remarkable achievement, but       nobody has ever been through what you've been through to get       here, and you can wear this experience and this hard-won       success like a badge of honor for the rest of your life.        Congratulations also to your families and friends who have       helped you get to this day.        They are heroes, just like you, and they have made their       own sacrifices to support your ambitions. And I think they       deserve their own round of applause.        I graduated from the University of North Alabama, with a       degree in secondary education, in 1978.        As it happened, I didn't spend a minute of my career in       secondary education.        Life had other things in store for me, and because of those       completely unexpected things, earlier this year, this fine       university honored me with its Lifetime Achievement Award.        They said it was because I was the first African American       ever to serve as Secretary of the Senate--the chief       administrative, legislative and financial officer of the       world's greatest deliberative body.        Or they may have just been looking for someone who       graduated a really long time ago.        Either way, it was very special to me, because it was this       university that set me on a path of life I would never have       dreamed of before coming here.        Before UNA, my ambition was to get a good office job.        I was a pretty good typist and I was hoping for a career in       an office as a secretary.        I was poor. I wanted to work and make money and have some       security for myself and my family.        But after high school, I found work at the Home Insurance       Company in Homewood, Alabama.        They call it a ``gap year'' now when you take a year       between high school and college to figure yourself out.        But, for me, it wasn't anything so fancy. It was a year of       making a living.        But it was also when I first learned about the University       of North Alabama.        And the more I learned about it, the better I knew that it       was the place for me.        UNA was not only the State's oldest public university, with       a heritage of training some of Alabama's finest teachers.        In an era when it was still quite unusual for women to go       to college, UNA had already opened its doors to women for a       hundred years.        And this year, UNA proudly celebrates its 150th anniversary       of co-education with the Year of the UNA Woman.        I was also impressed by the academic rigor built into the       tradition of UNA.        In its days as Florence Wesleyan University, prospective       students had to demonstrate an ability to translate four       books of Caesar's Gallic Wars from the original Latin, and       six books of Virgil from the original Greek, into English.        I think all of us feel fortunate that those particular       skills are no longer required for admission to the University       of North Alabama.        I know I did, and yet I quickly discovered that this       university's academic standards remained commendably high,       and so were its standards of conduct and ethics.        It was also a community, where people cared about each       other, helped each other, encouraged each other, nurtured       each other.        The course of my life was changed in just this way.        After graduation, when I couldn't find work as a teacher, I       took a job as a secretary in the engineering department of       South Central Bell.        But a year later, in 1979, I was contacted by the office of       Alabama's newly-elected United States Senator Howell Heflin       about a position in the Senator's Washington office.        I didn't know Senator Heflin, or how his office had found       me.        But I learned later that Dr. Robert Guillot, the president       of UNA for whom I had served as a student aide in the       Admissions Office, had recommended me to the Senator.        And I was off to Washington, DC--a city I had never seen--      for what Dr. Guillot correctly called ``the opportunity of a       lifetime.''        That was forty-two years ago, and in the decades since, I       have been proud to work not only for Senator Heflin but later       for five other United States Senators in positions of       increasing responsibility.        I was thinking seriously of retiring earlier this year when       I was offered the position of Secretary of the Senate--a       position for which I was nominated by the Majority Leader,       Chuck Schumer of New York, and to which I was elected by the       full membership of the United States Senate.        Today I manage the Senate as an institution, supervising 26       departments, nearly 240 employees and a $25 million budget.        My team and I are responsible for everything from recording       each day's Senate debates to running the Senate gift shop.        The Parliamentarian of the Senate, the Senate Historian,       the office of interparliamentary services, and the people who       pay 100 Senators and thousands of staff people report to me.        And I am proud to be the first African American, and the       eighth woman,  [[Page S540]]       in the 232-year history of the Senate to hold this office.        But what I found most compelling about being called to this       assignment was another historic opportunity that had nothing       to do with being Black or being a woman or being a pioneer of       any kind.        It was the opportunity to support, lead and nurture a       remarkable group of people who protected our democracy during       the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol.        When the rioters tried to disrupt the ratification of       Electoral College ballots, the people I work with secured       those ballots until the crisis had passed.        When the rioters roamed through the Capitol building       threatening harm to anyone they encountered, the people I       work with barricaded themselves in their offices and kept       working.        When the rioters put democracy itself in danger on that       infamous day, the people I work with waited them out and       certified the same peaceful transfer of power that has been       the hallmark of our government for more than two hundred       years.        The people I work with are the ultimate public servants.        They are the unsung heroes of our Republic, drawn not to       fame and glory but to the quiet, professional, essential       mission of supporting our institutions of government--on good       days and really bad days alike.        And being their leader--not the fancy title, or the big       office in the Capitol building, or the pioneering path I       took--is the greatest honor of my life.        I would never have dreamed, when I was a student here, that       my life's journey would lead me to this calling.        The fact that it came after four decades on Capitol Hill,       when retirement was beckoning me, only makes it more       remarkable, more deeply personal and satisfying.        As you sit here, contemplating your own futures, I would       simply encourage you to focus not so much on a specific       destination as on the journey itself.        I didn't become an educator, though that was the dream of       my youth.        I did things I never dared to dream. I saved the best for       last.        And I have learned that the journey--with all its twists       and turns, peaks and valleys, sunshine and shadow--is what       life is really about.        The journey is the choices you make, large and small. So       make good ones.        It's the people you encounter, famous and familiar, heroes       and villains alike. So be kind to people, and be the kind of       person you want others to be.        It's the preparations you make, not least those you have       made these past four years right here at the University of       North Alabama.        It's the risks you take, like leaving the security of my       family for an adventure in the nation's capital.        And it's the understanding you gain, slowly over the years,       of what's important and what's not, what's lasting and what's       fleeting, who you are and what you're supposed to do in your       time on earth.        Philosophers tell us that ``life must be lived forwards,       but can only be understood backwards.''        That's exactly the way I look at my life now and understand       my purpose, improbable as it was when I sat where you sit so       many years ago.        As you begin your own adventure in the wide world, I urge       you to heed these simple, but profound, words of Ernest       Hemingway:        ``It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is       the journey that matters, in the end.''        Congratulations, good luck, and enjoy your journey.                            ____________________
