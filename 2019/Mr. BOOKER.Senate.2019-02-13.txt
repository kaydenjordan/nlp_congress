 Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of  William Barr to be the next Attorney General of the United States of  America.   Last Thursday, I voted against his nomination in the Senate Judiciary  Committee, as did nine of my fellow Committee Members. I voted against  his nomination because of some very serious concerns I have with his  record on everything from criminal justice to environmental justice, to  defending the economic rights of Americans, the rights of immigrants,  LGBTQ rights, and women's rights.   I want to go through those concerns here on the floor today, but I  also want to be clear that Mr. Barr has been nominated at a time of  extraordinary challenge when it comes to defending rights in this  country. This is a crisis.   We are in a moment in history when, after years of attacks on civil  rights by this President and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, some of  our most fundamental democratic principles--the rule of law, separation  of powers, equal protection under the law--are hanging in the balance.  We now face a full-blown crisis when it comes to rolling back the  rights of Americans.   From community to community across the country, we see what it looks  like when the Department of Justice fails to pursue justice for all  Americans.   It looks like hate crimes in this country are on the rise for the  third year in a row but a Department of Justice that rolls back  protections for LGBTQ Americans instead of strengthening them.   It looks like more than one-third of all the LGBTQ youth in the  country missing school because they feel unsafe but a DOJ that refuses  to fight for them and protect them against State laws that target  transgender students.   It looks like unchecked voter suppression of Black Americans in  Georgia, Native Americans in North Dakota, and the voter ID and voter  purge laws across the country that tried to target and suppress  minority voters but a Justice Department that has stood by and failed  to take on one single voting rights case during the last 2 years.   It looks like communities that are being poisoned by corporate  polluters pushing their costs of doing business onto neighborhoods  least able to defend themselves, making their land and air and water  toxic but a DOJ that has made it easier for polluters to get settlement  agreements while cutting its own enforcement capacity to hold those  corporate polluters accountable.   It looks like corporate malfeasance continuing to target the most  vulnerable while DOJ enforcement of corporate penalties drops by 90  percent during the first 2 years of the Trump administration.   It looks like doubling down on the failed war on drugs, which is  known to be not a war on drugs but a war on the American people-- disproportionately low-income Americans, disproportionately mentally  ill Americans, disproportionately addicted Americans, and  disproportionately Black and Brown people--which is exactly what Jeff  Sessions did when he directed all Federal prosecutors to ``charge and  pursue the most serious, readily provable offense'' and seek the  highest penalties in nonviolent drug crimes.   It looks like unarmed Black men being killed by officers in their own  homes and backyards, Americans of color being disproportionately  stopped and arrested without adequate systems of accountability, but  having a DOJ that limits the use of consent decrees that can prevent  systemic abuses of power by law enforcement and can actually help to  make law enforcement better, more accountable, more effective,  rebuilding and repairing the trust  [[Page S1306]]  between law enforcement and communities necessary to create safe and  strong communities.   Of course, it looks like children fleeing violence, being ripped from  the arms of their parents, of their mothers at the southern border, 6- year-olds being thrown into cages, and an untold number of children who  still have not been reunited with their families because of the DOJ's  so-called zero-tolerance policy.   Right now we see a Justice Department whose leadership over the past  2 years has failed countless communities, from low-income Americans who  are being victimized by large corporations with bad actors to  individual Americans who are trying to have their basic, fundamental  rights protected.   The Justice Department has failed the American people, and, most of  all, it has failed to seek that ideal we all hold dear, which is equal  justice under the law. That is why, at this moment in history, during  this crisis of conscience, during this crisis of moral leadership, we  need an Attorney General who grasps the urgency of the moment, who is  aware of the impact of the Department of Justice on communities across  this country, and who is willing and prepared to protect our most  fundamental rights in every community for every American. That is the  ideal of justice; that is the ideal of patriotism.   What is patriotism but love of country? You cannot love your country  unless you love your fellow country men and women. What does love look  like in public? Justice, justice, justice.   I appreciate that Mr. Barr took the time to sit down and meet with  me. It was after the hearings; yet at my request, he finally agreed to  come and meet with me. There was no staff in the room. It was an  honorable gesture--a gesture of courtesy. We had a chance to have  dialogue about his record, his experiences, his perspectives as well as  mine. I appreciate that. It is a constructive first step.   I appreciate his willingness to listen to me and talk about his  record of mass incarceration. I even appreciate his willingness to  accept the book I gave him--I hope he reads it--titled ``The New Jim  Crow'' by Michelle Alexander.   I continue to have concerns about Mr. Barr's ability and willingness  to be the kind of Attorney General this country needs at this pivotal  moment in American history. I am concerned because throughout his  career, time and again, and during his confirmation process, Mr. Barr  has demonstrated not only that he holds troubling views but also that  he has an alarming lack of knowledge about the crises that make our  justice system so broken right now, at a time when the United States  continues to lead the globe, to lead the planet Earth and all of  humanity in the sheer number of people we incarcerate.   One out of every four people incarcerated on the planet Earth is  right here in the United States, the land of the free. One out of every  three incarcerated women on the planet Earth is right here in America,  the land of the free. I say, again, that they are not the wealthy; they  are not the privileged. As my friend Bryan Stevenson says: We have a  nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're  poor and innocent.   Since 1980, our prison population in this country alone has grown on  the Federal level by 800 percent. You can tell a lot about a nation by  whom they incarcerate. In Russia they incarcerate political prisoners.  In Turkey they incarcerate members of the media. In this country we  incarcerate the poor. We incarcerate Americans with mental illnesses,  Americans with disabilities, Americans who are survivors of sexual  assault, Americans who are struggling with addiction, people who have  faced harm and need help, who often in the system get hurt and  experience retribution and not restorative justice. We have a nation  where we are locking people up for doing things that two of the last  three Presidents admitted to doing.   Mr. Barr has a record of actively pushing the policies that have led  to mass incarceration, that have driven up our Nation's prison  populations at a time when we need an Attorney General who is willing  to follow the lead of this body, which passed criminal justice reform.   When Mr. Barr served as Attorney General during the first Bush  administration, he literally wrote the book on mass incarceration. He  commissioned a report titled ``The Case for More Incarceration'' and  wrote the forward endorsing it. He is an architect of the criminal  justice system that is so disproportionate--out of proportionality-- that is ruthless, doing things that other countries, until this body  acted, called torture, like juvenile solitary confinement.   At his hearing, Mr. Barr said he recognized that some things have  changed over the last quarter century, but he failed to explain how his  views on criminal justice have actually evolved. He was describing more  of what he was seeing this body and others do, but he didn't talk about  his own evolution. He didn't say: Hey, that was my perspective then,  and it has changed now.   On the issue of implicit racial bias, I asked him if he acknowledged  its well-documented existence in our criminal justice system. Implicit  racial bias has been pointed out by both sides of the aisle in this  body, by big city police chiefs and a former FBI Director. Time and  again, it has been documented by university studies. It is actually in  our Justice Department's policies to train people in implicit racial  bias. This isn't something that is new. This is something we  understand.   When asked about it, Mr. Barr said:         I have not studied the issue of implicit racial bias in our       criminal justice system. . . . Therefore, I have not become       sufficiently familiar with the issue to say whether such bias       exists.    I find this incredibly alarming. There are widely documented  instances of racial disparities throughout our criminal justice system  from police stops to sentencing, to charges. Racial bias exists even in  our school pipeline; with Black kids and White kids having committed  the same infractions in school, African-American kids are more likely  to be suspended for them.   There is no difference, for example, between Blacks and Whites in the  United States of America for using drugs--no differences for Blacks,  Whites, Latinos. We have a drug problem in America, and it is equally  seen, regardless of race. Whites are more likely than Blacks, in many  studies, to deal drugs. Yet, despite this, we live in a country where  Blacks are about three times more likely to be arrested for using drugs  and almost four times more likely to be arrested for selling drugs.   What does it do when you apply a justice system to certain  communities and not to others? It has a multiplier effect of impact. It  affects voting rights because States still eliminate the right to vote  for nonviolent drug charges. It is called felony disenfranchisement. It  affects economic opportunity because if you have one criminal  conviction for doing the same things that past Presidents have admitted  to doing and Members of this body have admitted to doing, then you  can't get a job, you can't get business licenses. Doors are shut to  you; opportunity is closed. When you have a justice system that  disproportionately impacts certain Americans, those communities then  face serious, serious consequences.   As a Villanova study shows, overall, we would have about 20 percent  less poverty in America if our incarceration rates were the same as  those of our industrial peers. Poverty is more inflicted on those  communities of color when they are more likely to be arrested, charged,  and convicted because of the existence of implicit racial bias.   But the nominee for the top law enforcement position in our country  says he is not sure ``whether such bias exists.''   This should be deeply troubling to all Americans because we believe  in an ideal of equal justice under the law. This should be troubling to  all Americans because we believe, as King said, ``Injustice anywhere is  a threat to justice everywhere.''   This should be deeply troubling to all Americans because there is a  deep lack of faith that people have in our criminal justice system.  They are losing faith that they will receive equal treatment.   When the justice system does not operate in good faith, it is  hampered in doing its most sacred duty.   Right now there is a lack of belief that people will be treated  fairly, a lack of belief that the system works  [[Page S1307]]  the way it is supposed to. Mr. Barr's response and his record show me  that he will do nothing to address these legitimate concerns in  communities all across this country. At a time when he could be a  leader, a champion, a light of justice and hope for those who have lost  hope, for those who have lost faith, for those who feel left out and  left behind, he almost doubles down with a dangerous lack of knowledge  about what we all know exists.   If confirmed, Mr. Barr would also be charged with implementing what  this body collectively has done to start to reform, for the first time  in American history, mass incarceration and increased sentencing.   For the first time since 1994's crime bill, we in this body, with  wisdom and in a bipartisan way, have started to go back to more  proportionate sentencing. Through the FIRST STEP Act, this body put  more justice back into our justice system. It is the first step, but it  is the first step in the right direction in decades in our country's  history.   I am proud of what we did together. The bipartisan criminal justice  reform that this body just passed into law, by an overwhelming vote, is  incredible, but it is critical that the FIRST STEP Act be fully and  fairly implemented by the Justice Department. Mr. Barr has not  demonstrated his commitment to the law or to fixing any part of the  broken criminal justice system I have outlined.   Then, of course, we have industries, from the private prison industry  to phone companies charging exorbitant fees in prisons and jails,  making a profit off of these injustices, making a profit off policies  that penalize and criminalize low-income communities and communities of  color and that target refugees of color.   What is happening in our country's criminal justice system today is a  human rights crisis. Think about a justice system right now that has  people sitting in prison for months before they even get a trial  because they can't afford bail or a lawyer. We have a human rights  crisis in this country.   We need an Attorney General who recognizes the problem and has a  willingness to do something about it, not one who says they are not  sure we even have a crisis. This is an extraordinarily challenging time  in our history. This Nation was formed under ideals of justice and  fairness and equality. It was formed at a time when we mutually pledged  to each other--as it says in our Declaration of Independence--``our  lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.'' This is a country where we  are all in this together. This is a country where our values and ideals  have to be real for all and not just a select few.   After 2 years, we have seen the Justice Department's relentless  attacks on basic fundamental rights by our President and Attorney  General. We now need an Attorney General who will work to uphold the  values that are most in danger. We need an Attorney General who will  fight for equal justice for all, not just the privileged few. We need  an Attorney General who knows the difference between ensuring justice  is done and does not automatically seek the harshest penalty in every  case, with a blind eye to circumstances, or facts, or extenuating  circumstances.   We need an Attorney General who will stand up for all of our  children, LGBTQ rights, for voting rights, environmental justice, and a  fairer justice system. We need an Attorney General who will refocus on  the mission of the Department of Justice in seeking justice for every  young person who is afraid to go to school because of prejudice and  policies that discriminate. We need one who is seeking justice for  every elderly man who lived through Jim Crow only to be blocked from  exercising his voting rights because of racially targeted voter ID  laws.   We need an Attorney General who is seeking justice for Americans who  have become entrapped in our broken criminal justice system, whether it  is a kid from a community like the one I live in who is being targeted  by our ineffective drug laws or kids who have been picked up on the  southern border and thrown into a privately run detention center.   We need an Attorney General who is seeking justice for communities  whose soil, air, and water are being polluted by massive corporations  and that feel no one will fight for them. We need an Attorney General  who will live up to the purpose of the Justice Department. This is the  call of our country. This is the leadership we need. This is the  Attorney General we must insist on, one who will seek justice for  everyone in every community from the gulf coast to the Great Lakes,  from sea to shining sea.   Mr. Barr has not demonstrated that he understands the fierce urgency  of this moment in our history and the imperative for the Attorney  General to be deeply disturbed by injustice and to urgently seek  justice. For this main reason, I will be voting against his nomination,  but if confirmed, I will perform my constitutional duty and provide  oversight and accountability. I will continue to work to ensure that  our Justice Department lives up to its demands.   I hope this Attorney General, should he be confirmed, learns, sees  the vulnerable, understands the challenges of the meek, and understands  communities in crisis; that he gets to know people; that he reaches out  and sits down with folks to learn and to develop a more courageous  empathy, but I will not wait on that.   I will fight every day to make sure our Justice Department seeks  justice. If Mr. Barr tries to double down on the failures of a broken  criminal justice system, tries to roll back basic rights, or fails to  protect voting rights and civil rights, I will fight against his  efforts at every step. I will fight for justice that doesn't just take  the side of the powerful few but seeks justice for all Americans. That  is our obligation--all of us. Whether you sit in this body or you sit  in communities across this country, we have gotten to where we are  because we all sought justice. Even if it didn't affect our families  directly, we knew the call of our country must be about all of us  understanding that injustice for one is an injustice for all.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
