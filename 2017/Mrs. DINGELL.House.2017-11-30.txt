 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3017, the  Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and Reauthorization  Act of 2017.   The bill before us today is a good bipartisan, compromise bill that  will reauthorize $250 million in funding for the brownfields program  under the Environmental Protection Agency for each fiscal year through  2021.   The EPA's brownfields program has a long history of empowering  States, local communities, and other stakeholders to work together to  prevent contaminated sites from endangering public health and the  environment.   Brownfields grants continue to serve as the foundation of the EPA's  brownfields program. These grants support revitalization efforts by  funding environmental assessments, cleanup, and job training activities  nationwide.   Additionally, this bill makes a number of overall improvements to the  law that will strengthen brownfields remediation into the future.   In 2013, the Downriver Community Conference in my district received a  brownfields funding grant to clear out asbestos and other hazardous  materials from a hangar at the Willow Run Airport. Once the original  home of Rosie the Riveters during World War II, today the site of the  Arsenal of Democracy is now the home of the American Center for  Mobility, a national DOT proving ground for the testing and validation  of connected and automated vehicles, autonomous vehicles.   There are many success stories like this one and all across the  country that would not have been possible without brownfields grant  funding. This matters.   Mr. Speaker, I thank every member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee for working across the aisle to find a bipartisan way forward  on reauthorization. We need to do more of this.   This program has proved its merits again and again and has  historically had strong bipartisan support. It is my sincere hope this  will carry over to today's vote and will continue through the  appropriations process.
