 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Senate amendments  to H.R. 251, the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program  Extension Act. This bill reauthorizes the Chemical Facilities Anti- Terrorism Standards program, more commonly known as CFATS, for a period  of 15 months.   CFATS is a vital national security program that makes Americans safer  by helping chemical facilities secure dangerous substances. Under  CFATS, security and industry stakeholders must work together to  identify high-risk facilities and ensure appropriate security measures  are in place to mitigate these risks.   I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle and in  the Senate to develop a long-term reauthorization to protect our Nation  and provide certainty to industry.   I thank my colleagues in the Senate for taking up this urgent matter  to prevent this program from expiring, and I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).   (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill  to allow this program, which protects and secures our chemical  facilities, to continue, and I yield back the balance of my time.
