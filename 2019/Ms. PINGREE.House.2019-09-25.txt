 Madam Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 1595, the SAFE  Banking Act, which passed this House this afternoon.   Maine voters have legalized marijuana. Like every other business,  cannabis companies in Maine and other legalization States need  financial institutions to help them start and grow.   Maine credit unions and banks want to help. They were early advocates  of the SAFE Banking Act. They recognize that a safe harbor is necessary  so that lenders can assist this emerging industry sector, to the  benefit of consumers, lenders, and law enforcement.   Just yesterday, a banker from southern Maine contacted me out of  regret. The bank had to close a long-time customer's account when they  found out he was a delivery driver for a legal marijuana producer. Due  to potential Federal liability, the bank lost a customer. The citizen  lost his trusted financial institution.   Does he have to keep his earnings under a mattress?   This makes no sense. The SAFE Banking Act will fix this problem by  allowing lenders to legally serve marijuana businesses. It promotes  security by ensuring transactions are done through regulated  institutions, not with bags of cash.                            ____________________
