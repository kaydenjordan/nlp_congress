 Mr. President, it is not entirely unusual to have policy in  an appropriations bill. It happens with some regularity. In fact, it  happened in the corresponding House appropriations measure.   What we are talking about here is some of the worst kind of lawmaking  that occurs here in the swamp, in Washington, DC. Congress sets forth a  broad, vague standard, and an executive branch agency figures out the  rest, sometimes with disastrous consequences.   In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers came up with a  clean water rule, also known as the waters of the United States rule,  one that effectively dramatically expanded the jurisdiction of the  Federal Government over land in the United States, in some instances  saying that if a plot of land is wet some of the time, some of the  year, during any particular year, you can be subject to massive fines  totalling millions of dollars if you do anything on that land, subject  to the arbitrary determinations of Federal bureaucrats.   This is something that garnered bipartisan support in the 114th  Congress. We had 49 cosponsors and ended up having 53 people vote to  undo this under a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval.  That was Republicans and Democrats. Tragically, President Obama vetoed  that measure, and we were unable to secure the votes to override that  veto.   This particular measure is in the House appropriations bill that  corresponds to this one. I urge my colleagues to support it and to  oppose the motion to table.
