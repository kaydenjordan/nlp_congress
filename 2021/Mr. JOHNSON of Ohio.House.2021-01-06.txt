 Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this  objection and to give voice to the 249,386 men and women of Ohio's  Sixth Congressional District who have had their voices silenced by the  rogue political actors in Pennsylvania who unilaterally and  unconstitutionally altered voting methods to benefit the Democratic  candidate for President.   Secretaries of state and State supreme courts cannot simply ignore  the rules governing elections set forth in the Constitution. They  cannot choose to usurp their state legislatures to achieve a partisan  end, Constitution be damned.   Madam Speaker, this is a sad day for America. We have seen too many  sad days like this recently: assaults on courthouses, police stations,  and now the U.S. Capitol. People who disagree with the results of  police work and court decisions are wrong to respond violently. And  people who disagree with the results of an election are also wrong to  respond with violence. Thank you to the Capitol Police and all the law  enforcement involved for protecting the people's House today.   Madam Speaker, some may question our motives for raising these  objections, but other than the Bible, our Constitution is the most  sacred document known to man because it created the most free and  prosperous nation in human history.                                time  0210    2021 has the chance to be remembered for when the leaders of a deeply  divided America came together to defend that sacred document and to  ensure that the integrity of future Presidential elections is ensured.  It is imperative we take this opportunity. The future of our Republic  depends on it.   Benjamin Franklin, in the summer of 1787, during the heated debate to  create our sacred Constitution, said these famous words: ``I have lived  long, sir, a long time . . . and the longer I live, the more convincing  proofs I see of this truth . . . that God governs in the affairs of  men.   ``And, if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is  it probable that an empire can rise without His aid? We have been  assured, sir, in the sacred writing that `Except the Lord build it,  they labor in vain that build it.' ''   Madam Speaker, I pray that we would turn to the God Almighty that  ordained our Nation into being to help us in our time of need.
