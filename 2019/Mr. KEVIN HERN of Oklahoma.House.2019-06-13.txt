 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my  June Veteran of the Month, Mr. Oscar Nipps, Jr., and to share his  American hero story.   Mr. Nipps served as a rifleman, company cook, and sergeant with the  1st Calvary division during World War II, liberating thousands of  civilians from the Santo Tomas Internment Camp. He continued fighting  alongside the Allied forces to liberate the Philippines and was on a  ship headed to the front lines of the Japan invasion when victory was  declared over Japan in 1945.   At 92 years old, he continues to be a leader and public servant as a  volunteer at the Military History Museum in Broken Arrow. In fact, the  city has even named two streets in his honor.  [[Page H4632]]    He is a familiar face at the museum, where he shares his stories of  the brave men and women he fought beside and friends he lost during the  war.   Mr. Nipps' bravery will never be forgotten, and I am grateful for the  work he continues to do to serve this great country and share the  stories of those who fought for justice and peace. I am honored to name  him the First District's Veteran of the Month for June.                            ____________________
