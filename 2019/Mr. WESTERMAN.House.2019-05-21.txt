 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 100th  anniversary of the 19th Amendment and the efforts of the women's  suffrage movement in the United States.   Susan B. Anthony once said: ``Oh, if I could but live another century  and see the fruition of all the work for the women. There is so much  yet to be done.''   Now that we stand on the other side of that century, it is only  fitting that we honor the suffragettes who paved the way for millions  of women to vote and hold public office.   By a vote of 74-15, my home State of Arkansas became the 12th State  to ratify the 19th Amendment.   I would like to specifically recognize Ms. Hattie Wyatt Caraway from  Jonesboro, Arkansas, the first woman to ever be elected to the United  States Senate and whose portrait is prominently displayed outside the  Senate Chamber.   A truly representative democracy necessitates that all voices be  heard, and the 19th Amendment signified a turning point in government.   America's legacy of strong women continues on today in the lives of  each woman who casts a ballot and runs for office. I am honored to  serve alongside many of these women.                            ____________________
