 Mr. President, I am truly honored to join my friend and  colleague Senator Lujan to recognize the life of Congressional Medal of  Honor recipient and Gallup's own staff sergeant, Hiroshi ``Hershey''  Miyamura, who passed away this past November.   The State of New Mexico ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in  honor of one of our State's and, really, one of our entire Nation's  greatest heroes.   A second-generation Japanese American, Hershey Miyamura first  volunteered for the U.S. Army near the end of World War II. He did so  at a time when many of his fellow Japanese Americans--and that includes  his future wife--were detained in American internment camps. He served  in the storied 442nd Infantry Regiment, which was composed of soldiers  with Japanese ancestry and became one of the most decorated units in  U.S. military history. Following the start of the Korean war in 1950,  the Army recalled Miyamura, who had remained in the Army Reserves, into  Active Duty.   The Korean war is often labeled the ``Forgotten War,'' and it is true  that far too many Americans have forgotten the incredible sacrifices  that were made by American servicemembers who fought alongside Korean  as well as United Nations allies. More than 36,000 American  servicemembers and more than 7,200 members of the Korean Augmentation  to the U.S. Army gave their lives to defend a free and democratic South  Korea. In the face of unthinkably harsh conditions, many servicemembers  demonstrated the very best of what it means to be an American--none  more so than Hershey Miyamura.   During an intense overnight firefight from April 24 to April 25,  1951, then-Corporal Miyamura ordered the men in his machine gun squad  to fall back. Corporal Miyamura covered the withdrawal of his entire  company from advancing enemy forces. He killed more than 50 enemy  combatants in both hand-to-hand combat and with his machine gun. After  he sustained severe wounds, enemy forces captured Corporal Miyamura as  a prisoner of war but not until after he had allowed all 16 of the men  in his machinegun squad to safely withdraw. In later years, Hershey was  most proud of the fact that each and every one of the men who were  under his charge that night survived the entire Korean war and returned  home to his family.   After his capture, Corporal Miyamura marched hundreds of miles to a  prisoner of war camp, where he would endure nearly 2\1/2\ years of  captivity. During this time, he served as a source of strength and  comfort to many of his fellow prisoners of war as they endured terrible  conditions.   Nearly a month after an armistice agreement was reached, ending the  hostilities on the Korean Peninsula, Corporal Miyamura was finally  turned over to American authorities in Freedom Village. In a living  history interview conducted years later with the Congressional Medal of  Honor Society, Hershey remembered what it was like to see the American  flag flying again for the very first time.   Hershey said:         Until I saw that flag, the Star Spangled Banner, waving in       the breeze, did I know that I had learned what it represents.       That alone is what makes you feel so humble.    It was also only after his release that Hershey learned that his  actions had earned him the Congressional Medal of Honor. Upon his  return to the United States, President Dwight D. Eisenhower presented  Corporal Miyamura with the Medal of Honor at a ceremony at the White  House.   Hershey also received a Purple Heart, a Prisoner of War Medal, a  Combat Infantryman Badge, and a Meritorious Service Medal, in addition  to the service medals recognizing his service both in the Korean war as  well as in World War II. He achieved a final ranking in the U.S. Army  of staff sergeant.   Hershey Miyamura's lifelong dedication to his country never ceased.  It continued long after his decorated military service ended. After he  received his honorable discharge from the Army, Hershey opened up a  service station along Route 66 in his hometown of Gallup, NM. He  remained active in his community until his dying days in advocating for  his fellow veterans and in inspiring young people with lectures on  patriotism, faith, and service.   It was one of the greatest honors of my public service career to work  alongside Hershey in opening the VA's community-based outpatient clinic  in Gallup in 2015. In 2018, I was also proud to join Hershey for a tour  of the site that is now the Gallup State Veterans Cemetery.   In recent years, Hershey touched the lives of countless young people  in Gallup during his regular visits with students at the local high  school that is  [[Page S7217]]  named in his honor. The Miyamura High School Patriots wear the colors  purple and silver in honor of Hershey's Purple Heart; and a bronze  statue of Hershey in his Army uniform and wearing his Medal of Honor  stands at the main entrance of Hiroshi Miyamura High School.   I hope that none of us will ever forget the profound example of  humility and patriotism that Hershey Miyamura left to each of us as his  enduring legacy. Hershey Miyamura truly embodied the best of what our  Nation stands for.   My thoughts are with Hershey's daughter Kelly; his sons, Pat and  Mike; his four grandchildren, and all of those in New Mexico and across  our great Nation who are mourning his loss and honoring his memory.
