 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my  fellow female Members of the House of Representatives to pay tribute to  Jeannette Rankin, the first woman elected to the U.S. House of  Representatives 100 years ago.   A mere 4 years after Congresswoman Rankin's landmark election, three  more women were elected to Congress, including Mae Ella Nolan.   Congresswoman Nolan was not only the first woman from California to  be elected to Congress, she was also the first woman to chair a  congressional committee.   Mr. Speaker, now a century after Jeannette Rankin was sworn into  Congress, it is not enough to simply recognize the significant  contributions  [[Page H2736]]  women have made throughout history, we must also look to the future.   We have made significant strides in this country, but more are  needed. Women represent over 50 percent of the population, yet we still  face significant obstacles in the workplace, academia, and elsewhere.  That is why we must work together to expand opportunities, remove  barriers, and empower the next generation of women.   We must always remember that we stand on the shoulders of those who  came before us and fought for equality--equality of opportunity, not- quality of outcome.   As we strive to make our country stronger for the next generation, we  must continue to fight so that each woman has an equal opportunity to  compete and to excel based on her abilities and accomplishments.   I want to thank the co-chairs of the Congressional Women's Caucus,  Congresswoman Brooks, and Congresswoman Frankel, for sponsoring this  Special Order.
