 Mr. Chairman, as I have listened, again,  I want to point out the same thing I pointed out the other day, that  they act as if you go to the doctor and the doctor says you have a  dreaded disease, that you can go out the next day and get an insurance  contract. That is simply not true.   Affordable Care Act contracts are not available until January 1 of  next year. You can sign up for them starting in November, but you will  not have coverage until the first of next year.   And if you think healthcare was expensive and insurance was expensive  before the Affordable Care Act, you sure ought to look at it now,  because it is significantly more.   I just want to point out that there is a lot of good stuff in this  legislation, there really is. I commend both the Democrats and the  Republicans on the committee for the work that is done to help the  American citizens on the prescription drug issue.   But as a Representative who has 24 counties, in over half the  counties that I represent, they have only one insurance carrier--only  one insurance carrier. I can tell you these skinny plans are important.  If you lose your coverage, where we live, it is, in many cases, the  only thing that is available to you.   Is it what people want to have? Is it what we want people to have? I  would tell you, no, it is not, but it is sure better than nothing.   So I hope that, as things move forward, we will be able to get some  things done on the prescription drugs.   But again, 24 counties that I represent, half of them only have one  insurance option. Those insurance carriers, exempt from the antitrust  laws of the country--that is the way they wrote the Affordable Care  Act. They left them exempt from the antitrust laws of the country.
