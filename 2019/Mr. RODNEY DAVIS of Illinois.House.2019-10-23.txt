 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my  friend, Tom Tracy, Jr., an active and beloved community member who  passed away unexpectedly last month at the age of 47.   Tom grew up in Ivesdale, Illinois. After graduating from Bement High  School, he went on to attend Southern Illinois University at Carbondale  and earned his MBA from Eastern Illinois University.   He spent over two decades working in the banking industry before  accepting the role of president and CEO of Farm Credit Illinois in  2015. In this position, he led an organization of 220 full-time  employees and a multibillion-dollar loan portfolio for its farm owners.   Those who worked closely with him described Tom as an extraordinary  executive with a kind and charitable heart.   Outside of work, Tom showed he grew up in Bement and learned how to  actually get involved in his community to make it better. Tom gave  generously to Parkland College. He gave generously to local charities,  and he served on the board for Kirby Medical Center's Kirby Foundation  in Monticello. Tom lived his entire life in humble service to his  friends, to his neighbors, and to his family.   He was a kind young man. Tom's life was full of promise. He is truly  going to be missed.   Shannon and I are deeply saddened by his passing, and our prayers are  with all those who knew Tom, all those who worked with Tom, but  especially  [[Page H8392]]  his wife, Erin, and his children, Alex and Maggie.   Rest in peace, my friend.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I appreciate the  opportunity to come to this great institution to talk about this piece  of legislation. I thank the ranking member and also my colleague from  Florida (Mr. Hastings) for a great spirited debate last night in the  Rules Committee, but I still, today, have to rise in opposition to the  rule for consideration of H.R. 4617.   Last night at the Rules Committee meeting, there was bipartisan  consensus that this bill has not gone through regular order. We did not  have the opportunity to hold a single hearing addressing foreign  political propaganda in the Committee on House Administration.   We are focusing on paid political advertisements, when the Senate  Intel's bipartisan report stated that ``paid advertisements were not  key'' to Russia's activity. Out of the $1.4 billion spent on political  advertisements in the 2016 election cycle on digital advertising, the  Russians spent $100,000 of that over 2 years on paid political Facebook  ads.    This is relevant information. This should have been considered and  discussed in a committee hearing before sidestepping process and  rushing a bill to the floor that does not address key issues.   None of us had a chance to ask Facebook: ``Why did you take a payment  from Russia?''   ``Was it in rubles?''   ``Was it in dollars?''   ``Why in the world did you take $100,000 from Russia and put overtly  political ads online?''   At some point, companies that participate in the political process,  we need to have them in front of us to ask them why; ask them how. But  we didn't get a chance to do that because the Committee on House  Administration had zero hearings before rushing this bill to the floor.   We have a process here in the House for a reason, Madam Speaker. The  process is set up to make sure what gets to the floor will address the  problem at hand and will not harm the rights of the American people.  Instead, the language in this bill is so broad that it does little to  stop foreign political propaganda and, instead, creates a chilling  effect on America's free speech.   If the House had held hearings on this legislation, then we could  have appropriately tailored language to address the real problem of  foreign interference without affecting free speech.   In 2016, the Russians tampered in our elections and engaged in  stunning misinformation campaigns in an effort to undermine our  elections.                                time  1245    Much of what the Russians did was already illegal. If we want to stop  this from happening in the future, then we should be strengthening  existing laws and making sure law enforcement has the resources it  needs to track down foreign nationals that are breaking the law by  spreading propaganda.   Instead, this bill provides zero resources to help law enforcement  enforce existing laws and, rather, imposes new regulations that will  harm Americans' right to free speech.   The sweeping language in this bill will very likely silence the  voices of honest American organizations and nonpolitical companies that  wish to speak out on ``issues of national importance.''    SHIELD's burdensome regulations will  make it more difficult for Americans to be heard. Isn't that the goal  of the Russians, to shut down our free and open society and silence the  voices of Americans?   Madam Speaker, we should support our law enforcement to do their  jobs, not make up new regulations that chill free speech.   This bill is a misinformation stunt to the American people. It sends  a message to America that something is being done to stop what happened  in 2016 when, in reality, it fails to address the actual threat. It is  a Trojan horse from the majority.   Do we actually want to stop foreign interference, or do my colleagues  simply want talking points?   Madam Speaker, you have a bill before you that will not stop  meddling. I urge a ``no'' vote.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from Florida for reminding everybody here that I was offered a chance  by my good friend Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat from Colorado, to actually  ask Facebook, ask Mark Zuckerberg, a question of why they took that  payment.   The answer, Mr. Hastings, is yes. I went over to the Financial  Services Committee. I specifically spoke with Mr. Perlmutter in the  committee hearing room, where he told me that Chairwoman Waters would  allow Members who were not on the committee, like me, to ask questions,  but I probably have to come back in about 5 hours.   I am hoping to do that. I am hoping to go back there later this  afternoon and ask that question.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I said many times since becoming the ranking member of  the Committee on House Administration, the committee with leading  jurisdiction over election legislation in the House, that the greatest  threat to our Nation's election system is partisanship.   Why is partisanship the greatest threat?   Because when you have one side drafting partisan legislation to  further their own political agenda, it causes inaction. When it comes  to securing our Nation's elections, we cannot afford inaction. That is  why it is imperative that our colleagues across the aisle work with us  to find a bipartisan solution to preventing foreign interference in  elections.   Unfortunately, that is not the route that the majority party chose to  take this Congress. We saw this pattern first begin with the majority's  H.R. 1. Over 700 pages of political initiatives to help them Federalize  elections, then again, for the SAVE Act, a partisan election security  bill, again attempting to Federalize elections and take power away from  States. Both bills were drafted without bipartisan input and rushed  through the House.   Back then, I told my colleagues if they were serious about reforming  elections and making them more secure, we needed to work together. But  here we are again with another partisan election bill that has no  chance--zero chance--of becoming law. This time it is the SHIELD Act, a  bill aimed at preventing foreign interference in our elections, like  what we saw with Russia's misinformation campaign through social media  in the 2016 Presidential election.    Look, it is safe to say that no one on either side of the aisle wants  foreign meddling in our elections. Let me repeat that: I don't believe  a single Republican or Democrat in this House wants foreign meddling in  our elections.   And I want to be clear that there is bipartisan agreement on some of  the intended goals of SHIELD. We should have increased transparency and  political digital advertising, and we should close the loopholes that  allow for foreign nationals to meddle in our elections.   But this bill isn't a serious attempt to address the type of  interference that we saw in 2016, Mr. Chairman. It is jammed full of  poison pills that the Democrats knew would make SHIELD a nonstarter.  The SHIELD Act contains provisions that would Federalize elections,  which as I have already pointed out, is the favorite solution of our  majority for any issue.   This bill expands the powers of the Department of Justice to allow  the Attorney General to insert himself or herself into individual races  at the Federal, State, and local level. That is a complete Federal  overreach of States' constitutional rights to maintain their own  elections.   Think about it: The AG can come in to your race, every State and  local race if they--he or she--wants to ``correct the record.'' There  are also provisions of this bill that I believe are unconstitutional  and will have a chilling effect on our freedom of speech. For instance,  we should not be proposing broad, vague regulations for disclosing  online political ads that create unworkable standards for the American  public.   Out of the $1.4 billion spent on political digital ads in 2016,  Russia spent $100,000 over 2 years on Facebook ads. The majority of  those were not even election ads, so it wouldn't have even been  regulated by the Honest Ads Act.   Why would we then overreach and threaten American's free speech with  this bill when it doesn't even address  [[Page H8412]]  what Russia did? We need serious election security legislation that  will protect Americans' First Amendment rights. That is why I  introduced the Honest Elections Act, which, if passed, would actually  address the type of foreign meddling we saw in 2016 and highlighted in  the Senate intel report.                                time  1445    The Honest Elections Act would strengthen existing laws, such as the  Foreign Agents Registration Act, FARA; the Federal Election Campaign  Act; and the Help America Vote Act. And it would modernize online  political ad disclosure without infringing on free speech or requiring  unworkable standards for Americans.   Our bill also increases monitoring of spending by foreign nationals  in elections and addresses domestic interference in our elections,  something the SHIELD Act fails to accomplish.   We may never be able to prevent criminal activity, whether that is in  our elections or in our day-to-day lives, but we can provide our law  enforcement with the best tools and resources available.   The Honest Elections Act is simply a better solution to preventing  foreign interference in our elections than the SHIELD Act and its  unintended consequences on Americans.   Again, I will say the greatest threat to our Nation's election system  is partisanship because it is the partisanship we are seeing from the  majority today that is keeping the American people from having  bipartisan legislation right now that will prevent any potential  foreign interference in our elections.   I keep hearing my Democratic colleagues talk about urgency, but this  is the third time we have been here with a partisan election bill in  the House that has yet to become law or make any real change  whatsoever. If Democrats are serious about this urgency in protecting  our Nation's elections in the 2020 cycle, prove it. Stop with the  political games. Come back to the table and work with us on something  that actually stands a chance at becoming law and protecting our  Nation's elections.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), my good friend and a very  well-respected member of the House Administration Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy), my good and new friend, our  newest Member of this institution.    Mr. Chair, before I yield to my good  friend from California, I do want to respond.   My great friend and colleague from the great State of Maryland  mentioned that Republicans said that this bill is unconstitutional.  Well, it wasn't just us.   Americans for Prosperity says this bill is unconstitutional. Heritage  Action says the bill is unconstitutional. Even the ACLU said this bill  is unconstitutional.   It is not every day, Mr. Chair, that you get those three  organizations together on the same issue, but it is here. The  unconstitutionality of this bill is from them and their remarks, adding  to what we are saying here and debating on the floor.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McClintock), my good friend.    Mr. Chair, there are too many comments  I would like to make, so I will reserve them until we have a few less  speakers. I am sure we will have a chance to debate some of the issues  that my good friend and colleague from Maryland brought up.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from the  great State of Virginia (Mr. Griffith).    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman from  Virginia an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   I have some folks who are on their way here to offer some more  remarks, so, while we are waiting, I will offer my remarks on some of  the comments that were made by my colleagues.   One of my colleagues talked about bipartisanship, that this is a  bipartisan bill. It is not a bipartisan bill.   Mr. Chairman, the majority party clearly had an opportunity to put  through our committee and onto the floor a bill that had Republican and  Democrat cosponsors. Instead of doing that, they chose to follow the  exact same path that they followed in the past through other committees  and other pieces of legislation: They don't want to put real solutions  forward; they want to put political talking points forward.   They decided to combine what my colleague from Virginia just talked  about, allowing an Attorney General to participate, possibly, in  Federal campaigns. That should scare every American, regardless of  whether you are Republican or Democrat. Let's keep our elections run in  the most safe and effective way possible: at the State and local level.   So it is not bipartisan. This bill is not bipartisan. There are 187  cosponsors of the SHIELD Act, and not a single Republican.   And that is a ploy? That is how we run away from bipartisanship? No,  bipartisanship was taken away from us.   Now, how do you get bipartisanship? Well, you have hearings.   Not a single hearing was held in the House Administration Committee  where we could ask questions to the social media platforms that are  going to be affected by this piece of legislation if it becomes law. I  certainly would have loved to have asked Mark Zuckerberg.   I tried to go over, today, to the Committee on Financial Services to  ask Mr. Zuckerberg why in the world did Facebook or anybody at Facebook  take a payment from Russia for overtly political ads. They took  $100,000 in payment out of $1.4 billion in digital ads that were bought  during the 2016 cycle. That check was cashed.   I don't know if they wrote a check; I don't know if they paid cash; I  don't know if they paid rubles; but we ought to be able to get to the  bottom of it.   I didn't even have a chance to ask before this bill was rushed to the  floor. Too many questions.                                time  1515    If you want bipartisanship, you have got to earn bipartisanship by  allowing us to have a seat at the table.   Now, it is not too hard to have discussions. It is not too hard to  sit down and work out bipartisan solutions. There are only nine members  of the House Administration Committee. We didn't have a chance to do  that, to sit down and talk about our priorities. It was great H.R. 1  was brought up. That is the bill that was written in secret by special  interests before we were all even sworn in. H.R. 1 had every single  Member of the majority party signed on as a cosponsor before they even  had a chance to read it. It wasn't even introduced yet.   And let's talk about what H.R. 1 did, what my colleague called strike  one. H.R. 1. Every single Member of this institution who voted for that  bill voted to put either your taxpayer dollars or corporate money for  the first time ever in our Nation's history into their own political  campaign coffers. That is not a strike to vote against that bill. That  is a freaking home run. That is terrible. Nobody thinks getting more  money out of politics would be solved by those provisions.   The SAFE Act, well, when the majority decided to write their bill  after we had one hearing, they didn't even listen to their own witness  about the efficacy of certain types of voting machines and the safety  capabilities. They didn't listen to their own witness. They still tried  to create a process that would have made safe election machines with a  voter verified paper backup mechanism which would have made them  essentially illegal after the year 2021 or 2022.  [[Page H8416]]    We know counties upon counties and election authorities in this  Nation that have purchased these machines that their own witness said  was safe, but that would be a waste of their own taxpayer dollars now  because somebody in Washington that didn't consult with us, didn't  allow us a chance to work in a bipartisan way, they would have wasted  hundreds of thousands of dollars on voting machines.   My local Democratic election official in my home county of Christian  County, Illinois, they worked with their local Republican county board  to purchase almost $300,000 in election machines that if the SAFE Act  was signed into law, that expense would have lit 300 grand up with a  match. That is wrong. Let's talk to our local election officials. I do.  That is certainly not strike two. I think that is another home run,  too.   Now the SHIELD Act. Again, I said it is not bipartisan. 137  cosponsors, all Democrats. We want to talk about bipartisanship, Mr.  Chair, we can talk all we want. I want to see some action. I haven't  seen some action. We talked in the Rules Committee last night about no  hearings, no ability to question witnesses. We can come together.  Nobody, and I mean nobody, in this institution, no one wants foreign  interference. You want a bipartisan bill? Our next colleague who is  going to talk was a cosponsor of a bipartisan bill that could have come  to the floor, but we weren't given the chance.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will tell you, my  colleague from the great State of Washington, you can't get much more  bipartisan than Mr. Kilmer. I certainly wish we would have been able to  have the bill on the floor that my colleague spoke about that had an  even number of Republican and Democratic cosponsors, but unfortunately,  we don't have the opportunity to do that, Mr. Chairman.   Unfortunately, we are watching poison pills like the one that my  colleague from Virginia spoke about where an attorney general can come  in and decide to correct the record on Federal elections. I think that  is scary for any American. That is not a solution.   I do believe that we will see this bill passed. I am not proud that  this bill is going to pass, because this bill is not going to be signed  into law.   And I know my good friend and colleague, the chairperson of the House  Administration Committee, have discussed a couple of times about  Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh. I think her and I agree with Justice  Kavanaugh, that foreign bad actors, they don't have freedom of speech  protections in the United States of America. But the sad fact, Mr.  Chairman, is that if this bill were to pass into law, it would do  nothing to affect the bad actors who interfered in our 2016 elections.  Nothing.   Our bill, the Honest Elections Act would. We will positively affect  those bad actors, and we will make sure they are held accountable.   If this bill passes, I believe the majority party would give more  free speech protections to those foreign bad actors.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  California (Mr. Calvert), my good friend.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for their comments today.   Look, there is a lot of activity and the opportunity to come to this  floor and debate very important issues, and there are no more important  issues than protecting the validity and safety of our election system  here in this institution in the great United States of America.   You know what? We heard a lot about this process not being  bipartisan, Mr. Chairman. Well, let's talk about what we have done in a  bipartisan manner to protect our elections.   When Republicans were in charge of this institution, we worked in a  bipartisan fashion to actually appropriate over $300 million to go to  our States, to work with our local officials, to partner with the  Department of Homeland Security to ensure that our election  infrastructure is safer than it was in 2016.   We all learned the lessons of 2016, and we worked together to put  solutions on the table.   That is exactly what we should be doing here. But on the SHIELD Act,  unfortunately, the Democratic majority did not allow us a seat at the  table.   You know, you go to my home State of Illinois, where they have been  raving about their partnership with this administration's Department of  Homeland Security, and look at the 2018 election cycle. We had record  turnout in a midterm election, and not one instance of foreign  interference has been brought forth, So it looks like we have done  something good together in a bipartisan fashion in the past.   I certainly hope, Mr. Chair, we could do that in the future.   Many of the provisions that my colleagues talked about and that I  spoke about are just simply too egregious for us to support. We want to  support a bill that has proper hearings, goes through regular order,  and provides an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to work  together, just like we did to protect America's election systems for  the 2018 election cycle.   I want to see results, Mr. Chair. I am not seeing results with the  SHIELD Act.   Let's come together. Let's take another swing, take another crack at  the bat. Let's hit another home run together. Because according to my  count right now, that bipartisan investment of $300-plus million that  we worked together on, that is a grand slam. Let's start working on  some more grand slams together.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the core function of the  Federal Election Commission is to be the independent regulatory agency  charged with administering and enforcing Federal campaign finance law.  The FEC has jurisdiction over the financing of campaigns for the U.S.  House, the Senate, the Presidency, and the Vice Presidency.   We do think States should be notified of disinformation by foreign  actors. The FEC is not equipped to investigate, much less make a final  determination, that foreign nationals have meddled in an election. This  is better left to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.   In one way that they are not equipped is that FEC commissioners do  not have the authority to obtain clearances to access certain  classified information, which would make it impossible for any  commissioner or the FEC to make such a notification to States, not to  mention the fact that the FEC chair is too busy attacking the President  to spend time on additional notification requirements.   It is also worth noting that the majority of the committee's position  has been that the FEC is dysfunctional, even to the point that they  voted to make it a five-member partisan commission in H.R. 1.   The Department of Justice, FBI, DHS, and other national security  agencies are better suited to address the problem of foreign meddling  in our elections, which is exactly what we allow them to do in the  Honest Elections Act--my bill--that I would certainly hope some on the  other side of the aisle would cosponsor.  [[Page H8425]]    Mr. Chairman, for these reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague  from California offering an amendment and participating in this  process. It is not every time that we have disagreements on not only  legislation, but amendments like this.   I believe that this amendment needs to be clarified before it should  be put into law. And just as with the SHIELD Act, I believe it should  go back to the drawing board and we ought to be able to have more  hearings to find out the effect on free speech in the United States of  America, but also give us a chance in a bipartisan way to question the  social media platforms that we want to work with us to protect this  Nation from foreign meddling.   For the reasons I mentioned above and for the reasons that I stated  just now, I am going to urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend  from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko) for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a very well-intended amendment. I  agree with my colleague from California that it is a very well-intended  amendment that is going to actually correct, I believe, what would be  an unintended consequence if this bill were to ever become law.                                time  1600    This section that is being amended today provides unprecedented power  to the Attorney General to intercede in Federal races when he or she  believes State and local officials have not taken  [[Page H8426]]  ``adequate steps'' to correct ``misinformation.''   Madam Chair, the Attorney General is a partisan official. They are  not a nonpartisan official. Imagine if Attorney General Barr was given  broad authority to take ``adequate steps.'' This is the language in the  bill.   These are the facts, Madam Chair. If Attorney General Barr was given  broad authority to take adequate steps in correcting the record in any  Democratic districts, imagine that. Imagine the uproar. There would be  a public uproar. The same could be said for a Democratic Attorney  General.   The section not only gives broad authority to the AG, but it is  extremely vague and will also leave State and local election officials  struggling to comply with this section.   To make matters worse, we have not heard from a single State or local  election official about how this might impact their ability to conduct  elections. This is the reason why we have hearings. This is the reason  why we call people into Congress to listen to them about the impact of  legislation that we are debating in this House.   And we did not have a single hearing before this bill was rushed to  the floor. This is not regular order. This is not what the Democratic  majority promised when they were given the majority by the American  people to run this institution. This is a broken promise that they made  to the American people, and I think we need to pass this amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to  the amendment, although I am not necessarily opposed it.    Madam Chair, this is a problem.  Misinformation, false representation, digitally manipulated images,  that is a problem.   What we do in this institution, and the political nature of our jobs,  I think we have all been victims of videos that try to provide false  information. This has to be addressed.   I believe we need to have some hearings on this issue because it is  pretty complicated. And we haven't had a single hearing with any of the  platforms, where many of these videos would be published, before this  bill was rushed to the floor.   I agree with my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) that  deepfakes present a unique challenge for Congress to address. I would  hate to see a potential solution that is being offered by my good  friend put on a partisan bill.   An additional problem I see is that I am not aware of any technology  that can identify which images or video are deepfakes. Perhaps the  Committee on Science, Space, and Technology should hold a hearing on  this issue as well.   In dealing with this issue, Congress needs to appropriately weigh the  First Amendment protections afforded to public speech with the  dangerous potential of deepfakes to add further damage to our already  polarized climate.   This amendment, like many of these amendments, would be better served  to pass through regular order and give the American public a chance to  learn about these very important and, at times, recent and troubling  issues.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed to this amendment.    Madam Chair, I support this amendment.   I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. Levin, Ranking Member McCaul, Mr.  Rouda, Ms. Speier, and Ms. Slotkin, for offering this very thoughtful  amendment. I would like to note that, even though the issue of using  shell corporations to make contributions is covered under the existing  straw donor prohibition, I do believe more clarity is needed on this  issue.   Madam Chair, I want to thank my colleagues. I am prepared to close,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank, again, my good  friend from the great State of Michigan for offering this amendment.   The only thing that I wish could have happened is I wish we could  have had some hearings on this bill so that we could have brought  experts in on shell corporations that are making straw donor donations  to Federal campaigns that are already prohibited so we could find out  the best way to ensure that doesn't happen in the future, especially  from nefarious foreign actors.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to this amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I thank my colleague, Mr. Langevin, for offering this  amendment. As good a friend as he is, it somewhat pains me to have to  stand up and be opposed to it.   Again, the FEC, the Federal Election Commission, is the independent  regulatory agency charged with administering and enforcing the Federal  campaign finance law. They have jurisdiction over the financing of  campaigns for us here in the House, our colleagues in the Senate, the  President, and the Vice President. They are not the fake news police,  much to the chagrin of the current FEC Chair.   This amendment requires an independent report from the FEC, and I am  not convinced that the FEC Chair is capable of issuing any independent  report, any independent guidance, or any independent legal  interpretations; and, frankly, I don't think she is capable of offering  any independent tweets.   I think it is worth noting that every single House Democrat voted to  make the FEC a partisan agency earlier this Congress in H.R. 1 and has  lamented how dysfunctional they believe the FEC is. If the FEC were a  partisan agency, would we want them determining which news was fake  news and which news was legitimate?   I agree we need to understand and improve media literacy with respect  to political content in this country, but the FEC is not the entity to  lead that endeavor.   Let's take a look at the danger of overregulating online ads and  misinterpreting political content. The ad I have behind me and the ones  behind it are already being labeled as political ads on Facebook. These  came straight from the Facebook ad library.   First off, we have my favorite. As the proud dad of two Yorkies at  home in Taylorville, Illinois, this political ad for hotdogcollars.com  would allow me to get my two Yorkies some new dog collars. I don't  know--except maybe the American flag dog collar--how political that is.   Next up is the very political ad Facebook is now categorizing under  current law and under their current regulations as a political ad-- Pizza Crave. Hey, it is Halloween season, it is almost upon us, $10  pizza pies. I don't know why that is categorized as political, but it  is.   Do we really want the FEC to figure out that they are the agency to  correct that? No. Facebook ought to correct it.    Lastly, Stone Bridge Pizza & Salad: We always crave the classic-- obviously a political ad. I don't know anybody who would eat pizza like  that, but clearly this is not a political ad.   I think we need to take a step back. We need to realize that the  current FEC that is dysfunctional is the last place for independent  review of anything. We need to make sure that the FEC does its job in a  nonpartisan way.   Madam Chair, we need to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I appreciate the comments from my good friend from  Michigan. I, too, am in a swing district. We don't want misinformation.   To address comments made by my good friend from Rhode Island, I  understand that what the gentleman is asking for is an independent  report. I don't believe the FEC can offer an independent assessment of  anything right now.   Madam Chair, you have an FEC that is completely dysfunctional. You  have a Chair of the FEC who is doing nothing but taking partisan shots  at our  [[Page H8430]]  President. That is not what the FEC should be.   The FEC is incapable of offering any independent review of anything.  That is my concern. That is why I believe if we could work together and  come up with a more viable solution to get a true independent study, I  think we could do that.   Madam Chair, I am ready to close, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, to clarify, I don't think  the FEC is capable of actually commissioning an independent study. I  would be happy to work with the gentleman from Rhode Island to find  another agency that we believe could offer a fair assessment.   Madam Chair, I will urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment for those  reasons, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to  this amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment amends the  underlying duty to report section.   The goal of this underlying section is something I share with my  friend across the aisle. If a foreign national would approach me with  an offer of assistance in my campaign, I would absolutely alert the  FBI.   My colleague from California mentions an instance with the  President's son. I mean, clearly, I know that he and my Democratic  colleagues, they look at this, this is not about what is going to  happen to many of the colleagues here, because, likely, we are never  going to be approached by a foreign national. But if we are, I think we  all agree, it is a pretty bipartisan consensus, we would call the FBI.   This is a partisan attack on the President. But rarely are instances  as blatant as what I mentioned before about being contacted and I would  call the FBI. What this underlying section is asking of political  committees is for them to serve as immigration officials, where they  will be in a position to determine the citizenship of anyone that their  campaign comes into contact with.   But, again, I believe through bipartisan negotiations, we could make  this work. The underlying duty to report section was already vague to  begin with, and adding in additional parties, as this amendment does,  that must comply only adds to our concern that we are setting up  campaign committees, as well as their families, we are setting them up  for failure.  [[Page H8431]]    It is also worth noting that this amendment would affect family  members the candidate has no control over. My family members own fast  food restaurants. So are they going to have to ask--if this becomes  law--every customer if they are a foreign national representing a  foreign government?   Do they have a duty to report?   That is something that needs to be clarified.   We have to do a little bit more work. I think we can work this out,  but again, the secretive nature of how this bill was written and forced  onto the floor with zero hearings doesn't give us a chance, or frankly,  the majority a chance to ask these questions and address our concerns.   Madam Chair, I would urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of  my time.     Madam Chair, I agree with my colleague  from California. We will be judged on how we actually impact foreign  interference in our elections. We will be judged on the chilling effect  to free speech that this legislation, if put into law, would have on  our system that is so much different from those nefarious countries and  leaders who want to meddle in our election process.   But my point earlier still stands. I agree that somebody who would  fall under FARA, the Foreign Agent Registration Act, would be the ones  that we would have a duty to report, if they came to our campaign. But  at the same time, how do we know? Are they going to wear a badge that  says, Hey, I am a FARA-registered individual from another country, and  I am coming to talk to you since you are a Member of Congress in a  political campaign?   I mean, am I going to have my kids who are in college, am I going to  have to have them ask everyone they come into contact with, ``Are you  registered under the Foreign Agent Registration Act in Washington,  D.C., because I have a duty to report.''   How are we going to know? That is why we have to take a step back. We  have to sit down. We have to work this together. There are too many  unintended consequences that, yes, Madam Chair, we will be judged by in  this country. We will be judged by the freedoms and the freedom of  speech that many in this country take for granted, that we should stand  together, Republicans and Democrats, to protect, or we will be judged  by bad legislation that could be turned into law that could have a  chilling effect on these freedoms, on these liberties that our  adversaries that meddle in our elections want to use to take them away  from every single American.   Vote ``no'' on this amendment. Vote to protect free speech and vote  to take a step back to clarify how we work to ensure that no foreign  entity can interfere with our elections again.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to  this amendment.    Madam Chair, the provision this section  seeks to amend has problems in and of itself. I object to this  amendment because I object to the underlying premise of the bill. It is  unreasonable to require candidates to vet every foreign national they  come into contact with.   I understand that this bill requires that candidates know or have  reason to know that foreign nationals are covered. My question is:  Would not any government employee, such as those that work at an  embassy, be covered under this bill? Wouldn't a conversation with a  traffic officer or embassy clerk be subject to penalties under this  section?   I absolutely believe that campaigns should have to report offers of  assistance from foreign nationals. The issue with this bill and, thus,  this amendment, is that it is overbroad and puts the responsibility on  campaigns. Campaigns are ill-prepared to interpret this language.   I am also concerned that requiring the FBI to not only notify  Congress, but detail how they are managing and responding to  notifications from political committees will inevitably lead to  selective leaks and will politicize the well-intended goal of  preventing foreign influence.   Madam Chair, for those reasons, I oppose this bill. And since my  colleague yielded back, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chair, I, too, like my colleague  from New York, represent a district with a very large rural population.  I want to see rural turnout as high as possible.   But the mission of the FEC is to administer and enforce Federal  campaign finance law. I mean, if this becomes law, along with some of  the other previous amendments and amendments after this, I don't know  when the FEC is going to have any time to actually enforce campaign  finance violations that are happening right now. The FEC is not  equipped to receive all these mandates from Congress.   This is an extremely important job, a job some on the Commission,  including the Chair, are ignoring by spending all their time attacking  the President. I think we need to let the FEC focus on their day job.   There are many groups, within and outside government, that could  produce a report on misinformation, such as the U.S. Commission on  Civil Rights, maybe even the Brennan Center. Let's let them do it.   Help us help the FEC to be able to do the job that we have required  it to do.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I look forward to working  with my colleague from New York to address many issues regarding rural  America. I would love to be able to sit down and find a workable  solution.  [[Page H8433]]    The problem is, the solution that is being offered in this amendment  is going to be tacked on to a bill that is never going to become law.  So we are either going to talk about amendments that are going to  remain talking points or we can sit down together and work in a  bipartisan fashion to get a law passed that is going to have the impact  that my colleague from New York and I want it to have.   Let's sit down, without having to write the rules that the FEC would  have to follow. Let's work together and send a letter to the U.S.  Commission on Civil Rights. Let's send a letter to the Brennan Center  and see if they can study it.   Why do we have to wait so long? This is a much easier way to address  the problem that I think he and I agree ought to be addressed. Let's do  that.   When this bill passes on a partisan rollcall today and goes nowhere  when it moves into the Senate, let's commit to working together to see  what we can do to get this done because rural America is too important  to be affected by partisanship here in Washington, D.C.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, again, I agree with my  colleague. This place becomes overly partisan. This entire process,  this bill, with zero hearings in the House Administration Committee  before it was forced to markup through our committee, without us to  have a chance to ask experts what they can and cannot do to address  many of the problems that my colleague from New York actually offers  solutions for, that is the problem of partisanship.   We can't just blame the Senate. I was told by many of my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle when we were in the majority, ``So what  if the Senate is not going to pass it? We ought to work together in the  House.'' I agreed then, and I agree now. We ought to find solutions.   Unfortunately, partisanship has overtaken this process. The  unfortunate result of that is that good ideas like the one my colleague  has are going to stop in their tracks when this amendment passes on a  partisan rollcall vote for this amendment, and then it is not going to  be signed into law.   Again, I can't wait to work with my colleague on finding a way to get  this information into the right hands and have those who can study it  without having to go through a dysfunctional Federal Election  Commission and also have them study why we had historic turnout not  just in urban America but in rural America during the 2018 midterms.  Let's talk about what we have done right to make sure that voters have  a chance to get to the polls at historic turnout numbers like we saw  during the 2018 election cycle, which allowed many of my colleagues to  get elected to this institution.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. I look forward  to working with my colleague in the future to address the problem of  access and voter access in rural America, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition,  although I am not opposed to this amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank my good friend  from the great State of Pennsylvania for offering this amendment.   However, I would like to add, this is an incredibly wonky amendment  to an already complicated, convoluted, and confusing bill. I don't  think you should have to be a high-powered campaign finance attorney to  understand what is at stake in terms of election security.   The issue of foreign nationals meddling in elections can be resolved  more simply by passing my bill, the Honest Elections Act. My bill does  not have to empower the FEC, an already--I have said, and I hope my  colleagues agree--pretty dysfunctional agency.   If they didn't believe it was dysfunctional, they wouldn't have  voted, in H.R. 1, to make it a partisan agency. If they think it is  great now, why did they try to make it into an even more partisan  agency?   So, I think we all agree it is dysfunctional. We may have different  reasons why.   But my bill doesn't empower a dysfunctional FEC to address the  problem of foreign nationals meddling in our elections. My bill  empowers the Department of Justice, which has jurisdiction over  enforcing the Foreign Agents Registration Act. That is a better option.   Clearly, I am not going to get an option because this bill was  brought to the floor without any hearings, without any opportunity for  us to have input, and that is a problem. That is a problem with  legislating in this institution.   That is a broken promise that this Democratic majority made to the  voters who sent them here and put them in the majority. They said they  were going to do things differently, right? I heard from my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle, in my terms before this one, how things  were ramrodded through, how regular order wasn't followed, how they  weren't given a chance to sit down and come up with solutions. Well, I  find it ironic that the success story we have of the Republican  majority in the 115th Congress of investing $380 million in election  security funds, where we saw historic turnout in the 2018 midterms--we  saw historic turnout, and we saw success.   That is what a Republican majority gave. The Democrat majority, they  have given us hearings--well, wait, no. No hearings before this bill  was put to the floor, that is a problem.   I really want to say thank you to my colleague from Pennsylvania for  offering this amendment. It is a commonsense amendment. But, again, the  FEC is not the place. I am not going to be opposed to this amendment.  The DOJ is the place.   Madam Chair, I am going to make sure I reserve my time. If I had a  challenge flag, I thought my colleague last time yielded back, but I  believe the judgment from the referees up there was that he did not  yield back. Maybe we could check the replay a little later, so I will  go ahead and reserve this time.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition,  although I am supportive of this amendment.    Madam Chair, I just want to say to my  colleague from the great State of Michigan, thank you.   Finally--finally--we have a study that is not too wonky, a perfect  amount of wonkiness, that is going to go through an agency that is  going to give us an unbiased review: the GAO.   Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Pass this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to  this amendment.    Madam Chair, I appreciate my new  colleague from New Jersey offering this amendment and participating in  this process. I look to work with her and many of my colleagues when  the majority party finally comes to the table and wants to put a  bipartisan solution together.   Everyone here is against deceptive practices. This includes providing  false information about the time or place of voting and qualifications  for voting.   But the underlying section here presents numerous questions because  of its vagueness. Some of the situations this would apply to seem  pretty ridiculous.   Do you want to know how ridiculous this section of the SHIELD Act is?  Let's talk about public endorsements.   Recently, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said about  current Presidential candidate, our colleague, Congresswoman Tulsi  Gabbard:         I think the Russians have got their eye on somebody and are       grooming her to be a third-party candidate. She's a favorite       of the Russians.    So Secretary Clinton is suggesting the Russians endorse Congresswoman  Gabbard. Is that not a false endorsement? Would Hillary Clinton not be  subject to 5 years in prison according this section if this bill were  passed?   Let the Record show, nobody is chanting ``Lock her up.''   This is another ridiculous section of the bill. It is not surprising,  given the warp speed with which this bill is being rushed to the floor.   I have to commend my colleague from New Jersey because this amendment  is right about the amount of wonkiness that we need in amendments and  pieces of legislation.   But I will stand here and say, as a Member of this institution, that  we can never get so wonky with our jobs and our writing of bills that  it has a chilling effect on the First Amendment  [[Page H8436]]  rights to free speech that every American in this country deserves.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition,  although I am not necessarily opposed.    Madam Chair, I have had the opportunity  to travel the country with my friend and colleague Congresswoman Marcia  Fudge on the subject of the Voting Rights Act.   We have heard testimony that minority turnout across the board was  higher than ever: Hispanic and Asian communities jumped 13 points above  the turnout levels in 2014 when compared to the 2018 election cycle;  this last midterm, in 2018, African American turnout jumped 11 points.   I hope this trend continues, and I hope we see increased minority  turnout in our upcoming elections.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Madam Chair, as much as I would like to  have some fun with my good friend and colleague from South Carolina and  oppose this amendment and have great debate back and forth, it is a  pretty darn good amendment.   I think we need to do everything we can in a bipartisan way to make  sure that our Nation's heroes have the right to vote not only here at  home, but abroad.   I look forward to working with you--after this bill that will pass  today on a partisan roll call but will go nowhere--to make sure that  our Nation's heroes are not adversely affected by any propaganda or any  attempts to stop them from exercising that right.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to  this amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank my colleague from  Virginia for offering this amendment, but this amendment shares the  same flaw as the main text of the bill, putting media platforms in  charge of enforcing our Nation's laws.   They are not doing a good job right now. I don't know if Mr.  Zuckerberg is still across the street testifying in front of the  Financial Services Committee, but if they were doing a good job, he  wouldn't have been here so long.   Rather, we need to strengthen FARA and help the Department of Justice  do  [[Page H8438]]  its job. I do not understand why the Democrats want the social media  companies to have more responsibilities when they failed miserably in  2016.   I strongly urge a ``no'' vote. I also urge every Member, both  Republicans and Democrats, to take a look at my bill. It is a  nonpartisan bill.   I don't want to empower the media platforms or restrict speech by  American citizens. I want to give the DOJ the resources to do its job   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time    Madam Chair, I appreciate the  gentlewoman's willingness to want to help fix a bill where the  underlying bill is one that we never had a chance to have an open  debate about, never had a chance to have hearings about.   When it doesn't pass, I look forward to working with my colleagues.  When it doesn't pass into law--it will pass here on a partisan roll  call--when it doesn't pass into law, I look forward to working with my  colleagues.   But I do have a bill that would address this situation. FARA, let's  work together to let the DOJ have the resources and the ability to do  their job. The SHIELD Act is not allowing that to happen. The Honest  Elections Act, my bill, will allow that to happen. I would urge  everybody to take a look at that.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.    I am in its current form.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  motion to recommit, a proposal that would actually assist law  enforcement in pursuing those individuals who seek to disrupt our  elections, as opposed to the partisan bill we have been debating here  today.   I first want to address some of the accusations made here today about  how my colleagues and I on this side of the aisle do not care about  election security or how we are the only thing standing in the way of  securing elections. This is simply not true.   In the 115th Congress, a Republican-controlled Congress appropriated  over $400 million to the States and to DHS prior to the 2018 midterms  to bolster election security, allowing for unprecedented cooperation  between DHS and all 50 States and 1,400 localities. Earlier this year,  $33 million was appropriated to DHS to continue these assistance  efforts.   I also introduced a bill during the debate of the SAFE Act that will  provide even more funding for DHS to combat nefarious activity. But  last week, I introduced, along with many of my colleagues, the Honest  Elections Act, which the entire basis for this motion to recommit is  based upon. So don't tell me that we on this side of the aisle are  standing in the way.   According to the report recently released by the Senate Intelligence  Committee, out of the $1.4 billion spent on digital political ads in  the 2016 election cycle, Russia spent $100,000 over 2 years on Facebook  ads. The majority of those were not election ads, so they wouldn't  necessarily be regulated by the Honest Ads Act portion of SHIELD and  will not address the real threat that we saw in 2016.   My motion today strengthens and reforms the Foreign Agents  Registration Act, FARA, to combat election interference. It modernizes  online political ad disclosure. It increases monitoring of spending by  foreign nationals in elections. It incentivizes States to prohibit the  practice of ballot harvesting and encourages States to stop this recent  trend of noncitizen voting.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this motion to  recommit because I was given some advice by our colleague from Idaho  (Mr. Simpson) before I came up here. He said: ``The more you talk, the  fewer votes this MTR will get.''   So, let's make sure everyone goes back to their districts. But first,  vote for this motion to recommit. Vote to protect our elections from  interference from foreign countries like Russia, China, and all others.  Vote to hunt down those who are attempting to interfere in our  elections. And vote, finally, to restore the American people's trust in  our institutions.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this motion to recommit, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded  vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded  vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
