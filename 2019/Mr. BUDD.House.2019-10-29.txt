 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my Democratic colleagues  across the aisle to end their partisan impeachment inquiry and instead  focus on an issue that will actually improve the lives of our  constituents and supercharge the already roaring American economy; that  is, bringing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, to  this floor for a vote.   Mr. Speaker, ratifying this landmark trade deal would generate a  whole host of benefits, including growing the economy by tens of  billions of dollars and supporting hundreds of thousands of American  jobs and giving farmers more access to sell their products beyond our  borders.   According to a recent report from the International Trade Commission,  the USMCA would raise the United States' GDP by more than $68 billion  and create nearly 200,000 new jobs. The study also found that the USMCA  would have a positive impact on trade by increasing U.S. exports and  imports to Canada and Mexico by billions of dollars.   The benefits don't stop there. The agreement would benefit farmers  across the country and in my district in North Carolina. Under the  USMCA, U.S. dairy farmers would be able to more than triple their  access to the Canadian dairy market. This would be a  [[Page H8544]]  huge win for Iredell County, the top dairy producing county in North  Carolina, as our dairy producers will gain wider access to a bigger  marketplace.   Along with dairy, the USMCA would boost North Carolina's poultry  producers--a $37 billion industry that supports nearly 150,000 jobs in  my State. Early estimates show that poultry exports to Canada will grow  astronomically because the agreement increases tariff rate quotas for  U.S. poultry and egg exports to Canada. The agreement also eliminates  barriers facing U.S. dairy and poultry exports to Canada which will  further unleash economic growth.   Mr. Speaker, there is a reason the USMCA enjoys broad support from  Mexico, Canada, and the U.S. stakeholders, as well as a majority of  this House on both sides of the aisle: Because the upside for our  country is undisputed.   Ratifying this agreement would be a historic victory for our economy,  for our workers, and for our farmers.   The President and his team should be commended for a job well done,  and now it is time for this House to quit stalling and to act. The  window to pass the USMCA is closing, and I stand ready to vote for this  deal and to get it across the finish line.   I ask my Democratic colleagues to suspend their blind hatred of this  President and bring the USMCA to the floor for a simple up-or-down  vote. We need to stop thinking about this in terms of giving President  Trump a political victory and start thinking about giving the American  people an economic victory. That is why we all were sent here in the  first place.   Mr. Speaker, let's pass the USMCA now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lexington, North  Carolina, native Sarah Davis for recently becoming Yellowstone National  Park's first female chief ranger. This is a huge milestone, and our  Davidson County community could not be more proud of her.   Over the past two decades, Sarah has held various leadership roles,  including at North Carolina's own Guilford Courthouse National Military  Parks and also Blue Ridge Parkways. Sarah is well suited for this  position as she becomes the 18th chief ranger in more than 100 years of  Yellowstone National Park.   When asked to describe her leadership qualities, the superintendent  said: ``She is an outstanding leader, with a track record of high  performance, strategic thinking, and collaboration.''   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Sarah Davis of  Lexington, North Carolina, on her new position at Yellowstone National  Park. We wish her the best of luck.                            ____________________
