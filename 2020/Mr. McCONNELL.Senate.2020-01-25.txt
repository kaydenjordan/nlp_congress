 Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, we should expect 2 to 3  hours of session today. We will take a quick break if needed.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 483, the  counsel for the President have 24 hours to make the presentation of  their case.   The Senate will now hear you.   The Presiding Officer recognizes Mr. Cipollone to begin the  presentation of the case for the President.                              Opening Statement    Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, Leader McConnell,  Democratic Leader Schumer, thank you for your time and thank you for  your attention. I want to start out, just very briefly, giving you a  short plan for today. We are going to be very respectful of your time.  As Leader McConnell said, we anticipate going about 2 to 3 hours at  most and to be out of here by 1 at the latest.   We are going to focus today on two points. You heard the House  managers speak for nearly 24 hours over 3 days. We don't anticipate  using that much time. We don't believe that they have come anywhere  close to meeting their burden for what they are asking you to do. In  fact, we believe that, when you hear the facts--and that is what we  intend to cover today, the facts--you will find that the President did  absolutely nothing wrong. What we intend to do today--and we will have  more presentations in greater detail on Monday, but what we intend to  do today--is go through their record that they established in the  House, and we intend to show you some of the evidence that they adduced  in the House that they decided, over their 3 days and 24 hours, that  they didn't have enough time or made a decision not to show you.   And every time you see one of these pieces of evidence, ask yourself:  Why didn't I see that in the first 3 days? They had it. It came out of  their process. Why didn't they show that to the Senate? I think that is  an important question because, as House managers, really, their goal  should be to give you all of the facts, because they are asking you to  do something very, very consequential and, I would submit to you--to  use a word that Mr. Schiff used a lot--very, very dangerous.   That is the second point that I would ask you to keep in mind today.  They are asking you not only to overturn the results of the last  election, but as I have said before, they are asking you to remove  President Trump from the ballot in an election that is occurring in  approximately 9 months. They are asking you to tear up all of the  ballots  [[Page S568]]  across this country, on your own initiative--take that decision away  from the American people. And I don't think they spent 1 minute of  their 24 hours talking to you about the consequences of that for our  country--not 1 minute. They didn't tell you what that would mean for  our country--today, this year, and forever into our future.   They are asking you to do something that no Senate has ever done, and  they are asking you to do it with no evidence. That is wrong, and I ask  you to keep that in mind. I ask you to keep that in mind. So what I  would do is point out one piece of evidence for you, and then I am  going to turn it over to my colleagues, and they will walk you through  their record, and they will show you things that they didn't show you.   Now, they didn't talk a lot about the transcript of the call, which I  would submit is the best evidence of what happened on the call. And  they said things over and over again that are simply not true. One of  them was: There is no evidence of President Trump's interest in burden- sharing; that wasn't the real reason. But they didn't tell you that  burden-sharing was discussed in the call, in the transcript of the  call. They didn't tell you that.   Why? Let me read it to you. Here is the President. And we will go  through the entire transcript. I am not going to read the whole  transcript. We will make it available. I am sure you have it, but we  will make available copies of the transcript so you can have it.   The President said--and they read this line:         I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of       effort and a lot of time.    But they stopped there. They didn't read the following:         Much more than European countries are doing and they should       be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost       nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it's       something that you should really ask them about. When I was       speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn't       do anything. A lot of European countries are the same way so       I think it's something you want to look at but the United       States has been very, very good to Ukraine.    That is where they picked up again with the quote, but they left out  the entire discussion of burden-sharing.   Now, what does President Zelensky say? Does he disagree? No, he  agrees. They didn't tell you this. They didn't tell you this. Didn't  have time in 24 hours to tell you this:         Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100%, but actually       [100%] and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela       Merkel and I did meet with her. I also met and talked with       Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much       as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions.       They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as       much as they should work for Ukraine. It turns out that even       though logically, the European Union should be our biggest       partner but technically the United States is a much bigger       partner than the European Union and I'm very grateful to you       for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for       Ukraine. Much more than the European Union especially when we       are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation.    You heard a lot about the importance of confronting Russia, and we  are going to talk about that. And you will hear that President Trump  has a strong record on confronting Russia. You will hear that President  Trump has a strong record of support for Ukraine. You will hear that  from the witnesses in their record that they didn't tell you about.   That is one very important example. They come here to the Senate and  ask you: remove a President, tear up the ballots in all of your States.  And they don't bother to read the key evidence of the discussion of  burden-sharing that is in the call itself. That is emblematic of their  entire presentation.   I am going to turn the presentation over to my colleague, Mike  Purpura. He is going to walk you through many more examples of this.  With each example, ask yourself: Why am I just hearing about this now  after 24 hours of sitting through arguments? Why? The reason is, we can  talk about the process; we will talk about the law; but today we are  going to confront them on the merits of their argument.   They have the burden of proof, and they have not come close to  meeting it. I want to ask you to think about one issue regarding  process, beyond process. If you were really interested in finding out  the truth, why would you run a process the way they ran it? If you were  really confident in your position on the facts, why would you lock  everybody out of it from the President's side? Why would you do that?   We will talk about the process arguments, but the process arguments  also are compelling evidence on the merits because it is evidence that  they themselves don't believe in the facts of their case.   The fact that they came here for 24 hours and hid evidence from you  is further evidence that they don't really believe in the facts of  their case; that this is--for all their talk about election  interference, that they are here to perpetrate the most massive  interference in an election in American history, and we can't allow  that to happen.   It would violate our Constitution; it would violate our history; it  would violate our obligations to the future; and, most importantly, it  would violate the sacred trust the American people have placed in you  and have placed in them. The American people decide elections. They  have one coming up in 9 months.   We will be very efficient. We will begin our presentation today. We  will show you a lot of evidence that they should have showed you, and  we will finish efficiently and quickly so that we can all go have an  election.   Thank you, and I yield to my colleague, Michael Purpura.   Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, good  morning.   Again, my name is Michael Purpura. I serve as Deputy Counsel to the  President. It is my honor and privilege to appear before you today on  behalf of President Donald J. Trump.
