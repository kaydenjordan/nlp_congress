 Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember and recognize the  incredible life of Enedina Celiz Rapan, who passed away this month at  the age of 93.   I was raised in a farmworker community with farmworker parents in the  eastern Coachella Valley, where, for many of us, hardship and injustice  can feel like the norm; and if it weren't for women like Enedina Rapan,  many of us would still believe that it is true, and we would not be  standing where we are today.   Enedina came to America at a young age to work hard, earn her living,  and give her children a better life. And while she was working away in  the fields, sweating in 120-degree heat with calloused hands, she  witnessed the mistreatment of her fellow farmworkers and she saw their  suffering.   If there is one thing about Enedina, it is that, when she saw  injustice, she would speak up and get to work to fix it. So, when she  saw farmworkers laboring for hours on end with no bathrooms nearby, she  fought to bring restrooms to the fields. And when she saw seniors in  the community going hungry, she organized, asking for donations and  cooking meals so they could have dinner to eat.   And Enedina devoted her life to standing up for people who were  mistreated, discriminated against, and vulnerable. There was no voice  too soft that Enedina didn't hear and elevate.   Enedina was a giant for our community, working with the United Farm  Workers of America, Cesar Chavez, and Lideres Campesinas to stand up  for the rights of farmworkers. She used her tireless will and unmatched  strength to pick people up, fight for what is right, and make the  Coachella Valley a better place for everyone who lives there.   I am better off because of Enedina's work. My family and the entire  farmworker community of the Coachella Valley, we are all better off  because of Enedina's work.   And she would not be happy with me for being up here talking about  her, because she was so humble. A woman who elevated everyone's voice  around her, she would never seek this type of recognition.   Mr. Speaker, today, I want to make sure the country knows Enedina's  story. I want to make sure you know about her contributions to our  community and her unrelenting pursuit of justice.   Enedina will be sorely missed, but her presence will be felt and her  life, an inspiration for years to come.      Recognizing the Life and Legacy of Petra Ruiz of Coachella Valley     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell the Nation about the life  and legacy of Petra Ruiz of the Coachella Valley.   Petra Ruiz was an organizer, activist, and leader who used her life  to stand up for farmworking women across California.   As the son of farmworkers in the eastern Coachella Valley, I am all  too familiar with the social, economic, and political hardships the  farmworking community faces on a daily basis. The struggles can often  be so great that you have to have someone or something to look to for  inspiration. For me, and for so many of us in the Coachella Valley,  Petra Ruiz was one such inspiration.   Petra was a fierce and loving leader who was held in high esteem,  even by the people who didn't agree with what she had to say. But it  was hard not to agree with what she had to say. You see, Petra believed  in helping farmworking women across California advocate for themselves,  for their families, and for their communities in the struggle for  equality and their basic human rights.   Petra got involved in the union movement in the 1970s and was a  warrior for justice and equality within the farmworking community  through her final days.   A phrase that I have heard repeatedly in talking with members of the  community and with her family is ``she was always there.'' Petra was  always there.   Even as a mother and a grandmother to a big family, she worked with  the United Farm Workers of America and as a member of Lideres  Campesinas to advocate for the rights of the farmworker community.  Petra led marches; she attended meetings; she would even go door-to- door with flyers making sure that farmworkers knew their rights.   Petra was a remarkable woman, revered, admired, a mover and shaker,  an effective leader who led with her actions as much as she did by her  words. She inspired me to never say no to my dreams, to pursue justice  at every turn, and to always believe I could make a difference.   Mr. Speaker, while she is missed dearly, Petra's legacy didn't end  with her passing. Her impact is felt today and will continue in the  lives of generations to come.                            ____________________
