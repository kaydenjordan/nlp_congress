 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back all  time.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I pay tribute to the life and  legacy of Cuban-American businessman and icon, Felipe Valls, Sr., who  unfortunately passed away. Many know Valls Sr. as the founder of world- renowned Versailles Cuban Restaurant, but many more know of the  indelible mark he left on the Cuban exile community throughout south  Florida. His life was a true testament to the American dream and he  demonstrated a well-lived life in a nation that welcomed him and gave  him the opportunity to create a culinary landmark in my home State of  Florida. Felipe's legacy will live on through his beloved family and  friends. Jeanette and I unite in prayer for the repose of the soul of  this great Cuban-American entrepreneur.                            ____________________     Madam President, I recognize Dr. Osvaldo De La  Pedraja on his more than 60-year career in the medical field and for  celebrating his 92nd birthday on November 19, 2022.   Osvaldo graduated as a doctor of medicine from the Medical School of  the University of Havana, Cuba in 1960. Three years later, he was  expelled from  [[Page S6851]]  the Hospital Clinico Quirurgico Comandante Fajardo due to his  opposition to Castro's communist regime.   In 1968, Osvaldo arrived in the United States with his family.  Committed to helping those in need of medical assistance in his new  country, Osvaldo completed an internship at Mount Sinai Hospital in  Miami Beach, FL, and completed his specialty in radiology at Jackson  Memorial Hospital. In 1972, Osvaldo opened his own private practice  specializing in diagnostic radiology in Coral Gables, FL. For more than  50 years, it has remained in the same location and has helped countless  Floridians in need of consulting doctors and seeking medical treatment.   Osvaldo is also a member of the Latin American Society of Radiology,  is the president of the Physicians' Assistant Hospital and Annexes  Association, and has been a volunteer doctor of La Liga Contra El  Cancer for 35 years. Previously, he served as president of the Cuban  Revolutionary Forum.   Osvaldo's medical work over the years has undoubtedly saved countless  lives in Florida. I am grateful for his decades of service to the  people of Florida and for his fight against communism in Cuba. I extend  my best wishes on his 92nd birthday.                            ____________________
