 Madam Speaker, how dare Republicans come to this floor  and lecture America about masks and liberty over and over again while  at the same time undermining the precious right to vote?   Free and fair elections are central to our liberty, and we are not  going to let anyone take that away from us.   Those who worship at the altar of voter suppression will fail. Those  who worship at the altar of Jim Crow-like oppression will fail. Those  who worship at the altar of turning back the clock to make America hate  again will fail.   We are not going backward.   The John Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act will become law,  and when it is all said and done, democracy will prevail, and good  trouble will win the day.
