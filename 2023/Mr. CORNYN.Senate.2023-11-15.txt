 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, earlier this week, the U.S. Supreme Court  issued an official code of conduct. This is really an update over  existing rules that govern the ethics and operations of the Judiciary,  not only at the Supreme Court but throughout the Judiciary throughout  the country. This document was important because questions have been  raised about the practices of the Court and about public disclosures of  some of their activities.   But the good news is, this was adopted by all nine members of the  Court and codifies ethics rules and principles that guide the Justices'  conduct.   I am glad that the Court took this step to make clear to the American  people that they were committed to operating with the highest ethical  standards. But I get the impression that some of our colleagues here in  the Congress think that it is the job of another branch of government  to tell an independent branch of government what it ought to do.  Obviously, it is basic government. We have three coequal branches of  government: the legislative branch, the executive branch. Those are the  so-called political branches. Then there is the independent judiciary,  which is, frankly, I believe, the crown jewel of our system.   I think there are those who sometimes feel like they don't like the  decisions made by the Federal judges and that the best way to control  that or to have an impact on it is to undermine public confidence in  the Judiciary. As my Republican colleagues and I have said for months,  any decision about the Supreme Court's rules, including their recusal  rules or formal code of conduct, should not come from the Congress; it  should come from the Court itself. And now it has done so.   The Senate has a limited, albeit important, role when it comes to the  Supreme Court. That is through the confirmation process that we are all  familiar with. As we know, all nine members of the Supreme Court  underwent a rigorous confirmation process; they endured hours and hours  of questions from members of the Judiciary Committee; they had FBI  background checks and other background checks; they met with each  Senator who was willing to meet with them one-on-one; and they were  ultimately confirmed to a seat on the highest Court in the land. That  is where the Senate's role ends.   It is not Congress's responsibility or authority to force the  Justices to adopt a specific code of conduct or to dictate how the  Supreme Court conducts its business. As I said, the Supreme Court and  the Federal Judiciary is a separate--separate--and coequal--those are  important words--separate and coequal branch of government. And it  falls squarely outside the legislature's authority to tell the Supreme  Court how to run its business.   There is another constitutional function that is available to us  that, fortunately, we haven't had to use in a long time, which is  impeachment. That is the role of the Senate and the House. The Senate  confirms, but the House can vote Articles of Impeachment, and then  there is a trial in the Senate in the most egregious set of  circumstances, which, thankfully, we are not presented with.   Many of our friends across the aisle have been particularly vocal  about  [[Page S5519]]  their desire to see a specific code of ethics for the Supreme Court. As  a matter of fact, our Democratic colleagues, the majority, have even  cosponsored a bill that would force--force--a coequal branch of  government, the Federal judiciary, to adopt a certain specific code of  conduct. This was introduced by our colleague from Rhode Island,  Senator Whitehouse, under the guise of ``ethics reform.''   In addition to the code of conduct, it would impose strict new rules  for recusal. That means when judges should withdraw from and not  participate in the decision of a case. It would also subject the  Justices to a never-ending stream of ethics complaints by politically  motivated groups. The bill itself would incentivize frivolous ethics  complaints against Justices to prevent that specific Justice from  actually sitting on a particular case.   The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board called this the ``Supreme  Court Control Act,'' which is certainly an appropriate description.   This bill is not designed to promote ethics and good governance. It  was about forcing an independent branch of government to bend to the  Senate's will. In July, Democrats on the Judiciary Committee banded  together to pass this potentially unconstitutional bill, but the  majority leader has yet to bring it to the floor for a vote because I  think he understands it would be dead on arrival.   Now that the Supreme Court has adopted an official code of conduct, I  hope our colleagues across the aisle will finally lay this bad idea to  rest. They said they wanted the Supreme Court to adopt a code of  conduct. The Justices have now done that, and so, now, this should be a  moot issue.   I hope this development will also encourage the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee to abandon his latest partisan attack on the Court.  In the Judiciary Committee last Thursday, Chairman Durbin and Senator  Whitehouse planned to expand their so-called ethics investigation by  issuing subpoenas to private individuals.   To be clear, the targets of these subpoenas are not government  officials. They are not judges. They are not elected officials. They  are private citizens.   Democrats want to bully, interrogate, and, potentially, embarrass  these individuals for committing what, in their eyes, amounts to a  serious crime, which is being friends with a Supreme Court Justice.   Senators Durbin and Whitehouse claim this is about transparency and  rebuilding trust, but the evidence suggests the opposite. I find it  telling that the only subpoena targets are known to donate to  Republican candidates and conservative causes. Democrats seem to have  zero interest in hearing from liberal billionaires and dark-money  groups that have made it their mission to rig the Supreme Court in  Democrats' favor.   If our colleagues wanted to hear from folks who actually jeopardize  the legitimacy of the Court, my Republican colleagues and I planned to  provide a range of options. We planned to provide a range of options at  last week's meeting, but then, abruptly, Senator Durbin gaveled us out,  without taking up these subpoenas.   But I did file an amendment to subpoena liberal billionaire George  Soros, for example, who is one of the biggest benefactors of the  Democratic Party and a major contributor to the dark-money group known  as Demand Justice. This isn't your typical public interest advocacy  group. The entire goal of the misnamed Demand Justice is to pack the  Court and install a permanent liberal majority.   Last year, one of the cofounders of Demand Justice tweeted:         It's time for [the Democrats] to see the Court as a       political opponent, just as much as any [Republican] elected       official, and run against it.    So Demand Justice, funded by George Soros, was saying that we need to  target these lifetime-tenured, nonpolitical officeholders as political  opponents and run against them. If we want to talk about depoliticizing  the Court and rebuilding faith in the judiciary, this is where the  Judiciary Committee should look.   The millionaires and billionaires who are bankrolling the effort to  brand the Court as a political opponent are far more relevant to this  debate than longtime personal friends of the Justices.   I was eager to see if Democrats' commitment to ``transparency'' held  up when wealthy Democrats were on the receiving end of a subpoena, but  we never found out. As I said, just before the committee was supposed  to vote, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee abruptly adjourned the  meeting--I would like to think, because he finally had second thoughts  about how dangerous and inappropriate this entire effort was. After  all, the Senate Judiciary Committee has no business issuing subpoenas  for private citizens under the guise of transparency.   There was no legitimate legislative purpose for conducting this witch  hunt. Maybe our Democratic colleagues realized that Republican  amendments were likely to pass, too, causing their partisan smear  campaign to backfire. But the chairman claimed that it was just a  matter of timing, and he has put the subpoena authorizations on the  docket for the Judiciary Committee meeting tomorrow morning--Thursday,  this week.   Democrats claim that the Justices are to blame for distrust and lack  of confidence in the Court, but let's take a look at some facts. The  Justices already file, like we do, annual financial disclosure reports.  They recuse themselves, under their rules, from cases when it is  inappropriate for them to sit. They go to great lengths to avoid even  the appearance of impropriety. To assuage any remaining concerns about  ethical standards, as I said, the Justices just adopted a code for the  first time in history.   Meanwhile, Senate Democrats, who claim to care about public trust and  confidence in the Court, are on the warpath. The Democratic leader, the  majority leader of the U.S. Senate, stood on the steps of the Supreme  Court just months ago and threatened two sitting Justices by name,  saying they would pay the price and they didn't know what would hit  them if they didn't reach his preferred decision in an abortion case-- unbelievable.   A group of five Democratic Senators made a not-so-subtle threat to  the Court, claiming it could be restructured if it didn't deliver the  preferred outcome in a case involving the Second Amendment.   Fifteen Democratic Senators, including several members of the  Judiciary Committee, recommended slashing the Supreme Court's budget if  it failed to meet their demand to implement a new code of ethics that  had the Democrats' stamp of approval on it.   And, now, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee wants to  interrogate private citizens over their personal finances, something he  claims is imperative to restoring trust in the Supreme Court.   Well, it is pretty clear that the so-called ethics crisis in the  Supreme Court isn't really about ethics at all. It is about exerting  control and domination over a separate, coequal branch of government,  as the Constitution itself provides. So it is time for the Judiciary  Committee to abandon its partisan charade and focus on the actual  crises facing our country.   While the chairman spends valuable time--limited time--dealing with  this made-up controversy, we have seen nearly 2.5 million border  crossings in the past year. We are losing 70,000 Americans a year to  fentanyl poisoning. The Biden administration has also lost track of  hundreds of thousands of migrant children.    You would think that would be a matter of some urgency to the  Judiciary Committee, and its chairman, that has jurisdiction over those  matters. But these aren't problems that have earned the time and  attention of the Judiciary Committee. Rather, it has chosen partisan  attacks on the independence of the Supreme Court.   I urge my colleagues to abandon their partisan attacks on the Supreme  Court and to get back to doing the work of the American people, and a  good place to start would be at the southern border.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
