 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Olivia Letts, who  passed away on February 1 at the age of 93. Ms. Letts was a true  trailblazer.   After being hired as the first Black schoolteacher in Lansing, she  was a constant force for good in the community. It is my privilege to  honor her with my remarks on the floor of the people's House.   Born on the south side of Chicago, Ms. Letts did not let anything get  in the way of her own education. According to her grandsons, the only  time she was ever late for school was because of a trolley accident.   At the rooming house that she and her family shared with other  families, she would wake up as early as 4 a.m. to study in the bathroom  because it was the only time she could find peace and quiet.   She maintained her devotion to learning during her time at the  Chicago Teachers College and her three advanced degree programs at  Michigan State University. Nothing could keep Ms. Letts from the  classroom, not even the racial discrimination of the day.    To be sure, breaking the color barrier in Lansing schools wasn't  easy. The first time she applied to be a teacher, she was rejected with  a letter that said the district ``had never made a practice of hiring  anyone of her race, but would keep her under consideration.''  Undeterred, Ms. Letts lobbied local leaders until she was asked to  reapply. Ten years later, she was promoted to principal.   Ms. Letts' story wouldn't be complete without mention of her husband  and lifelong love, Richard, who passed away in 1997. For nearly half a  century, their union was an unstoppable force for good in Lansing--she  as the consummate advocate and role model for students and he as the  city's equal opportunity officer and human relations director for 44  years. They are the namesake of the Letts Community Center, where this  photo was taken.   Ms. Letts was an eternal optimist. She liked books with happy  endings, whether they were Nicholas Sparks novels or President Obama's  memoirs.   She lived a full life, and her story had a happy ending, too. Just a  few days before her passing, she parked herself in front of the  television, thrilled to watch her fellow Alpha Kappa Alpha sister,  Kamala Harris, be inaugurated as Vice President.   She is survived by her daughter, Eileen; her two grandsons, Robert  and Matthew; as well as the countless individuals she touched with her  grace and humility.   Since her passing, the tributes to her life have been effusive:   ``She was just delightful.''   ``She helped pave the way.''   ``She just did what was right.''   And my personal favorite, ``Her legacy lives on in the work that  folks are doing here in the community.''   What a fitting way to remember such a towering figure of the Lansing  community. May she indeed live on in the work and in these words spoken  into the permanent Record of the people's House.                                time  2045                      Honoring the Legacy of James Bibbs     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor another legend in the  Lansing community, Mr. James Bibbs.   Mr. Bibbs has had many words written about him over the years, and  almost all of them mention his distinction as the longest-tenured  track-and-field coach in Michigan State University history.   From 1968 to 1995, his students won 52 Big Ten titles, 26 All- American honors, three NCAA titles, and broke two world records.   But those who know Coach Bibbs will tell you that it has never been  about the number of titles and his own career. What has distinguished  him over the years was the size of his heart and the kindness he has  shown over the course of his life.  [[Page H717]]    From high school to AAU club teams, collegiate squads, to national  and international teams, Coach Bibbs lived by the words he spoke in  2010 when he was inducted into the MSU Athletics Hall of Fame: ``I just  loved track and I loved to work with the youngsters.''   And yet, it almost didn't happen. After graduating as a star baseball  recruit from Ecorse High School, he turned down a minor league contract  offered by the Yankees to attend Eastern Michigan University.   At the time, EMU didn't have a freshman baseball team, so he decided  to join the track team instead. And as with the races he would win as a  champion sprinter, he never looked back.   Mr. Bibbs later became a teacher in Detroit before assuming the title  of coach for the first time in 1959. He led his hometown high school in  Ecorse to multiple championships before arriving in East Lansing as an  assistant in 1968, the first African-American coach ever hired at  Michigan State.   In 1977, Coach Bibbs became head coach, and over the next 27 years,  he inspired hundreds of student athletes to be their best selves by  connecting their personal achievements on the track with their personal  achievement in life.   Many of his former runners have credited him with planting the seeds  of confidence that allowed them to compete all over the world. It is no  surprise that several of them have paid it forward by becoming track  coaches themselves.   Today, his path has taken him full circle as a volunteer with the  team at East Lansing High School, where his son is the principal.   Even after all the Hall of Fame inductions and all the honors  bestowed on him, Mr. Bibbs is still the same gentle and humble man he  has always been, a man who loves track and the lessons it can teach  others.   His wife, Martha, who passed away in October of last year, was his  partner of 50 years. A trailblazer in her own right, she was the first  woman and first Black woman to serve as personnel director for the  State of Michigan.   These two were a power couple in Lansing, recognized for their high  profile jobs and their contributions to the community.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to deliver these remarks so that Coach  Bibbs' achievements may forever exist in the Congressional Record, as a  proud Spartan, as a legend in the track and field community, and as a  pioneer for equality.    Recognizing the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission of Mid-Michigan     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an organization  that has been on the front lines of advocating for racial equality over  the past 40 years: The Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission of Mid- Michigan.   Founded in 1979, with the goal of establishing a Federal holiday for  the icon of the civil rights movement, the MLK Commission realized its  mission just 4 years after its founding. Ever since, the group has been  working to preserve the legacy and teachings of Dr. King, in part, by  supporting community agencies and empowering youth to achieve their  goals.   The Commission's success can be found in its record: 40 high  schoolers sponsored each year to go on a college tour of historically  Black colleges and universities, more than $100,000 in scholarships  awarded, and more than $70,000 in grants given to local organizations.   In the past, the Commission has sent delegations to notable milestone  events, from the opening of the National Museum of African American  History and Culture to the 55th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma,  Alabama.   Under the capable leadership of my friend, Ms. Elaine Hardy, its  chairperson, the MLK Commission has flourished as a proud beacon of  justice in our State.   But to really understand the impact, you need only look at the annual  Day of Celebration, the largest and longest-running in the entire  country. I have been many times.   Every third Monday of January, more than 1,500 attendees come  together in Greater Lansing to recognize local students, hear from  keynote speakers, and recommit to the unfinished work of Dr. King.   Each celebration is focused on one of Dr. King's quotes. For this  year's event, held remotely for the first time due to the pandemic, the  Commission selected: ``Out of a mountain of despair, a stone of hope,''  and invited Bernice King to address the group.   At a time when we face unprecedented challenges, the MLK Commission  of Mid-Michigan is that stone of hope for so many in our beloved  community.   For 42 years, the Commission has shown what is possible when folks  from all walks of life come together under the banner of equality and  justice.   May it continue to shine as an example of community leadership for  the next 42 years; and may its legacy live on forever in the official  record of the U.S. Congress.        Honoring the Legacies of James Riley, Sr. and James Riley, Jr.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a father and son  duo who, between them, have served Lansing for over 60 years: James  Riley, Sr. and James Riley, Jr.   Their story begins when the elder Riley moved to Michigan after  graduating high school at 17. He took a job at the Ford plant in River  Rouge but left 2 years later to join the military when World War II  broke out.    While stationed in Charleston, he met his future wife of 70 years,  Deresa, at a dance. They moved back to Detroit soon after, and Mr.  Riley used his GI benefits to attend Wayne State University while  working at the Post Office.   On the advice of a friend, he majored in mortuary science, obtaining  his license before moving to Lansing and starting Riley Funeral Home in  1957.   As the oldest Black-owned funeral home, and perhaps even the oldest  Black-owned business in Lansing, the Riley name is synonymous with  being active in our community, being kind and courteous, and serving  families with professionalism and grace.   But it wasn't an easy path. When Mr. Riley first set out to get his  business off the ground, he found that no bank would extend him a loan.  It was a time when financial institutions could deny a man a line of  credit based on the color of his skin.   Indeed, Mr. Riley would later recall that loan officers seemed almost  amused by the novelty of a Black man asking for a loan. So he turned to  the community, cobbling together his savings with some contributions  from his sisters and friends who sold or lent him equipment.   At first, business was slow. They had just seven services in their  first year. This was the late 1950s, a time when African Americans  would routinely be turned away from other funeral homes. If and when  they were able to secure a service, they were continually assigned a  date and relegated to the afternoon, after the White services were  finished in the morning.   And so it went for the Rileys in their first decade of operation,  working hard to earn the trust of the community with sincerity and good  faith. It took time and concerted effort, but by the time James, Jr.  took over the business from his parents in 1993, Riley Funeral Home was  handling 150 services per year.   In a business that operates on trust, the younger Riley has taken his  family's business even further, making sure that every family that  comes to him is treated with care and respect.   After almost 30 years at the helm, James Jr., has devoted the same  attention to detail and standard of excellence his father was known  for.   James, Sr., passed away in 2016, 1 year after Deresa. And while they  may be gone, it is clear that their legacy lives on with their son.   Last October, I had the opportunity to visit Riley Funeral Home and  talk to James personally about his family story. He shared how Black- owned businesses were routinely discriminated against and regularly  denied capital and credit. It is thanks to legislation passed by this  body that that discrimination is no longer the case.   The Rileys have overcome tremendous obstacles to get where they are.  It is my honor to recognize both father and son today so that their  contributions to the Lansing community may live on in the permanent  record of the House of Representatives.                     Honoring the Legacy of Gregory Eaton     Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate a living legend in  Lansing, Mr. Gregory Eaton, proprietor of Gregory's Soul Food Bar &  Grill.  [[Page H718]]    Mr. Eaton embodies the motto of ``no job too small, no job too  large.'' It may be his name on the door, but he is often found on the  floor, busing tables, offering refills, and making sure that guests are  taken care of.   Growing up, Mr. Eaton developed a legendary work ethic that continues  to inspire to this day. His first jobs were shining shoes for his dad,  who worked at the Lansing Country Club and later ran a shoe repair  store.   When Mr. Eaton was 20 years old, he founded his first company, Greg's  Janitorial Service, with the slogan, ``We search for dirt.'' He won  cleaning contracts the old fashioned way, by word of mouth, working  hard, and helping others.   He hired local student athletes as a way to help them. Even future  superstars like Magic Johnson punched a time card under Mr. Eaton, for  a whopping $1.65 an hour.   Mr. Eaton has lived a life out of a movie. He is one of only a  handful of individuals to have attended all 53 Super Bowls in person.  He has been to title fights, the Masters, and was even in the stands at  the 1968 Olympics when Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists  at the podium.   But no matter how far and wide he travels, Mr. Eaton's heart remains  in Lansing. It remains with his three kids, 8 grandchildren, and one  great-grandchild. And it remains with all the individuals he has helped  along the way with his never-ending generosity.   Even in the midst of a pandemic that has claimed so many local  restaurants, Gregory's Soul Food has been able to keep its doors open,  thanks to a loyal and dependable clientele. Gregory's is an  institution, like the man it is named after.   So today, I am proud to recognize him on the floor of the people's  House, so that future generations may learn about his selfless service  to the Lansing community.                       Honoring Alex's Great State Race     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an organization that  brings together fierce rivals in the name of shared community; an  organization that bridges the sometimes impossible differences between  us; an organization helping to bring arch rivals together for the  betterment of the community and, most specifically, an organization  that literally bridges the 64 miles between Michigan State University  in East Lansing and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.   Most days, any Spartan or Wolverine will tell you that those miles  are still too close for comfort. But on the Friday before the big game  between both schools, a new tradition has emerged in the name of  charity, community spirit, and expanding access to education for all:  It is called Alex's Great State Race.   Named after Alex Powell, a young man accepted to Michigan State as he  underwent treatment for a rare and aggressive cancer, Alex had always  dreamed attending MSU. But the surgeries, chemo and radiation treatment  left him unable to carry out his studies with the normal vigor of a  freshman student.    Thankfully, Alex turned to MSU's Resource Center for Persons with  Disabilities, or RCPD. Devoted to inclusivity on campus for students,  employees, and visitors alike, the RCPD provided Alex with a dorm room  near his classes, offered support to him and his family, and  accommodated his needs as they became more complex.   They made arrangements to provide Alex the same MSU experience as any  other student, even when he was being treated at a cancer center at the  University of Michigan, 64 miles away.   Despite has valiant fight, Alex lost his battle with cancer in 2011.  Those around him remember his vibrant spirit and easy sense of humor,  even in the midst of a debilitating illness.   More than anything, Alex wanted to leave a legacy that would inspire  others, which is how his mother, Juliana, got in touch with the folks  at the Resource Center who played such an important role in his life.   Together, they created the Great State Race in Alex's name, a charity  organization dedicated to raising money for the RCPD, as well as its  counterpart at the University of Michigan, the Office of Services for  Students with Disabilities.   Now celebrating its seventh year, Alex's Great State Race is an  example of what can unite us. Each year, no matter how intense the  rivalry between the two schools, ROTC cadets from both Michigan and  Michigan State come together to run the game ball the 64 miles  separating the two campuses.   Supported by police that line the route, gracious donations that make  it possible, and a community united by the spirit of charity, Alex's  Great State Race proves that despite our split allegiances, we  absolutely have a common humanity.   Today, I am proud to honor the Powell family, the ROTC cadets, and  all of the folks involved at both schools who raise money for such a  worthy cause.   As the Jewish Prayer of Remembrance says: ``So long as we live, they  too shall live, for they are now a part of us, as we remember them.''   Mr. Speaker, we all remember Alex as long as these words will exist  in the Congressional Record, which is to say, we remember Alex forever.                                time  2100                          Honoring Jessica Witkowski     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jessica Witkowski, a  young woman making a difference in her hometown of Hartland, Michigan.  For her efforts, she has earned the distinction of being one of the  first female Eagle Scouts in the country. Drawn by the Scouts' emphasis  on environmental stewardship, service to community, and development of  leadership skills, Jessica joined the Scouts 2 years ago as a sophomore  in high school, shortly after they opened membership to girls.   She set her sights on a lofty goal, being a part of the inaugural  class of female Eagle Scouts. After building and installing bluebird  houses in Settler's Park for her Life Scout rank, she started  brainstorming Eagle Scout projects that would similarly align with her  love of the outdoors.   But soon after, the pandemic hit, and stay-at-home orders forced a  change. Like a good Scout, though, Jessica adapted. She soon realized  that the greatest need in the community was for face masks for seniors  in retirement homes. Through Zoom meetings and video tutorials, she  gathered 16 of her classmates and set out to teach them how to create  face masks.   The fact that she had never sewn before did not hold her back, nor  did the fact that she would have to sew with gloves on in order to  follow the best practices for sanitation and avoiding potential spread.   From start to finish, the project took 2 months. By the time it was  completed, Jessica and her determined group of volunteers had surpassed  their initial goal of creating 600 masks, which Jessica distributed to  the three local organizations taking care of seniors vulnerable to the  pandemic.   Last fall, just by chance, on a tour of cider mills in my district, I  actually ran into Jessica at Spicer's. Even now, I can still remember  her infectious personality and her thousand-watt smile, even behind her  face mask. She is an impressive young woman, and I am proud to  represent her here in Congress.   Although we haven't been able to hold her official court of honor due  to the pandemic, I know that it will come, and Jessica will be able to  celebrate her achievement surrounded by her friends and family. In the  meantime, it is my personal honor to speak these remarks into the  Congressional Record so that folks back home can read about her hard  work and dedicated service to community.                          Celebrating Marcus Goller     Mr. Speaker, lastly, I rise to pay tribute to Marcus  Goller, a cornerstone of the Brighton community who sadly passed away  late last month.   Marcus owned and operated the Brighton Coffeehouse and Theater  alongside his wife, Amy, and their two kids, Spencer and Macy.   The spot is a mainstay of downtown Brighton, a place to pop in for a  quick coffee or pastry or to take in a show in its 70-seat black box  theater. But before it was a reality, it was just a dream between a  couple and their kids.   Marcus had had a long career in the coffee business, running a chain  of coffee shops in college towns all across the Midwest. Amy had acted  professionally and directed productions at Brighton High School.  [[Page H719]]    One day, while sitting in the children's reading room at a small  bookstore on Main Street, they had the idea of opening their own  coffeehouse. What started that day as a dream became a reality in 2018  when Brighton Coffeehouse and Theater opened its doors and quickly  became a cornerstone of downtown.   It is the perfect place to gather. I still remember hosting a  townhall conversation there in 2019 and the incredible sense of  community that you felt as soon as you walk in the door. It is the  reason that student organizations and performers constantly use the  space, because you immediately feel at home.   As anyone will tell you, that is because of Marcus. He was the soul  of Brighton Coffeehouse, a quiet, kind presence. He treated visitors  like neighbors and neighbors like family, always making sure that they  were well served and had everything they needed.   It was his idea to start the Brighton Yacht Club, a fleet of dozens  of little motorized remote-controlled sailboats that people could rent  and sail on the millpond just outside. He loved his business, and the  people loved his business back.   He would be the first to tell you that it wasn't easy, that the road  from a conversation to construction was filled with twists and turns  and setbacks, but Marcus never met an obstacle he couldn't overcome.   His passing is our loss. To Amy, Spencer, and Macy, to all those who  knew Marcus and loved him, may they hold on to the dark roasts, the  baked goods, the theater productions that brought them close together.   I speak these words today so that his legacy is forever remembered in  the permanent Record of the people's House, letting all who read know  Marcus made a difference.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
