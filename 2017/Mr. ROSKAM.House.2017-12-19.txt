 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.   We have heard some strong language for the past couple of minutes.  This has been described as theology, science fiction, ideology, and now  deceit.   Well, where is the deceit?   The deceit is in the assumption that we can live with the status quo,  Mr. Speaker.   The deceit is a blindness to the recognition that we have a Tax Code  that is literally dissolving underneath us. It is dissolving underneath  us.   And this Congress has an opportunity to do something  transformational, and I propose, along with my colleagues, to be  transformational and opportunistic.   There is a lot of discussion in the subtext of this about class envy  and opportunity and so forth. Here is what I know: It is the status quo  that is serving the few. It is the status quo that is so off-putting  and unsettling and keeps people at arm's length.   What we are proposing is something very different. Mr. Speaker, we  are proposing the economics of opportunity, not the economics of envy;  the economics of buoyancy and the economics of participation.   Therein lies the foundation of this bill. It offers tax relief that  my constituents are longing for, and it offers a business environment  in a milieu that makes things happen, and happen for the good.   So I am pleased, I am honored to be a part of this. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``aye,'' and let us celebrate a job well done.
