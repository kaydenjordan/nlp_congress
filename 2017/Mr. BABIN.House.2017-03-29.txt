 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the HONEST Act.  As a cosponsor of this legislation and a member of the Science, Space,  and Technology Committee, I am very pleased to see this bill come to  the House floor.   I represent the congressional district with the highest concentration  of petrochemical, manufacturing, and refining facilities than any other  district in the entire Nation. This means that thousands of my  constituents have been or are currently employed by these industries.  In fact, years ago, I spent some time as a worker in one of these very  factories.   With this in mind, you can understand why pushing for reform,  transparency, and accountability within the EPA would be very important  to me because so many of my constituents' livelihoods are affected by  costly and burdensome regulations from the EPA. My constituents want to  make sure that the EPA's actions, particularly those based on secret  science, do not cost them their jobs or their livelihood.   Time and again, the EPA has issued extensive regulations without ever  showing the science to back up their claims to justify these  regulations. It is like they have a little black box over there. They  don't let anyone else look into it, and they just say: Trust us, we  have got good science backing up our claims.   I say, if your science is so good, then don't hide it in your little  black box. Show us your data.   The HONEST Act simply requires the EPA to open their little black box  to public scrutiny. After we pass the HONEST Act, any regulations  coming from the EPA must be based on data that is publicly available.  What is so offensive about a little transparency?   Most companies and businesses would be happy to comply with the EPA  when data shows that their regulations are backed up by clear evidence.  But many times, if not most of the time, this is not the case. Instead  the regulations are based on secret science that no one but the  regulators themselves have access to.   When the Federal Government issues regulations based on secret  science, this is yet another example of a Federal agency getting away  with something the rest of America cannot do.  [[Page H2539]]  American workers are fed up with overzealous regulators pushing our  jobs overseas.    Mr. Speaker, this bill is about protecting American jobs  and the American economy.   In math class, we were taught to show our work; and when we didn't,  we got the problem counted wrong. This bill is about transparency,  accountability, and holding the government to the same standard that  everyone else is.   According to a poll by the Institute for Energy Research, 90 percent  of Americans believe that scientific data used to make government  decisions should be available to the public, to the rest of us. That is  nearly 100 percent. Not many issues in our current political  environment enjoy that level of support. But when it does, Congress  should very well listen.   The HONEST Act is a commonsense legislation that I am proud to  support.   I include in the Record this letter of support from the American  Chemistry Council.                                     American Chemistry Council,                                     Washington, DC, March 28, 2017.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: On behalf of the American Chemistry       Council (ACC), we want to thank you for introducing H.R.       1430, the ``Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment Act of       2017'' (or the HONEST Act) to help improve the science       employed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in       the Agency's regulatory decision making processes.        The proposed legislation would increase the transparency       and public confidence in the EPA's scientific analyses.        Consistency and transparency are key to the regulatory       certainty our industry needs to grow and create jobs. In some       instances, EPA has fallen short of employing the highest-      quality, best-available science in their regulatory decision       making.        It is critical that the regulated community and the public       have confidence that decisions reached by EPA are grounded in       transparent and reproducible science, while ensuring the       protection of confidential business information and       competitive intelligence. By ensuring that the EPA utilizes       high quality science and shares underlying data used to reach       decisions, the HONEST Act can help foster a regulatory       environment that will allow the U.S. business of chemistry to       continue to develop safe, innovative products that Americans       depend on in their everyday lives.        We commend you for your leadership and commitment to       advance and improve EPA science. We look forward to working       with you and other bill sponsors to pass this important piece       of legislation.            Sincerely,                                                        Cal Dooley.     Mr. Speaker, I applaud the tireless work that Chairman  Lamar Smith has done to bring this legislation forward so that we can  bring accountability and transparency to the EPA.
