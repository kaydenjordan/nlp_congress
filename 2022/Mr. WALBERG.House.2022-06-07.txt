 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6087, the Improving Access to Workers'  Compensation for Injured Federal Workers Act,  [[Page H5243]]  is a commonsense bill to improve access to care for workers under the  Federal Employees' Compensation, or FECA, program.   I rise in support of this bill that I have co-led with my friend and  colleague, Representative Courtney, and thank him, his staff, my staff,  the staff of the Committee on Education and Labor for their diligent  work on this legislation.    The bill simply allows nurse practitioners or physician assistants to  care for Federal employees under the Federal workers' compensation  program so long--and I make this clear--so long as that care is within  their scope of practice under State law.   Under current Federal law, only a physician can diagnose, certify,  and oversee the treatment of an injured Federal worker receiving  compensation benefits. This requirement places an additional burden on  Federal employees who may have to drive great distances to receive care  from an approved provider.   Additionally, it limits the injured individual's choice, depriving  them from receiving healthcare from the provider with whom they are  most comfortable. A majority of States already allow NPs and PAs to  diagnose, certify an injury, and oversee the patient's treatment and  care for their State workers' compensation programs. So it is time that  the Federal Government do the same under the Federal disability  program. Furthermore, our bill will align the FECA program with other  Federal programs.   Currently, the Federal Government allows care provided or overseen by  PAs and NPs in Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employee Health Benefits  Program, and TRICARE. Additionally, since 2017, the Social Security  Administration has considered PAs and NPs, along with physicians, as  acceptable sources of information for documenting the existence of an  impairment for purposes of determining a disability.   Madam Speaker, across the country, nurse practitioners and physician  assistants provide critical care, especially in rural communities where  there may not be a physician within a reasonable distance. In Michigan,  there are 5,300 practicing physician assistants and nearly 9,000 nurse  practitioners. They are an important part of our primary care workforce  in our State.   Our bill updates Federal law to grant Federal employees more choice  in selecting their healthcare provider, improve access to care, and  enable better continuity of care. Again, I sincerely thank my  colleague, Representative Courtney, and his staff for their great work  on this bipartisan, commonsense bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Harris), my friend, the MD.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I add to the comments about concerns about the care that is being  provided. Repeated studies over the decades have shown that NPs and PAs  provide outstanding quality of care, improve health outcomes, and  increase cost-effectiveness.   Additionally, these healthcare professionals have advanced degrees  from nationally accredited programs that include both classroom and  clinical rotations and must demonstrate clinical competency.   Once more, if there were legitimate concerns about the quality of  care, whether it is a Federal program or State program, provided by NPs  and PAs to injured workers, then States would not license them to treat  or diagnose these workers under State workers' compensation programs.  However, the vast majority of States do recognize nurse practitioners  and physician assistants as eligible providers for diagnosing and  treating disability claims.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Murphy), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the ranking member of  the Education and Labor Committee and my good friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate that information being shared, but I would like to  address some of the concerns that my good friends from the Doc Caucus  have presented.   We have discussed this in committee representing districts that are  rural, urban, and suburban, and the challenges that are there. Again,  the issue of States' rights and the ability of States to make  decisions, there is a primacy that is there that we ought to consider  very strongly.   A majority of States already allow nurse practitioners and PAs to  diagnose, certify an injury, and oversee patients' treatment.  Furthermore, if we are talking about precedent, our bill will align the  FECA program with other Federal programs currently in place. Currently,  the Federal Government allows care provided or overseen by PAs and NPs  in, I state it again, Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employees Health  Benefits Program, and TRICARE.   That is significant. Those are textbook studies on how it is working  already. Adding to this just seems like it is justified and very  important to do.   Going back to the States' concerns, as well, if diagnosing or  treating a particular workplace injury is outside of the scope of  practice for a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant under their  State's law, then they would not be covered under this bill, plain and  simple. The bill preserves States' rights to make those determinations.   H.R. 6087 is simply expanding choice, important at this time,  especially with inflation and the cost that is going on in coming out  of a pandemic and getting in endemic situations.   The Congressional Budget Office, I repeat, noted that the bill would  not affect direct spending. In fact, CBO noted in its score that the  bill may result in injured workers receiving treatment faster and, as  my colleague Representative Courtney said, thereby returning them to  work and productivity more quickly and reducing the actual cost for  some FECA costs in the process.   Getting workers healthy and back to work is not only good for the  individual but also good for our economy as we look to get through  these worrisome economic times.                                time  1530    I accept the concerns of the medical doctors. I understand that they  have committed themselves to significant training and significant time  in the classroom and in the hospital itself, but we also know that we  have come of an age where doctors very regularly use the services and  need the services of nurse practitioners and physician assistants.   There are communities in my district, in rural areas, where the  doctor is a physician assistant. The people appreciate them and receive  good care as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, we have all heard of the physician shortage in  America. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants are a critical  component in fulfilling the provider gap. There are 355,000 nurse  practitioners and more than 150,000 physician assistants across the  country.   These healthcare professionals have advanced degrees from nationally  accredited programs and include both classroom and clinical rotations  and must demonstrate clinical competency.   Allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to diagnose,  certify, and treat injured Federal workers to the full extent of their  State license is not only common sense but is smart economic policy to  ensure workers get back to work more quickly and off government  supported programs.   The bill will not remove physicians from providing care to an injured  worker if that is who the patient chooses. The bill is simply giving  injured workers more choice to get the timely care they need.   The CBO scored the bill as having insignificant impact on direct  spending and noted, may result, in fact, in injured workers receiving  treatment faster, thereby returning to work more quickly and reducing  costs for the FECA program.   Lastly, the FECA program is virtually the last remaining Federal  health program that does not recognize the role that PAs and NPs play  in modern healthcare delivery. They can already provide and oversee  care in Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employee Health Benefits  program, the VA, DOD, Indian Health Service, and the Bureau of Prisons,  and are recognized by the Social Security Administration.   Furthermore, the bill aligns with the majority of States which  already authorize NPs and PAs to certify and oversee healthcare for  patients in their State workers' compensation programs.   This is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that will make the Federal  workers' compensation program more efficient and ensure workers have  access to a health provider of their choice.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Foxx, and Mr.  Courtney for their support of this bill, and I urge the rest of my  colleagues to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time.
