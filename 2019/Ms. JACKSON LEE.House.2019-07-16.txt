 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for  his scholarship and his passion, the chairman of the Rules Committee,  my good friend from Georgia, and all those who have come to the floor  today.   Mr. Speaker, let me say that this is a somber moment. It is not a  moment that I cherish. My privilege in serving the greatest country in  the world has allowed me to serve with three previous Presidents. Not  one time from the three previous Presidents have I ever heard the words  that were uttered this weekend.   I believe in harmony. I just came out of a Helsinki Commission  meeting, an organization that deals with peace around the world. We  were talking about how we can impress upon the world to not use  religion for hatred. Religion is love.   One of the answers I gave was to show the examples here in the United  States, where religions from all different perspectives come together  in a time of disaster and need. It is something that touches our heart.   When we vote for a President, we want that President to touch our  hearts, to lift us up, and to make us better people.   I cannot argue with the fact that 49 percent of the American people  believe that this President is a racist. It hurts my heart because I  come in a skin color where I have been at the sad end of racist tactics  and words. I am a product of busing. But it does not diminish my love  for this Nation.   So it disturbs me for this wonderfully diverse group of new Members  who have come to the United States Congress from all over the Nation,  including the LGBTQ community, and among the 40 Representatives who  came was the Representative from the Seventh Congressional District of  Massachusetts, the State's first African American woman; the  Representative of the 13th Congressional District of Michigan, the  first Palestinian woman; the Representative from the 14th Congressional  District of New York, the youngest woman; and the Representative from  the Fifth Congressional District of Minnesota, the first Somali  American elected to Congress.   In the discharge of their duties, they went to the border--their  passion, their youth, just as I had done--and saw the appalling  conditions that children were held in. They came back and expressed  themselves, protected by the First Amendment.   They used no violence. They only wanted to wake up the Congress, as  all of us who went and could not accept the pain did. In fact, wherever  I go at home, people are asking: What are you doing for the children at  the border?   So, they didn't do anything extraordinary, in terms of what Members  should do, having the responsibility of oversight.   Then came, in the last 72 hours, these words: ``So interesting to see  `progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from  countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the  worst, most corrupt, and inept anywhere in the world, if they even have  a functioning government at all, now loudly and viciously  [[Page H5841]]  telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful  nation on Earth, how our government is to be run.''    ``Why don't they go back and help fix the totally  broken and crime-infested places from which they came?''   I will be introducing a condemnation resolution that recounts the  life and legacy of this President while 49 percent of the people  believe that he is racist.   I only ask that we come together today to do the right thing, to do  what the 16th President said right after the Civil War: ``We are not  enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have  strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords  of memory'' will swell when again touched, ``as surely they will be, by  the better angels of our nature.''   Today, if we condemn this language, it will say to America that we  cannot accept this kind of behavior. That is what is bringing the  country together, that we accept each other's diversity.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary  and Homeland Security, I rise in support of the rule governing debate  on H. Res. 489, a resolution condemning President Trump's racist  comments directed at Members of Congress.   Mr. Speaker, on November 6, 2018, in an election widely regarded as a  referendum on the performance and disapproval of the Administration of  President Donald J. Trump, the American people voted to vest control of  the U.S. House of Representatives in the Democratic Party to restore  the system of checks and balances designed by the Framers in 1787 in  Philadelphia.   The Representatives elected to the 116th Congress comprise the most  diverse class in American history with respect to its racial, ethnic,  and religious composition, and also includes the largest contingent of  female Representatives and the most members ever of the LGBTQ  community.   Among the cohort of the 40 Representatives first elected to the  Congress in the November 2018 election are several whose membership is  historic, including the Representative for the Seventh District of  Massachusetts, the first African American woman elected from the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts; the Representative from the Thirteenth  District of Michigan, the first Palestinian-American woman elected to  Congress; the Representative from the Fourteenth District of New York,  the youngest woman ever elected to Congress; and the Representative  from the Fifth District of Minnesota, the first Somali-American elected  to Congress.   In the discharge of their official duties as Members of Congress,  these talented and dedicated Members of Congress traveled to the  southern border of the United States to observe the living conditions  and treatment received by migrants and refugees seeking asylum in the  United States who are currently being held in detention facilities  operated under control or supervision of the U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), some consisting of nothing more than tent villages  cordoned off under highways.   Upon their return to the Capitol, these Members of Congress reported  their shock and horror regarding the appalling and inhumane conditions  to which detainees were being subjected by CPB at a public hearing of a  House Committee on Oversight and Reform.   On July 14, 2019, the President of the United States reacted to the  criticism of his Administration's treatment of detainees by these  Members of Congress in a series of unhinged tweets that questioned  their loyalty to the United States and implied that due to the  circumstances of their birth they had no right to exercise the  responsibilities and privileges of duly elected Members of Congress.   Specifically, the President tweeted that it was:         So interesting to see ``Progressive'' Democrat       Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose       governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst,       most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even       have a functioning government at all), now loudly . . . and       viciously telling the people of the United States, the       greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our       government is to be run. Why don't they go back and help fix       the totally broken and crime infested places from which they       came.    The President's statements are false in that three of Members of  Congress he impugned are in fact natural born citizens and the fourth  is a naturalized citizen.   Although the recent statements of the President are inaccurate and  offensive, they are consistent with prior statements he has made to  stoke to division, discord, and disharmony among the American people.   Let us not forget that the current President of the United States  burnished his political reputation by claiming falsely for more than 5  years that his predecessor was born in Kenya and not in the United  States and thus was an illegitimate President.   The current President of the United States launched his 2016 campaign  for the Presidency by saying of persons from Mexico seeking to  immigrate to the United States: ``They're bringing drugs. They're  bringing crime. They're rapists.''   The current President of the United States claimed that a Hispanic  federal jurist could not preside over a court proceeding to which then  presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization were  defendants accused of civil fraud because ``He's a Mexican!''   In January 2018 the current President of the United States is  reported to have inquired of his advisors: ``Why are we having all  these people from (expletive deleted) countries come here?'', referring  to persons from countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and Central and  South America.   And most contemptible of all, on August 15, 2017 the current  President of the United States said he regarded as some ``very fine  people,'' the neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and Ku Klux Klansmen who  descended on the peaceful community of Charlottesville, Virginia to  advocate racism and who were met by peaceful counterprotestors in a  clash that the white supremacists turned violent and resulted in the  death of Heather Heyer and left injured many other innocent persons who  were gathered to affirm the principles of the Declaration of  Independence and the U.S. Constitution, and to honor the sacrifice of  unsung American heroes who devoted their lives to the ongoing quest to  continue perfecting our union.   Mr. Speaker, the recent and past statements and actions of the  current President of the United States demean the office he holds and  falls short of the standard set by the 16th President, whose  administration was devoted to unity, healing, and ending racial  division.   In his famous March 4, 1861, Inaugural Address, President Abraham  Lincoln foretold the reasons why the efforts of the current President  of the United States to rend our union are destined to fail:         We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.       Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds       of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when       again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels       of our nature.    Before closing, Mr. Speaker, I think it appropriate to share my  perspective on immigration and significant and positive impact it has  in the development of this, the greatest nation in human history.   Like the Framers did in the summer of 1776, it is fitting that we  gather in the nation's capital on a sweltering July day to reflect upon  America's long and continuing struggle for justice, equality, and  opportunity.   After all, all that any of us wants is an honored place in the  American family.   I am often reminded that as I speak there is a family somewhere about  to begin a dangerous but hopeful quest.   Somewhere south of the border, maybe across the Rio Grande from El  Paso, Laredo, Corpus Christi, or Brownsville or maybe just south of  Tucson or San Diego or Douglass, Arizona.   Somewhere there is a family in the Old Country anxiously about to  embark on their own journey to the New World of America.   They come for the same reason so many millions came before them, in  this century and last, from this continent and from every other.   They come for the same reason families have always come to America:  to be free of fear and hunger, to better their condition, to begin  their world anew, to give their children a chance for a better life.   Like previous waves of immigrants, they too will wage all and risk  all to reach the sidewalks of Houston or Los Angeles or Phoenix or  Chicago or Atlanta or Denver or Detroit.   They will risk death in the desert; they will brave the elements,  they will risk capture and crime, they will endure separation from  loved ones.   And if they make it to the Promised Land of America, no job will be  beneath them.   They will cook our food, clean our houses, cut our grass, and care  for our kids.   They will be cheated by some and exploited by others.   They work in sunlight but live in twilight, between the shadows; not  fully welcome as new Americans but wanted as low-wage workers.   Somewhere near the borders tonight, a family will cross over into the  New World, willed by the enduring power of the American Dream.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting H. Res. 489.   All American should take pride in and celebrate the ethnic, racial,  and religious diversity  [[Page H5842]]  that has made the United States the leader of the community of nations  and the beacon of hope and inspiration to oppressed persons everywhere.   And in addition to the love and pride Americans justifiably have for  their country, all persons in the United States should cherish and  exercise the rights, privileges, and responsibilities guaranteed by the  Constitution of the United States.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that my faith, my  commitment to many people of different colors who respect the  distinction or difference but also the greatness of this country, my  love of those who serve, causes me to say, as many of my colleagues  here are ready to say: Let us sit down at the table of peace and  reconciliation.   I hope we will have some who will acknowledge that these actions--I  will try to be generic--and words were certainly not becoming of the  United States of America. The American people must see us work together  on that.    Mr. Speaker, I said earlier today that I wish we  were not here, but we are here. Now, I wish to indicate that I am  appalled at any commentary that demeans or hurts a fellow human being  or a fellow American or fellow world citizen. So the recounting of  various statements, I realize and recognize that comments were made  about statements to ease the pain of those who were receiving it.   Right now, we are talking about comments that came from the highest  office in the land, which really does reflect what this little book,  the Constitution, says, that this Nation was organized to create a more  perfect union. Yet, unfortunately, the officer in the White House, the  President of the United States, took to tweeting and talked about the  first African American woman from the Seventh District, the first  Palestinian American woman, the youngest woman elected to Congress, and  the first Somali American woman, women of color.   It is imperative today that, along with H. Res. 494, my resolution,  we condemn this action, and we do it together. I ask my Republican  colleagues to vote for the underlying resolution.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary  and Homeland Security, I rise in support of H. Res. 489, a resolution  condemning President Trump's racist comments directed at Members of  Congress.

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Bass), who is a distinguished member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from  California an additional 15 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Jeffries), who is the distinguished Democratic chair  of the Democratic Caucus of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell).    The gentleman from California has 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Washington State (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the way to move forward is by voting ``yes'' on the  underlying resolution.   To paraphrase the Declaration of Independence, it is indicated that  we all are created equal, with certain unalienable rights of life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   That is immigrant and nonimmigrant. That is an individual whose  religion you believe in and one you do not. That is a lifestyle that  you may not know and understand. It may be a race or ethnicity that you  have never come to be able to accept.   In this Nation, the founding Thirteen Colonies fleeing persecution  were described as creating an experiment. It was not a perfect  experiment.   There were some of us who came to this Nation in the bottom of the  belly of a slave boat. There were some who were indentured servants.  Many came by boat. Some walked across a border that has created havoc.  But they were people desperate for freedom and the right to make their  lives better.   We can account for those people by the history books and the decades  of heroes and sheroes who have come in a different skin, a different  religion, a different basis. They have even put on the uniform of this  Nation because they love this country.   I am reminded of the era of Dr. Martin Luther King, the many miles he  walked with the soldiers, the Civil Rights soldiers, and his early book  titled ``Why We Can't Wait.''   I join with the idea that we must work for the American people. We  must provide for the increase in the minimum wage, good healthcare, and  education.   At the same time, there is something in this Nation that our children  demand that we do. What are the values of the red, white, and blue?  What are the values of those stars that represent the many States of  this Nation? The values are that we are a Nation based upon laws,  morality, values, a love of country, due process, equality, and  justice. It means that every single person must have the fundamental  right of respect.   This resolution is simply that. It is a fundamental right to respect  and dignity--in this instance, for four Members of the United States  Congress from Boston, from New York, from Minnesota, and from Michigan.   As they go on to their places, it is very clear that they must have  the respect that is deserving of this particular Congress.   These four women are no less deserving of dignity than anyone else.  This resolution is simply one that is to seek--not condoning, as was  said--a condemnation of attitudes that may parlay racist beliefs.    No one stands for that. We cannot go on to all that is good without  saying to the Nation and the world that this is not good; it is not  America; and we will not accept that as our definition because we do  believe in the creation of a more perfect Union.   I conclude by saying that we condemn the hurtful and offensive  comments that demean immigrants and people of color, especially if  those comments originate from the White House. What we will do today is  accept the challenge of Dr. Martin Luther King, a peacemaker, a man of  hope, and we will say why we can't wait because the Nation calls upon  our higher angels.   That is what we will do when we affirm this resolution on behalf of  the people of the United States of America.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for this very important  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 240,  noes 187, not voting 6, as follows:                               [Roll No. 482]                                 AYES--240       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Amash      Axne      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Boyle, Brendan F.
