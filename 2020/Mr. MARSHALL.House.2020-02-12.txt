 Mr. Speaker, growing up on our family farm in rural  Kansas, one thing was for sure: Every day at about 12:20, over the  lunch hour, and then again at about 10:20 at night, our family would be  gathered around the television set to watch the latest weather forecast  for the upcoming day.   From aviation to agriculture, accurate and timely weather forecasts  are essential to a number of industries across the United States, and  especially to farmers and ranchers back home in Kansas.   150 years ago, on February 9, 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant signed  into law a joint resolution creating what was known as the Signal  Service, laying the foundation for what would become today's National  Weather Service.   While the organization has evolved over the years, the National  Weather Service provides important weather data, forecasting, and  warnings aimed at protecting life and property across the United  States.   There are four National Weather Service offices across Kansas working  to analyze data and provide timely weather information. They are  located in Topeka, Dodge, Wichita, and Goodland, and I have had the  opportunity to visit several of these locations and the fine ladies and  gentlemen that run those stations.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say happy 150th birthday to the National  Weather Service and to say thank you for the around-the-clock work they  do to keep us all safe and informed.                               Surprise Billing     Mr. Speaker, if you or a loved one has ever experienced  a medical emergency, you know how stressful these situations can be;  but for far too many, the stress and heartache does not end when help  arrives or treatment is delivered.   Nearly one in four Kansans seeking medical treatment either through  planned surgery or emergency medical care are hit with a surprise bill  because the care they received was from a provider outside of their  network. In Kansas, this can happen after a trip to the emergency room  for, say, a child's broken arm, a motor vehicle accident, or chest  pain.   Surprise billing may occur when a patient receives emergency care  from a professional outside of their insurance network. Unfortunately,  surprise billing can also occur in nonemergency situations where a  surgery is planned out well in advance, but you later find out one of  the doctors or services was not in your plan's network.   These unplanned expenses can leave Kansans on the hook for  thousands--if not tens of thousands--of dollars in additional medical  bills, often depleting  [[Page H1055]]  family savings or forcing individuals into long-term debt and even  bankruptcy.   The nightmare of unplanned medical billing has gone on far too long.  Working alongside the White House and President Trump's leadership and  my fellow members of the House Doc Caucus, I am proud of the solutions  we have developed that would put an end to the unfair practice of  surprise billing.   I am encouraged by the widespread agreement in Congress to address  the issue and am optimistic we can agree to commonsense policies that  President Trump is eager to sign into law.   We should all be able to agree on sensible reforms that address  surprise billing. Specifically, patients should always be protected  from surprise medical bills when receiving emergency or nonemergency  care. Patients should only pay in-network rates for emergency care, and  claims should be settled between healthcare providers and the insurer  without roping in the patient.   In the 21st century, we should expect that consumers have a right to  accurate, transparent information about providers and their network  with real and honest cost estimates before they make healthcare  decisions.   When referring a patient to another specialist as a physician myself,  I always told my patients to check their health plan's provider  directory, but also encouraged them to double-check with the  physician's office directly in case the information was not up to date.   This process can be confusing, time consuming, and unnecessary to  physicians' offices as well as the patients, and it is my priority to  fix it. These solutions have been more than a year in the making, and I  am optimistic we are very close to accomplishing our shared goal of  lowering the cost of healthcare and ending surprise billing once and  for all.                         Recognizing Stephanie Sigler     Mr. Speaker, later today, a Kansan from my district  will be honored at the Next Generation 911 Institute's Annual 911 Honor  Award Showcase to recognize emergency response heroes and leaders from  across the country for their excellence in emergency response.   Stephanie Sigler works as a 911 phone operator for the Rice County  Emergency Communications Center in Lyons, Kansas, and will be honored  as a 911 public safety professional for her superior response efforts  on the job.   In April of last year, Stephanie received a 911 phone call reporting  the shooting of a Rice County sheriff and undersheriff, which led to an  hours-long standoff involving numerous law enforcement agencies. Thanks  to the swift and professional job done by Stephanie, many lives were  spared.   Hundreds of millions of 911 callers, every year, rely on the  dedication and cooperation of our public safety professionals like  Stephanie. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize Stephanie Sigler for  dedicating herself to help Kansans in need.   I would like to also recognize Rice County Sheriff Bryant Evans and  Undersheriff Chad Murphy, who were wounded in the shooting, as well as  those who were heroically responding during this situation.                            ____________________
