 I include in the Record a letter from the  American Medical Association that states: ``Not only would the AHCA  eliminate health insurance coverage for millions of Americans, the  legislation would, in many cases, eliminate the ban against charging  those with underlying medical conditions vastly more for their  coverage.''  [[Page H4157]]                 [From the American Medical Association, May 3, 2017]  AMA Warns that Proposed Changes to the American Health Care Act Do Not                         Remedy Bill's Shortcomings     Despite Amendments to bill, millions of Americans would still lose                         health insurance coverage         Chicago--American Medical Association (AMA) President       Andrew W. Gurman, M.D., issued the following statement today       about proposed changes to the American Health Care Act       (AHCA):        ``None of the legislative tweaks under consideration       changes the serious harm to patients and the health care       delivery system if AHCA passes. Proposed changes to the bill       tinker at the edges without remedying the fundamental failing       of the bill--that millions of Americans will lose their       health insurance as a direct result of this proposal.        ``High-risk pools are not a new idea. Prior to the       enactment of the Affordable Care Act, 35 states operated       high-risk pools, and they were not a panacea for Americans       with pre-existing medical conditions. The history of high-      risk pools demonstrates that Americans with pre-existing       conditions will be stuck in second-class health care       coverage--if they are able to obtain coverage at all.        ``Not only would the AHCA eliminate health insurance       coverage for millions of Americans, the legislation would, in       many cases, eliminate the ban against charging those with       underlying medical conditions vastly more for their       coverage.''        ``America should not go backward to the time when our       fellow citizens with pre-existing health conditions faced       high costs for limited coverage, if they were able to obtain       coverage at all. The AMA urges congressional leaders and the       Administration to pursue a bipartisan dialogue on alternative       policies that provide patients with access and coverage to       high quality care and preserve the safety net for vulnerable       populations.''                        Background on high-risk pools         A January report from the American Academy of Actuaries       notes that ``enrollment has generally been low, coverage has       been limited and expensive, they require external funding,       and they have typically operated at a loss . . . Removing       high-risk individuals from the insured risk pools reduces       costs in the private market only temporarily. Over time, even       lower-cost individuals in the individual market can incur       high health care costs, which would put upward pressure on       premiums.''        According to the Kaiser Family Foundation: State high-risk       pools featured premiums above standard non-group market       rates--with most states capping them at 150%-200% of standard       rates. Many also featured high deductibles, some $5,000 or       more.        Despite the fact that many individuals were forced into       high-risk pools because of a pre-existing condition, nearly       all states excluded coverage for these conditions for 6-12       months.        Almost all high-risk pools imposed lifetime limits on       covered services, and some imposed annual limits.        Some states capped or closed enrollment.        Combined net losses for the state high-risk pools totaled       more than $1.2 billion for 2011, or $5,510 per enrollee, on       average.        Furthermore, a 2010 paper by James Capretta and Tom Miller       that appeared in National Affairs estimated that the cost of       adequately funded high risk pools would be $15 billion to $20       billion per year.     Mr. Speaker, the country will not remember what  we say here today, but it will never forget what we do today,  especially if we make the wrong choice and adopt this bill.   The 159 million Americans whose employer-sponsored health care could  be cut would never forget. Neither would the 24 million Americans who  would lose their coverage or the 52 million people with preexisting  conditions who would struggle to find health insurance again.   If this bill passes, Mr. Speaker, no cancer survivor denied coverage  will forget, no survivor of sexual assault charged more for her ordeal  will forget, and no parent struggling to afford emergency surgery for a  newborn child could ever forget. They would not have that choice.   But today, we have one. We can choose to vote no and prevent millions  of Americans from losing their health care. We can choose the right  path rooted in morality, decency, and reason. I implore you, vote  ``no.''
