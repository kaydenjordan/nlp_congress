 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Teacher Appreciation Week  to honor the educators in my district, who work tirelessly on behalf of  our students.   The public schools in the Third District of Kansas are some of the  best in our Nation, and our workforce of qualified, dedicated teachers  are a major factor in making our schools so great. As a product of  public schools myself, I know the kind of impact teachers can have on  the lives of their students. Good teachers are a key to setting our  kids and our communities up for a successful future.   I am working hard to give teachers the tools and resources they need  to do to their jobs well. I fought to protect the educator expense  deduction in tax reform, affirming that our Tax Code should support and  reward our teachers. I also supported the recent omnibus funding bill,  which included a $2 billion investment in continuing education and  workforce development grants for teachers.   Mr. Speaker, none of us would have the opportunities we have in life  without the teachers who gave us the tools and skills to succeed, and  we pay special recognition to each of the teachers who made a  difference in our lives, and who continue to make a difference in the  lives of kids in our districts this week during Teacher Appreciation  Week.                            ____________________
