 Mr. President, today I wish to honor and pay  tribute to Gerald Boschwitz, who passed away on December 30, 2018.   Gerry's life was defined by his enduring kindness and commitment to  his family. The son of Ellen and former U.S. Senator Rudy Boschwitz,  Gerry came from a family that valued service and decency. During his  life, he embodied these values and passed them on to his children as  well.   I went to Wayzata High School with Gerry. An accomplished student, he  then attended Carleton College where he studied political science, a  subject for which his family life prepared him very well.   Gerry, or ``the Gerb'' as he was known to his family, was the first  of Rudy and Ellen's four sons and the leader of his pack. Gerry was a  quintessential oldest son and big brother, serving as both a mentor and  a sounding board for those he loved. Whether it was helping his father  on the campaign trail, or his brothers make career decisions, Gerry  always showed up, ready to give his support.   Gerry also worked alongside his siblings at the family's Plywood  Minnesota/Home Valu Interiors business for 25 years, stepping in as CEO  when his father was ready to pass the torch. He later cofounded a  business of his own.   His commitment to his work often made him the first one up in the  morning and out the door, but that didn't stop him from putting his  family first, including leaving voicemails for his wife Janet at her  work so that his voice was the first she would hear in the morning.   Gerry's family--his wife Janet and their sons David, Benjamin, and  Michael--was truly the centerpiece of his life. Gerry was deeply  committed to the Boy Scouts and served as an assistant scoutmaster for  more than a decade. The Scouts played an important role in the lives of  his sons as well--all three Eagle Scouts--something Gerry was very  proud of.   Gerry fought valiantly against his multiple myeloma cancer for 4\1/2\  years, undergoing numerous treatments including a stem cell transplant  and a natural killer cell transplant. In keeping with the kindness and  generosity that defined so much of his life, Gerry's final gift to  others was the knowledge researchers will gain from his experience.   That final act is no surprise to those who knew him best.   May his memory be a blessing.   Thank you.                            ____________________
