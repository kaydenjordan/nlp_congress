 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.  Laura Anderson, who retired from her broadcasting post with WTKS in  Savannah on September 6.   Originally from South Carolina, Ms. Anderson came to the First  Congressional District of Georgia after her college graduation for  love, life, and work.   For life, it was our large green spaces and easygoing people in our  area. The love portion included her marriage and becoming a mother. But  her work is what nearly everyone in Savannah has woken up to for the  past 21 years.   Ms. Anderson hosted the Savannah News Now radio program on WTKS,  along with her morning costar, Mr. Bill Edwards. With high-quality  news, the program has become one of the most trusted in the Savannah  area, interviewing countless community leaders, and giving commuters  important daily updates.   Now, she is leaving the air to spend more time with her family.   Madam Speaker, I wish Laura the best of luck in her future endeavors.  Laura will be missed on the air every morning.                            ____________________
