 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Brendan Hurson to the U.S. District Court for the District of  Maryland.   Born in Washington, DC, Judge Hurson received his B.A. from  Providence College and his J.D. from the University of Maryland Carey  School of Law. After clerking for Judge Margaret B. Seymour of the U.S.  District Court for the District of South Carolina, Judge Hurson began  his legal career at Schulman, Hershfield, and Gilden, PA as an  associate, where he worked on a variety of civil and criminal  litigation matters on behalf of individuals, small businesses, and  small to mid-size corporations. He then went on to work as an assistant  Federal public defender in both Maryland and the U.S. Virgin Islands,  where he appeared in court routinely, litigated substantive motions in  close to 40 Federal cases, and tried 18 cases to verdict. In February  2022, Judge Hurson was appointed to serve as a U.S. magistrate judge  for the same district to which he is nominated. In his time on the  bench, he has written approximately 77 opinions.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Hurson ``well  qualified'' to serve on the district court, and he has the strong  support of Senators Cardin and Van Hollen.   Judge Hurson's deep ties to the Maryland legal community, combined  with his significant courtroom experience, make him an excellent  addition to the Federal bench.   I thank my colleagues for supporting his nomination.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Susan DeClercq to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  Michigan.   Born in Seoul, South Korea, Ms. DeClercq received her B.A. from the  University of Michigan and her J.D. from Wayne State University School  of Law. After clerking for Judge Avern L. Cohn of the U.S. District  Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Ms. DeClercq worked at  Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meager & Flom, LLP as an associate, where she  worked on a variety of matters, including white collar defense and  commercial litigation. During her tenure at Skadden, she coauthored an  amicus brief on behalf of Members of Congress in the 2003 Supreme Court  case Grutter v. Bollinger, which considered the use of affirmative  action policies in college admissions. She then went on to serve as a  Federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern  District of Michigan for 18 years, where she led substantial  investigations and handled hundreds of cases at every stage of  litigation, from inception to post-judgment.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Ms. DeClercq  ``qualified'' to serve on the district court, and she has the strong  support of Senators Stabenow and Peters.   With more than two decades of litigation experience--the vast  majority of which has been in government service--Ms. DeClercq is well  positioned to handle the demands of the Eastern District of Michigan  from day one.   I thank my colleagues for supporting her nomination.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, yesterday, the Republican leader of the  Senate came to the floor to give a speech relative to the issue of  crime in America, and he was fairly specific as he outlined examples of  violent crimes that were taking place across the Nation. He, of course,  included in his litany the city of Chicago, talking about the car  thefts that were occurring in that city and other felonious assaults in  New York City and the like.   He concluded his remarks--the Republican Senate leader did--by  saying:         American families deserve to feel safe in their homes and       in their neighborhoods and  [[Page S4930]]       certainly in the Nation's Capital. It shouldn't take another       assault, carjacking, or homicide to convince local leftwing       leaders to start actually doing their jobs.    I come to the floor to discuss doing your job and reducing crime in  America. I come here once again to discuss the Senate's need to quickly  confirm two pending U.S. attorney nominees: Rebecca Lutzko, to the  Northern District of Ohio, and April Perry, to the Northern District of  Illinois.   I have come to the floor three times in the past 2 weeks to request  unanimous consent for the Senate to take up and confirm these pending  U.S. attorney nominees who are being stopped by one junior Senator from  Ohio.   Keep in mind that both of these nominees, for the State of Ohio and  for the State of Illinois, have gone through extensive vetting and  extensive efforts to determine whether or not they were prepared and  qualified for the job--and it is a big job. They would be the leading  U.S. criminal prosecutors in their area and have responsibilities that  we know are substantial.   Each time I have come to the floor to ask to give the opportunity to  these two young people to lead the U.S. Attorney's Office, Senator  Vance of Ohio has come up with a different explanation of why he is  blocking their confirmation. It appears that he is not certain in his  own mind as to the issue on a daily basis.   As I stated last week, for almost 50 years, the Senate has confirmed  U.S. attorney nominees, from both political parties, by either a voice  vote or unanimous consent after they have been reported by the  Judiciary Committee.   Just look back to the previous Trump administration. In the 115th and  116th Congress, 85 of President Trump's U.S. nominees moved through the  Judiciary Committee, and Senate Democrats allowed all 85--every single  one of them--to be confirmed by a voice vote or by unanimous consent.   Why would we automatically give to a President of the United States  their U.S. attorneys, their representatives of the Department of  Justice and the Nation? Because we understand the critical role that  U.S. attorneys play in our justice system.   Just take a look at the law, title 28 of the U.S. Code, section 547.  It states that ``each United States attorney, within his district,  shall prosecute for all offenses against the United States of  America.''   Leader McConnell regularly comes to the floor to assert that  Republicans are really tougher on crime than Democrats. The obstacles  that Senate Republicans have created to confirming Federal prosecutors,  and especially Senator Vance's actions over the last 2 weeks, show what  an empty argument that is.   Senate Republicans are literally moving the goalposts in the Senate  and blocking the confirmation of law enforcement officers who lead our  Nation's efforts to prosecute violent crime and protect our communities  from drug traffickers, gun violence, terrorism, and so many other  crimes.   Is it important in the State of Ohio, where the junior Senator hails  from, as it is important in Illinois, to deal with fentanyl deaths? It  most certainly is. We understand that thousands of Americans are dying  each year because of this deadly narcotic.   Who is fighting them? Leading the fight is our Federal Government and  the Department of Justice. We are dealing with an international drug  cartel hailing out of Mexico. We are dealing with an effort to take  over drug and narcotics control of the United States, Europe, and  beyond. Certainly, we need more than local law enforcement to deal with  it.   So whom do we put on the case? The Department of Justice. Why is that  important? It is important because we need to have the men and women  serving in that Department of Justice who are doing this job every  single day.   Earlier this year, the Senator from Ohio explained why he is doing  this, why he is stopping the appointment of well-qualified and vetted  criminal prosecutors in the Department of Justice. Here is what he  said:         I will hold all Department of Justice nominations . . . we       will grind the Justice Department to a halt.    ``Grind the Justice Department to a halt''--really? Is that what you  want to leave as your legacy in the U.S. Senate, that somehow you  managed to diminish the Department of Justice's effort to keep America  safe, to keep neighborhoods safe, to stop the spread of narcotics? Is  that something you brag about back home? I don't think so.   The average American hopes and prays that someone in Washington is  working late at night, lights on, trying to make sure that there is  less crime in America. They trust us to do our jobs, and one of them is  to make sure the Department of Justice has the men and women they need  to be led properly and to be effective.   The junior Senator from Ohio campaigned for this job in Congress, in  the U.S. Senate, on the fact that he was tough on crime. He said:         Americans deserve safety. They won't get it if politicians       . . . keep attacking police officers instead of violent       criminals.    I would think he would recognize that U.S. attorneys are too  important to be used as political footballs to make some headline or  make some tweet, or whatever it happens to be. I would think he would  recognize that he is blocking highly qualified nominees who have  significant experience as Federal prosecutors and who have  qualifications and leadership abilities to serve with distinction.   According to the junior Senator from Ohio, the Justice Department has  been ``weaponized''--a favorite word of the right--simply because  former President Trump has been indicted for multiple felonies. So this  is retribution. In order to punish the Department of Justice for any  part of it--prosecuting or indicting the former President--the Senator  from Ohio wants to stop prosecutors--criminal prosecutors--from going  to work in Chicago and Cleveland.   What is he going to do about the pending case in New York? There has  to be a way for him to stop the Department of Justice, the work by the  State of New York, the work by their attorney general. The former  President is being sued--I can use the term ``prosecuted,'' but sued-- in court for his business dealings in New York, and he has a case  pending in Georgia. What is the junior Senator in Ohio going to do to  punish Georgia for having the temerity of indicting the former  President as well?   There is simply no basis in reason, fact, or law for what he is  doing. The Justice Department under the Biden administration has made a  point of demonstrating its independence, focusing on investigating and  prosecuting criminal activity, regardless of an individual's political  affiliation.   Attorney General Merrick Garland has even appointed special counsels  to handle the investigations of the current President and the former  President to ensure their independence.   Last week, Senator Vance came to the Senate floor and stated:         [M]y objection is not specific to the qualifications of the       particular individuals that have been nominated.    He explicitly said this in reference to both these nominees. So he is  not questioning whether they are qualified for the job; he is just  angry because the former President has been indicted by the Department  of Justice.   In response, I offered the junior Senator from Ohio the opportunity  to end his obstruction and to keep his promise to support law  enforcement by allowing us to schedule confirmation votes on four  pending U.S. attorneys--exactly what he said in the Congressional  Record he wanted. He agreed to it. He released his objection to all  four nominees on the condition that we hold rollcall votes on them. He  did this publicly in the Congressional Record and privately. He had  said that while he couldn't speak for his colleagues in the Senate who  may object to some on the floor, he would no longer object.   Last week, we held votes on two of those U.S. attorney nominees. But  then Senator Vance changed his mind again. Overnight, he decided he  actually does object to even holding a confirmation vote on the two  nominees--Rebecca Lutzko to be the U.S. attorney in Cleveland, OH, and  April Perry to be the U.S. attorney in Chicago, IL.   Over the last few weeks, Senator Vance offered explanation after  explanation on why he is doing exactly what he promised not to do when  he ran for office. He promised he would ``fight the criminals--not the  cops.'' He has introduced a resolution in the Senate that calls on  ``all levels of government to  [[Page S4931]]  ensure that law enforcement officers receive the support and resources  needed to keep all communities in the United States safe.''   Now he has the chance to support law enforcement. Instead, he comes  to the Senate floor three times to undermine the U.S. Attorney's  Office--even one in his own State that he represents here in the  Senate. These are officers responsible for prosecuting drug cartels,  sex traffickers, and other violent criminals.   Senator Vance himself has said that Americans will not be safe if  politicians keep attacking our law enforcement officers. I fear he is  proving that as right.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of the following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 314  and 315; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without  intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Can you imagine what the family in Chicago who is  concerned about narcotics and fentanyl deaths in their neighborhood  thinks about this argument that somehow there is a grievance and people  are mad about some of the things done by the Department of Justice?   Trust me, under the previous administration as well as this  administration, as an attorney and a Senator, I can find things to  object to. But to deny to the city of Cleveland and the Northern  District of Ohio a U.S. attorney to lead their office to stop sex  trafficking--that is a political statement this Senator believes is  appropriate, that he is going to stop a nomination for someone to move  into the U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago and lead the effort to stop  the narcotics in our community or the trafficking of thousands and  thousands and thousands of guns each year from neighboring States, and  he is going to hold up that person because he objects to the way they  treated former President Trump? For goodness' sake, that is what is  wrong with this country, and that is what is wrong with this Senate.    When one Senator can stop the appointment of a well-qualified  individual with no questions asked about her ability to handle the job,  either in Cleveland or in Chicago, and to do that because he has a  political grievance--I hope I never get to that point, and I hope other  Members of the Senate will think twice.   We need to function as a government that is effective and provides  safety for the people we are sent here to represent. Having this snit  over some political grievance and holding up the effective appointment  of prosecutors to do their job is inappropriate.   I will continue to come to the floor and plead the case for safety in  the neighborhoods.   Before anyone else decides to come to the floor in the future on the  Republican side and criticize crime in the city of Chicago, for  goodness' sake, try to explain to the Senator from Ohio that there is a  connection between criminal prosecution and crime.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S4932]]     I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez) is necessarily absent.
