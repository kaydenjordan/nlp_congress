 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the Black  Americans who were assaulted, terrorized, and killed during the Jim  Crow era.   Our Nation has a long and troubling history of failing to deliver  justice for victims of racially motivated violence. One could draw a  direct line from the lynching of Emmett Till in 1955 to the killing of  Trayvon Martin just 10 years ago. In neither case were the killers  convicted.   Willie James Howard, Lamar Smith, and Reverend George W. Lee are but  a few of the countless Black Americans who were killed for the crime of  existing while Black in the Jim Crow South. In not one of these cases  was a single perpetrator brought to justice.   I am proud of the students from Hightstown, New Jersey, in my  district, who took time to write the Civil Rights Cold Case Records  Collection Act with my friend, Congressman   Bobby Rush. I am now  calling on this Chamber to pass the Civil Rights Cold Case  Investigation Support Act, which will extend authorization of that  legislation.   By passing this bipartisan bill, we can begin to heal the wounds of  our past and demonstrate that racist violence has no place in America.
