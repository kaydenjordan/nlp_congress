 Mr. President, I first thank Senator McCain and  Senator Reed for their leadership, a model of bipartisanship at this  incredibly important time with the rest of the world and the need to  have a strong military. We know that. I think that is why we see this  bill proceeding, but this bill will be so much stronger if we make sure  that we not only defend our shores and stand by our troops but if we  also defend the security of our democracy.   I so appreciate Senator McCain and Senator Reed supporting this  amendment I have with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. This  must be included in this bill. We are having a situation where one or  two Members on the other side of the aisle are not allowing it to  proceed. The timing is critical. The 2018 election is only 400-some  days away, which is why you see us pushing this bill and doing  everything we can to get it either included in the managers' package or  to get a vote.   This amendment is supported by the Freedom Caucus, and in the House  is led by the head of the Freedom Caucus. You may ask why. There are a  lot of Republicans who would like to see States be able to keep running  their own elections. I agree with that. I like the fact that we have  decentralized elections, but the hacking was so real in this last  election that our intelligence agencies have now established there were  21 States where there were attempts made to hack into their election  software. We know this is going to happen again, and we must stand  ready. We must protect our democracy.   Instead of having a successful hack attack in this next election, why  don't we prepare ourselves so we can keep the decentralized nature of  our elections? That is why we see such broad support for this  amendment.   I came to the floor yesterday to fight for a vote--a simple up-or- down vote--on the bipartisan Klobuchar-Graham amendment. I also thank  Senator Lankford of Oklahoma, as well as Senator Harris of California,  for their bipartisan work and support for this amendment. This  amendment has support, but one or two Members are blocking it--an  amendment which has the support of the chairman and ranking member of  the Armed Services Committee because they understand that election  security is national security.   This provision simply says that it is the policy of the United States  to defend against and respond to cyber attacks on our democratic  system. You  [[Page S5714]]  have to have your head in the sand if you don't know that this has been  a problem, whether you are in business and have had information stolen,  whether you are someone who has been scammed or have had stuff sent to  you on your email, or whether you are a voter who is concerned simply  that when you are exercising your freedom to vote, someone is going to  come in and steal your own private information or--worse yet--change  what you did and change the result of an election.   In the words of Bruce Fein, a former Reagan official, ``Passing the  Klobuchar-Graham amendment is imperative because public confidence in  the reliability of elections is a cornerstone of national security.''   I am stunned we weren't simply able to include this amendment. I  still have hope that we can. I am here to fight for this amendment so  vigorously today because we need to get this done now. We need to get  the authorization done now so we can start the process of putting  grants out to States so they can upgrade their election equipment, have  backup paper ballots, and simply employ the best practices that we  believe we need to protect ourselves from the perpetrators in Russia or  in any other foreign entity.   We need to make sure our election equipment in every big city and in  every small town in America, in every county is as sophisticated as the  bad guys who are trying to break into it. That is all this is about. I  don't think anyone can go home to their constituents and say they  blocked this. How on Earth can we pass a bill which authorizes billions  of dollars in spending and refuses to simply authorize a relatively  smaller amount of money to upgrade our election equipment?   Predictions are that this would cost about the same amount of money  we spend on military bands every year--bands--music bands. I love  military bands. There is nothing I like better, and I want to keep our  military bands strong, but all Senator Graham and I are saying is, I  think maybe the protection of our entire election--guaranteeing the  freedom of Americans to pick the candidate they choose, whether  Republican or Democratic or Independent--is just as important as the  music they hear celebrating our democracy. You can't have music  celebrating our democracy if you don't have a fair democracy.   U.S. national securities have been sounding the alarm that our voting  systems will continue to be a target in the future. The idea that we  would pass the Defense authorization bill and not address this threat  is mind-boggling. It is literally congressional malpractice.   According to the Department of Homeland Security, now run by the  Trump administration, Russian hackers attempted to hack at least 21  States' election systems in 2016. Earlier this year, we also learned  that Russia launched cyber attacks against a U.S. voting software  company and the emails of more than 100 local election officials.   The former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, recently  testified that Russia will continue to interfere in our political  system. This is what he said:         I believe Russia is now emboldened to continue such       activities in the future both here and around the world, and       to do so even more intensely. If there has ever been a       clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the       very foundation of our democratic political system, this       episode is it.    Vigilance, that is what we need right now. This is not about one  party or the other. I think Senator Rubio said it best when he said,  well, one election it might affect one party and one candidate; the  next election, it is going to affect the other. No one has any idea,  when you are dealing with outside foreign entities that are trying to  interfere with our democracy and trying to bring down our democracy in  the eyes of the world--you don't know who they are going to affect. You  just know they are trying to do it. So what do we do? We put in the  necessary money in the Defense Authorization Act, an authorization for  that to stop this from happening.   In order to safeguard future elections, State and local officials  must have the tools and resources they need to prevent hacks and  safeguard election infrastructure. They don't need those resources in 2  years. They don't need us debating this for 3 years. They need these  resources now. Ask the secretaries of States--Democratic and  Republican--who are supporting this bill all over the country, ask the  local election officials, and they will tell you they need it now.   The next Federal election in 2018 is just 419 days away. As we know,  it takes time for them to plan, it takes time for them to get the right  equipment, and it takes time for them to get the information from cyber  experts to make sure whether their systems are secure.   Experts agree that if we want to improve cyber security ahead of the  2018 election, we must act now. That is why I am fighting so hard for  this amendment. I don't think we can just wait around and see if there  is another bill we can attach it to next summer. No, that will not  work. In order to protect our election systems, we need to do three  things.   First, we must bring State and local election officials, cyber  security experts, and national security personnel together to provide  guidance on how States can best protect themselves. These  recommendations should be easily accessible so every information  officer and election official in every small town can access them. As  we know, a lot of the States themselves still don't have full  information about the hacking in the 21 States. That is a problem.   Many State officials I have talked to say they are still in the dark  about threats to their election systems. That can't continue. We need  our national security officials to be sharing information about the  potential for attacks--not the day before the election, when they can't  do anything, when they have a system that doesn't have paper ballot  backups. No, they need that information now, and we need to help them  not just get that information but make the changes they need. This  means creating a framework for information sharing, which acts as an  alarm system against cyber intruders. Our amendment would simply  establish that alarm system.   Second, the Federal Government must provide States with the resources  to implement the best practices developed by States and cyber security  experts. A meaningful effort to protect our election systems will  require those resources. As I mentioned before, predictions are that it  is about the same amount of money that we spend every year on military  bands. I think that is a bargain when you are looking to protect our  democracy.    I think most Americans would agree with me--Republicans or Democrats,  which is why there is such widespread support for this amendment--when  I say that protecting our democracy from foreign cyber attacks and  letting Americans have the freedom to decide who they want to elect,  instead of someone in Russia, are probably money well spent.   Finally, we need better auditing of our elections. That means voter- verified paper ballot backup systems in every State. That is  fundamental to protecting our elections and improving public confidence  in the reliability of elections. Our amendment would accelerate the  move to paper ballots by providing States with the resources they need  to get there. The vast majority of our States simply don't have that  system in place.   In short, our amendment would help States block cyber attacks, secure  voter registration logs and voter data so that people don't get their  addresses in the hands of a foreign government--or maybe even the data  on whom they voted for or what party they belong to--upgrade auditing  election procedures, and create secure and useful information sharing  about threats.   I am not alone in this fight. As I mentioned, Senators Graham,  Lankford, and Harris are also pushing for the Senate to do its job and  include this provision. Representative Meadows, the leader of the House  Freedom Caucus, and Democratic Congressman Jim Langevin have introduced  companion legislation in the House.   Again, why is the Freedom Caucus strongly behind this bill? They are  behind this bill because they want to preserve States' elections. They  want to preserve the rights of States to have their own elections, and  they are concerned enough because they have looked at the intelligence  reports and have seen that this next election could blow it all up.  [[Page S5715]]    Are we just going to look back at it then? People who are holding  this up, whose names will be revealed--are they then going to say  ``Oops, I guess we made a mistake''?   No, it is going to be on their hands. It is going to be on their  hands. This is the moment to do it.   I repeat: We need to get the authorization in place, so we can get  the grant money out to the States so that they can upgrade their  election equipment.   Dozens of former Republican national security officials are pushing  for the Senate to pass this amendment. They have written op-eds, called  their representatives, and worked to inform the public about the need  to take action now.   Michael Chertoff, who served as Secretary of Homeland Security under  President George W. Bush, published a piece this month in the Wall  Street Journal, calling on Congress to take action and pass the  Klobuchar-Graham amendment. He noted that our amendment would address  the cyber security challenge in a way that is ``fiscally responsible,  respectful of states' policy-making powers, and proactive in dealing  with the most pressing vulnerabilities.''   As I noted, Bruce Fein, a Reagan Department of Justice official,  said: ``The amendment would enormously strengthen defenses against  cyber-attacks that could compromise the integrity of elections in the  United States and undermine legitimacy of government.''   A bipartisan group of former national security officials sent a  letter to Senate leadership pushing for a vote on this amendment. They  noted that attacks on U.S. voting systems threatened the most basic  underpinnings of American self-government. These attacks are growing in  sophistication and scale.   As we all know, States administer elections. If you talk to the local  election officials--call any of them up--you will find that they are  adamant about protecting States' rights in this area.   We want to help them. A bipartisan group of 10 Secretaries of State  sent a letter urging the Senate to pass this amendment. They want this  amendment to pass because it would provide vital resources.   How do you truly expect someone in a town of 1,000 people to be up on  the latest cyber security attacks from some sophisticated hackers in a  warehouse in Russia? Really? I don't think so. That is why we want to  keep the decentralized nature of our elections. In some ways, one, we  like it; two, it gives us protection because it is not all in one  system. We know we have to realize that in these small towns and in  these rural areas, they are not going to have the updated,  sophisticated cyber security protection equipment unless we tell them  how they can do it and give them help to get there.   The National Association of Counties, a group that unites America's  3,069 counties, also endorses this amendment. Why? Because in our  country, most of our elections are run by county officials.   As I noted, our decentralized system is both a strength and a  weakness--a strength because we have multiple systems, so all of our  information isn't in one place. American elections are increasingly an  easy target because many local election systems are using election  technology that is completely outdated.   A survey of 274 election administrators in 28 States found that most  said their systems need upgrades. Forty-three States rely on electronic  voting or tabulation systems that are at least 10 years old. Whoa. Do  you think the Russians and those other foreign entities that want to  mess up with our democracy are not aware that this equipment is 10  years old? I am not telling them anything new right now. Of course they  are aware of it.   What are we doing? We are letting people in these small towns in  Alaska or in Iowa sit there and wait to see if it happens. Guess what.  If they get into one locality or if they get into one State, do you  think that doesn't undermine the integrity of our whole democracy in  our country? Of course it does.   Local election officials who are passionate about keeping the Federal  Government out of State elections support our amendment because it  strikes the balance that our Federal system demands when it comes to  the administration of elections.   As I said, despite the strong bipartisan support for this amendment-- the strong support and leadership of the Freedom Caucus--there are  Members of this body who are still blocking a vote. They happen not to  be on my side of the aisle, so I implore my friends the other side of  the aisle to figure this out and let this either be included in the  managers' package or come up for a vote where I know it would pass.   Republican and Democratic Senators support this amendment. Cyber  security experts support this amendment. Republican and Democratic  former national security officials support this amendment. State and  local officials support this amendment.   I ask you, why is this not included? We don't have an answer.  Actually, there is no good answer, except for a bunch of procedural  gobbledygook, which, of course, if it had gone through the regular  order and had been allowed a hearing--which it was not--then we would  have had a hearing. We were blocked from having a hearing. Now, as is  my right, I am bringing this before this body.   The integrity of our election system is the cornerstone of our  democracy. The freedom to choose our leaders and know with full  confidence those leaders were chosen in free and fair elections--that  is something Americans have fought and died for since our country was  founded.   Obstructing efforts to improve election security is an insult to  everyone who has fought for freedom and those who work every day to  protect our democracy. Members standing in the way of this bipartisan  amendment to protect our election infrastructure are literally  committing democracy malpractice.   Our attitude must be to roll up our sleeves to get this done. The  American people deserve nothing less.   I see my friend Senator McCain is on the floor. Again, I appreciate  his support and his and Senator Reed's work, not only on this bill but  their work to try to include this amendment in the package.   I yield the floor.
