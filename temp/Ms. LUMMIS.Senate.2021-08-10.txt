 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3104 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, as Americans are trying to enjoy their  last month of summer vacation before the kids go back to school, they  are facing gasoline prices at a near 7-year high.   What is the Biden administration doing about this? They are begging  Russia and the OPEC oil cartels to pump more oil so that U.S. gasoline  prices don't rise any more than they already have under his watch.  Meanwhile, through various Executive actions, such as the Biden ban on  new oil and gas industry drilling and development and canceling  pipelines, this President is attacking American workers and American  energy independence.   The oil and natural gas industry supports 11.3 million jobs across  the country and contributes nearly $1.7 trillion to the American  economy. It makes no sense to send production to other countries when  we could be doing it here, produced cleaner, more efficiently.    I yield back.
