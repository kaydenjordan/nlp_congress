 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5290, to extend  authority for the Department of Agriculture's Livestock Mandatory  Reporting program.   Under the Livestock Mandatory Reporting program, or LMR, meatpackers  across the country are required to report to the USDA the details of  transactions involving the purchase of cattle, swine, and sheep, as  well as transactions for the corresponding sales of certain beef, pork,  and lamb products.   The USDA compiles and disseminates the information through hundreds  of market reports each week, detailing price trends and supply and  demand conditions. In turn, livestock industry participants, including  farmers, ranchers, and feedlot operators, use the information to make  informed marketing decisions.   The livestock markets have experienced significant price volatility  leading up to and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, cattle markets  in particular. As I am sure many of you have heard from constituents at  home, this uncertainty has led to cries from the countryside for  significant market reforms and investigations into packer purchasing  behavior.   As industry and Congress continue to grapple with the best approach  to improving market transparency while avoiding unintended  consequences, and as we await the results of ongoing investigations, it  is imperative that farmers and ranchers maintain access to the market  information already provided by LMR.   H.R. 5290 would do just that, providing much-needed certainty for the  year ahead.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, the Livestock Mandatory Reporting program is really a  necessary and significant tool for the agriculture industry, especially  based on the disruptions that we experienced most recently in 2020.   I think American citizens are consciously aware of the difficulties  and the potential difficulties with the food and agriculture supply  chains and the difficulties that they experienced as they went to the  grocery stores as they sought to feed their families, specifically  during 2020 and in the wake of COVID-19. The Livestock Mandatory  Reporting program is a tool that can help avoid that type of an issue.   This reauthorization, as the chairman said, is important. It gives us  time to have a great debate and to look at how we increase transparency  within the livestock industry.   I urge my colleagues to support this extension, this reauthorization,  to give us time to make the necessary fixes and refinements in the  future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the management of  this bill to Mr. Johnson of South Dakota.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 5609, the Cattle Contract Library Act of 2021.   As I am sure many of my colleagues have heard from their constituents  back home, the differences between prices paid to producers for their  live cattle, and those paid by consumers at the meat counter, have led  to spirited debate about the transparency of the cattle markets in the  wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.   A variety of hearings on the matter have amplified those concerns.  These hearings and other related oversight have also made very clear  the differing opinions on if and how they should be addressed  legislatively.   There is a small, but vocal, faction in support of government  mandates dictating thresholds of cattle to be purchased on the spot  market. Frankly, such a proposal lacks broad industry support and, in  my opinion, needs further review to ensure it would actually achieve  its intended goals.   In fact, on two occasions now during this Congress, the House  Agriculture Committee has heard from diverse groups of respected  economists and industry stakeholders about the potential costs and  unintended consequences of this sort of government intervention in the  marketplace.   Giving these complex and compelling interests, I am thankful for  Congressman Dusty Johnson's leadership in pursuit of what I view as a  pragmatic middle ground with a broad cross-section of industry support.   If true market transparency is the goal, it seems to make sense that  a cattle contract library could serve as part of the solution. The  library would serve as a clearinghouse of information regarding the  various contract provisions being utilized in a variety of marketing  arrangements. Hopefully, access to this information would provide  producers and feeders more insight into market transactions and  ultimately give them more leverage in negotiating better terms for the  sale of their cattle.   It may not be a silver bullet to all that ails the industry, but I  certainly think H.R. 5609 marks a commonsense step in the right  direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in support of this  carefully crafted bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate and  recognize Mary Ann Chavey for her retirement from Penn State  University, my alma mater.   Mary Ann was hired by Penn State in April 1976 and has served the  university with distinction for 45 years. She joined the Office of  Government and Community Relations, OGCR, in 1996 and has served as  executive assistant through two vice president transitions.   Penn State OGCR is the office elected officials contact to interact  with the university's world-class scientific researchers and talented  students as well as its senior leaders. Mary Ann always handled her  duties with grace and professionalism. Her institutional memory and  understanding of the university have been critical to serving Penn  State's external stakeholders at the Federal, State, local, and Tribal  governmental levels.   Mary Ann has been the glue that held OGCR together over the years.  She has been a model and mentor to numerous staff and student interns.  Her knowledge and expertise helped strengthen the OGCR team to advance  the mission, vision, and goals of Penn State University.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Mary Ann Chavey for her  extraordinary service to Penn State University and a congratulations on  her retirement.                            ____________________
