 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Graves), chair of the full committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Chair, I would inquire how much time  remains in opposition.    Mr. Chair, our Nation has always had a  national commitment to infrastructure. Mr. Chairman, that has been true  whether it has been the interstate highway system, universal telephone  service, or rural electrification.   We don't ask each rural county to pay exclusively for their portion  of the interstate or high voltage transmission line that resides within  their county borders. That, sir, would be absurd. These are assets with  national benefit.   Now, that is the same wisdom, thankfully, that we apply to our  national aviation infrastructure. That  [[Page H3828]]  does not mean an airport everywhere, of course; not any more than it  means an interstate everywhere. It does mean a national commitment to  having the essential infrastructure necessary to bind together 50  States into one unified America.   This amendment destroys that national commitment to infrastructure  and to essential air service. It is misguided, and I urge a ``no''  vote.   I will close, Mr. Chair, by noting this: There may be some airports  within an hour, but there are many, including in South Dakota, that are  2 hours or 3 hours away from these hubs.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
