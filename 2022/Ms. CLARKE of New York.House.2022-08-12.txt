 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding. I rise today in support of H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction  Act of 2022.   This monumental generational investment in our Nation's future will  lower prescription drug prices and energy costs, extend healthcare  coverage for millions of Americans, and deliver a vital down payment of  resources in our stand against the climate crisis, all while creating  millions of well-paying jobs across America.   Moreover, it makes good on our promise to always fight for this  country's most vulnerable communities, now and forever.   The journey to today has been challenging, to say the least, but I am  at long last elated to know that the change Americans need and demand  is finally here.   Thanks to the hard work and ceaseless resolve of President Joe Biden,  my Democratic colleagues on the Senate side, and every individual who  took seriously their duty to fight tooth and nail to better the lives  of every American in our care, our pursuit of progress has never been  stronger.   For communities of color, our seniors, pregnant and postpartum  people, individuals and families living on low wages, and everyone else  who has long borne the brunt of too many hardships to list, this  legislation represents the initial steps they have long and desperately  awaited.                                time  1500    The Inflation Reduction Act will prevent thousands of premature  deaths by improving air quality in densely populated communities with  high environmental justice needs.
