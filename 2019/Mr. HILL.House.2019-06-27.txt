 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendment thereto, and  concur in this Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill was passed in the  Senate with 84 votes, Madam Speaker, and could be sent today to the  President's desk for his signature.
