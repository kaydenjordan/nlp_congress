 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3103) to amend title 18, United States Code, to eliminate the  statute of limitations for the filing of a civil claim for any person  who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section 1589, 1590,  1591, 2241(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422,  or 2423 of such title.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3103         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Eliminating Limits to       Justice for Child Sex Abuse Victims Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.         Section 2255 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by       striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:        ``(b) Statute of Limitations.--There shall be no time limit       for the filing of a complaint commencing an action under this       section.''.       SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICABILITY.         This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall--        (1) take effect on the date of enactment of this Act; and        (2) apply to--        (A) any claim or action that, as of the date described in       paragraph (1), would not have been barred under section       2255(b) of title 18, United States Code, as it read on the       day before the date of enactment of this Act; and        (B) any claim or action arising after the date of enactment       of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 3103.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 3103, the Eliminating Limits to Justice for Child Sex  Abuse Victims Act of 2022 is bipartisan legislation that would ensure  that survivors of child sex abuse are not barred by a statute of  limitations when seeking civil damages in court.   Data suggests that 86 percent of child sexual abuse goes unreported.  Also common is delayed disclosure, or the tendency of survivors of  child sexual abuse to wait many years before disclosing abuse to  others.   This is because survivors of sexual abuse often take a long time to  process their trauma, and many survivors who were abused as a child may  not even recognize the abuse they suffered until much later in life.   Unfortunately, because survivors of child sexual abuse often delay  reporting, any statute of limitations may prevent survivors from  accessing justice and seeking damages in civil court.   The current Federal civil remedy statute for victims of child sexual  abuse includes a statute of limitations requiring all claims to be  filed within 10 years of the injury or not later than 10 years after  the victim turns 18 years old.  [[Page H7748]]    These statutes of limitation can serve to protect the abusers and  enable them to continue to exploit their power by allowing victims'  claims to expire.   This bill will enable survivors who are victims of Federal child sex  abuse offenses, including aggravated sexual abuse, sex trafficking,  human trafficking, forced labor, and sexual exploitation, to seek civil  damages in Federal court regardless of the amount of time that has  passed since the abuse.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Ross)  for joining Senator Durbin in introducing this important legislation  and recognizing that the challenges survivors face in reporting the  trauma they have experienced should not bar them from accessing justice  in the courts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Ross), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, S. 3103 is bipartisan legislation that would ensure that  survivors of child sex abuse are not barred by a statute of limitations  when seeking justice in the courts.   This bill recognizes that many victims of child sexual abuse delay  reporting the trauma they have experienced. Therefore, it will enable  survivors who are victims of more than a dozen Federal sex abuse  offenses to seek civil damages in Federal court regardless of the time  that has passed since the abuse.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4785) to extend by 19 days the authorization for the special  assessment for the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4785         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATION FOR SPECIAL ASSESSMENT                     FOR DOMESTIC TRAFFICKING VICTIMS' FUND.         Section 3014(a) of title 18, United States Code, is       amended, in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by striking       ``September 11'' and inserting ``September 30''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 4785.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 4785 is bipartisan legislation that would extend  until September 30 of this year, 2022, the mandatory special assessment  of $5,000 imposed on those convicted of certain offenses involving  sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or human trafficking.   Human trafficking is a multi-billion-dollar criminal industry that  denies freedom to 24.9 million people around the world and generates  more than $150 billion annually in illicit profits. It is a  reprehensible crime that touches communities across the country--from  major cities to suburban enclaves and rural back roads--and can cause  devastating, sometimes irreparable harm to victims who fall prey to  cunning traffickers.   The fight against human trafficking requires a comprehensive,  multidisciplinary strategy that includes prosecution of traffickers so  that they cannot harm again, protection of victims through services to  increase safety and treat trauma, and prevention efforts to alleviate  social vulnerabilities to exploitation.   From providing immediate, emergency care when victims are identified  to long-term care that helps survivors recover from their  victimization, victim assistance is vital to the Federal anti- trafficking strategy and efforts to combat sexual abuse and  exploitation as well as child pornography, which continue to be a  threat to our children and other vulnerable persons.   The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, commonly referred to as  the JVTA, requires Federal sentencing judges to impose a special  assessment of $5,000 on those convicted of Federal crimes involving  sexual abuse, child pornography, sexual exploitation, or human  trafficking.   The fees collected from the special assessment are transferred to the  Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund and used to fund and enhance vital  services and programming that assist victims and survivors who have  been abused, exploited, and/or trafficked.   This past Sunday, the provision that requires judges to impose the  special assessment expired, which necessitates the passage of this  extension until the end of the fiscal year when it can be renewed as  part of other ongoing legislation to fund the government.   Congress must do all we can to ensure that resources are available to  support the needs of victims and survivors of human trafficking, sexual  abuse, and sexual exploitation, who often have complex needs requiring  a broader array of trauma-focused services and treatment.   Although we are considering the bill as introduced by Senators  Klobuchar and Cornyn, I must also thank Representative Karen Bass for  her work to introduce the House companion, H.R. 8684, and for her  continued dedication to helping victims and survivors of human  trafficking, sexual abuse, and sexual exploitation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the extension of the  $5,000 special assessment, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   S. 4785 is bipartisan legislation that would extend the $5,000  special assessment that provides funding to help victims and survivors  of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, child pornography, and human  trafficking, through services, programming, and treatment tailored to  their specific needs.   Each of us should make every effort to support programs that help  rescue survivors of these reprehensible crimes and provide them with  the resources they need to become whole again, while also holding  perpetrators accountable for the harms they cause.   I urge all my colleagues to support S. 4785, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from New York, the Honorable Patrick Ryan, be permitted to take the  oath of office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.    Madam Speaker, as the dean of the New York delegation, I  have the distinct honor to rise today to introduce the new Member of  the House of Representatives from New York's 19th Congressional  District, Representative Patrick Ryan.   Representative Ryan is a fifth generation New Yorker who was born and  raised in Kingston, New York. After graduating from the U.S. Military  Academy at West Point, he served our Nation as an Army intelligence  officer and deployed for two combat tours in Iraq.   Returning to New York as a decorated veteran, Congressman Ryan went  on to become a successful small business owner before returning to  public service as the County Executive of Ulster County.   As County Executive, Representative Ryan has been shown to be a  dedicated public servant, and I know he does not take his new role  lightly.   As the dean of the delegation, I know I speak on behalf of the entire  delegation when I say that Representative Ryan will be a wonderful  colleague whose experience, entrepreneurial leadership, and history of  devoted service to our country will help this Chamber navigate the  challenges of our times.    I am now honored, Madam Speaker, to yield to a fellow New Yorker (Mr.  Ryan).
