 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to Speaker  Pelosi's radical partisan prescription drug pricing plan.   Let's not forget the last time that Speaker Pelosi brought healthcare  legislation it was rushed through this House, and it doubled our  premiums and our deductibles skyrocketed.   There is no guarantee that H.R. 3 would lower the prices of drugs,  but rather, it could mandate a one-size-fits-all government takeover of  healthcare. It could pose a grave threat to innovation, research and  development, and ultimately patient access to life-changing  prescriptions.   The bill could have far-reaching economic consequences that would  negatively affect jobs, the economy, and trade. The pharmaceutical  industry employs over 800,000 workers and supports an estimated four  million jobs in this country. I know this firsthand. Right in my  district healthcare researchers are transforming patient care and  creating local jobs at the same time.   This week the House Committee on Education and Labor marked up this  legislation, and, unfortunately, my amendment was not adopted. My  amendment would have prevented innovation and American manufacturing  from moving out of the United States to China.   The American people deserve for this Congress to go to work and pass  legislation that is bipartisan and has a chance to become law to lower  drug prices.                            ____________________
