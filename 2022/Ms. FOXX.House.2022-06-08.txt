 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize and wish a happy 88th  birthday to an exemplary North Carolinian, Lindsay Holcomb, Jr., of  Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It has been my honor and pleasure to  know Lindsay for nearly 30 years, and I understand what a remarkable  man he truly is.   After graduating from Duke University in under 4 years, he went on to  serve in both the United States Army and National Guard. Later, he  became president of Pine State Knitwear, a prominent textile  manufacturer in Mount Airy, North Carolina.   Additionally, he served on the Board of Trustees for Northern Surry  Hospital for three decades, and was chairman four of those years.   That is an impressive resume. But there is more, much more to his  story. He served in pivotal leadership roles within the community as  well and showed his generosity in many ways.   He and his late brother, Smith, funded a care wing at Arbor Acres, an  independent living community in Winston-Salem, in honor of their mother  who suffered from dementia. They also donated the waiting room in the  Perry Clinic at Arbor Acres.   He is the kind of person who would give the shirt off his back to  help someone in need, and his service to others speaks volumes about  his character.   God bless you, Lindsay, and happy 88th birthday. Here is to many  more.                Recognizing the Service of William Morgan, Jr.     Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize William Morgan, Jr., of  Statesville, North Carolina. For the last 8\1/2\ years, he has served  as a city council member and mayor pro tem of Statesville. In these two  roles, he has excelled tremendously.   I have had the pleasure of knowing William for many years, and there  is no question about how dedicated he is to serving others.   William, your tireless advocacy efforts, and record of  accomplishments for the city of Statesville and its many  [[Page H5340]]  citizens has not gone unnoticed. Thank you for your service to our  great State, and may God bless you and Tina as you enter this new  chapter of your life.                     It Is Time to Re-educate Washington     Madam Speaker, Washington needs to be re-educated on the  meaning of ``shall not be infringed.''   The Second Amendment insulates the American people from the Federal  Government exerting undue influence over them; otherwise known as  infringement.   When the Federal Government acts in haste, the room for error is  drastically compounded; as is the case with the Democrat gun control  bills that are before this very body.   Let me be very clear: The horrific tragedies that occurred in Uvalde  and Buffalo are truly heartbreaking. I continue to pray for our society  and for the families of the men, women, and children who were  senselessly murdered.   Before proposals are put on the table, however, this problem must be  diagnosed in its entirety.   The Supreme Court has recognized the right of individual citizens to  keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment.   Further, the Court specifically recognizes that the inherent right to  self-defense is protected by the Second Amendment as well.   A study conducted in 2013 estimated that firearms are used in defense  from half a million to 3 million times annually. Americans exercise  their Second Amendment rights when protecting their family and  property. It was not written so that one could go hunting.   As former Senator Tom Coburn once said, ``It was to create a force to  balance a tyrannical force here.''   The Federal Government should not be in the business of issuing  edicts that threaten the Second Amendment rights of Americans. It is a  right that cannot be infringed.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2377, the  Extreme Risk Protection Order Act. Simply put, this bill tramples upon  the Second Amendment by means of destroying the Fifth.   However, I would like to direct my argument against the bill towards  another amendment, the Tenth, which reserves powers to the States.  Nineteen States have already enacted red flag laws in some form or  another, and all 31 additional States have the authority to do so.   The Federal Government must ask itself whether this bill will add any  measure of additional security the States are not already able to make  for themselves. The Federal Government must also look to these States  to gauge whether red flag laws have any effect on gun violence at all.    It is certainly not the case in Chicago, Illinois, a city subject to  State red flag laws, which leads all American cities in the number of  persons killed and injured in mass shootings over the past 4 years. Red  flag laws have saved no lives in Chicago.   This bill is redundant, not to mention likely ineffective. Americans  deserve better than this.    Mr. Speaker, we have certainly heard our fair share of hot  air from Democrats as they attack the Constitution and the rights of  Americans.   A Member from Rhode Island recently said that the constitutional  rights of the American people are BS. President Biden claimed that the  Second Amendment was not absolute.   This is a new and dangerous standard that is being set--that the  Constitution is merely a doormat that a Member of Congress wipes his or  her feet on.   It will surely pain my Democrat colleagues to hear this, but I will  say it anyway: the Constitution is absolute.   If they have a problem respecting our founding document, then why did  they take a take an oath to protect and defend it in the first place?   Perhaps they need to do some soul searching.                            ____________________
