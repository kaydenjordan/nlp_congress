 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, for the first time in 12 years, an  outright majority of Americans say crime has gotten worse in their area  over the past year.   Many Democrats have spent the last year and a half trying to defund  police, smear law enforcement, and go soft on crime. As a result,  innocent citizens have spent a year and a half watching murders,  carjackings, and other violent crimes literally skyrocket.   On Monday, in my hometown of Louisville, KY, we were stunned by what  appears to have been an assassination attempt against a Jewish mayoral  candidate by a prominent far-left activist who previously called for  defunding our police department.   This far-left Black Lives Matter activist and defund-the-police  cheerleader walked into a Jewish Democrat's campaign headquarters and  opened fire.   Obviously, every aspect of this is still under investigation,  including the suspect's mental condition. But guess what. He has  already been let out of jail--already let out of jail.   A leftwing bail fund partnered with BLM Louisville to bail him out.  Less than 48 hours after this activist tried to literally murder a  politician, the radical left bailed their comrade out of jail.   This is just jaw-dropping. The innocent people of Louisville deserve  better.   Since 2020, a long list of prominent corporations have donated or  pledged enormous amounts of money to the radical nationwide BLM parent  organization. One wonders if any of their corporate money helped spring  this would-be assassin from jail.  [[Page S758]]    Now, I am confident that if an activist claiming to be conservative  tried to assassinate a politician, whatever his mental state, the media  would open a 24/7 national conversation about rhetoric on the  right. Somehow, I doubt attempted murder by a BLM activist will get  that same treatment. I doubt we will have a national conversation about  the constant chorus of powerful voices calling our society evil.    I raise this double standard because it is not limited to media  coverage. We have seen this extend into our legal system itself.   In May of 2020, when Minneapolis was engulfed in lawless riots, one  rioter broke into a pawn shop and started a fire that burned it down.  His act of arson actually killed somebody. But the Federal attorneys,  who were supposed to represent the victim and the people, went out of  their way to push for an unusually lenient sentence. They asked for the  typical sentencing guideline to be cut in half. Why? Well, because,  they wrote, the defendant was an angry political protester who simply  lost his cool. They wrote, ``As anyone watching the news worldwide  knows, many other people in Minnesota were similarly caught up''--as if  that were an excuse. This is the sentencing memo from the prosecutors.  It reads like it was ghostwritten by the defense. They even tried to  quote Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to explain why this guy burned down  a pawn shop. What a backward attitude.   We cannot have Federal officials acting like leftwing political  violence is more acceptable than any other violence. If anything,  political violence is uniquely unacceptable in a democratic republic.   Now, I placed a hold on President Biden's nominee to take over as  U.S. attorney in Minnesota until he pledged he would keep political  favoritism out of his prosecutions. Fortunately, he quickly said so in  writing. He also knows Republicans will be watching.   The American people need public servants to crack down on crime and  defend their safety--crack down on crime and defend their safety--less  pandering to woke mobs; more protecting innocent families.                                    Energy    Madam President, now on an entirely different matter, Washington  Democrats' inflation is slamming consumers with the highest prices in  40 years. One of the toughest blows has been the soaring cost of a trip  to the gas pump. A gallon of regular costs a full dollar more today  than it did a year ago.   So after triggering a historic run of inflation and hammering  American producers with anti-energy policies designed to restrict  supply, our Democratic colleagues are suddenly talking about gas  prices. Here is their bold, creative plan: temporarily suspending the  gas tax, to the tune of 18 cents--oh, and excluding diesel--a slap in  the face to truckers and a further burden on the supply chain. Oh, and  just to make the political games transparent, they want this to expire  right after the midterms, as soon as the next Congress is sworn in.   Democrats want to blow a $20 billion hole in highway funding so they  can try to mask the effects of their own liberal policies on working  Americans. They have spent the entire year waging a holy war on  affordable American energy, and now--now--they want to use a pile of  taxpayers' money to literally hide the consequences.   As the senior Senator from West Virginia has pointed out, ``People  want their bridges and their roads, and we have an infrastructure bill  we just passed this summer, and they want to take all that away. It  just doesn't make sense.''   He added that this half-baked proposal doesn't make any more sense  than the President's pointless decision to take oil out of the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve last year.   President Clinton's Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers, called this  stunt ``short-sighted, ineffective, goofy and gimmicky.'' That is the  Secretary of the Treasury in the Bill Clinton administration.   Back in 2008, then-Candidate Obama himself said this:         We're arguing over a gimmick that would save you half a       tank of gas over the course of the entire summer so that       everyone in Washington can pat themselves on the back and say       they did something. Well, let me tell you, this isn't an idea       designed to get you through the summer--it's designed to get       them through an election.    That is Barack Obama in 2008, and he was right.   Look, if Democrats actually want to help the American people fill  their tanks, they wouldn't have been attacking American energy every  way possible for the entire year. President Biden made killing the  Keystone XL Pipeline his day 1 priority. Democrats voted in lockstep to  endorse President Biden's ban on new energy exploration on Federal  lands. At every turn, in every way, Democrats have made it harder to  produce affordable and reliable American energy. Take any form of  energy, and if people in San Francisco don't find it fashionable, the  Biden administration has gone after it.   Three years ago, under Republican policies, the United States became  a net exporter of oil for the first time in more than 70 years. From a  sheer mathematical perspective, for the very first time since World War  II, we were producing all that we needed and then some. Alas, a very  different philosophy now controls Washington. In President Biden's  first year, our own oil imports from Russia--from Russia--hit a new  alltime high.   But as we speak, events in Eastern Europe are reminding the entire  world that energy abundance is not just about families' pocketbooks;  there is a colossal strategic cost when our Nation and our allies  become economically dependent on countries that don't like us very  much.   Some of our European allies have spent many years voluntarily winding  down reliable sources like nuclear and coal and refusing to tap into  their own considerable natural gas reserves via fracking. Instead, they  gambled on less reliable sources and outsourced their perceived dirty  work to places like Russia. Western European elites decided they wanted  their energy production out of sight and out of mind, and Putin was all  too happy to oblige them.   Even after Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014,  Germany willingly signed up for Putin's Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. It  would negate Ukraine's own pipelines and deny the money and leverage  that Ukraine needs to keep Russia at bay, but Germany backed it.  Meanwhile, Berlin put off building liquid natural gas terminals,  instead choosing to rely on Russian gas and refusing to diversify its  import options. I am hopeful the latest indications that Germany is  reconsidering this will prove to be accurate.   The Biden administration is scrambling to connect our at-risk allies  with some energy resources from everywhere else--everywhere else. But  it should not have taken this latest Kremlin misbehavior to remind the  West that self-sufficiency actually matters. It matters. And Democrats  have still not flinched in their broader war against our own--our own-- U.S. production.   Glitzy summits in Paris and finger-wagging climate rhetoric are one  way to approach energy policy. Actually exploring and developing  abundant, affordable, and reliable domestic energy is another approach,  and that is the approach that will actually work.
