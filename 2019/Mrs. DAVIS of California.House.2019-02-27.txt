 Mr. Speaker, today is a momentous day, one  that makes me proud of this Chamber. After years of inaction, Congress  is moving to address our country's gun violence problem.   We have seen some of the worst mass shootings in our Nation's history  in just the past few years. Las Vegas, Thousand Oaks, Sutherland  Springs, Parkland, Sandy Hook--these are only a few of the names that  recently shocked us to the core. And, sadly, each time, Congress failed  to act.   But today--today--we are offering more than thoughts and prayers. We  are offering legislation. This bill has bipartisan support--finally,  something we can all agree on.   Strengthening our background check system is a small but a very  important first step. We simply cannot allow criminals to take  advantage of loopholes.   Background checks work. They keep guns out of the hands of criminals,  and background checks will save lives.   No more excuses. It is just common sense.                            ____________________
