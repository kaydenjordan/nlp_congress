 Madam Speaker, as we all know, the House has already  voted to address the debt ceiling.   Madam Speaker, on April 26, this House passed the Limit, Save, Grow  Act. I should say some of this House, but a majority of this House  passed a bill to address not only the debt ceiling but also the  spending problem in Washington that has brought us to this point.   Now, I will also say, Madam Speaker, that for more than 4 weeks, the  Senate has not even taken up action on that bill. In fact, the Senate  is not even in session today or this week.   Madam Speaker, following tomorrow's votes, if some new agreement is  reached between President Biden and Speaker McCarthy, Members will  receive 24 hours' notice in the event we need to return to Washington  for any additional votes either over the weekend or next week.   Additionally, we will allow all Members to have 72 hours to review  any such legislative text that may come before us relating to the debt  ceiling before final passage of that bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Clark).    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time.   Maybe my colleagues on the other side are having buyer's remorse, or  should I say voter's remorse, that every single one of them voted  against addressing the debt ceiling over a month ago when we brought  that bill to the floor.   Now, Madam Speaker, there is a remedy. If anyone in this Chamber,  including my friends on the other side, would like to see this problem  addressed, they should go over to the Senate side.   Frankly, there is no one there. They should get on the phone and call  the Democrat Senators who run the Senate and chose to be out this whole  week because they took this so seriously or call the White House and  ask the President why he took 97 days off after the first meeting with  Speaker McCarthy when the Speaker was ready to negotiate.   We are still here. We have done our job. We have acted. We are, in  fact, the only body in this town who has actually taken steps to  address the debt ceiling and the spending problem in Washington.   I encourage the Senate to take up the bill. I encourage the President  to get engaged and address this problem, but we already have the votes  on the board.   I ask that the House be in order and there be some decorum on the  other side.    Madam Speaker, while some in this town might be  interested in theatrics, House Republicans took action.   We passed a bill to address the problem. It is time for my friends on  the other side to start doing their job.   Call the Senate back in to take up the bill. If they don't like it,  they can amend it. That is part of the legislative process. Let's get  our jobs done. We have done ours. They need to do theirs.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
