 Mr. President, today I offer my recognition of the  service of Sherie Allen to Utah mothers and children. Adopted in  Lancaster, CA, in 1965, around 3 months of age, Sherie was raised in a  home that frequently and openly discussed her adoption. This experience  instilled a passion to serve those in need of love and home.   Sherie's late husband also understood the goodwill in adoption, and  together, they formed a family with eight children, four biological and  four adopted. Of her four adopted children, one now lives in assisted  living, two have graduated college with bachelor's degrees in biology,  and the other is a high school student. Sherie and her late husband  were also foster parents, providing love and care for many children  before those children were placed into their forever homes and  families.   In February of 2019, Sherie started Ohana Beginnings where she now  serves as CEO and executive board chair. Ohana Beginnings offers  support for expectant mothers facing an unplanned pregnancy who choose  to marry, place their baby for adoption, or single parent. The  organization's Taking Flight Initiative offers services that include  housing, food, clothing, medical care, therapeutic services, and  academic support. This initiative is individually designed to fit the  unique circumstances of the expectant or parenting mother to set her up  for future success.   This September, the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute-- CCAI--honored Sherie and other outstanding individuals who have  demonstrated a commitment to improving the lives of children in need of  permanent, loving homes. Sherie's work and dedication toward serving  the needs of expectant mothers and children has earned her the Angels  in Adoption Honoree award. Sherie is a powerful advocate for pro-family  values and has committed her time, gifts, and resources to  strengthening families, helping young mothers, and protecting babies  through Ohana Beginnings.                            ____________________
