 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this Congressional Review Act  that would overturn yet another radical rule from the Biden  administration's EPA.   If you need any more proof of how radical the rules coming out of  this EPA are, look to where this bill came from: The Senate. The last  time I checked, the President's own party holds the majority in that  Chamber, yet they still think this rule is too extreme.   This EPA rule would impose severe emissions reductions that are 80  percent more stringent than the previous rule.                                time  1515    Today's new trucks have already reduced nitrogen oxide emissions by  more than 98 percent since 1988. In fact, there is a chart on EPA's own  website showing the U.S. reduced six common pollutants by 78 percent  between 1970  [[Page H2530]]  and 2020, all while increasing miles driven and experiencing dramatic  economic growth.   Put simply, this rule is both unnecessary and unworkable. It would  make it harder for the truckers who keep our economy moving from doing  their jobs--truckers from the Georgia Ports Authority in my district.   The cost of complying with this rule would force truck owners and  operators off the road, and that is not acceptable.   Prices are up. Our supply chains are backlogged. We have an  administration that continues to strangle our economy with antigrowth  and antiworker rules like this.   Mr. Speaker, this needs to stop, and I urge passage of this matter.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Jimmy Wilson. Jimmy was born in September 1946 in Chester,  Pennsylvania. After graduating from Savannah High School in 1964, he  immediately joined the United States Navy.   After leaving the Navy, Jimmy went on to graduate from Georgia  Southern University with a degree in accounting. While in college, he  married the love of his life, Barbara.   Post-Georgia Southern, Jimmy worked for Metro Development before  launching his business, the James Corde Company.   In 1985, he and Louis Young created Great American Builders, and that  soon rose to become the largest home builder in the Savannah area. He  was also active in trade organizations, such as Home Builders  Association of Greater Savannah and was also inducted into the Home  Builders Association Hall of Fame.   Outside of work, Jimmy was an avid University of Georgia football  fan, even attending the 1982 Heisman Trophy ceremony.   Jimmy leaves behind his dear wife, Barbara, three incredible  children, and his beloved grandchildren.   My sincere condolences go out to the Wilson family during this time  of mourning.                            ____________________
