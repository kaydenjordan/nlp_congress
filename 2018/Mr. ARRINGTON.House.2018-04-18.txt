 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the passing of  a very special person and the epitome of a First Lady, Barbara Pierce  Bush. As First Lady, Mrs. Bush was praised for bringing the power of  literacy to others, but America will remember her most for her fierce  love and commitment to her family.   Mrs. Bush embodied the best of America: strong, compassionate, and  spirited. She, like her husband, believed that public service is a  noble calling, and she stewarded that calling with class and grace.   Our country would not have been blessed with the principled  leadership of both our 41st and 43rd Presidents if it were not for the  strong character and devotion of Barbara Bush.   Her dedication to family values wasn't just a political talking  point; it was her life's mission, and now, her greatest legacy.   While I grieve with my dear friend, President George W. Bush, and his  family, I join them in celebrating a life well lived, and thanking God  with gracing us with Barbara Bush.                            ____________________
