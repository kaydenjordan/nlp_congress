 Mr. Speaker, international trade is essential  to America's economy and to American leadership. Today, I introduce the  Global Trade Accountability Act, which seeks to establish this  principle.   As a private-sector manufacturing business owner, I experienced the  harmful effects of bad trade practices firsthand.   On trade, as with many other issues, Congress needs to work with  President Trump to restore power to the American people. This bill does  that by ensuring that the President has flexibility to change tariffs  as needed in negotiations, but if the President wants the tariff to  continue beyond 90 days, Congress would need to vote approving that  action.   President Trump's commitment to put America first in trade is  commendable in fulfilling his promise to American workers; however, the  President should not be in this fight alone. Congress needs to join the  fight to ensure these efforts are effectively moved forward for the  entire country.   The Constitution clearly gives the legislative branch the  responsibility to  [[Page H1011]]  regulate commerce and lay taxes and duties with foreign nations, yet  Congress has surrendered this Article I authority. Mr. Speaker, it is  time to restore it.                            ____________________     ``No Person shall be a Senator who shall not  have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen  of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant  of that State for which he shall be chosen.   ``The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the  Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.   ``The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President  pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall  exercise the Office of President of the United States.   ``The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.
