 Madam Speaker, this Representative is going to go down  in history as one of the most articulate fighters for justice we have  ever seen. I give her a special congratulations for all the work she  did on the Violence Against Women Act that was celebrated today.   Madam Speaker, I recognize another historic woman who is very  prolific. I will highlight just a couple of things.   She brought to this venue the #MeToo movement. She has been the  champion in changing military law to protect people from sexual  violence. And she is my co-chair of the Women's Caucus. And I could go  on and on.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the State of  California (Ms. Speier).
