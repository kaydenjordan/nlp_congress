 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 2, the  Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018. Included in this great bill are  two bills I introduced: the WATER Act and the STRESS Act, which was  introduced with other colleagues as well.   The WATER Act improves water quality by easing access to the  Conservation Innovation Grant program and reducing red tape. Iowans  expect and deserve clean water, and this bill will help do that.   The STRESS Act will help address the farmer suicide crisis gripping  our Nation. By opening the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network,  farmers facing tough times can get the help that they need. Our farmers  feed, fuel, and sustain the world. It is only right we take steps to  help them.   I was also pleased--and I thank the chairman--that in the farm bill  there are positive steps to address the food waste that is out there in  our country. Our country wastes 40 percent of our food supply. As a  cofounder of the Food Waste Caucus, I am committed to reducing food  waste to combat hunger, as well as are many of my colleagues.   Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Conaway as well for his leadership by  putting in the bill the Food Loss and Waste Reduction Liaison at the  USDA so we can take another step to reduce food waste by 50 percent by  2030.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
