 Mr. Speaker, Winston Churchill once said: ``Socialism is  the philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of  envy. Its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.''   Despite the truth of these words, unfortunately, more and more young  Americans hold positive views of socialism and negative views of  capitalism. A recent Gallup Poll found that 51 percent of young  Americans view socialism favorably, while only 45 percent view  capitalism positively. That marks a 12-point decline in the popularity  of capitalism just this decade.  [[Page H10023]]    So the question is, Why are increasing numbers of our young people  supporting socialism?   The answer is, because they have been told that it is somehow  ``moral'' and ``compassionate'' and ``fair'' by leading socialist  voices in media and government, mostly concentrated in and around  Washington, D.C.   On the surface, one might think that taking from the prosperous for  the betterment of the poor is a decent and fair policy. But just under  the surface lies a fundamental ignorance of one of the most  foundational principles of human behavior, and that is, incentives.   Socialism doesn't reward people for hard work, creativity, and  entrepreneurial spirit. In reality, the overwhelming taxation necessary  to support socialist policies penalizes people who work hard by forcing  them to send their earnings, perhaps thousands of miles away, to  Washington, D.C.   The incentive that is created is one of mediocrity; that it would be  just easier to settle for economic scraps instead of shooting for the  Moon and pursuing the American Dream.   And what about the supposed beneficiaries of socialism, the middle  and the lower-class workers? Under that system, not only do massive  amounts of other people's money flow here to Washington, but so does  the decisionmaking capacity, over large swaths of people's lives, from  your healthcare decisions to how you power your home, or your car, or  what school your child can attend.   Liberal Democrats often mock Republican economic policies as trickle- down economics. But the socialist view essentially constitutes trickle- down bureaucracy. The theory is that if we give more money and power to  Federal bureaucrats in Washington, that the benefits will somehow  trickle down to those who need it the most.   Furthermore, it is fundamentally immoral for decisions over your life  to be fundamentally outsourced to a far distant Capital hundreds or  thousands of miles away with the dim promise of support after the  Washington swamp has had its say.   The best way to combat the rise of socialism is to educate Americans  on the devastation that it has caused in other countries around the  world.   In Greece, socialist policies have crippled investment, innovation,  entrepreneurship, and led to a shortage of food, money, and medicine.   In Venezuela, the socialist policies of Hugo Chavez and Nicolas  Maduro have led to mass shortages of critical medicine, widespread  starvation, skyrocketing crime, and a terrible refugee crisis.   In contrast, countries that have adopted the capitalist principles of  economic freedom have fared much better. After trying Socialist  policies in the 20th century, Israel, India, and the United Kingdom  realized that their economies were hopelessly stagnated, and as a  result, all three countries stopped allowing the government to dictate  economic decisions and made the switch to free-market policies as a way  to jump-start their economies.   After embracing economic freedom, India now has the largest middle  class in the free world. Israel is rated as the third most innovative  economy in the world, and the United Kingdom's economy grew faster than  nearly every other economy in Europe.   As a strong supporter of economic freedom, I stand firm in my  commitment to combat the rise of socialism. This dangerous ideology has  failed in nearly every country where it has been tried, and we must do  everything in our power to educate the next generation of Americans  about the true nature of socialism.   Socialism is not what made America great. Socialism is not who we  are. America will never become a Socialist Nation.                            ____________________
