 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, as  amended, would establish a framework to support greater access and use  of government data.   I want to thank Representatives Derek Kilmer and Blake Farenthold for  their work on the OPEN Government Data Act, which is the basis for  title II of this bill. I also want to thank Speaker Ryan, Senator  Murray, and Chairman Gowdy for their bipartisan work on this issue.   This bill would require that agencies make data ``open by default''  and develop a plan for building evidence in their agencies.   The bill would require that the Office of Management and Budget  develop a Federal catalog and inventory of agency data assets and that  each agency designate chief evaluation officers and chief data officers  who would work to ensure that agencies utilize data effectively.   The goal of this bill is to ensure that Congress and the executive  branch are able to make important policy decisions based on evidence.  This is not always the case. For example, take the Teen Pregnancy  Prevention Program. Funding for that program was recently cut even  though there is significant evidence that it works well.   If we are going to demand more and higher quality evidence from these  Federal agencies, it is imperative that Congress and the executive  branch advance policies supported by that evidence.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 3369, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post  Office located at 225 North Main Street in Spring Lake, North Carolina,  as the Howard B. Pate, Jr. Post Office.   Born in 1925, Howard Pate joined the Army in 1944, 2 years after his  high school graduation. In early 1945, Howard deployed to Europe as  part of the famed 101st Airborne Division.   Later serving in the 82nd Airborne Division, Howard was discharged  from Active Duty in 1946, but he continued his service as a member of  the North Carolina Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve. He retired in 1965,  as a sergeant major in the 13th Special Forces Group.   Following his military service, Howard was appointed postmaster of  Spring Lake, North Carolina, and served as both a State vice president  and president of the National Association of Postmasters.   He was also an active member of his community, serving as a deacon at  the First Presbyterian Church of Spring Lake, charter president of the  Spring Lake Jaycees, and a member of the Greater Spring Lake Chamber of  Commerce for over 50 years, where the Volunteer of the Year award is  named in his honor.   Howard Pate passed away a year ago this week, as we heard, on  November 14, 2016.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor Howard Pate's life of  service to his community and to his country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3369, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 1207, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post  Office located at 306 River Street in Tilden, Texas, as the Tilden  Veterans Post Office.   Military men and women sacrifice their time, energy, and lives for  our country every day. Whether serving in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps,  Air Force, or Coast Guard, these brave individuals risk their lives to  protect others and demonstrate an unmatched level of selflessness,  courage, and dedication.   While this bill will name the post office in Tilden, Texas, in honor  of all veterans who have served, I would like to specifically recognize  the service of Mr. Anselmo Villarreal.   Drafted into the Army in March of 1968, he served in Vietnam until  1970, and he continues to serve his fellow veterans through volunteer  work at his local veterans service organization.   His story is not unlike other servicemembers who give their time at  home and abroad to protect and improve their communities in so many  ways. In recognizing his contributions, we recognize the contributions  of veterans throughout Texas and the United States, and we thank them  for their work.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to celebrate the lives of  American veterans and commemorate the sacrifices that each have made  for the good of our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1207, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 2873, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post  Office located at 207 Glenside Avenue in Wyncote, Pennsylvania, as the  Staff Sergeant Peter Taub Post Office Building.   A native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Mr. Taub was inspired by his  grandfather's World War II military service to join the Air Force in  2007. He loaded missiles for F-15 fighter jets in Japan before  transferring to Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, where he  specialized in arming B-1 bombers.   In 2013, after earning his bachelor's degree in cybersecurity, Peter  became a special agent in the Air Force Office of Special  Investigations and participated in over a dozen combat missions through  hostile areas.   On December 21, 2015, while in Afghanistan, Staff Sergeant Taub gave  his life, along with four of his fellow airmen, when his unit was  ambushed in a suicide attack. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze  Star, Purple Heart, Air Force Commendation Medal, and Air Force Combat  Action Medal, and he leaves behind a beloved wife and two children.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor Staff Sergeant Peter  Taub's bravery and remember the ultimate sacrifice he made to protect  our Nation.   I urge the passage of H.R. 2873.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 3109, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post  Office located at 1114 North 2nd Street in Chillicothe, Illinois, as  the Sr. Chief Ryan Owens Post Office Building.   A native of Edelstein, Illinois, Ryan Owens graduated from Illinois  Valley Central High School and joined the Navy in 1998.   Ryan served at the Office of Naval Intelligence before completing  SEAL training and was selected as a chief petty officer in 2009.   While on his fifth tour of duty with the elite SEAL Team Six, Ryan  sustained wounds in a firefight and succumbed to his injuries on  January 29, 2017.   Ryan's dedicated service has been recognized through a number of  awards  [[Page H9295]]  and medals, including the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, a Bronze Star  and Bronze Stars with Combat V, a Joint Service Achievement Medal, and  three Presidential Unit Citations.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor the heroism of Sr.  Chief Ryan Owens and recognize the ultimate sacrifice he made for our  country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 3109, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 3893, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Post  Office located at 100 Mathe Avenue in Interlachen, Florida, as the  Robert H. Jenkins Post Office.   Robert Jenkins joined the United States Marine Corps in Jacksonville,  Florida, in February of 1968.   After completing training at Camp Lejeune, Robert was assigned to the  3rd Marine Division in Vietnam. There he served as a scout, driver,  machine gunner for Company C in an area south of the demilitarized  zone.   In the early morning of March 5, 1969, Private First Class Jenkins'  team was suddenly attacked by the North Vietnamese Army. While Private  First Class Jenkins and a fellow marine returned machine gun fire, a  hand grenade was thrown at their location.   In an act of pure selflessness, Private First Class Jenkins threw  himself on top of his fellow marine, shielding him from the explosion,  while absorbing the full force himself. Tragically, Private First Class  was gravely wounded and died soon after.   Private First Class Jenkins was posthumously awarded the Medal of  Honor for his valiant actions in April 1970.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor the valiant actions of  Private First Class Jenkins and to remember his courage and  selflessness devotion to his fellow marines.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3893. I have no further speakers,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.

The two of them lived in Fairview with children Elea and James, where  Douglas proudly volunteered as a firefighter, cheered for the Green Bay  Packers, and loved spending time outdoors riding his motorcycle,  hunting, and fishing.

Sergeant Douglas Riney was awarded the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and  Army Commendation Medal, among other honors, for his valiant service.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to remember the courage and the  sacrifice of Sergeant Douglas Riney and honor his memory for years to  come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 2672, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), my colleague.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.

He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart, National Defense  Service Medal, and Vietnam Service Medal for his honorable service. His  captain deemed Lance Corporal Addington one of the finest marines he  had ever known.   Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the ultimate  sacrifice Lance Corporal Zachary Addington made for our Nation, and I  urge the passage of H.R. 3821.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
