 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Calvin C.  Goode, a civil rights leader and longest-serving Phoenix City Council  member in the city's history.   Mr. Goode passed away in December 2020 at the age of 93, but his  impact on Phoenix will be felt for generations to come.   Calvin moved to Arizona with his family when he was just 10 months  old, and later had to move across the State to find a high school that  would enroll Black students. He eventually graduated from Carver High  School in 1945 and went on to earn a master's in education from Arizona  State University.   In 1971, Calvin became only the second Black American ever elected to  the Phoenix City Council. In his 22 years on the council, Calvin  advocated for historic preservation, affordable housing, more  accessible neighborhoods, and educational programs such as Head Start.   Calvin was married to his wife, Georgie Mae Goode, a Phoenix activist  and educator, for 55 years.   As we continue to celebrate Black History Month, I would like to  recognize and share my appreciation for Calvin C. Goode's commitment to  the Black community in Phoenix and to advancing the lives of young  people in the city. His spirit will be missed, and his leadership will  be felt for years to come.
