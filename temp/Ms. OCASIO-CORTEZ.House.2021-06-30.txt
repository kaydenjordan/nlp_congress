 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer six amendments  to the INVEST in America Act.   It is imperative that any infrastructure bill that we work on and is  passed by Congress helps to achieve two goals: one, address the history  of injustice and displacement that traditional and historic  infrastructure investment has imposed on communities of color and  working people, like the construction of the Cross Bronx Expressway;  and the second is to prepare for and create good, dignified union jobs  in building the infrastructure that helps mitigate climate change.    One amendment that I am offering today would double the funding to  replace lead water infrastructure in schools. In the richest country in  the world, no child should be poisoned by their classroom water  fountain, yet that is exactly the case for millions of American  schoolchildren. In New York City alone, at least 400 schools, many in  the Bronx, contained faucets with elevated lead levels as recently as  2019.   I am also offering an amendment today with Representative Moulton to  increase rail funding by 20 percent.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support and passage of these amendments.
