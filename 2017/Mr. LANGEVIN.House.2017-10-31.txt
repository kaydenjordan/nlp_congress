 Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago this week, Congress passed  the Help America Vote Act, which provided much-needed Federal aid to  overhaul our aging election infrastructure.   I was proud to support this investment in our elections, which helps  States expand opportunities for all Americans to cast ballots and know  that they were properly counted.   Unfortunately, today, much of our election infrastructure is again in  need of a refresh. Among many challenges, Russia has mounted a direct  attack on our elections, and it is absolutely imperative that we shore  up our defenses.   To address this issue, among others, I introduced the PAPER Act with  Congressman Mark Meadows, to provide States with resources to assess  the security risks posed to their election systems and implement  cybersecurity best practices, including postelection audits of paper  ballots.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to recommit to the ideals of HAVA. I urge my  colleagues to pass the PAPER Act and restore the integrity of our  elections.                            ____________________
