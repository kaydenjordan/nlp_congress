 Mr. President, a little over a decade ago, Michigan  lawmakers convened a session in the dark of the night. They put  padlocks on the doors of the State Capitol so that they wouldn't have  to listen to the protesters who had gathered outside.   They had come to Lansing to pass ``right to work,'' a policy that  weakened the power of unions all across Michigan. But today--today--my  colleagues in the State legislature passed legislation in the State  senate to repeal that law, and it now moves to the house next week.   They are stepping up. They are stepping up because they understand  that we are living through a crucial moment. The richest Americans are  only getting richer, while many working people are left behind, unable  to reap the benefits of the wealth that they helped to create.   Labor unions are the best tool that we have to buck that trend. They  expand and empower the middle class. They allow workers to negotiate  for better wages and safer workplaces and the right to retire with  dignity. But union membership is at an alltime low. Many employers  intimidate workers who attempt to organize and retaliate against those  who are able to come together. It is one reason that the gap between  rich and poor continues to grow.   In order to keep building an economy that works for everyone, we need  to take a lesson from my home State of Michigan. We need to breathe new  life into American unions, and we need to pass the PRO Act. This  legislation will empower workers to exercise their right to organize.  It will hold employers accountable for violating workers' rights. It  will secure free, fair, and safe union elections, and it will preempt  right-to-work laws across the country. Simply put, the PRO Act will  make it easier for working people everywhere to join a union.   As a Michigander, the right to organize is a pillar of my State.  Modern unions were born in Flint, MI, when autoworkers banded together  in the winter of 1936 for better pay and working conditions. Their 44- day strike started a movement that formed the backbone of the American  middle class.   But this is also very personal to me. My dad was a teacher and a  member of the MEA. My father-in-law is a proud member of UAW Local 5960  as a retiree. My mother, a nurse's aide, worked tirelessly with the  SEIU to organize her workplace. And when management tried to sway her  to not support the union with a raise, she refused. She would not quit.  She would not stop her fight until everyone got a better deal and  everyone got a raise. And after the employees voted to unionize, they  made her a union steward. She taught me the value of standing up and  fighting for your rights, no matter what is in your way.   We have seen what is possible when we choose to stand up for working  people. We enacted the bipartisan infrastructure deal, which will  create good-paying union jobs all across our country and penalize  companies that break the labor law. Just over 2 years ago, we passed  the Butch Lewis Act and secured pensions for millions of American  workers.   These victories have helped people all across our country, and we can  build on that work by passing the PRO Act. It is a comprehensive,  commonsense piece of legislation that we have to get across the finish  line. The namesake of this bill is former AFL-CIO President Richard  Trumka, a legend in the labor movement and a tireless advocate for  working people.   Just before he died, he addressed a group of Alabama coal miners who  were in the throes of a strike, and he told them: We are not going to  give up. We are not going to give in. We will prevail. One day longer,  one day stronger.   His words ring as true today as they did that night in Brookwood, AL.  We are not giving in or giving up, and together we will prevail. I am  proud to stand in solidarity with labor unions all across Michigan, as  well as all across this country, as a cosponsor of the PRO Act, and I  will continue to do everything in my power to see that it gets passed.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate consider the following  nomination: Calendar No. 67, Michael Ratney, to be Ambassador to the  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; that the Senate vote on the nomination,  without intervening action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon table and the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action.
