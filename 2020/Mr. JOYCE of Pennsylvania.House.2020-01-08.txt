 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 5130, the Capturing All Small Businesses Act of 2019.   As a member of the Small Business Committee, I have personally heard  from many business leaders who tell me that the guidance and the  resources provided by SBA can be instrumental for success in the open  marketplace.   Often, these tools pave the way for rapid growth; yet, as these  businesses experience success, hire more employees, and grow our  economy, the owners can be hesitant to expand their operations beyond  certain parameters, fearing that, if they become too successful too  quickly, the resources provided by the SBA would be no longer  available.   H.R. 5130 would address their concerns by allowing companies to  maintain their designated status, encouraging them to continue growing  and graduate into successful businesses.   I thank my colleague, Mr. Hern from Oklahoma, for this important  legislation. I thank our chair, Ms. Velazquez, and our ranking member,  Mr. Chabot, for their bipartisanship. This is important legislation,  and I encourage all of my colleagues to support it.                                time  1530     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 5130, the Capturing All Small Businesses Act. As a member of the  Small Business Committee, I have personally heard how important this  act is.   Additionally, I want to speak today in support of H.R. 5146, the  Unlocking Opportunities for Small Businesses Act, introduced by my  friend and colleague, Mr. Hagedorn from Minnesota, and my fellow  Pennsylvanian, Mr. Evans.  [[Page H41]]    Federal contracts provide many businesses across the Nation with the  opportunity to receive stable funding through which they can develop a  reliable workforce, supply chain, or line of production. These  contracts can be a lifeline to small businesses looking to grow or  expand. Unfortunately, as designed, the current system limits smaller  companies' chances to acquire these contracts.   This legislation implements a much-needed change to allow small  businesses to use their previous experience to demonstrate their merits  and to strengthen their abilities to compete for Federal contracts.   This is an important step in leveling the playing field for small  businesses looking to grow their footprint in the Federal market. I  look forward to the positive impact that this legislation will have on  countless small businesses that I represent in south central and  southwestern Pennsylvania and across our great country.
