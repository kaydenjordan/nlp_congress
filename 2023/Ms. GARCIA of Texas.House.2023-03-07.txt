 Mr. Speaker, House Democrats have always put  people over politics, but House Republicans continue to prioritize  their own power and pocketbooks instead of solving problems.   House Democrats have lowered kitchen table costs for Americans by  lowering healthcare coverage prices, capping out-of-pocket drug costs  for seniors, and giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices.   Additionally, we have helped make clean energy more affordable to  American families through rebates and tax credits.   Meanwhile, House Republicans continue threatening to raise taxes on  families and cut Social Security and Medicare funding.   Our seniors are dependent on these vital programs.   These extreme MAGA Republicans are focused on political games at the  risk of thousands of Americans' livelihoods.   I will always put people over politics today, tomorrow, and every  day.   People over politics.                            ____________________
