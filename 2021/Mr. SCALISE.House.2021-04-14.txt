 Madam Speaker, it is with great honor that on behalf of  the entire Louisiana delegation and on behalf of all of my colleagues,  we welcome Julia Letlow to Congress.   It has been quite a journey, and it is not a journey that she walks  alone. This has been Julia and Luke Letlow's journey for over a year,  and we all still grieve for the loss of Luke, who tragically died just  days before he would have been sworn into Congress. But Julia never  backed down, never looked back. She moved forward, and she said we are  going to continue this journey with her beautiful family.   Madam Speaker, up in the balcony, we have her 3-year-old son,  Jeremiah, and her 1-year-old daughter, Jacqueline. We welcome them, as  well as both Julia's and Luke's families, who are in the balcony.   There are so many great attributes that Julia is going to bring to  this Congress. She graduated from the University of Louisiana Monroe.  She has been in higher education her entire life and truly dedicated  her life to serving others. She will be serving on the Education and  Labor Committee, as well as on the Agriculture Committee, two important  committees that enrich this country, as well as her district.   She has a great record of service. We are so excited to have her in  our delegation. We are especially proud that Julia becomes, today, the  first Republican woman ever elected to Congress from Louisiana.   Madam Speaker, let me welcome our newest Member of Congress, Julia  Letlow.
