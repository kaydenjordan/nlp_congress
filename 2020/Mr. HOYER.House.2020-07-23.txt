 Madam Speaker, this is an issue of who we are as a people.  Many women have spoken on this floor, but this is an issue for fathers.  This is an issue for sons. This is an issue for brothers.   I have three daughters, two granddaughters, and three great  granddaughters. They must not be confronted with this kind of attack,  and that is what it was.   Some have tried to demonize the gentlewoman from New York who does,  in fact, bring the intellect, the passion, and the focus on issues  surprisingly that the gentleman mentioned yesterday in his non-apology.  All the men on this side of the aisle are supportive of Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez and all of her sisters and all of her mothers as well.                                time  1115     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  congratulate her for her work over the years. She and I spent over 2  decades serving together on that committee, the Appropriations  Committee, and the same amount of time serving on the Labor, Health and  Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of that  Appropriations Committee; and I enjoyed her insight and her wisdom and  her hard work, and I thank her for what she has done for the committee  and what she has done for the country.   I also want to thank the Staff Director of the committee, Shalanda  Young, who clearly is one of the most outstanding members of the  Congressional staff on either side of the Capitol. She has been  tireless in working with Mrs. Lowey to bring bills to the floor and,  particularly with respect to our response to COVID-19, has performed  extraordinary services.    Frankly, but for the Appropriations Committee and its staff on both  sides of the aisle, we would not have been able to do that; so I thank  all those involved.   Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat infamous, I suppose, on my side of the  aisle with some other committee chairs and staff, for wanting to make  sure that we do our work on appropriation bills.   Frankly, there are so many important bills that this House and Senate  pass and the President signs. Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case  lately, but usually is the case. But these bills must pass.   If the American people are going to continue to enjoy the services of  their government, in so many critical ways to their lives, then the  Appropriations Committee must do its job. We have been blessed that we  have as chair and ranking member two Members who care about that  process in Mrs. Lowey and Ms. Granger.   I also had the opportunity of serving some period of time with Ms.  Granger on the Appropriations Committee. She is a woman and  Representative that I have great respect for and appreciate  [[Page H3793]]  her attitude and collegial effort to work together.   I regret that these will not be bipartisan bills. Frankly, I think it  is not so much because of the appropriations bill as it is because of  the context in which we find ourselves in Washington, and in our  country today.   The House is getting its work done for the people, and passing these  appropriations bills well in advance of the end of the fiscal year, as  we did last year.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the Senate is on track to fail to mark up  a single bill in committee, which may be the first time ever that that  has been the case.   Sadly, it is consistent with their not passing any other bills  either, so 275 of our bills sit untended in the United States Senate.  Why?   Because, as former appropriator and former Senate Budget Committee  Chair Senator Judd Gregg said: ``I don't see any reason why they should  go to markup if the goal of that markup is to simply create political  fodder for the election, rather than move the bills forward.''   That bleak assessment speaks directly to the harmful effects of  Senate Republicans' policy choices, because in this body, and in the  Democratic Caucus, we believe appropriations bills are a statement of  our values and an opportunity to communicate them to the American  people.   We have a saying, all of us, put your money where your mouth is. And  if you don't do that, then your mouth is articulating things that you  may not really believe in, but you think it is useful for people to  hear.   This package contains important and positive investments in our  people, our economy, and in our national security that reflect House  Democrats' commitment to governing for the people and, very frankly, I  think, for the most part, Republican values, which is why I am so  disappointed that this will not be a bipartisan effort.   It reflects our priorities for moving America forward and helping our  people get ahead.   This bill will help ensure that children and families receive the  assistance they need through SNAP and WIC to protect against hunger, an  extraordinary challenge in today's COVID-19-afflicted America.   It strengthens our conservation efforts and ensures a cleaner  environment. And we passed an extraordinary historical bill yesterday  in a bipartisan fashion to accomplish that objective as well.   In particular, I am pleased it includes funding for the Chesapeake  Bay program, so vital to my State and to our region.   We are taking steps as well to protect the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge, and this package will require that the National Park Service  will move any commemorative displays honoring the Confederacy, so that  no American will be either humiliated or denigrated as they visit our  national parks.   The bill also ensures we provide resources to support our veterans,  so critical, and across the board, felt to be a moral responsibility.  We are standing with our servicemembers by prohibiting, frankly, the  President from stealing funds from our military in order to build this  wall that he said the Mexicans were going to pay for. Nobody believed  it then; nobody believes it now. And he is taking money from our  troops, from our military security, to build that wall.                                time  1445    I am proud that this bill continues America's strong and robust  support for our ally Israel.   In all, this is a funding package of which our country and this House  can be proud. It reflects our values and our principles, and it is  focused on governing responsibly and spending taxpayer resources  wisely.   Sadly, it will, in all likelihood, join the more than 275 other  bipartisan House bills languishing in the Republican-controlled Senate.  We have a lot of new judges; we just don't have legislation for the  people.   I urge the Senate to do its part to avoid even the risk of another  shutdown. Just a few 18 months ago, 19 months ago, we came into this  Congress with much of the Government of the United States shut down  because the previous Congress had not funded the government. I urge the  Senate to do its part. Let's get the job done together for the people.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair, I thank the ranking member, I thank  the staff on both sides of the aisle, and I thank Shalanda Young.
