 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Speier for organizing  this Special Order Hour to highlight how state abortion restrictions  impact  [[Page H8008]]  our nation's brave servicemembers and their families.   The military is a male-dominated institution where women make up only  20 percent of active-duty forces, and significantly less at senior  leadership levels. As a result, women's healthcare needs are cast  aside. TRICARE doesn't cover abortion services, except in cases of  rape, incest, or to save the mother's life, forcing servicemembers to  leave the military base to seek reproductive care.   With the upending of Roe, servicemembers in states that restrict  abortion must travel even further on their own dime to seek basic  reproductive healthcare, risking their career and standing in the  ranks. This is outrageous and wholly unacceptable. It sacrifices the  readiness of our troops and perpetuates a discriminatory environment  for women in the military.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Congresswoman Speier's  legislation, the MARCH for Servicemembers Act, to remove the statutory  ban on military treatment facilities providing abortion services and  Department of Defense funds being used to perform abortions.   I believe it is our collective responsibility to ensure that every  American who wears a uniform to defend our country has the health  services, opportunities, and care they need and deserve. This is a  promise we must keep, and I certainly will.
