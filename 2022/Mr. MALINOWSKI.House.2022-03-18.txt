 Madam Speaker, from war in Europe to pandemic around  the world to potential crisis in Asia, one of the lessons we are  learning is that America should never be dependent on strategic  adversaries like China or Russia for the goods most critical to our  economic and national security.   Whether it is PPE, pharmaceutical ingredients, microchips, or the  advanced battery technologies that will power the future, we must bring  our supply chains home.   We can do this by enacting into law the bipartisan supply chain  resiliency provisions in the America COMPETES Act.   This section of the bill, which I helped write, makes one of the  biggest investments to spur domestic manufacturing in our Nation's  history. It has been endorsed by the National Association of  Manufacturers, the United Steelworkers, the National Defense Industry  Association, and more than 20 organizations, and the list is growing  each day.   I urge that any competitiveness bill that goes to the President for  his signature include these important provisions in the America  COMPETES Act.                            ____________________
