 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the  thousands of patriots who are taking to the streets of towns and cities  throughout our Nation later today, taking to the streets to stand up,  to speak out, and to say no to yet another war in the Middle East.   Less than 48 hours ago, our Nation was gripped by fear as we watched  missiles rain down on our servicemembers and other allied forces in  Iraq, an attack that was a direct response to this administration's  reckless and impulsive decisions to assassinate a high-ranking military  leader in Iran.   Like so many of my colleagues, I prayed. I prayed for all of the  servicemembers and their families. I prayed for the innocent civilians  in Iraq who once again find themselves in the crossfire in a  battlefield of our own making. I prayed for peace.   But I also know perfectly well that the people of the Massachusetts  7th did not send me to Washington, D.C., to just pray. As a woman of  faith, I will continue to send prayers up and to work for peace. But  what this moment demands and what this country deserves is a strategy.   For more than 3 years now, this administration has been devoid of a  coherent approach, instead implementing our Nation's foreign policy  like a game of Battleship. They have actively incited further conflict  in the region, abandoned diplomacy, and isolated our country from even  our strongest allies.   The administration tore up the international agreement keeping Iran  from developing nuclear weapons. The administration then engaged in a  maximum pressure campaign that has ravaged the Iranian economy and  harmed innocent civilians.   Yesterday, the White House had the opportunity to change course.  Instead, we heard more of the same.   Let me be clear: We cannot allow our country to be lied into another  war. We have the opportunity to learn from the mistakes of our past.   For nearly two decades, endless wars have claimed the lives of  hundreds and thousands of civilians and servicemembers alike. An entire  generation has only known war. Millions of refugees have been  permanently displaced.   I remind my colleagues today that war is never inevitable. We reject  the false choice between peace and security.   The 116th Congress is a fundamentally different Congress, and it is  time to advocate for a fundamentally different foreign policy: foreign  policy centered in the dignity and humanity of all people.   Prayers alone will not suffice. We need prayers and strategy. This is  our chance. Let me be abundantly clear. The American people do not want  war.                            ____________________
