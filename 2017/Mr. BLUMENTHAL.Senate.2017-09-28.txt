 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am here for the third time in as  many days to talk about this Nation's response to a humanitarian crisis  affecting millions of Americans--the people  [[Page S6206]]  of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. It is similar to the situation  in Florida, in the gulf coast, and, some years ago, in Connecticut and  in other parts of this country when they faced a natural disaster that  was almost as devastating as an attack would be by a foreign power.  Analogous but different, this category 4 Hurricane Maria caused  consequences as devastating and destructive as any that man could do.  It is a natural disaster, not manmade, but it is turning into a manmade  disaster.   So far, the response from our government has been underwhelming. In  fact, it has been inadequate and anemic. It has been shamefully slow  and undersized and should be vastly upgraded and increased.   Just moments ago, I learned that Lieutenant General Buchanan has been  appointed to head the military efforts in Puerto Rico. That appointment  followed a call just an hour or so ago with all of the representatives,  including FEMA, the Department of Defense, other Federal agencies, and  the Red Cross, during which I urged our U.S. military to be mobilized,  much as we would be in responding to a natural disaster in Connecticut  or Texas or Florida or other places in this country on the mainland  where we have seen the same kind of storm.   The 3.4 million people in Puerto Rico are almost exactly the same  number as the population of Connecticut. I hope, and I believe, the  response would be better in Connecticut if we were to face the same  kind of natural disaster. Yet the manmade disaster is the failure to  move food, fuel, medicine, water, other necessities, and communications  equipment from the ports and the airports into the interior of the  country, even into the major cities, where currently apparently a lack  of drivers and passable roads make it all the more difficult. Whether  the supplies of food and fuel and medicine and water are adequate on  the island or need to be increased on an emergency basis and whether  there are sufficient shipments and airlifts going into the island, the  simple fact is that Puerto Rico faces a disaster--manmade after  natural.   I commend the loyal and dedicated people of FEMA and all of the  National Guard, including the National Guard of Connecticut, who have  performed with such heroism and dedication in the face of the most  difficult circumstances imaginable, but their efforts need to be  matched by many others. There are 4,500 American military personnel now  in Puerto Rico. Rather than 5,000, there should be 50,000 of our  National Guard, not to occupy the island, not to enforce martial law  but to make sure the logistics--the transportation, the means of  delivery of the lifeblood of that island in food and fuel and medicine  and water and other basic necessities--are sufficient to move those  basic supplies to the places they are needed. The troops who are there  now are performing heroic, Herculean work, and so are many volunteers,  along with FEMA officials, the Coast Guard, and others, but they need  more help.   Nearly a week after this storm, Maria, more than 90 percent of the  island's residents are without power, 42 percent have no water, the  vast majority of the country's 69 hospitals cannot function, and only  10 percent of the cell towers are working. If those conditions existed  in Connecticut, I would be on the floor 24 hours a day. Puerto Rico and  the Virgin Islands have no one here, and they have no elected  Representatives in the House of Representatives. They are voiceless or  at least voteless in this body. We need to stand for them, speak out,  and fight for them. That is why I am here for the third day in a row.   We need a plan and a strategy, which has been lacking from this  administration. In that phone call earlier today with FEMA officials  and the Department of Defense, I asked about a plan. They are working  on it. The military, U.S. Northern Command, is working on a plan. They  could not tell me when it will be ready or what it will say or what the  total number of troops or other logistical supplies will be nor could  they commit that there would be a waiver under FEMA regulations of the  C through G conditions, which apply to permanent recovery.   The only decision that has been made is A to B, which provides for  debris and other emergency responses over the next 180 days, and that  is part of what the island needs--a longer term plan as well as an  immediate one to make sure there is a road to recovery, that there is a  path that will provide hope. Not only is the well-being and health of  this island threatened but so is hope, which is so important for  progress to be made.   The people of Puerto Rico have been met with, at best, ambivalence  and ambiguity by the President of the United States. Earlier this week,  he seemed more inclined to blame the island itself and the size of the  ocean than in advocating for help. I hope we can come together on a  bipartisan basis. With the kind of situation that is there now--the  danger of epidemic as well as immediate health threats before disease  takes hold--we must act before people die. We must come to the aid of  Puerto Rico. They need medical care. They need access to food and safe  drinking water, and, yes, they need greater security.   The 78 mayors of Puerto Rico, along with the Governor, are doing also  heroic and Herculean work, but a whole of government response is  necessary from this body and from the Federal Government at a much  higher magnitude. In the long term, we must have a martial plan--a  strategy for rebuilding the island's roads, bridges, rail, airports,  ports, and VA facility, much as we do in this country, except that,  there, the need is so much more dire and immediate. Hospitals,  transportation, electricity, power, communications, safety, housing all  have been destroyed, and the consequences will be deadly.   My hope is that Lieutenant General Buchanan will expedite that plan.  So far, it has been lacking. It should be done today. It should be  integrated with the FEMA approach, and I hope they will permit visits  by Members of the Congress who, so far, have been prevented from going  there.   The American people deserve to have elected Representatives there  because Puerto Rico has none here. The extraordinary work done by the  cable TV and reporters for the print media and others who are there  have given us a picture--and often a picture is worth a thousand  words--of the devastation that now continues from a manmade disaster  that must be avoided before it takes lives and destroys hope.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.
