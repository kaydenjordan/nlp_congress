 Mr. President, a skilled workforce is essential to  addressing the growing cybersecurity challenges in the United States.  In both the public and private sectors, a shortage of skilled cyber  security professionals has hindered the Nation's cyber preparedness.  According to a 2017 Global Information Security Workforce Study, 1.8  million more cyber security professionals will be needed worldwide by  2022.   Data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management in 2015  highlighted the need for robust cyber security protections at the  Federal level, which include a strong and skilled workforce. Since  2001, the Federal Government has operated a cyber security education  program known as CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service. Thanks to great  leadership by Chairman John Thune and the U.S. Senate Committee on  Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Congress codified the CyberCorps  Program as part of the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014. Serving  roughly 70 institutions, the National Science Foundation, NSF, grants  award to institutions as part of the CyberCorps Program. Institutions  utilize grants to build capacity for cyber security programs and  provide scholarships to students. Scholarship recipients must fulfill a  service requirement in a federal, state or local government cyber  security job upon graduation.   In recent years, more community colleges have provided opportunities  for students to gain much needed cyber security skills. An October 2015  study by the National Academy for Public Administration reviewed the  CyberCorps Program and formulated major recommendations to improve it.  One of the Academy's recommendations was to include qualified 2-year  programs in the program regardless of their association with a 4-year  institution. Currently, NSF only provides scholarship awards to  students in 2-year programs who will transfer into a 4-year program.   Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleague Senator Roger  Wicker, the Cybersecurity Scholarship Opportunities Act of 2017. This  legislation will improve the federal cyber security workforce pipeline  by directing the CyberCorps Program to provide 5 percent of  scholarships to career changers and military veterans at qualified 2- year programs with no transfer requirement. The bill would also codify  CyberCorps' K-12 education program and align the skills required for  scholarship eligibility with the National Initiative for Cybersecurity  Education Framework.   In addition, the bill would enhance cyber security protection for  critical infrastructure by allowing CyberCorps graduates, on a case-by- case basis, to meet their service requirements in critical  infrastructure missions at government-affiliated entities like the  Tennessee Valley Authority. Just today, a report by the Massachusetts  Institute of Technology found that digital threats to U.S. critical  infrastructure demand attention and that the Nation does not produce  enough graduates with the skills to protect critical infrastructure. It  recommended that the President take steps to increase the supply of  skilled professionals. By allowing CyberCorps graduates to fulfill  service obligations in critical infrastructure missions, this  legislation represents an important step in the right direction.   The Cybersecurity Scholarship Opportunities Act is a commonsense,  bipartisan bill that would help students succeed and strengthen our  national security. There are cyber security jobs in Virginia and across  the country that are going unfilled, and it is clear we must make it  easier for students to access the programs that prepare them for these  roles.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself and Ms. Collins):   S. 743.
