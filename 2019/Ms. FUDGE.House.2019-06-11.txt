 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to read a letter from my  constituent, Pastor Dr. Ronald S. Williams.   Mr. Williams writes: ``A mobster, con man, gangster in the White  House? I think so.   ``This past week, Special Counsel Robert Mueller gave a verbal  synopsis of his 2-year investigative report. He is quoted as saying:  `If we had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a  crime, we would have said so.' He also said: `The Constitution requires  a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a  sitting President of wrongdoing.'   ``This process would be impeachment. The question is, why hasn't the  United States Congress started a formal impeachment investigation?   ``In our Nation's Pledge of Allegiance, we state that the United  States of America is `one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty  and justice for all.' Many of us have been taught to recite this pledge  since elementary school. Today's society compels one to ask the  question: Are we truly one nation under God?   ``Nancy Pelosi is a woman who I respect. However, I do believe her  hesitancy to impeach this President is her opinion, based upon polls  and her belief that it would further polarize the country. However, the  country is already divided and polarized, which can be greatly  contributed to the madness of the present executive administration of  the country.   ``As a pastor, a father, a grandfather, and a friend of many, my  answer to this question is, no, we are not.   ``I recently engaged in a conversation with a pastor's wife who  resided in the small community that I attended graduate school. I knew  the town was small and malignant with bigotry, ignorance, and racism.  As we conversed, I discovered that she, too, was a bigot. She stated  that the present administration was the `smartest and most intelligent  to ever reside in the White House.'   ``I asked her if she was out of her mind. `What about Roosevelt and  Kennedy?' she asked. I responded by asking her what was she talking  about. She responded by saying, `They exploited women, and it was Obama  that divided and polarized the Nation.'   ``I knew at that point that she was steeped in her ignorant opinion.  I responded by telling her that I was not alive during the Roosevelt  years and during the administration of John F. Kennedy we did not have  internet and the means of communication that we have today. Regardless,  at least they both were sophisticated statesmen who publicly presented  themselves as leaders. Secondly, the rightwing went after Clinton for  his indiscretions and Obama was scandal free.   ``It is glaringly apparent that many who support the present  administration are either racist, steeped in religious beliefs,  ignorant, or, as my mother used to say, `just plain dumb.' They have  chosen to support a president who has a proven record of being sexually  condescending to women, will not oppose the resurgence of the Ku Klux  Klan and other hate organizations, is indecisive, condescending to  anyone who challenges him, and hides behind his Twitter account, rather  than dealing with the real issues in our country and around the world,  and, to put icing on this cake, he is a proven liar.   ``I believe the crooked ascension of Trump to the Oval Office is a  gauge that measures the declining patriotic and moral values of many of  the citizens of America, as well as being the revelation of the hidden  bigotry, judgmental attitudes that yet exist in many of those who call  themselves evangelicals.   ``This President has surrounded himself with yes-men and -women who  apparently refuse to challenge his madness for fear of his wrath. I  believe I can safely assume that the United States is no longer a  democracy. A democratic government is one that is governed by the  people or their elected representatives. In 2 years, this man has  turned the tide and the Nation is spiraling downhill quickly.   ``My growing concern is that the Congress and Senate of these United  States have more of a personal interest for themselves rather than a  patriotic duty to the people they represent. The Republicans appear to  have become a Trump cult, and the Democrats refuse to move against this  man in a collective, decisive way.   ``I remember the time that we were guided by principle and not by  party. Congress, Senators, you were not elected to collect a paycheck,  you were elected to be women and men of principle and maintain the  health of a Democratic nation.   ``It does not take a genius to discern that this man wants to be a  dictator in the truest sense of the word. He appears to be drawn to the  evil of tyrannical dictators and is alienating our country from our  closest and most trusted allies. This President praises the leaders of  Russia and North Korea, while at the same time has been condescending  to the leaders of Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany, just to name  a few. Something is wrong with this.   ``Despite all of this, there are still many, including evangelicals  and people of color, who are resolute in their support of this  administration.   ``Thomas Paine wrote:''         Men must conquer their own spirits. Even in the shadows of       the guillotine, we must preserve and endure in spite of the       threat.
