 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Anthony  Gallopo--a dear friend, a wonderful, caring family man, a leader in  Sussex County, and a tireless fighter for his fellow veterans--who  recently passed from COVID-19 complications.   A Navy veteran, Tony served as vice commander of the New Jersey  American Legion and commander of Post 86 in Newton. For more than 5  years, Tony and I worked together to deliver the care and services that  our veterans deserve: securing the long-awaited goal of the community's  first VA outpatient clinic, boosting in-person psychiatric care at the  clinic, and serving on our district's service academy selection  committee, all focused on improving access to care for those who fought  for our great country and preparing the next generation.   Tony lived a life of service that will truly never be forgotten. We  are indebted to this selfless patriot, all of us in northern New Jersey  and the country.   As we mourn Tony's loss, we think of his daughters, Sarah, Alexandra,  and Ashley, and we pray for his beloved wife, Betsy, who remains in the  hospital.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering my friend,  Tony Gallopo.                            ____________________
