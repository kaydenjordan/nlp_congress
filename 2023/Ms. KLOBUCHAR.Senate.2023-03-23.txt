 Mr. President, I rise to recognize Anthony Williams's  decades of service with the U.S. Postal Service. Nearly 43 years ago,  Mr. Williams began as a city carrier at the Rice Street Station in St.  Paul, MN, and on March 3, 2023, he retired as the Minnesota-North  Dakota district manager. During that time, Mr. Williams supported the  Postal Service in its work processing and delivering 425 million pieces  of mail each day, including everything from Social Security checks and  life-saving prescriptions, to birthday and graduation cards.   When I think about Anthony's time with the U.S. Postal Service, I  will always think about his commitment to problem-solving. In the face  of polar vortexes, staffing shortages, and a global pandemic, he always  found a way to regroup, examine the situation, and do what needed to be  done to get Minnesotans and North Dakotans their mail.   While in a practical sense the U.S. Postal Service brings us our  letters and packages, as the only organization with the logistical  capability to reach every address in the Nation, it also brings our  country together. That is the heart of what Anthony did through his  decades of service, and I will always be grateful.   I hope that Anthony gets some much deserved rest and time with Cindy  in retirement, and if I ever need to reach him, I know he is just a  stamp away.                            ____________________
