 Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from  Arizona, Senator Sinema, in introducing legislation to support the  operation of a national child abuse hotline. Of all the major national  help hotlines, the crisis line for child abuse and neglect, which is  currently operated by a national nonprofit, is the only one without a  federal authorization and dedicated federal funding. Our bill, the  National Child Abuse Help Hotline Act of 2020, would give the  Administration for Children and Families the authority to award a grant  to a national nonprofit to support a hotline dedicated to the  prevention and intervention of child abuse and neglect. The child abuse  and neglect crisis happening across the United States has only been  exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.   On average, five children die every day from child abuse and neglect.  According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Child  Maltreatment Report, which was published in January 2020 and reflects  2018 figures, 678,000 children were victims of maltreatment in 2018 and  a heartbreaking 1,770 children died--including three in Maine. These  statistics reflect an unfortunate increase in both child fatalities and  victims of maltreatment, and is the first increase for the number of  victims who suffered maltreatment since 2015.   Access to prevention and intervention services nationwide has only  become more critical in the face of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The  current crisis threatens to severely exacerbate child abuse and  neglect, and a number of experts predict that child abuse is currently  being underreported. In Maine, when schools closed their doors on March  16 and stay-at-home orders went in place, calls to Maine Child and  Family Services decreased immediately, falling 32 percent in the first  month. Of note, only seven percent of calls were from school personnel,  which is a dramatic drop from the 22 percent of teachers and other  school staff--more than any other group--who call in typically to  report abuse and neglect.   With stay-at-home orders, school closures, and high unemployment,  families are experiencing financial stress, isolation, and new  anxieties at the very time when children have less exposure to  mandatory reporters--such as teachers, physicians, and coaches--and  safe environments where one may normally escape or seek help. In April,  Dr. Larry Ricci, a child abuse pediatrician at Spurwink, located in  Portland, Maine, said ``our sense is that not only is abuse still  happening at the same rate it was happening before, in all likelihood  it has increased.'' Dr. Ricci pointed out that ``We've known for many  years that the abuse rate mirrors the unemployment rate.'' And as  Michelle Fingerman, Vice President for Childhelp, a national nonprofit  and the current operator of the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline  located in Arizona, details: ``There is a wide range of fallout from  pandemic anxiety and school shutdowns. There is more abuse already  occurring in homes where caregivers are melting down from the stress,  children are trapped at home with abusers, schools and daycare are  closed, and therapists and other frontline providers are now more  difficult to access.''   During a time when children are not going to school, day care, or  family resource centers, and, therefore, traditional resources may not  be as easily accessible, the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline is  a resource that is accessible to children and families across the  country. The hotline, 1-800-4-A-CHILD, saw call volume increase by 33  percent from February to May. Childhelp's text and online chat  platform, which is supported by a $1 million ACF Innovation Grant that  I have advocated for as a member of the Appropriations Committee,  experienced a 66 percent increase in outreach since February.   The helpline importantly serves a wide range of individuals in every  single state--at-risk children, distressed parents seeking crisis  intervention, and concerned individuals who suspect that child abuse  may be occurring. In Maine, where one in every 71 children is a victim  of abuse, the National Child Abuse Hotline assisted nearly 200 callers  in fiscal year 2019. Those in need are connected--either on the phone  or by text or online chat--with masters-level social workers who are  there to offer confidential crisis intervention and information,  literature, and referrals to emergency, social service, and support  resources.   The bill we are introducing today would provide a small but  meaningful federal investment to protect children across the country-- authorizing $1 million annually for the Administration for Children and  Families (ACF) to award a grant to a nonprofit entity to support a 24- hour, national, toll-free telephone hotline that will provide  information and assistance to victims of  [[Page S4547]]  child abuse or neglect, parents, caregivers, mandated reporters, and  other concerned community members. This does not interfere with any  state-mandated reporter hotlines and can be a resource for these  individuals. In fact, the current operator has more than 80 community  partners in just Maine alone.   The helpline's dedication to the prevention and intervention of child  abuse and neglect is both successful and well-documented, and more  federal support for this resource will improve our ability to reach  children of all ages, as well as parents or caregivers in need. During  a time when these supports are needed more there an ever, I believe the  existing infrastructure and experience of the National Child Abuse  Hotline should be used. Even with just more outreach and  communications, we could better support the needs of children and  families during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and economic recovery.  Action and investment now can help prevent the worst possible outcome-- letting children fall through the cracks during an already traumatizing  crisis.   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to put the welfare of our  nation's children at the forefront of our national Covid-19 response  and to support the adoption of this important legislation, which will  benefit children and families in the age of Covid-19, as well as after  this pandemic passes.   Thank you, Mr. President.                                  ______                                         By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Lee, and Ms.          Klobuchar):   S. 4346.
