 Madam Speaker, 1 week ago today, I was trapped in this  House Chamber as the banging on the doors began. I feared for  colleagues, reporters, and staff. I feared for myself. The attack on  the Capitol will never be forgotten.   The President and many in this Chamber have shamelessly peddled  dangerous untruths about the election, despite the warnings of where  those lies would lead. Last Wednesday, those lies and dangers found  themselves inside this Capitol.    This hateful rhetoric is another deadly virus. It is time to remove  it from its host. To heal, we need accountability and truth. That  begins by acknowledging the President's dangerous lies and their deadly  consequences. Removing Donald Trump is the beginning of restoring  decency and democracy. What happened last week will not be forgotten,  and what we do this week will long be remembered. Vote ``yes'' on  impeachment.
