 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give special  recognition to the members of the Democratic Caucus who have been able  to accomplish many things in spite of the sound and fury of the  dysfunctional politics in a small and vocal part of the House  Republican Conference. As I stand here in the people's House I am  struck by how much congressional leadership matters and how divided the  118th Congress has been.   We have been here, without question, living in perilous times. In  times like these what we do in this Chamber matters in the lives of  American people.   The people of our district did not send us here to perform theatrical  acts. They did not send us here to posture for the cameras. None of us  were elected here so that we could increase the status and the stature  of our personal media profiles. Yet that seems to be the total measure  of what this Congress has amounted to.   The 118th Congress and the year of 2023 have been unprecedented.  Earlier this year, leader Hakeem Jeffries made history as the first man  of African descent to be elected the leader of a major political party.   Nevertheless, almost immediately chaos erupted. The Speaker's vote  was a mess. Speaker Emeritus McCarthy was elected after 15 rounds of  votes, 15 rounds. It was the first time in a century that election of a  House Speaker took multiple ballots to complete, and it was the longest  vote in the United States' history since 1855 lasting 133 rounds just  over 2 months.   I will say, though, that our honorable leader, Hakeem Jeffries, did  receive 3,179 votes for Speaker across 15 rounds.   The hits just kept coming as we rolled into the spring. At the end of  March, we reached a new milestone, the People of the State of New York  v. Donald J. Trump marked the first time--after four indictments  against President Trump--that we have ever seen in our country's  history a former President indicted on criminal charges.   As the weather got warmer, temperatures flared. Some wanted to take  our national debt hostage. To be clear, this is money the Congress had  already appropriated, and with a bipartisan coalition we managed to  avert an economic calamity and an economic shutdown.   Fast-forward to the fall, and many of the same issues arose again.  Then Speaker McCarthy was confronted with an unruly small group who  were willing to shut down the government after the debt ceiling debate.  For keeping the government open, Speaker McCarthy became the first  Speaker in the House to ever be removed. The chaos that ensued was  brutal. The House went without a Speaker for 23 days, the longest since  1961.   A marathon 10-week session that tested everyone's patience produced  only frustration and anger. There is a reason we have had a record  number of retirements from the Members of Congress at every level that  we have not seen in a decade. Thirteen Senators and Representatives  have already announced they are not seeking reelection in just the  month of November. This is the highest number of retirements we have  seen in this body in more than a decade.   This should not surprise us because dysfunction is a bitter pill to  swallow, and I say that broadly because that dysfunction is not limited  to this Chamber or to the House of Representatives.                                time  2015    Over in the Senate, Senator Tuberville stood in the way of over 400  senior military officers that deserved promotion and the dignity of all  of their ranks and their compensation. He held up 400 officers, putting  our Nation's security at risk. One United States Senator thought his  understanding of what was right should supersede the will of 99 other  United States Senators.   More than that, this one Senator spent most of the year subjecting  the United States military and members of the armed services to the  detrimental effects of his personal whims and wishes. He had no regard  for the families he put in jeopardy who risk their lives every day for  our citizenry. He showed no concern for the hard work and dedication of  these military officers who have focused their careers on protecting  and serving our Nation.   Perhaps most of all, this United States Senator tried to impose his  morality on 1.4 million active military personnel in the armed services  without their consent and without the advice of their commanding  officers.   Senator Tuberville's story is instructive of what happens when we  come together and do the right thing. Just last week, he folded. As a  man of faith, I pray that the second part of the 118th Congress is more  productive than the first. With only 21 bills that have been passed  into law at the halfway point of this Congress, it is on pace to be the  most sluggish Congress since our predecessors met in 1931 and 1932, but  let's stay positive and hopeful.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from the great  State of Louisiana, Congressman Troy Carter.    Mr. Speaker, as I stand on this floor  tonight, I do so as someone painfully aware of the serious times we are  living in. Let the word go forth in this time and place that this  Nation and, indeed, this entire world stands on the precipice of  unregulated conflict.   From Civil War in the Congo, to the war in Ukraine, to Israel's war  with Hamas in the Middle East, the Earth is saturated with violence and  recrimination and as in the case of all wars, people are dying.   Tens of thousands of innocent people have lost their lives. People  who have nothing to do with governmental policies that send men and  women into battle are no less the victims of those momentous decisions.  Israeli babies, Palestinian babies, Congolese babies, and Ukrainian  children all deserve to live in a world where they are, not judged by  the details of their religion or the color of their skin. Yet, this is  not the world that they were born into.   I stand here tonight concerned about the state of our civilization. I  stand here tonight concerned about the role this country plays in being  promoters of peace. I come here to this well bothered by the rise and  the almost unfettered proliferation of anti-Semitism.   It should never be the case that a Jewish person in this country  feels like their lives are under threat because they are Jewish.   We cannot allow the children of Einstein, Oppenheimer, and Rabbi  Abraham Joshua Heschel to feel as if they have no place in this  country. There can be no moral equivocation when it comes to anti- Semitism in the way that this could be a moral equivocation when it  comes to racism. Racism and anti-Semitism travel together because they  are two sides of the same coin.   History is repeat with the evidence to prove that societies that  begin with one will evidently end up with the other. Where there is  anti-Semitism, racism is sure to follow. Where there is racism, there  will ultimately be anti-Semitism as well.   We know this is the case because hatred knows no bounds, bigotry  respects no limits, and ironically prejudice does not discriminate.   The moment you release one into the universe of our consciousness,  the other will invariably come knocking at the door. That is why those  of us who are leaders in this country must be clear about where we  stand with respect to anti-Semitism. Whatever challenges people may  have with policies conducted by the government of Israel, those  concerns must not be used to avoid the absolute rejection of anti- Semitism as a plausible, cultural, or political solution.   I say this as a Black man living in America who has had a  multiplicity of concerns about the policies of my own government. Black  people in America have had 400 years of learning how to separate  policies from people. While it is intelligent to question all  governments, it is not, however, acceptable to allow corrosive  influences to convince us that anti-Semitism is a liberating political  project because it is not, nor has it ever been, and neither will it  ever be.   I don't care what anyone says: Black lives matter, Jewish lives are  sacred, and Palestinian lives are important because all life comes from  God.   Anti-Semitism is a vile and repulsive preoccupation with hatred that  has more than once manifested itself with horrific consequences. I  stand here today doubly concerned because influences and, in some  cases, influencers have provided the permission and the structure for  people who are themselves the object of hate to participate in the  hatred of our Jewish brothers and sisters.   We simply cannot allow this to happen. We must declare in no  uncertain terms that right is right and wrong is wrong, and that it is  wrong to hate people. It is wrong to treat people like they are beneath  you. It is wrong to act like people are outside of the human family  because they pray differently. We here tonight must be highly resolved  that this country is to be the oasis of tolerance amid a vast desert of  discrimination.   We say no to anti-Semitism, we say no to anti-Black racism, and we  say no to anything that would subject any human being to dehumanizing  language in treatment.   I encourage the people of this country to hold fast to the principles  of this Christmas season in which we find ourselves. Whether you are  Christian or not, the principles of this season are enduring and a  great degree universal.   The idea that peace should be the function of our politics is  something all of us should embrace. The notion that the birth of love  is the only thing that can save us is something that no  [[Page H6810]]  one should be willing to reject. In the words of Reverend Martin Luther  King, he called us a ``beloved community,'' I submit to you tonight  that it is this very thing that compels me to be a Member of this body.   I still believe that what self-centered men have torn down, men and  women who are other-centered can build up again. I still believe that  truth crush down to Earth can still rise again, and I still believe  that if we stand up for one another, that is the only way we can have  our salvation. None of us would be brutalized when we learn to love.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford), the  honorable and distinguished Congressional Black Caucus Chairman.                                time  2030     Mr. Speaker, I give a very special thank you  to the Honorable Congressman   Steven Horsford, the chairman of the  Congressional Black Caucus. I thank him for his leadership and his  outstanding voice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
