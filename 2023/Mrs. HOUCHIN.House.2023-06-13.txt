 Mr. Speaker, Kovener's Korner Ice Cream has been a  summertime staple in Seymour, Indiana, for decades. In fact, Kovener's  Korner opened in 1949 as one of Seymour's very first drive-in  restaurants, serving up sweet treats and their famous chocolate malt- flavored ice cream.   During its 75 years in business, this family-owned brick store on 2nd  Street has employed hundreds of Hoosiers, with the majority being young  adults in high school or college.   As we celebrate their 75th season, I am bringing well-deserved  appreciation all the way from the House floor. I thank them for not  only their delicious ice cream, but their commitment to the community  and a summertime tradition for generations of families in Seymour.   We are proud to have so many special small businesses in southern  Indiana, and Kovener's Korner is an exceptional example.                            ____________________
