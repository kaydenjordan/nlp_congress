 Mr. Speaker, in 2013, Eric Williams was working as a  correctional officer at USP Canaan when he was savagely murdered by an  inmate who was already serving a life sentence. A jury later found the  inmate guilty of Eric's murder, but because 1 out of 12 jurors voted  against the death penalty, he faced no additional penalty for this  crime. Such an outcome is unacceptable in our legal system. Officer  Williams' tragic killing reveals a glaring injustice for victims of  violent crime.   That is why I reintroduced Eric's Law this week, which would permit  prosecutors to impanel a second jury for sentencing in a death penalty  case when the first jury fails to deliver a unanimous verdict.   Officer Williams died protecting our community, and we owe it to him  and others like him to punish the violent criminals who commit these  acts. Though we will never be able to rid our society of heinous crimes  or acts of violence, this bill is a step in the right direction to  ensure victims and their families have every opportunity to pursue the  justice they deserve.                            ____________________
