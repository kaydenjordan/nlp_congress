 Madam Speaker, I understand the importance of passing  legislation that will make much-needed investment in our Nation's  infrastructure. And as the representative of the Virgin Islands, a  place where modern infrastructure resilience to climate change is  needed, I am committed to making that happen.   President Biden's Build Back Better agenda is not just about fixing  our Nation's crumbling infrastructure, it is also about strengthening  the economy, creating jobs, helping Americans afford the rising cost of  living. These critical investments will not be possible without passage  of a budget resolution.   Passage of a budget resolution gives House Democrats the opportunity  to make sure we are not just investing in infrastructure, but also  reducing carbon emission, restoring transit funding, reconnecting  neighborhoods, and ensuring climate-resilient and affordable investment  in our crumbling wastewater infrastructure, all of which are needed in  my home.   Ensuring a bicameral reconciliation process, with input from the  people's House prior to the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure  legislation, is essential to advancing critical American priorities on  infrastructure and so much more. That is why I know Democrats will work  together and take the first step to enact a budget resolution this  week.                            ____________________
