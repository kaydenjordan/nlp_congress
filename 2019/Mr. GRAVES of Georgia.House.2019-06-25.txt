 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today to express some concerns and opposition to the current  bill before us, the Financial Services and General Government  appropriations bill.   First, before I get into some of the highlights of our opposition, I  have been through this process before last year as chairman of this  subcommittee, so I truly understand and am aware of the hard work that  Mr. Quigley and his team have put into this bill, and I commend them  for navigating a process that is not easy and making it to this point  that we are here today.   Now, while I don't support every piece of this bill, I certainly  value the approach that Chairman Quigley took and the strong working  relationship that he and I have both had over the years and continue to  have.   The bill we are addressing includes, I will say, a few key priorities  that have been really important to my Republican colleagues and myself,  and we appreciate that and look forward to supporting those in the  future. And it does strike a bit of a bipartisan tone in a way that I  know that we all appreciate, and our constituents value the most, and,  quite frankly, we could use a little bit more of that around here. And  I know you would agree with that, Mr. Chairman.   Now, while this is a really good starting point, and that is how I  will characterize where we are today, we are at a starting point, a  small foundation that we can build from, the bill, as drafted, is just  not something that I can support at this time, nor my Republican  colleagues, but I would like to highlight some of the areas that I  think we need to work on.   First and foremost, if we were to have a budget agreement--and that  is a big if, because there is a lot of discussion about budget  agreements, but there has certainly not been any movement, and that is  one of the bigger problems the new majority has, is navigating the  budget process, seeing how a budget hasn't even been passed out of  committee.   This bill will continue the spending that our Nation has seen at a  skyrocketing fashion, one that we just  [[Page H5106]]  don't need to accept. The total level of discretionary spending under  this bill increases by 8 percent over last year. That is a significant  number. Last year, when I was chair, we were proposing cutting this  bill by 5 percent, and this year we are 13 points different, going up 8  percent, which is nearly a $2 billion increase.   Secondly, this bill blocks the administration from doing what they  are so focused on right now, and that is securing this Nation and our  country, particularly at the southern border. I am sure we will hear  later this week if the new majority gets the votes to bring a bill to  the floor about a border supplemental, but you have to ask yourself,  why do we even need that supplemental?   We had an opportunity earlier this year with the conference committee  report to provide the funds the administration requested, and yet the  new majority rejected that then, and now comes forward with a  supplemental, but while at the same time, ironically, obstructing the  spending of the administration currently from spending funds to secure  the border through this bill.   So the irony of the failure of the conference committee report, the  inability to get a supplemental to the floor for a vote this week, but  yet refusing to allow the administration to secure the border through  this bill in addition, so it is ironic, and that is something that we  certainly would like to see restored.   But also, this would remove any oversight and accountability that  this body has over the District of Columbia.   The District of Columbia is not like a city in any of our States. It  is a district. It is a different entity under a different charter, of  which the greatest Nation on the planet's capital exists, and I believe  we should continue that oversight, but yet this gives the District of  Columbia a blank checkbook here.   Then next I would say, you know, we have talked about bipartisanship.  This bill does omit some longstanding bipartisan provisions that we  have always agreed on, and I am not sure why we would object to them  today, or why the new majority would object to them today, but one, in  particular, is to allow taxpayer funding for the ending of the lives of  the innocent unborn.   Mr. Chairman, I don't know why we would go there today when year  after year after year, Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate,  have always come together and said those lives are precious and we  should protect them from the use of taxpayer funds being used to  eliminate their life.   And then I am concerned that the bill as it is currently written  would force schools to withdraw from the Opportunity Scholarship  Program. One of the great successes this body has enjoyed over the  years is celebrating in the success of children of the District of  Columbia benefiting from a scholarship program, to see their lives  improved and enriched and move on into a better future. In fact, the  scholarship program has a great record of success, with 98 percent of  12th grade students participating graduating, a 98 percent graduation  rate. Eighty-six percent of them are accepted to a 2- or 4-year college  after graduation.   We should not be making it harder for these schools to operate. We  shouldn't be making it harder for kids to be able to enjoy this  opportunity. In fact, quite frankly, it is just an assault on the low- income children right here in the District of Columbia.   It is also disappointing that this bill drops a long-standing  prohibition against requiring contractors to disclose campaign  contributions as a part of the Federal procurement process.   This process should be about getting the best service by the best  company for the best price for the American people, the best to assist  our constituents. Instead, now, if the provision as it is stated in  this bill continues, we might be creating a new higher bidder scenario  in which it is the highest bidder of political contributions going to a  company might get the bid instead of something different, such as the  best price from the best company for the best service.   Now, we all know that these are poison pills that Members of both  sides shouldn't be forced to swallow here today.    As long as this bill is fashioned in this manner, Mr. Chairman, we  know that it is not going to be signed into law. Just yesterday  President Trump said that if this bill were on his desk in this current  form, he would veto this legislation.   So I know we are going to have a robust debate today, and maybe we  can improve upon this foundation, but with the Federal debt exceeding  $22 trillion, we just can't afford to spend more. We don't need to  spend more on general governmental activities. Just because we can  spend it doesn't mean we should, nor should we spend it at any time in  the future when we have the opportunity to cut, and instead, today here  we are spending more.   So it is up to us. Let's set the example, Mr. Chairman. Let's leave  this country's pocketbook in better shape for our kids and our  grandkids.   Mr. Chair, as I close, I do want to finish on a positive note,  because we do have a great working relationship. I want to thank  Chairman Quigley. I want to thank his team. They have addressed some of  the priorities that are important to us, and they have crafted a small  foundation which I know we can all work from in the days ahead.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the chairwoman,  Mrs. Lowey. She has done a great job this year with the committee, and  she is absolutely right in congratulating Mr. Quigley on his good work  this year.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Granger), our Republican leader of the full Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate Mr. Serrano's years  of work on the subcommittee as well as his leadership on the Commerce,  Justice, and Science Committee. It has been a joy to work with him and  learn from him over the years. We are going to miss his presence after  this term, as I know he has announced he is not running for reelection.   I now yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Foxx), the Republican leader of the Education and Labor Committee.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to just highlight one little point there.  I really enjoy working with Mrs. Torres. She is a great addition to the  committee this year and spends a lot of time in the Rules Committee, so  she hears a lot of the different issues that we all discuss. But the  forfeiture fund--I think this is a really important point to  highlight--wouldn't necessarily go to local law enforcement. These are  funds that are collected from criminals that the administration was  going to use to stop criminals.   What better way to secure our Nation than using the funds that have  been forfeited by criminals to stop future criminals. This bill  eliminates that ability of the administration to do that. I feel like  that was $290-plus million that could go to better invest in securing  our southern border and, unfortunately, this bill has removed that.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I know we are reaching the conclusion here of general  debate of the bill. We have heard certainly some positives about the  bill and we have heard some negatives about the bill. I think there is  a great opportunity to work together and build upon the foundation in  which there is agreement. But until then, there are certainly items  that there is strong disagreement on.   In summary, working with Mr. Quigley has been fantastic. He has done  a great job of getting us to this point. I know, under his leadership,  we will continue working together until we can have a product that  Republicans and Democrats alike can support, can get through the  Senate, and, yes, needs the signature of the President of the United  States, Donald Trump.   But as the bill stands today, I guess if I had to sum it up, if you  want to spend a lot more, if you want to weaken our national security,  if you want to wash your hands of oversight and accountability of  Washington, D.C.--the District of Columbia, here where we reside and so  many of our constituents come to visit--or maybe, more importantly, if  you really want to limit the access of low-income children from  enjoying and benefiting from one of the  [[Page H5110]]  best educations they could receive, then this is the bill for you, but  it is not the bill for us.   We believe that we can reduce spending. We believe that national  security should be a priority. We believe that D.C. does deserve some  oversight. And we certainly believe that low-income children deserve  the best opportunity that they can have to have the best education  possible that provides them the best future that their dreams are  imagining right now, but this bill just doesn't provide that.   Mr. Chairman, it is for those reasons that I can't support this.   Lastly, I would say, knowing that this bill would never become law, I  think that should cause us all to just pause for a second and go: Do  you know what? Maybe we should take it back and go back to the drawing  board to see if we can't find some more areas of agreement and build a  better product in which Republicans and Democrats alike could support,  the Senate could pass with 60 votes, and the President of the United  States could sign.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to  the amendment here.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate Mr. Pocan and his  concerns for rural America.   I represent a very rural district as well, and broadband and others  are very challenging, even in our region. But one has to ask: If we  have had this Universal Service Fund for so many years with such an  exorbitant amount of money being collected from our constituents, then  why do we still have this problem?   And that is why I would suggest we oppose this amendment and allow  the FCC to study what is going on here and are these funds being used  appropriately or not. In fact, it is my understanding that the FCC has  identified that there are no budgeting constraints; there is no top- line budget whatsoever. And when they are doing considerations and  studies or analyzing the use of funds, there are really no  measurements, no benchmarks.   I think this is a really good opportunity for us to allow them to at  least move forward into this process, and just thinking of the Chairman  of the Commission, Ajit Pai is from Kansas himself, and I think he  understands the needs and the concerns of rural America as well.   But, ultimately, it is not fair to the American consumers, our  constituents, who are the ratepayers, who are paying into this fund on  every bill that they receive and yet are not being delivered the  service that I think we all expect in this day and age of new  technology.   Mr. Chair, with that, I am in opposition to the amendment and ask  that we vote this amendment down and allow the Commission to move  forward to study this and to provide more and better access to rural  broadband across America.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  gentleman's amendment. I am glad he has brought this forward to  highlight a few things.   Mrs. Torres said earlier these funds could be used to assist local  law enforcement. In fact, they can't. These are excess funds. And the  statute clearly says ``to be transferred to Federal agencies for law  enforcement purposes.'' That is what the administration was using them  for.   A little bit of a history lesson. The last 6 months, we went through  a government shutdown because of this issue.   We had a Homeland Security Conference Committee report that was  supposed to resolve this issue, so deficient that the President  declared it a national emergency, relating to this.   Now we are having to have a supplemental budget discussion to deal  with this very same issue while restricting the administration's access  to these funds to address this very issue.   Mr. Chair, because of those reasons, I support the gentleman's  amendment and ask for adoption.                                time  1600     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, in the words of a great orator here  on the floor of the House, Mr. Quigley, ``Just because we can  micromanage them doesn't mean we should.''   This is a great example of it here. He was absolutely right, as it  pertains to this.   Last August, the USDA sought interest from U.S. towns, cities, and  regions from all over the country to host two highly respected USDA  research agencies. In October, they received interest from 136 unique  locations in 35 States to host these two Federal agencies.   After a thorough analysis seeing the diverse, qualified applicants  and quality of life, USDA chose three locations and then selected the  St. Louis area.   Now, this wasn't just on a whim. In fact, it was Ernst & Young that  did an analysis that said this would be a savings of $300 million to  the taxpayers and the employees of the Federal Government.   The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority to make this move, and  he did so on behalf of the public's interest, the American people.    There was a time when physically housing Federal agencies here in  Washington, D.C., was necessary. However, I think we all know, in the  use of new technology, the advancements that we have today, it has  opened up the possibilities for these two and many other Federal  agencies to operate efficiently in almost anyplace in our country,  except for maybe Mr. Pocan's district because of the lack of rural  broadband.   Why should we oppose this move of two agriculture research agencies  to the heartland? Think about it, to the heartland where agencies can  recruit from a greater pool, a greater source of agricultural  economists, and operate closer to the farmers, the ranchers, the  producers, and the rural economies.   Why would we want to stop the agency from doing that? Saving taxpayer  dollars and the dollars of our Federal employees makes perfect sense to  me, and it is because of those reasons that I will urge a ``no'' vote  on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I will close with this: This is not  a political decision. This is a good-government decision. If this were  a political decision, the Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, from  the State of Georgia, who was in the agriculture profession himself in  the past, would have moved it to the State of Georgia, I would assume,  if it was a political decision.   If everything had to reside in D.C., I guess we wouldn't need  research facilities of other agencies elsewhere. We wouldn't need the  FBI located in other spots. We wouldn't have the majority leader  proposing to move the FBI out of Washington, D.C., might I add, to  Maryland, of all places. Maybe that is a little more political, but  maybe not.   This is not a political decision. This is about making a good- government decision, closer to the farmers, to the researchers, to the  universities, and to the ranchers. It might save $300 million of  taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Chair, because of those reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
