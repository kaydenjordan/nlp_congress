 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an issue that is very  troubling. It is an issue that needs to be addressed.   You see, I rise today because of the outrage and shock that Brett  Favre stole money that was supposed to be used to buy formula for  babies in Mississippi to build a volleyball stadium at the school his  daughter played at.   Today, I join the calls of millions of Americans demanding that he  and the corrupt Mississippi Republican Governor be held accountable for  this action.   Brett Favre is a millionaire. In a 20-year football career, he made  over $100 million. It would take an average Mississippian 20 years to  make just $1 million.   Instead of coming out of his own pocket, he used his power,  influence, and relationships with corrupt Republican lawmakers to steal  the money from those in Mississippi who need it the most. His actions  were criminal, shameful, reckless, and irresponsible.   Brett Favre is from Mississippi. One might think he should have cared  that his home State is one of the poorest in the Nation and suffers  from one of the highest rates of child poverty in this country.   He should have cared that one in every five Mississippians lives in  extreme poverty. One might think that he should have cared that in  Jackson, Mississippi, the capital, almost 25 percent of the households  depend on minimum wage. In these families, most earn less than $15,000  a year.   One might think he should have cared that hundreds of thousands of  Mississippians often have to boil their water due to the corruption and  the neglect by the leadership in Mississippi, the Republican  leadership, neglect that Brett Favre was a key and influential factor  of, neglect that he and the corrupt Governor benefited from, but Brett  didn't care.   In July 2019, Brett texted Governor Bryant, telling him how much he  loved Nancy New and John Davis for what they did for him and Southern  Miss.                                time  1215    He called the theft of funds amazing.   Governor Bryant knew that the money could have been used to provide  thousands of low-income families with a year's worth of rent. He knew  that it could have covered the cost of their electricity and their  childcare bills. He knew that it could have provided thousands of  Mississippi families with as many as nine meals a day.   But they didn't care. They didn't care that year after year many of  Mississippi's most vulnerable people can't shower, cook, or bathe for  weeks on end due to the systemic neglect in their water system.   In a report released earlier this month by Vox, Benji Jones explained  the water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, perfectly. He wrote:  ``However, infrastructure is often poorly maintained or intentionally  overlooked in particular places, leading to a lack of access,  affordability, and safety for many communities of color.''   Brett and Governor Bryant intentionally overlooked the needs of  Mississippi's poor people for a volleyball stadium. Perhaps this New  York Times headline says it best: Brett Favre's most memorable stat may  now be the $8 million he helped steal from the poor.    Mr. Speaker, this is a travesty in this country to take  from the poorest of the poor and to neglect what they have done. Brett  Favre and that government should atone and pay for what they have done.
