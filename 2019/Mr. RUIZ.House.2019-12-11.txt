 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   We already have hundreds of drugs in the market that millions of  Americans do not have access to and cannot get because they are not  affordable. Seniors in my district are walking out of the pharmacy  without their medication after seeing the out-of-pocket costs and  saying to themselves they can't afford it.   Many seniors are choosing between eating and buying their groceries  versus taking their medications. They are not taking the medicine that  they need, which puts their health and their lives at risk.   I have heard from seniors in my district who face up to $6,000 a  month in out-of-pocket costs for their medicine. To quote one  constituent of mine: ``Prescription and healthcare costs are an  astronomical burden.'' To quote another: ``Necessary medication should  not be treated as a luxury.''   We must bring down the outrageous out-of-pocket costs plaguing our  seniors and families. H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lowering Drug  Costs Now Act, finally answers the call to bring down out-of-control  costs.                                time  1900    It does so by empowering Medicare, for the first time ever, to  negotiate lower drug prices with Big Pharma, which will lower costs for  not only seniors, but also American families with private health  insurance.   It does so by limiting out-of-pocket costs to no more than $2,000 a  year for seniors--very important to seniors needing expensive  medication.   It does so by strengthening Medicare, delivering vision, dental, and  hearing benefits for seniors across this country.   Every Member of the House should do the right thing for seniors and  American families: pass H.R. 3.   Senate Majority Leader McConnell should do his job and bring this  legislation up for a vote immediately so that we can strengthen  Medicare for seniors and lower the cost of medicine for American  families.
