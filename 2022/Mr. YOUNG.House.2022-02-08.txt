 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Comer and Mrs. Maloney. This is a  good bill.   I have been working on this program for, actually, 48 years. I was  here when they stopped the post office, when we used to run it, and we  caused this mess. You guys are cleaning it up. I want my colleagues to  know this is the right way to go for the post office.   Now, you may wonder why I am so excited about this bill. Try living  in Alaska when you don't have any roads. Try not having anything but  the post office. Try to get your medicines and all the other things.  The post office is the key to the communities in Alaska. This bill  solves all the problems for the post office.   I am proud of the work you have done. I want to thank the staff who  worked on this legislation. It was a hard issue because there are some  people who say: Oh, let them go private. Don't worry about it.   You can't run something like this in the State of Alaska. Because of  our distances and lack of transportation, the post office is the key to  our economy in our great State. I want to thank both of you for the  work you have done. God bless you.
