 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 151, the  Pallone-Thune TRACED Act.   So far this year, Kentuckians have received 500 million robocalls.  That is over 100 calls per person this year. Robocalls are the number  one issue I hear about when I am home.   Scammers have found creative ways to trick people into thinking their  calls are legitimate. These calls have wreaked havoc for private  citizens, hospitals, small businesses, and everyone in between.   One Kentucky woman told me she gets three to four calls a day. She  always answers for fear that there might be a family emergency, only to  be greeted by a spam call, disrupting her work at a factory.   I was proud to cosponsor the original House bill, the Stopping Bad  Robocalls Act, and I am proud to support the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act,  which would put an end to these frustrating calls. I commend my fellow  colleagues on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and in the  Senate for developing this bipartisan, bicameral solution to stop bad  robocalls.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here, and I recommend  all of my colleagues support this.
