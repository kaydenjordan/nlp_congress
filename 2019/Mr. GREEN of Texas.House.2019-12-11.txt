 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise with love of  country at heart and my mnemonic notes in hand.  [[Page H10021]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise today with the preeminent privilege and singular  honor of paying tribute to a great American institution. I do so with  H. Res. 760, commemorating Houston Methodist Hospital for 100 years of  service, 100 years of world-class healthcare, 100 years of saving  lives, 100 years of groundbreaking research.   Houston Methodist Hospital, the world's first multiorgan transplant  hospital; first coronary bypass, grafting with the patient's leg vein;  ranked the number one hospital in Texas for 8 consecutive years and a  national honor roll hospital by U.S. News and World Report.   Houston Methodist has eight hospitals, employing more than 23,000  persons, 1.3 million patient encounters last year alone, acknowledged  for their outstanding specialties in neurology, neurosurgery,  pulmonology, orthopedics, cancer, cardiology, heart surgery, and  urology.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to say that all of my colleagues in the  Houston area are cosponsors of this resolution--original cosponsors, I  might add. This would include the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee, the  Honorable Lizzie Fletcher, the Honorable Pete Olson, the Honorable  Sylvia Garcia, the Honorable   Michael McCaul, the Honorable Randy  Weber, the Honorable Brian Babin, the Honorable   Dan Crenshaw, and the  Honorable Kevin Brady.   Houston Methodist has a great president who not only responds to  congressional inquiries, but also to the patients themselves. I know. I  have known of patients who have actually had the opportunity to see the  president of the hospital. Dr. Mark Boom is the president. He is a  medical doctor himself, and he is the chief executive officer.   This great institution is one that I am proud to have in my  congressional district, I am proud to represent, and I am also proud to  say is a part of the great institutions in the United States of  America.   Houston Methodist Hospital is celebrating its centennial, 100 years  of faithful service and saving lives, not only in Houston, Harris  County, in the State of Texas, but across the world.                            ____________________
