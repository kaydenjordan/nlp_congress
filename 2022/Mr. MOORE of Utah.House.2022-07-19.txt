 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of amendment  No. 81, which would provide funding for the Modernization Access to Our  Public Land Act, otherwise known as the MAPLand Act, which was enacted  last April.   I was proud to work with a strong, bipartisan coalition of Members in  the House and the Senate to get this bill signed into law, and I  appreciate Congresswoman Dingell for working with me on this amendment  before us today.   Making public land information more detailed and accessible in the  digital age is one of the many reasons why this bill has enjoyed such  broad support as it soared through the legislative process.   Adoption of this amendment today will provide the funding needed to  modernize and improve the quality of this data so that Americans can  more easily recreate on our Federal lands, which will also improve our  ability to fund important conservation programs that enhance and  protect habitats across this Nation.   This amendment is about helping families spend more time together  outside, about improving the way our government works, and about  fostering and sharing the joy of the great outdoors.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 81.
