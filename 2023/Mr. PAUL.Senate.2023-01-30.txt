 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize officers  Cody Woolston and Eric Goldschmidt for their heroic actions on Monday,  October 31, 2022.   On that day, Officers Woolston and Goldschmidt responded to calls of  a woman attempting to jump off an overpass on Breckinridge Lane, which  runs over a local interstate. When the two officers arrived at the  scene, they found a woman standing on top of the barrier and looking  over the highway. Officers Woolston and Goldschmidt tried to talk with  the woman, but she was wearing headphones and not responding.   When she started to lean more towards the drop, Officer Woolston  bravely grabbed her from the barrier, saving her life. The officers  then took her to a local hospital to receive help. Upon arrival, she  was hesitant to go inside, but Officer Woolston calmly reassured her  and took her hand as they walked in together.   As a result of his quick actions that saved a life, Officer Woolston  was nominated for a 2023 Rise Award. Officers Woolston and Goldschmidt  were also nominated for the Louisville Metro Police Department's  lifesaving award.   Officers Woolston and Goldschmidt are brave servants to the city of  Louisville and a true testament to the hard-working Louisville Metro  Police Department. I am proud to salute both officers and have no doubt  they will continue to be an incredible asset to the citizens of  Louisville.                            ____________________
