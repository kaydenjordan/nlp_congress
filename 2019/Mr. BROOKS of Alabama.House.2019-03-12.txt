 Mr. Speaker, a prominent American socialist  politician recently proclaimed that ``capitalism is irredeemable.''   Mr. Speaker, capitalism, better known as free enterprise, is based on  freedom and liberty, not government dictate.   The claim that freedom and liberty should give way to government  control and dictatorship is astonishing, sad, and alien to the America  that I know.   It is a betrayal of the freedom and liberty Americans have fought and  died for, a freedom that has given America the best gross domestic  product, the most wealth of any nation in history.   In sum, the argument that free enterprise is bad and irredeemable is  the height of economic hubris, economic ignorance, and economic  stupidity.   Mr. Speaker, it is one thing for an argument to be economically  ignorant and stupid, it is another thing for it to be dangerous to  human life. In that vein, the argument that socialism is better than  free enterprise is not only a betrayal of America's foundational  principles of freedom and liberty; it is also dangerous and must be  dealt with quickly and severely.   History is replete with examples of dead or dying nations that have  paid a heavy price for succumbing to socialist politicians who care  more about personal and dictatorial power, who care more about being  the boss, than the welfare of their own people.   For those who refuse to learn from history, I suggest reading George  Orwell's prophetic book ``Animal Farm.'' It explains all you need to  know about how and why socialism fails and who rules in a Socialist  society.   Venezuela's economic and humanitarian catastrophe is a present-day,  glaring lesson that warns all tempted by the siren song of socialism.   Thousands of Venezuelans are dying from malnutrition, disease, and  lack of food and medicine. The result: deadly riots.   In 2018 alone, a staggering 7,523 civilians were murdered due to  clashes with military and state police forces.   Mothers are forced to choose which child to feed and which child goes  hungry.   In 2017, the average Venezuelan lost 24 pounds because they could not  get the calories necessary to maintain their body weight. Today, there  are Venezuelans searching for food in trash cans who are fortunate if  they can eat once a day.   As Venezuelans lose hope, suicide rates have skyrocketed to almost  twice the global suicide rate.   Venezuela's socialist economy has collapsed. 2018's inflation rate  soared to 80,000 percent. Nearly 90 percent of the population is living  below the poverty line.   Even electricity is unreliable, as Caracas suffers from sporadic  total power failures, casting Venezuela's capital city into darkness.   Worse yet, Venezuela's socialism promotes crime and lawlessness by  desperate citizens. According to a 2018 report by the World Economic  Forum, Venezuela is the second most dangerous country in the world,  with Caracas coming in as the second most dangerous city overall with  111 homicides per 100,000 residents.   Venezuela's suffering even extends beyond its borders, as thousands  of refugees flee to neighboring countries that cannot take care of  them.   Venezuela is a man-made catastrophe brought about by tyrannical  dictators and self-proclaimed bosses that are always the result of  socialist policies.   Mr. Speaker, America must learn from Venezuela, a country that  succumbed to evil socialist sales pitches even though history proves  socialism has failed every single time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues and America to reject socialism  lest America go down the same path of financial self-destruction as  Venezuela.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I urge America to reject self-proclaimed  dictators and bosses who seek to deprive America of our hard-fought and  hard-won freedom and liberty.                            ____________________
