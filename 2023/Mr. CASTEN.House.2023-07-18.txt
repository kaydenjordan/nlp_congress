 Mr. Speaker, can we maintain an affordable, reliable, and  decarbonized grid if we rely only on traditional renewables?   To hear our Republican colleagues talk, absolutely not. They say that  nuclear and advanced fossil fuels and hydrogen all have to be in the  mix. As the old saw goes, when you are in a negotiation, don't watch  the other guy's lips, watch his feet.   The Republicans' proposed appropriations package includes $15  billion--that is a 20 percent cut--in the title 17 program. This is the  loan program office that helps those early stage technologies get to  commercialization.   This program, by the way, is currently massively oversubscribed. Of  their existing $73 billion of loan authority, they have already  received over $90 billion of applications of which 37 percent offer  carbon management, advanced nuclear, and fossil fuel technologies  included that my colleagues claim to hold dear.   These technologies are critically important to the future of our  energy system. They all critically need government support to get to  commercialization, and they would all be cut by the proposed Republican  budget.   I want a reliable, decarbonized power grid that uses all those  technologies and more. My colleagues across the aisle, on the other  hand, seem to be rooting for blackouts--or worse.   I know that is true because in the words of Shakira--feet don't lie.                            ____________________
