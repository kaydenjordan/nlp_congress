 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.   It was in 1935 that this body enacted the National Labor Relations  Act. It guaranteed basic rights to private sector workers to organize  into trade unions, to engage in contractual bargaining for decent wages  and better conditions at work, and to take joint action, if necessary.   But in 1935, just like today, here, 2018, the Republican Party and  business interests vehemently opposed passage of any laws that help  workers. Little has changed. Once again our Republican colleagues  trample on the backs of workers.   This legislation rolls back proven protections that allow wages to  rise in places like California, and their casinos, from $10 an hour to  $13 an hour. Now, these modest pay increases have helped elevate the  workers who work in those casinos above the Federal poverty level.   Who has ever tried to buy a house in California or tried to live on  $13 an hour or $10 an hour? You are not talking about a whole lot of  money there, especially from a party that just gave $1 trillion away to  the people at the very top.   But with this bill, our Republican colleagues chose to strip these  hundreds of thousands of workers, the majority of whom are not members  of Tribes but work in those casinos, of decent wages and their right to  a voice in the workplace.   Wow.   Beneath their sheepskin costumes hides another Republican attack on  worker rights in this country, this time under the guise of Tribal  sovereignty.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Let me remind my colleagues though, throughout our  National Labor Relations Board's history, it has never and will not  assert jurisdiction where it would interfere with a Tribe's internal  governance rights in purely intramural matters.   So I urge my colleagues to oppose this bad bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the strong opposition to it from  the United Steelworkers of America and from the Communications Workers  of America. As a proud daughter of labor, I am proud to stand here  today in opposition to this bill.                                            United Steelworkers,                                    Pittsburgh, PA, January 9, 2018.      Re United Steelworkers oppose inclusion of anti-worker H.R.           986, Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of 2017 in S. 140.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 850,000 members of       the United Steelworkers (USW), we strongly urge you to oppose       S. 140 on the House floor this week. Rather than  [[Page H121]]       being identical to the Senate bill, this version includes the       anti-worker and undemocratic Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act of       2017 (H.R. 986).        H.R. 986 would exempt all employees of federally recognized       Native American-owned commercial enterprises operated on       Indian lands from the protections of the National Labor       Relations Act (NLRA) and would authorize over 567 distinct       and separate labor law jurisdictions in the United States.        To be absolutely clear, this legislation strips workers--      both Native American and non-Native American--of their NLRA       protections. While some organizations have falsely attempted       to paint tribal governments as similar entities to states       (which are exempt from the NLRA), tribal governments are       substantially different than states in one key democratic       principal: state governments allow workers an ability to vote       for their legislators no matter their ancestry, while most       tribal governments require blood quantum or lineal descent to       determine who is eligible for membership or citizenship.        Simply put, if H.R. 986 becomes law by inclusion in S. 140,       U.S. citizens working in the United States for tribal       commercial enterprises would not be able to vote for the       elected representatives who set their labor laws. These       workers will lose the ability to petition the government that       oversees their working conditions.        The gaming industry, which is an employer for approximately       246 of the 567 federally recognized American Indian tribes;       has over 600,000 casino workers on tribal lands, the       overwhelming majority of whom are not Native Americans. In       2011 before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, the National       Indian Gaming Commission testified that the vast majority of       employees (up to 75 percent) were non-tribal members.        Our union understands the importance of the principle of       tribal sovereignty; however the fundamental human rights of       employees are not the exclusive concern of tribal enterprises       or tribal governments. As the International Labor       Organization highlighted in a letter on a previous version of       this bill, ``it is critical that the State (the national       authority) takes ultimate responsibility for ensuring respect       for freedom of association and collective bargaining rights       throughout its territory''. That is why we believe the       current test set by the NLRB is the best course of action       until labor laws are strengthened in the United States.        In 2004, the NLRB under the Bush Administration ruled for       the first time that Tribal casino workers should have the       benefit of NLRA protections, San Manuel, 341 NLRB No. 138       (2204). Yet, since the San Manuel ruling, the NLRB has       asserted jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis. In 2015, the       NLRB declined jurisdiction citing the 1830 Treaty of Dancing       Rabbit Creek and 1866 Treaty of Washington stating:        ``We have no doubt that asserting jurisdiction over the       Casino and the Nation would effectuate the policies of the       Act. However, because we find that asserting jurisdiction       would abrogate treaty rights specific to the Nation.''       Chickasaw Nation Windstar World Casino, 362 NLRB 109 92015).        Similarly the NLRB declined jurisdiction:        ``. . . when an Indian tribe is fulfilling a traditionally       tribal or governmental function that is unique to its status,       fulfilling just such a unique governmental function       [providing free health care services solely to tribal       members],'' Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation, 341 NLRB 139       (2004).        The NLRB has developed a reasonable and responsible test to       determine jurisdiction. H.R. 986 creates significant       confusion and jurisdictional issues over labor law       enforcement and grossly undermines worker's rights. Our union       urges you to oppose S. 140, with the inclusion of H.R. 986,       and asks you to instead work to expand worker's rights not       restrict them further.            Sincerely,                                                     Leo W. Gerard,      International President.                                   ____                                                    January 9, 2018.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the members and officers       of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), I am writing       to express our strong opposition to S. 140. CWA has no       objections whatsoever to Sections 1 and 2 of the bill as       amended. Unfortunately, these non-controversial, sensible       bills have been hijacked to also pass H.R. 986, a bill that       would strip hundreds of thousands of workers at tribal-owned       and -operated enterprises of their protections for the right       to bargain collectively.        H.R. 986 seeks to overturn a National Labor Relations Board       (NLRB) decision in San Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, which       applied the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to a tribal       casino enterprise. The NLRB's finding in San Manuel adopted a       test to determine whether the NLRA is applicable to       businesses operating on tribal lands--if it would ``touch       exclusive rights of self-governance in purely intramural       matters'' or ``abrogate Indian treaty rights,'' the NLRA       would not apply, but otherwise the decision will be based on       a series of factors including whether an entity is a purely       commercial enterprise or employs or caters to individuals who       are not tribal members.        The San Manuel test balances two crucial issues--tribal       sovereignty and the right of workers to bargain collectively.       The test ensures that truly internal matters of self-      governance will continue to be handled by sovereign tribes,       while also ensuring that the fundamental rights of workers to       organize and advocate for their own interests are properly       respected. H.R. 986 would overturn this balance by exempting       any enterprise or institution owned and operated by an Indian       tribe and located on its land from the requirements of the       NLRA--or any other guarantee of workers' fundamental right to       organize and collectively bargain.        The practical impact of H.R. 986 would be to exempt a broad       swath of businesses from the NLRA, even though, in many       cases, they are purely commercial enterprises. For many of       these companies--particularly casinos--the majority of their       workforces are not members of the tribe employing them and       therefore do not have full access to internal, tribal       mechanisms for grieving issues or petitioning for change in       tribal policies. This is why the International Labour       Organization stated in 2015 that ``it would appear likely       that an exclusion of certain workers from the NLRA and its       mechanisms would give rise to a failure to ensure these       workers their fundamental freedom of association rights.''        I urge you to oppose S. 140 as amended and instead work to       advance an agenda that protects both workers' fundamental       human right to organize and tribal sovereignty. CWA will       consider including votes on this bill in our Congressional       Scorecard Thank you in advance for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                   Shane Larson,                                               Legislative Director,                           Communications Workers of America (CWA).     Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight another scam in the GOP  tax giveaway just signed into law. President Trump promised in  November: ``Factories will be pouring back into this county.''   Really?   The Republican tax scam taxes earnings of foreign subsidiaries of  U.S. firms at half the rate of what is earned here in the United States  by those same companies. If that isn't an invitation for more job  outsourcing, I don't know what is.   The corporate tax rate, which Republicans slashed at the expense of  the middle class, Social Security, and Medicare, is now at 21 percent;  but the rate at which American companies' overseas subsidiaries will be  taxed is half that much, 10.5 percent.   Why does the Republican tax bill incentivize U.S. companies to move  profits and capital overseas?   Call President Trump, let him know, because that is what he just did.   The Republican bill does nothing to address the job outsourcing  crisis. It makes it worse.   Isn't this economic madness?                            ____________________
