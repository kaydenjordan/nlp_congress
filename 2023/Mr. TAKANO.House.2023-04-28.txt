 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding and I certainly share his commitment and I share your pride. I  know you stand for justice. I know you stand for the cause of all folks  who have been marginalized. I know of your commitment to our  servicemembers during World War II.   Mr. Speaker, I thank a member of my staff on the House Committee on  Veterans' Affairs for his valued service to veterans, this Congress,  and our country.   Miguel Salazar joined our committee as our communications director in  2019 as Democrats took back the House, and he was an integral part of  the committee's efforts to deliver meaningful change for our Nation's  veterans.   When my Honoring our PACT Act was signed into law last year, Miguel  worked tirelessly with our communications team to ensure that the 3.5  million newly eligible veterans became aware of the benefits they were  entitled to.   As a commissioned officer in the Marine Corps Reserve, Miguel has  embodied the very best of public service. He has been a true leader and  an invaluable member of my staff. The work of my committee and this  legislative body have been made better by Miguel's contributions. He  will be deeply missed.    Mr. Speaker, I was trying to remember the gentleman's  cause, which was the merchant mariners during World War II.   I was at an event with Senator McConnell which commemorated the  service of these merchant mariners who played such a critical role  serving our Nation during World War II. They weren't in uniform, but  they died at tremendous numbers.   I share Mr. Green's concern that we need to do something for these  surviving merchant mariners before they all die. They served our  country in an incredible way.                                time  1130
