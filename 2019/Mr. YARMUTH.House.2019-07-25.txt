 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 519, I call up  the bill (H.R. 3877) to amend the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit  Control Act of 1985, to establish a congressional budget for fiscal  years 2020 and 2021, to temporarily suspend the debt limit, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 3877.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we have an opportunity to advance bipartisan  legislation that will help secure a stronger future for American  families and our Nation's economy.   The 2-year budget caps deal we are now debating raises the debt  ceiling and increases the budget caps for 2020 and 2021. It stops  extreme sequestration cuts of $125 billion from being implemented,  helps us avoid another devastating government shutdown, and establishes  a realistic budgetary framework so that we can make critical  investments in our Nation's people and prosperity.   This budget agreement represents a vast improvement over the harmful  cuts contained in the President's 2020 budget proposal. It rejects the  Trump budget's 9 percent cut to nondefense discretionary spending that  would have weakened national and economic security, endangered public  health, and crippled critical programs that support American families.   Instead, this bill will allow us to make strong investments in  everything from K-12 education and infrastructure to research and  development, clean energy, and veterans' healthcare.   This is about finally moving us past the threat of sequestration. It  is about upholding the full faith and credit of the United States. And  it is about providing much-needed certainty to our communities and for  our economy.   This bipartisan agreement is a victory for the American people. In  the most divisive and polarizing environment in our lifetimes, it is a  much-needed example of Congress coming together to prioritize the  American people over self-serving politics.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to fulfill our obligations  to govern and ensure we meet the needs and priorities of the American  people by passing this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), the chair of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), the vice chair of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the House Armed Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), a distinguished member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of the House of  Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.   (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)  [[Page H7407]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I think anyone watching this debate today, and certainly  those of us who are here in the House, would say this is a very unusual  moment.   We have a lot of debates in this body in which there is a great deal  of unanimity and agreement, and usually that is over naming a post  office or doing something that is totally noncontroversial. But today  is very different, because today we have truly, I think, respected the  highest legacies of this body, that this body is supposed to be a  Chamber where you bring very diverse opinions and perspectives to try  and find common solutions to this country's needs.   I think the compromise that we are hopefully going to approve today  will serve as a model for what is possible in this body and in this  Congress, because it truly is, in my 13 years, I think, a watershed  moment. We are in a very, very divisive, polarized environment. We have  come together to move this country forward.   I want to thank and commend the ranking member and my friend, Mr.  Womack. I can't imagine having a better relationship than I have with  the ranking member, and I hope that he feels that, when he was chairman  and I was ranking member, it was exactly the same way. Mr. Womack is a  total class act and a distinguished Member, and it is an honor to work  with him.    I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those comments.   Mr. Speaker, I also compliment and thank the Budget Committee staff,  both majority and minority, for the work done on this very important  piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, our country is facing an infrastructure deficit; we face  a skills and education deficit; and we face a growing income inequality  crisis. A failure by Congress to make the necessary investments to  promote growth and opportunity will leave our communities and country  vulnerable.   Instead of the extreme cuts outlined in the President's 2020 budget  proposal, we need to be making bold investments in research and  development, educating and training a strong workforce, improving  public health, caring for our veterans, ensuring an accurate 2020  Census, and protecting our homeland.   The United States did not become an economic powerhouse and world  leader by accident. Throughout our history, we made strong investments  in our people, our economy, and our security that have allowed us to  innovate and grow, while promoting broad-based economic opportunity.   This agreement will build on that legacy by raising the caps and  lifting the debt ceiling, allowing Congress to move our Nation forward  without leaving our communities behind.   I look forward to passing this bill in the House, and I encourage  both the Senate and the White House to join us in ensuring that we meet  our obligations to our Nation and to the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
