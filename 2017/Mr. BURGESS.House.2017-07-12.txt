 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the  time.   It is significant today to be here and be supporting H.R. 2430, the  Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017.   The passage of this bill provides certainly the security to the  scientists who are working even now in pursuit of better cures and, of  course, hope for patients across the country who are awaiting better  treatments of the diseases that are afflicting them.   By reauthorizing the Food and Drug Administration user fee program,  we are ensuring that the Food and Drug Administration can continue to  officially operate and approve new drugs for the market.   Upon becoming chairman of the Subcommittee on Health this year, I had  the privilege of convening four separate legislative hearings on the  policies that are included in H.R. 2430. In each of those hearings, we  heard about the tremendous success of the user fee programs in  expanding access to affordable medications, supporting biomedical  innovation, and maintaining high standards at the FDA for safety,  efficacy, and quality.   H.R. 2430 will build upon these successes and will also build upon  the achievements that we achieved in the last Congress, in the 21st  Century Cures Act. And now we can ensure that the FDA has resources  necessary to get medical treatments and cures to patients and  healthcare providers as quickly as possible.   This bill is an important step forward for our committee and for this  Congress, and we continue to pursue meaningful improvements to the  healthcare system.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Gene Green,  Ranking Member Pallone of the full committee, all members of the Energy  and Commerce Committee, both subcommittee and full committee, who  worked hard to improve the substance of this bill as it came through.   Clearly, I wish to thank the majority and minority staffs who worked  so hard to bring this to fruition.
