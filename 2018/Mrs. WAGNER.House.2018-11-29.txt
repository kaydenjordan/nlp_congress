 Mr. Speaker, I rise because today we are voting on a 1- week extension of the National Flood Insurance Program. This will be  the eighth short-term extension since fiscal year 2017, and it is  unacceptable.   My district floods every year, and it is imminently clear that we  must reform our flood insurance program, not just repeatedly extend it.  Requiring taxpayers to fund construction projects in severe flood zones  over and over again is extremely expensive, and it isn't a sustainable  solution. The numbers prove it: NFIP is currently operating on a $1.4  billion annual deficit, with no end in sight.   As Chairman Hensarling knows all too well, I have personally spent  the better part of a year, along with the ranking member, Mr. Al Green,  working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to root out  waste, fraud, and abuse in other disaster recovery programs. We must  ensure that funds go to the people who truly need them, like the  disaster recovery program. The current flood insurance is broken, and  we must fix it once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, it has been 1 year since the House passed a reform  package that would have vastly improved the National Flood Insurance  Program. It has been 1 year since the Senate has refused to act. I urge  my colleagues to support the serious structural reforms that the  Committee on Financial Services passed last November.
