 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the cloture vote on the Kelley nomination, the Senate recess until  2:15; further, if cloture is invoked, all time during the recess counts  postcloture on the nomination.    Mr. President, the Senate returned from our  Thanksgiving recess and got back to work.   Since the election earlier this month, there has been plenty of  prognostication about what the new Congress will bring, but I would  rather focus on the one we are still involved in, and this Congress has  more business to complete before the end of the year. Even after two  historic years of accomplishments for the American people, there are  still important items left to check off our list.   Yesterday evening, we voted to advance the nomination of Stephen  Vaden, the President's choice, to serve as general counsel for the  Department of Agriculture.   Mr. Vaden has strong legal credentials, both public and private  sector experience, degrees from Vanderbilt and Yale, and he comes with  an upbringing in agriculture. He grew up on his family's farm in Union  City, TN--and according to the Tennessee Farm Bureau, it shows. As my  friend Senator Alexander referenced yesterday, that organization wrote  that Vaden has ``a passion for agriculture that can't be taught, but  that is necessary for the job'' of general counsel.   It is hardly surprising, then, that this nominee received bipartisan  support at the committee level, including the support of the ranking  member.   What is surprising? The fact that since clearing the committee, Mr.  Vaden's nomination has languished for 351 days, waiting for Senate  Democrats to end their obstruction--long, even by the standards of this  Congress. So I hope that each of my colleagues will join me in turning  the page and voting to confirm Mr. Vaden later today.   Following the Vaden nomination, we will turn to consideration of  Karen Kelley to serve as Deputy Secretary of Commerce. She is a  graduate of Villanova. She has built a 35-year record of expertise in  investment, management, and financial strategy.   She currently serves as Undersecretary--a position to which she was  unanimously confirmed by the Senate--and oversees the Department's  statistical programs through the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of  Economic Analysis. Ms. Kelley is already acting in the role to which  she has been nominated.   Through this service, Ms. Kelley has earned the respect and esteem of  her colleagues at the Department. Secretary Ross has said he is  thankful to have such a qualified individual fill the position.   I hope my colleagues will join me in voting to advance her nomination  today with a strong bipartisan vote.   As we look over the record of this 115th Congress, a number of  accomplishments were made possible with significant bipartisan  support--from landmark opioid legislation to major improvements in  veterans' medical care and services, to our tremendous progress on  appropriations and a lot more.  [[Page S7104]]    Our remaining work will require more of that bipartisan spirit when  it comes to closing out appropriations, confirming more nominees, and  other subjects as well. So let's continue the momentum and keep moving  forward.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
