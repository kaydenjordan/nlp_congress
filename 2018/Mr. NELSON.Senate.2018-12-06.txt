 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I wish to speak about one of the world's  great natural treasures, the Florida Everglades. Eighteen years ago,  there was an anniversary; as a matter of fact, it was in December of  2000. One of the major water bills that Congress passes, usually about  every 5 to 7 years, was enacted, and they typically contain Army Corps  of Engineers' projects for water handling, water channeling the great  rivers and lakes of America. All of these water projects are so vital  to the economic functioning of this country. This water bill was passed  back in December of 2000 to provide funding for projects on ports,  dams, and beach renourishment projects all across the country. It also  authorized for the first time the comprehensive restoration plan for  America's Florida Everglades. It was a 30-year, multibillion dollar  effort to restore the Everglades.   What had happened, ever since the beginning of the previous century-- in the early 1900s--as Florida started to be discovered and as people  increasingly had come, the way it was paved in the late 1800s, with  Henry Flagler building his railroad, the railroad went down the east  coast of Florida. He would build it as far as he could get, first to  St. Augustine, where there was built a big hotel. That hotel today is  the administrative building of Flagler College in downtown St.  Augustine.   Then Flagler extended it further to the Daytona-Ormond Beach  location, where another big hotel was built. Taking it further south,  all the way to West Palm Beach, the famed Breakers hotel in Palm Beach  was built, as well as a Biltmore hotel.   Finally, Henry Flagler took it on to Miami and then did a feat  thought impossible and went through a string of islands called the  Florida Keys. He took the railroad all the way to Key West.   This was a means of travel that opened up to Americans in the  Northeast this beautiful land called La Florida in Spanish, the name  given by the  [[Page S7348]]  Spanish conquistadors who came to Florida. Indeed, they came and they  loved this land.   As more and more people came and started settling, they found that  sometimes Mother Nature was harsh. When Mother Nature came in its full  display of fury, hurricanes would come; quick rainstorms would come;  quick changes of temperature occurred, from warm to suddenly freezing,  even with--albeit, not a lot of snow, but I have seen parts of Florida  with the ground covered in snow and other parts that were pelted with  freezing rain.   As people tried to adapt to this land of contrasting environments,  all of a sudden, they started to see nature, and along in the late  1920s came a hurricane of such magnitude that when it hit the coast  around West Palm Beach and then went inland to Lake Okeechobee, 3,000  people drowned.   As a result of that experience, the governmental structure said: We  have to do something about flood control. Thus, the diking and draining  for three-quarters of a century commenced under the rubric of flood  control that would get the water off the land when too much water came  at one time. But what happened was, suddenly they had a plan to reverse  what Mother Nature had intended. Mother Nature intended for water as  far north as southwest of today's Orlando to slowly flow south all the  way into the big lake, Lake Okeechobee, and continue on into the  Florida Everglades.   What happened with all this diking and draining was it was taking  away that natural flow of water. In order to get the water off the land  in times of flooding, they created big dikes and canals that would send  the water out into the tidewater of the Atlantic in the east and the  Gulf of Mexico in the west.   Take, for example, coming south of Orlando in the Kissimmee chain of  lakes into what was a meandering stream called the Kissimmee River,  where it slowly wandered southward through the oxbows with all the  marsh grasses, cleansing the water as it went south and then entering  into that big lake called Okeechobee, which did not have defined  boundaries but, instead, marshy grasses all around the lake. The water,  by gravity, continued to flow south into a natural extension of the  marshy grasses, into the miles and miles of river grass that Marjory  Stoneman Douglas had declared so beautifully as the ``river of grass,''  the Florida Everglades. So Lake Okeechobee had a way of taking care of  its water and keeping it clean.   After losing 3,000 people in that hurricane, the idea was to control  the water--dike and drain it; dike the lake and drain it to the east  and to the west, eventually into the St. Lucie River to go into the  Atlantic and into the Caloosahatchee, to go into the Gulf of Mexico. So  meandering streams like the Kissimmee River were suddenly diked and dug  into a straight ditch. It was catastrophic for the sensitive estuaries  that were cleansing the water as it moved south. It was catastrophic  for the estuaries, where so many of the critters had the nursery  grounds for their young, as well as the many fish species.   Lo and behold, across the entire southern peninsula of Florida, a  dike was built called Tamiami Trail, a paved road from Miami over to  the west coast, just south of Fort Myers and Naples. That, in effect,  became a dike across the southern peninsula of Florida that did not  allow the water to flow further south into what, ultimately, as a  result of President Harry Truman's signing it into law, became the  Everglades National Park. Consequently, the Everglades National Park  was then starved of freshwater.   The consequences of all of those actions over almost a century are  painfully visible in years like this one. Because of the pollution of  that water, instead of the grasses cleansing it, toxic blue-green algae  chokes the rivers and spreads all the way out to the Atlantic Ocean to  the east and to the Gulf of Mexico to the west.   People have seen in this past year the dramatic images of dead fish  covering the water's surface, covering the beach on the west coast and,  lo and behold, ultimately that phenomenon of red tide being  supercharged with green algae. Ultimately, it went around the peninsula  and up the east coast, and we saw dead fish on the beaches of the  Atlantic coast as well.   We need to return the waterflow to the flow that Mother Nature  intended. That is what the restoration of the Everglades is all about,  and that is how that started 18 years ago this month, with a  comprehensive plan to turn around that flood control--that diking and  draining of all of the southern half of the peninsula of Florida, which  has now caused so many of the unintended effects.   If you think about it, when the ecosystem is healthy, the Everglades  are healthy. When the ecosystem is sick, all of the rest of that  beautiful ecosystem is going to be sickly as well. What we have seen  with the little bit of cleaning up we have done is that the Everglades  are amazingly resilient. The environment and the Everglades are the  heart and soul of Florida. These precious natural resources deserve our  protection and stewardship because now they provide drinking water for  millions and millions of people in South Florida who have moved there  and for a major agricultural industry.   The Everglades also provide storm protection. That is why the ongoing  Everglades restoration effort is so important. We need to ensure that  the Everglades are there to provide a buffer the next time a hurricane  rolls through.   We understand there is a link between warming ocean temperatures and  hurricane intensity. If the climate trends continue--and I will  reference my speech on climate change and global warming and the rising  of the seas that I gave last week. As that climate trend continues, if  we don't reverse it, then it is all the more important to fortify  Mother Nature's best defenses.   Not only are beaches and the preservation of them as one of those  defenses important, but so are the Florida Everglades. Beaches,  wetlands, coral reefs, mangroves all protect us against storm damage.  We saw that during Hurricane Sandy in the Northeast and Hurricane  Matthew in Florida. We are learning that proved true again during  Hurricane Irma. That is why it is so critical that we preserve our  natural infrastructure and conserve the undeveloped lands. As that  famous Floridian, Marjory Stoneman Douglas said:         There are no other Everglades in the world. . . . The       miracle of the light pours over the green and brown expanse       of saw grass and of water, shining and slow-moving below, the       grass and water that is the meaning and the central fact of       the Everglades of Florida. It is a river of grass.    Since I have been privileged to be a Member of the Senate, the  Federal Government has spent almost $5 billion on Everglades  restoration. We have some great things to show for it, but we have a  long way to go.   Wading birds is an example. They are returning to the Kissimmee River  floodplain. Water is finally flowing under that dike that was built in  the 1920s--the Tamiami Trail. Now there is a breach of a mile-long  bridge, and there is another 2\1/2\-mile bridge that is under  construction to allow that water to flow south into the Everglades  National Park.   We are seeing the return of native wildlife in areas where projects  are still underway.   I referenced the Central Everglades Restoration Project that was  passed in the water bill 18 years ago. It was originally envisioned as  a 30-year plan because we knew we couldn't reverse all of the drainage  and the engineering overnight. Out of 30 years, we are into the 18th  year, with 12 more to go. It is a long-term effort, and it requires two  things: diligent oversight over the ongoing work and an unwavering  dedication to achieving Florida's goal of a restored Everglades.   This Senator, whose family came to Florida in 1829, is a fifth- generation Floridian. I understand this is an important project to  protect our beautiful natural treasures, but what happens if we don't?   We have all seen the environmental and economic wreckage, for  example, from an oilspill. We have seen NASA images from space of  mangroves flattened after a hurricane. As the hurricanes get stronger,  more ferocious, and more intense, that will be a result, as well as the  wiping out of beaches.   All too often in recent years, this Senator has seen the devastating  impact of toxic algae blooms on communities all over the Peninsula of  Florida and even into North Florida. When you  [[Page S7349]]  take a body of water and throw a sack of fertilizer in it, the  combination of heat and the nutrients are going to grow algae in most  any light but especially in the warm climate of Florida. As a result,  by that same example, if you take our freshwater in Florida and allow  pollution to go into that because the pollution is not properly  regulated, it puts the nutrients into the freshwater that will grow the  algae. The algae will suck the oxygen from the water, and that becomes  a dead river or a dead lake. All those extra nutrients then, when they  hit the saltwater on the Atlantic coast or the Gulf of Mexico,  supercharge other phenomenon that lives in saltwater, such as the red  tide. We have seen that devastating impact.   There was a Floridian whom we recently lost, Nat Reed. He was  particularly attuned to the needs of Florida's environment. We are  going to honor his legacy in a memorial service this coming weekend. We  are doing that because Nat Reed was one of the great defenders of  Florida's natural bounty, especially the Everglades. In the 1970s, he  served both Presidents Nixon and Ford. He returned to Florida, and he  worked under seven different Governors in many different environmental  capacities, including as chairman of the Commission on Florida's  Environmental Future. Back in the 1980s, that commission was  instrumental in the land acquisition projects we now know as Everglades  Restoration.   For Nat Reed, his children and his grandchildren, for all of the  current and future generations of Floridians, let's honor the legacy of  Nat Reed, and let's stay the course over the next 12 years of this  Central Everglades Restoration Project. Let's complete it and restore  America's Everglades.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
