 Madam President, the latest results of vaccine trials  continue to suggest that our victory over the coronavirus is on the  horizon. But here in Washington, the additional relief that would help  families, workers, schools, and small businesses cross the finish line  has been held up for months while Democratic leaders pursued an all-or- nothing approach.   When the Speaker of the House put forward the so-called Heroes Act  back in May, multiple--multiple--House Democrats called it out for the  political stunt that it clearly was. One Democrat said it was ``not  focused,'' ``rushed to a vote too fast,'' and it ``doesn't help us  accomplish [the] core mission'' of helping struggling people.   Well, after several months with no progress, this same Democrat just  said a few days ago that Senate Republicans' proposal is ``a bill we  can pass'' and ``we should negotiate that to the finish.'' Even Speaker  Pelosi's own Members think our Senate Republican bill is better than  hers.   Well, let's hope our Democratic colleagues will finally let us make  law in all the enormously important areas where we do not even  disagree.   In the meantime, the Senate will proceed with pressing business on  the Executive Calendar. We will vote to confirm several more well- qualified nominees, beginning today with Taylor McNeel, the President's  choice to serve as U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of  Mississippi.   I hope each of my colleagues will join me in supporting this  impressive nominee and those who will follow.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on an entirely different matter,  as the 116th Congress draws to a close, I once again face a task that  is among my favorite and least favorite jobs at this particular time:  bidding farewell to some of the people we proudly call colleagues and  friends. But I will take  [[Page S7118]]  any excuse to brag about the impressive men and women we get to work  alongside every single day.   Today, I will begin with the junior Senator from Arizona, Martha  McSally. For the last 2 years, Senator McSally has held the seat  formerly occupied by our dear friend John McCain. It is only fitting  that our ``Maverick'' was followed by a fellow veteran and pilot who  has approached her service to the people of Arizona with such unabashed  pride.   By her own account, if you had asked a school-aged Martha McSally,  who was apparently both shy and prone to motion sickness, whether a  career in cockpits and then politics sounded appealing, she would have  looked at you like you were crazy. But, even then, the future full-bird  colonel and Senator was already on her way to a life defined by  service.   When Martha lost her father, a Navy veteran, at a young age, his  final words to her were: ``Make me proud.'' ``Make me proud.'' With  this challenge in mind, the youngest of five children took her academic  and athletic talents to the U.S. Air Force Academy. The plan was to  earn a trip to medical school through military service.   Back then, a ground-based career must have sounded like a sensible  plan. After all, being a combat pilot wasn't an option back then for  female officers, and, besides, she was on the wrong side of the height  requirement for any pilot's seat. No women and no people her size were  eligible at the time.   But after a ride-along training mission in an F-16 during one of her  summer assignments, Cadet McSally realized that flying was just too  cool to pass up. Some doors were going to have to open to make it an  option, but if those doors weren't open already, then, Martha McSally  was prepared to bust them down. That meant shaking off three straight  rejections for a medical waiver of the height requirement. It meant  inventing new tests to prove her exceptional aptitude, not only among  the female candidates but the entire pool. It meant not taking ``no''  for an answer and ruffling as many feathers as needed until she got to  serve. Of course, none of these skills and talents would sound at all  familiar to us here in the Senate--not at all.   By the time our future colleague won her spot as the first woman  behind the stick of a combat fighter mission, she was charting a unique  course in more ways than one. Her place in the squadron had made  history, and the jet she flew--the A-10 ``Warthog''--had a unique place  of its own.   The A-10 flies low over the battlefield. It provides close air  support, hunting and destroying threats to friendly forces on the  ground. It is a machinegun on wings that holds special respect among  combat military.   Many seasoned soldiers have a story or two about times when pilots  like Martha McSally swooped in to get them out of a bind. So Martha's  flight hours were literally clearing the way for her fellow  servicemembers in more ways than one.   Her trailblazing helped change the perception and treatment of women  in our Armed Forces. In one instance, she took the DOD to court over  unfair dress codes for female servicemembers overseas and won an  important change in policy.   Pretty quickly, folks caught on to the fact that when Colonel McSally  put her mind to something, it got done. So, naturally, when the then- Congresswoman was sworn in here in the Senate, she dove into tracking  down answers for her fellow Arizonans, solutions for American  servicemembers, and the care and justice her fellow veterans deserve.   From her first day, Senator McSally reminded everyone here that  public service is personal, that what we do here has a direct impact on  the lives of millions of Americans. So after swearing the oath on a  Bible recovered from the bombing of the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor,  she brought her experience and expertise to solving issues that are  personal to her and to others who have worn the uniform.   In solidarity with her fellow A-10 pilots and the forces they  protect, Senator McSally fought to preserve and fund that unique  weapon. Using her role on the Senate Armed Services Committee, she let  her own painful personal experiences with sexual assault in the  military fuel the pursuit of justice for fellow survivors. She authored  expanded protections for service academy students who experienced  assault, she proposed new preservation requirements for service records  to promote accountability, and she made sure each was included when the  Senate passed Defense authorizations.   Her service to men and women in uniform didn't stop with those on  Active Duty. Senator McSally has also championed expanded care and  services for our veterans as they transition back to civilian life,  greater Federal support for telehealth and suicide prevention, and  expanded veterans treatment courts.   So many important changes have been enacted because Martha McSally  made them happen.   Last year, it came to her attention that one remarkable 95-year-old  Arizona veteran had not received the formal recognition he deserved for  distinguished service back in World War II. Senator McSally made sure  he got that Purple Heart, hand-delivered, with dozens of young airmen  on hand to honor him.   The junior Senator from Arizona has charted a singular course. She  has balanced respect for tradition with an eye toward the future. She  opened countless new doors for others. At every single step, our  colleague has done it with dignity, faith, and a deep love of her State  and her country that she cannot help but wear on her sleeve.   She departs with a long list of accomplishments and every reason to  hold her head high. Wherever life after the Senate takes her, I am  confident our colleague will continue to be the most enthusiastic  advocate for her State--for its people, its prosperity, and its natural  wonders. That includes all the interesting creatures that she and her  four-legged wingman, Boomer, meet when they are out hiking the trails.   No, I am pretty certain Martha McSally is not through fighting yet.  So, Martha, on behalf of not just the Senate but the Nation, thank you  so much for your service to our country, in uniform and here in the  Senate. We wish you all the best in the bright days to come.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
