 Mr. President, as we head toward the final hour of  debate, I want to just bring us back about 20 feet to talk about the  stakes that we are laboring under tonight.   I want to talk a little bit about the big picture of why this  matters.   I know we have changed the rules 160 times in the history of the  Senate, but I will submit that it is still an extraordinary endeavor to  ask our colleagues to change the rules and traditions of this body.   And so here is what I want to say: It is really important to remember  that democracy, this idea that every member of our country, every  member of the community gets an equal say in the rules that govern us,  it is unnatural.   Why do I know this? Because I want you to think of every organization  in your life that matters. Your workplace; it doesn't give equal votes  to every employee as to the direction of the company. Think about your  favorite sports team. There is not a vote from all the players about  the lineups or the strategy of the team. The Sunday sermon at your  church isn't chosen by an online poll of the congregation.   I love my kids, but they don't get an equal say with me and my wife  about the rules of our house.   When you look out over the long stretch of human history, it is no  wonder that 99.9 percent of humans have lived under governments that  were monarchies or sultanates or autocracies.   Since the beginning of time, human beings have preferred, have been  naturally drawn to or maybe have been trapped in hierarchal systems  where the strong and the powerful make the decisions for everyone else.   The idea that humans, both the weak and the powerful, the rich and  the poor, should decide together, each person having equal weight, the  course of their Nation--this idea is revolutionary.   There have been experiments over the course of world history, but no  nation has sustained this idea longer than this one. In historical  context, our democracy should be perceived as a tiny, fragile port in  the middle of a raging storm, and none of us should be surprised that  once in a while some Americans, drawn to the old system of control by  the strong and powerful, decide that it is time to give up and submit  to the battering winds.   That is the moment we are in today. Just in the last few days, former  President Donald Trump, the leader of the Republican Party and their  likely candidate for President in 2024, once again, made clear his  intent.   He said last week:         We have to be a lot sharper the next time when it comes to       counting the votes. . . . Sometimes the vote counter is more       important than the candidate.    The leader of the Republican Party isn't even trying to hide his  agenda any longer. State after State is changing the rules of who  counts the votes so that only the allies of Donald Trump can decide  which votes count and which votes don't.   Now, much of the focus today, understandably, has been on the  unconscionable rules that limit the ability of poor people or people of  color to vote, and it is heinous that Black voters have to wait in  lines that are two times or ten times longer than a White voter. But  democracy may actually collapse when Trump's plan to rig the next count  succeeds in plain view for everybody to see. He broadcasts that in the  next election the vote counting will be more important than the quality  of the candidates.   Why? Because the plan is to install Donald Trump as President,  whether or not he actually wins the election, just like he tried to do  after the 2020 election.   Can anybody really deny that this is the agenda?   Of course, that is what he is doing, because it is what he tried to  do transparently, unapologetically in 2020, and that is what he is  telling us he is going to do in 2024. At some point, we just have to  believe what we see and what we hear.   And I appreciate Senator Thune coming to the floor earlier today and  telling us that he believed Joe Biden won the election and that when he  faced a close election, he submitted to the will of the voters. But  Senator Thune is not the mainstream of the Republican Party today. In  fact, those that believe Joe Biden won the election in the Republican  Party are the dead limbs of an otherwise perfectly healthy tree. The  trunk of that tree is Donald Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene and all  those who believe that Joe Biden is an illegitimate President. That is  what 70 percent of Republicans believe today.   If mainstream Republicans in this body came to Connecticut and held a  rally, a dozen people would show up. Marjorie Taylor Greene came to my  State and 3,000 Republicans came--more than I have ever seen show up  for a Republican, because that is the mainstream of the Republican  Party.   Today, we are voting on a proposal to change our rules so that we can  protect our democracy and the rules that have stood for generations to  assure that both parties continue to have a role in counting the votes.  And while it feels astonishing that not a single Republican is going to  join us today--not the Trump cheerleaders nor the sometimes critics of  the former President--maybe it shouldn't be that shocking, because of  that natural state that billions of humans have defaulted to over the  millennium, the unelected rich and powerful being in charge of  everything and setting the rules for everyone else.   It might square perfectly with Republicans' agenda. For the last  decade, the entire legislative agenda here, when Republicans have been  in charge, has been about giving more power, more money, more influence  to the rich and powerful. They oppose President Biden's agenda to give  tax breaks to the poor and the middle class or to cut profits for the  drug companies, because it empowers that agenda, often the weak and the  powerless.   Maybe Republicans aren't fighting to protect democracy like Democrats  are because a reversion to a world where just the rich and powerful run  the country just isn't as scary to that side of this body as it is to  this side.   I wish it weren't up to us. I wish it didn't have to come to this. I  wish it was not only Democrats that see the miracle of our fragile  democracy, because the idea that a worker making $12 an hour has just  as much say in the future of their country as the CEO making $12  million a year, it is revolutionary. It is unnatural. And it matters  more than anything, even the traditions and the rules of the Senate.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?   The Senator from Maine.  [[Page S341]]
