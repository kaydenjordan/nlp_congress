 Mr. President, I have sought recognition to note last  night's strong bipartisan vote of 90 to 7 to confirm Derek Kan's  nomination. I am very happy that Mr. Kan is now able to take up the  duties of Under Secretary for Transportation Policy at the Department  of Transportation after a long, entirely unnecessary delay. As I stated  on the floor last week, it is truly unfortunate that it took 4 months  and the engagement of the cloture process to confirm this well- qualified nominee, who obviously has strong bipartisan support.   I hope that last night's vote will signal to those who are holding  other well-qualified nominees to the Department--including the  nomination of Ronald Batory to be Administrator of the Federal Railroad  Administration and the nomination of Adam Sullivan to be Assistant  Secretary of Transportation for Legislative Affairs--over funding for  the multibillion dollar Gateway Project in New York and New Jersey that  their strategy is misplaced and depriving the Department of the very  expertise needed to make progress on Gateway and a host of other  critical issues.   Mr. President, I have also sought recognition to voice my strong  support for the nomination of Steven Bradbury to be general counsel at  the U.S. Department of Transportation. Mr. Bradbury has had an  extraordinary legal career in both the private and public sector, and  he is well prepared to address the many challenging legal questions  that will come before the Department.   Mr. Bradbury is currently a litigation partner at the Dechert law  firm here in Washington, DC, and his practice focuses on regulatory  enforcement and investigations, rulemakings, and judicial review of  agency actions, as well as appellate cases and antitrust matters.   From 2005 to 2009, Mr. Bradbury headed the Office of Legal Counsel at  the Department of Justice, the office that provides essential legal  advice to the President and the heads of executive departments and  agencies.   In that role, he received the Edmund J. Randolph Award and the  Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service, among other  awards. Before serving in the Justice Department, he worked in private  practice for 10 years and clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas on the  U.S. Supreme Court and for Judge James L. Buckley on the D.C. Circuit.   On June 28, 2017, the Commerce Committee held a hearing on his  nomination, and we reported his nomination favorably on August 2. Last  night, the Senate invoked cloture on his nomination.   At his nomination hearing, a number of our Democrat colleagues raised  concerns over Mr. Bradbury's suitability for this position, mostly  focusing on a number of opinions he wrote regarding interrogation  policies while at the Justice Department.   I do not doubt the sincerity of those who question the Bush  administration's approach to detainee treatment in the wake of the  horrific attacks of 9/11. I know that these concerns are not limited to  a single party.   Nevertheless, I would suggest that Mr. Bradbury has demonstrated a  willingness to reexamine the difficult decisions made at that time in a  manner that underscores the thoughtfulness he would bring to the  position to which he has been nominated.   For example, after he became the head of the Office of Legal Counsel  in 2004, he participated in decisions to withdraw and supersede  previous legal opinions addressing interrogation policies that had been  issued by his predecessors.   In response to questions for the record from some of my committee  colleagues, Mr. Bradbury elaborated on this topic. Specifically, he  said:         I support the McCain-Feinstein Amendment, enacted by       Congress in 2015, which mandates that all agencies of the       U.S. government are limited to use of the Army Field Manual       in the interrogation of detainees and which prohibits the use       of physical coercion. I believe the McCain-Feinstein       Amendment represents a historic policy decision and a moral       judgment for the United States, and it reaffirms America's       leadership on interrogation policy and practice. The clear       mandate of the McCain-Feinstein Amendment appropriately       elevates and vindicates the compelling principle of       reciprocity in the treatment of captured U.S. service men and       women.    Mr. Bradbury went on to say:         Twelve years ago, when I was called upon to advise on the       legality of proposed interrogation policies for use by       intelligence officers, the McCain-Feinstein Amendment had not       been enacted, and it was understood at that time that       intelligence agencies operated under a different, less well       defined, legal regime from the U.S. Armed Services. I did my       best to pull back previous OLC opinions that were overly       broad or otherwise flawed; to limit OLC's advice to the       narrowest grounds necessary and avoid reliance on expansive       interpretations of presidential power; to spell out very       clearly the specific factual assumptions on which the advice       depended, including the particular conditions, limitations,       and safeguards that were required as part of the policies;       and to describe in detail the specifics of those policies so       that the senior decision makers on the Principals Committee       of the National Security Council would be fully apprised of       precisely what they were being asked to approve.        The OLC opinions I prepared on these issues are no longer       operative, and the law has changed. I welcome the statutory       changes enacted by Congress.    In sum, I believe that Mr. Bradbury has fully addressed these  concerns.   It is also worth noting that Mr. Bradbury's nomination has received  the endorsement of many bipartisan leaders. During his confirmation  process, the committee received letters of support signed by more than  50 former government officials, including former Transportation  Secretaries Rodney Slater and Norm Mineta; former Attorneys General Ed  Meese, William Barr, and Michael Mukasey; former counsel to the  President Fred Fielding; former National Security Advisor Stephen  Hadley; former Solicitors General Ted Olson, Paul Clement, Greg Garre;  and many others. He also received the support of nearly 20 State  attorneys general from across the country.   Finally, I would also like to address the concerns raised about Mr.  Bradbury's representation of the U.S. subsidiary of Takata in  connection with the airbag inflator ruptures before the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration.   Mr. Bradbury has agreed to go beyond the requirements of his ethics  agreement to recuse himself from all aspects of the Takata airbag  inflator recalls for the duration of Mr. Bradbury's tenure as general  counsel at the Department of Transportation.   Because Mr. Bradbury has agreed to go well beyond what is required by  federal ethics laws and regulations, and well beyond the ethics  agreement he signed with the Office of Government Ethics with respect  to the Takata airbag inflator recall, I am satisfied that he has more  than adequately dealt with conflict of interest concerns and recusals.   Moreover, as I have noted, Mr. Bradbury has received bipartisan  support for his nomination, including from former Transportation  Secretary Rodney Slater and former Transportation Secretary Norm  Mineta.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Steven  Bradbury to be general counsel for the Department of Transportation.
