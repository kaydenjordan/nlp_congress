 Mr. Chairman, New Mexico is  home to the Kirtland Air Force Research Laboratory that develops  groundbreaking technologies that support our men and women in the Armed  Forces.   These technologies often have a range of commercial applications that  can re-energize domestic manufacturing, create high-paying jobs, and  increase economic development in our State, which has the second  highest unemployment rate in the Nation.   High-speed internet servers, GPS, electric vehicles, and even  microwave ovens are just a few of the examples of transformational  technologies that were originally developed by the Federal Government.   My amendments would help facilitate the commercialization of  innovative DOD-developed technologies by investing in the scientists,  engineers, and mathematicians serving in our military laboratories.   By providing laboratory personnel with business education,  entrepreneurial sabbaticals, and new opportunities to partner with  universities and businesses, we can make cutting-edge technologies more  widely available to American businesses and consumers, grow our  economy, and ensure that the United States leads the world in  innovation.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendments.
