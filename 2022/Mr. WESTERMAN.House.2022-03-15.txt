 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 268 authorizes the transfer of approximately 166 acres, by  donation, from the International Boundary and Water Commission to the  National Park Service for inclusion in the Palo Alto Battlefield  National Historic Park in Texas.   Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Park is the site of the first  major battle of the Mexican-American War and has the distinction of  being the only National Park Service unit to interpret the Mexican- American War.   The land authorized to be transferred through this bill includes the  historic Fort Brown site in Brownsville, Texas, which served as a  critical military outpost during the Mexican-American War.   I thank Chair Grijalva for accommodating our request at markup to  require the Secretary of the Interior to complete a boundary study  analyzing the feasibility of adding this land to the park prior to it  being acquired and incorporated into the boundary. The study  requirement will ensure that the land to be donated is feasible for the  National Park Service to manage as an addition to the park.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will help preserve an important piece  of American history, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am ready to close when the gentleman  from Arizona is. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   H.R. 1908, offered by Congressman Case of Hawaii, requires the  Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to assess the suitability  and feasibility of designating Ka'ena Point National Heritage Area.   The study authorized by this bill focuses on an undeveloped area on  the west end of O'ahu that is home to the last intact sand dune species  in Hawaii.   As the chairman pointed out, this point is also inhabited by various  protected species, the wedge-tailed shearwaters, monk seals, and rare  native plants.   The feasibility study that this bill authorizes will be conducted in  consultation with State and local historic preservation officers,  historical societies, and tourism offices.   Some day I hope to be able to visit this Ka'ena Point with  Congressman Case. I urge adoption of the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I again urge adoption of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1931 extends the authorization of the Japanese  American Confinement Sites grant program and establishes a new  competitive grant program to award grants to Japanese American  organizations to create and disseminate educational materials about the  history of Japanese American confinement during World War II.   In 2006, Congress established the Japanese American Confinement  Sites, or JACS grant program to preserve and interpret U.S. Confinement  Sites during World War II. However, the program will soon run up  against the end of its authorization cap.   The program has supported valuable projects across the country,  including at least 12 in my home State of Arkansas, where important  projects have been funded at my alma mater, the University of Arkansas  at Fayetteville, as well as Arkansas State University, the University  of Arkansas at Little Rock, University of Central Arkansas, and the  Central Arkansas Library System, and the McGehee Industrial Foundation.   These projects include archiving, creating educational exhibits,  hosting workshops and lectures, preserving cemeteries, and recording  oral histories.   I appreciate Representative Matsui's work on this important  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support extending the program.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage passage of this bill.   I have friends back in Arkansas who, like Representative Matsui, at a  young age, were in some of these internment camps, and they are great  Americans, very patriotic. We owe it to them to recognize what happened  and to support this program.  [[Page H3725]]    Mr. Speaker, I, again, urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2899, offered by Mr. San Nicolas of Guam,  requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to assess the  suitability and feasibility of designating areas within the island of  Guam as a national heritage area.   Archaeological evidence indicates that the Mariana Islands were one  of the first places settled by seafaring peoples. The last 400 years of  Guam's history are marked by administrations of three different  nations: Spain, the United States, and Japan. After the Spanish- American War in 1898, Guam was ceded to the United States as an  unincorporated territory.   Guam's rich history and culture merit consideration for national  heritage area status.   I support Congressman San Nicolas' bill to study areas within the  island of Guam to determine whether they merit designation as a  national heritage area in the future.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, again, I urge adoption of the bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I also rise in support, along with Chairman Grijalva,  and I thank him for his support of H.R. 3113, the MAPLand Act, offered  by the ranking member of the Natural Resources Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations, Mr. Blake Moore of Utah.   This bill directs the Department of the Interior, the U.S. Forest  Service, and the Army Corps of Engineers to jointly develop and adopt  interagency standards for the collection and dissemination of outdoor  recreation data on Federal lands.   Our Nation's outdoorsmen and -women are increasingly reliant on  digital mapping and GPS technologies to hunt, fish, and enjoy other  recreation activities on our Nation's complicated patchwork of Federal  lands. Unfortunately, inconsistent and incomplete digital mapping data  frequently prevents the public and Federal land management agencies  from maximizing the full benefits of these technologies.   Mr. Moore's bill requires our Federal land management agencies to  digitize records of easements and rights-of-way across private lands so  the public will have a better understanding of Federal land access  points and ensure that Americans recreating stay safe and avoid  trespassing.   Outdoor recreation is vital to our Nation's economy, and the way we  expand outdoor recreation is to expand access.   Madam Speaker, I commend Mr. Moore for his hard work on this  important legislation to modernize our Federal land management records,  and I urge adoption of the measure.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Moore).  [[Page H3728]]         Madam Speaker, I encourage adoption of this  commonsense bill. It will be very beneficial to provide better access  to our outdoor recreation areas, and I think it would also be a great  benefit to Americans.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I also rise in support, along with Chairman Grijalva,  of H.R. 3197, the Save the Liberty Theatre Act, offered by Mr. Johnson  of Louisiana.   Mr. Johnson's bill transfers a federally owned annex to the city of  Eunice, Louisiana, so the city can complete critical renovations to the  historic Liberty Theatre.   Transferring this annex will allow the park to replace the HVAC  system in the adjacent Prairie Acadian Cultural Center and allow the  city of Eunice to install a new HVAC system in the theater and perform  other renovations that are currently hindered due to the Natural Park  Services' ownership interest. This transfer will result in cost savings  for the National Park Service and the taxpayer.   Madam Speaker, I commend Mr. Johnson for his work to save this  important Louisiana landmark and building local support for his  legislation. I urge adoption of the measure, and I hope that the Senate  will take up this bill very soon.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, along with Chairman Grijalva, I rise in support of  H.R. 4380, which would designate the El Paso Healing Garden in El Paso,  Texas, as a national memorial.   On August 3, 2019, 23 people tragically lost their lives and more  than 20 were injured when a gunman opened fire at a Walmart in El Paso.  In 2020, the county of El Paso approved the construction of the El Paso  Community Healing Garden to provide a space to honor victims and  survivors and aid in the healing process.   I hope that the El Paso Healing Garden will continue to bring peace  and comfort to the families who lost loved ones in this senseless and  horrific attack.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, again, I support this bipartisan bill.  It is unfortunate that with regard to something that had so much  agreement on it that people would point fingers at political figures or  political movements and try to assign the actions of a disturbed,  radical individual to a political party or to a political figure.   Madam Speaker, I do support this, I wish that the debate hadn't gone  in this direction, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I urge adoption of this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 5001 would extend the Upper Colorado and San Juan  recovery implementation programs and their reporting requirements for  an additional year.   The programs provide Endangered Species Act compliance for more than  2,500 water and power projects that withdraw more than 3.7 million-acre  feet of water for human needs.   The program's goals are to recover four endangered fish species while  continuing facility operations with the ultimate goal of species  delisting. Last year, the Fish and Wildlife Service reclassified one of  these species, the humpback chub, from endangered to threatened, and  proposed a similar reclassification for the razorback sucker.   Madam Speaker, if it has razorback in the name, it has to be  important, and we need to take care of it.   Current law required the Secretary of the Interior to submit a report  to Congress by September 30, 2021, on recommendations for the programs  post 2023. Unfortunately, the Department of the Interior failed to meet  this deadline. As such we are here today extending the programs by 1  year in order to give the administration enough time to complete the  report.   While I support the extension today, I want to be clear that any  further extension of the programs will require an in-depth discussion  of the programs' goals, achievements, and administrative overhead  costs.   In closing, Madam Speaker, again, I support this bill, I support the  razorback sucker, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6434, offered by my  committee colleague, Mr. Obernolte of California, to establish a  Japanese American World War II History Network within the National Park  Service.   As Chairman Grijalva stated, this bill is complementary to the  previous bill we considered today with the JACS program in it.   Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, tens of thousands of Japanese  Americans were forcibly removed from the West Coast to relocation  centers across the United States. Japanese  [[Page H3733]]  Americans were imprisoned without trial and forced to relocate to some  of the most remote areas of our country, with few personal belongings.  My State of Arkansas was home to two relocation camps, Rohwer in Desha  County and Jerome in Chicot and Drew Counties.   Mr. Obernolte's bill, which I have proudly cosponsored, would  establish a cohesive national network to increase the visibility of all  sites related to the Japanese American experience during World War II.  The network will be similar to existing networks established in recent  years to connect sites associated with the Underground Railroad, the  Reconstruction era, and the African American civil rights movement.   At the legislative hearing, Mr. Bruce Saito, chair of the Friends of  Manzanar, testified about this critical network, saying: ``We must  continue to strengthen the network and continue to connect the dots  through the network so this tragic and very important lesson in history  is never forgotten.''   The new network will be an important tool to ensure that this  history, no matter how painful it may be, is always remembered, and the  important stories of interned Japanese Americans are told with honor  and respect.   In addition to the Friends of Manzanar, we have received letters of  support from the Amache Preservation Society, the National Conference  of State Historic Preservation Officers, the National Japanese American  Historical Society, and the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program.   I commend Mr. Obernolte for his work on this important legislation  that will help future generations learn from and reflect on the  experiences of Japanese Americans during World War II.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his support,  and I thank Mr. Obernolte for introducing the legislation. I urge  adoption of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  also for his leadership in the Western Caucus and on these important  issues that mean a lot to places like the Fourth District of Arkansas,  to all over rural America, where out-of-touch policies in D.C. have a  negative impact on people's daily lives, and just being able to earn a  living, to pay their taxes, and to provide the goods and services that  the rest of the world needs. So I appreciate you hosting this Special  Order.   For years, it has been clear to rural America that our Federal  permitting and environmental review processes are broken. While well- intentioned, they are doing more harm than good. The current system is  complex, burdensome, and ineffective, yet the political  [[Page H3737]]  elite in Washington, D.C., wonder why our farmers, ranchers, and energy  producers struggle.   Far-left special interest groups have weaponized, as Mr. Newhouse  said, well-intentioned laws like the National Environmental Policy Act  and the Endangered Species Act, and they use them as clubs to bludgeon  or kill critical infrastructure, natural resource management, and  energy and minerals development projects across the United States.   Delays in environmental regulatory systems are especially acute. In  2020, the Council on Environmental Quality showed that the average time  for a Federal agency to complete a final environmental impact statement  through the NEPA process--again, Mr. Newhouse quoted this number--is  4\1/2\ years. But that is the average number. One-quarter of all  projects took over 6 years to complete. That is more than red tape.  That is a roadblock. That is why Republicans support the BUILDER Act to  streamline the NEPA process and benefit communities looking to improve  infrastructure investment.   My district, like many others in the Western Caucus, is built on the  agriculture industry, and I hear over and over from hardworking  Arkansans who are simply trying to make a living through the sludge of  government regulation. Overregulation and stalled regulation ensures  that only the biggest businesses have the money and time to navigate  the red tape and hire the lawyers that are needed to even attempt to  navigate the process. This is the kind of Big Government that puts  local, small operators out of business. It stamps out small business  operators and honest competition in one fell swoop.   The message from rural America is clear: Government needs to get out  of the way. More than that, government needs to be part of the solution  and not part of the problem. I think government has forgotten that it  is the government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and  that if you work for the government, you work for the people. It is not  the other way around.   There is no doubt that we should be good stewards of our environment  and communities, but too often the free market, unburdened by  government, is seen as the enemy of both. This is simply false.  Streamlining a permitting process shouldn't be partisan, political, or  picking sides. It can be a win for the environment, the economy, and  our communities simultaneously. We do not need to choose just one. In  fact, a healthy environment and a strong economy go hand in hand.  Somehow, we have gotten this idea that they are mutually exclusive, and  we can't have one without the other.   Again, Republicans have the solutions to cutting the red tape--it is  called the BUILDER Act--and by so doing, we can empower rural America  and strengthen our Nation's economy at the same time.
