 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                        Welcoming Back Senator McCain     Mr. President, I am so encouraged by the words of our  dear friend and fellow Senator, Mr. John McCain.   First of all, I am so encouraged by seeing that fighting spirit of  John McCain and so glad to see him back. In the midst of everything he  is facing, that he would come and insert himself to give us some  considerable words of wisdom--it was such an enormous, emotional  experience when John walked in. Then, to have all of us seated here  because of the vote that was occurring--and not a Senator left after  the vote was concluded because we wanted to hear from John and did so  willingly. His eloquent words about how we all need to come together  and stop being driven apart by partisan reasons were timely, and they  were well received.   Mr. President, this Senator never thought we would see a vote to  advance a bill which, to so many, feels as though it is going to harm  so many of our fellow Americans. Obviously, we can disagree on  specifics, but we have seen that particular expression of opinion of  harm over and over. We have seen it in the coverage of the townhall  meetings, where people stand up and say: If I didn't have this  healthcare, I would be dead.   This Senator has seen it in Florida over and over, as I have had  people come up to me wherever I am--in a meeting, on the street corner,  in the airport, wherever--and say: Senator, please don't let them take  my healthcare away from me.   Indeed, when people explained their particular circumstances, four  different families--one family, if they did not have the waiver on  Medicaid, indeed, that fellow would not only not be alive, but even if  he were alive, he would be in an institution instead of being able to  be cared for or three other families who brought forth testimonies  about how the Affordable Care Act has given them insurance they had  never been able to get before. It was at a price they could afford and  involved coverage they never could have had.   In other cases, people had preexisting conditions. This Senator, as a  former elected insurance commissioner of Florida, has seen insurance  companies refuse to insure people because they had a preexisting  condition. If you had asthma, that was a preexisting condition; if you  had a bad rash, that was a preexisting condition, and they were not  going to insure you. Also, insurance policies never had the guarantee  of lifetime coverage but instead the policy said you had lifetime caps.  There was a dollar figure which, if you exceeded it, the insurance  policy was not going to cover any more.   If we are really serious about wanting to fix the situation, if our  brothers and sisters on the other side of the aisle are not successful  in proceeding with what the majority leader is going to be coming forth  with, if that is voted down, and if we are serious about it, take what  is left, which is the existing law--the Affordable Care Act--and fix  it.   Senator Collins, a former insurance commissioner, appointed in the  State of Maine, and this Senator, a former elected insurance  commissioner in the State of Florida, are already working on a  reinsurance fund which would insure the insurance companies against  catastrophe. I asked for this to be costed out in the State of Florida.  This fix would lower premiums 13 percent in the State of Florida.   In the words of Senator McCain, if we really want to get together and  fix the problems, we can. Yet, in the midst of hearing from  constituents all around the country who have shared their personal  stories about how the existing law has helped, we are in the  parliamentary position we are in, where we will proceed on trying to  repeal what is the existing law.   For some people, they don't care about the politics. As a matter of  fact, for a lot of people, they don't care about the politics. They  just want access to healthcare. They want what is genuinely described  as health insurance--whether it is a Medicaid type of insurance or  whether it is an actual policy through a private insurance company  offered on the health exchanges in the States or whether it is the  guarantees of the coverage in an individual policy that they might buy,  they just want healthcare. That is the reason you have health insurance  in the first place.   Now, I have heard some fixes say: Oh, let's cut back on Medicaid,  which, remember, is spread over millions and millions of people, just  like Medicare is spread over millions and millions of people. The  difference there is age. If you are 65, you are eligible for Medicare.   There are some people we overlook in the system who depend on  Medicaid. How about veterans? Veterans' healthcare has been taken care  of while on Active Duty in the U.S. military. Then their healthcare is  transferred to the Veterans' Administration, but there are a lot of  veterans who are not getting their healthcare through the VA. They get  their healthcare through Medicaid. If you start cutting back on  Medicaid, which are the versions of the so-called replace bills we have  seen--if you start cutting back on Medicaid and make a capped program  or a block grant program, we already know the figures. It has been  costed out by the CBO. The figures tell us it is close to an $800  billion cut over a decade. When you start doing that, the people who  rely on Medicaid at the edges, like some poor people or like seniors in  nursing homes--by the way, in my  [[Page S4171]]  State, 65 to 70 percent of the seniors in nursing homes are on  Medicaid, and some of those veterans I told you about are not on VA  healthcare but Medicaid. How about some of the children's programs on  Medicaid? If you start cutting that back to the tune of about $800  billion over a decade, you are going to knock out a lot of these  people. That is not something we want to do. That is why, when  explained, you have such low numbers who support what is being  attempted as a replacement if you repeal the Affordable Care Act. We  should be focused on working together to improve the Affordable Care  Act, not to make it worse.   I pretty much have said it all. The bills we have seen coming forth  as replacements change the age ratio from the existing law, the  Affordable Care Act, of 3 to 1 in the healthcare exchanges so you can  charge an older person three times as much as a young, healthy  individual--not in the replacement bills we see coming up. It is 5 to  1. What does that mean? That means for those older Americans, before  they turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare, they are going to be  paying more for their insurance premiums. Is that what we want to do? I  don't think so.    You cannot ignore these facts. I ask those who come forth with these  replacements, why in the world do you do this? Why do you support a  bill that will hurt so many Americans, which has been demonstrated over  and over? Why do you support a bill that will hurt so many of your  constituents that your constituents cry out to you, please, don't do  this? And they give personal testimonies.   I urge our colleagues, after the emotional appeal of Senator McCain,  to do things in a bipartisan way. Take a moment, reflect on what your  constituents have said--not just some of your constituents. Listen to  all of your constituents and ask yourself, are you doing the right  thing?   Let's improve our Nation's healthcare system. Let's not make it  worse. Let's do it in the spirit of the uplifting words of Senator  McCain and what he said: Let's do it together in a bipartisan way.   I yield the floor.
