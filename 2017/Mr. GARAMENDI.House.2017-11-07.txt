 Mr. Speaker, I came here to talk about tax policy, and  I will; however, having listened for the last 60 minutes to the most  remarkable admission that Russia is meddling in America in many, many  ways, even an admission that Russia somehow wants to influence  America's elections--in this case, America's elections for the last  year--I am pleased that my Republican colleagues are so adamant in  pursuing Russian influence and, perhaps, controversial influence in the  United States. I am pleased that they are doing that.   I am also pleased that Mr. Mueller is continuing his investigations.  I will note that there have been two indictments and one guilty plea  that have already come forth from his investigation having to do with  people that are very, very close to President Trump's administration.   More will come of that, and I certainly hope our Republican friends  will continue to focus on the fact that Russia is playing very serious  and, quite possibly, illegal games or activities here in the United  States.   We will carry on. I firmly believe that Mr. Mueller is not about to  resign or be fired. If he were to be fired, I would suspect that there  would be far more serious consequences than the kind of yapping we just  heard for the last hour here on the floor.   Let me go back to my original point, which has to do with tax policy.  As interesting as Russia might be, tax policy is going to be far, far  more consequential in the long term. Whatever comes of the Russian  situation in the election and conspiracies or other kinds of conflicts  will bear themselves out over the next several years or months. Tax  policy, however, is something that America is going to live with for a  long, long time, were it to pass.   There are many things we could say about it. One is that, yes, the  top 1 percent of America's wealthiest people--you take 360 million of  us Americans and take the top 1 percent--are going to get 50 percent of  all of the tax cuts that are in this multitrillion-dollar tax cut  legislation.   So a trillion and a half dollars over the next 10 years to the top 1  percent ought to really drive up that problem that we call income  disparity in the United States, you know, what we used to talk about:  the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, or that America has a real  problem with the superwealthy controlling most of the wealth and the  rest of Americans really left behind.   So this tax bill is going to make it even worse. Now, that is really  good. How does it do that?   Well, let's see. By eliminating the estate tax. Yes, five members of  President Trump's Cabinet, including the President, would benefit in  the billions. You see, the estate tax would be eliminated in just 4  years, about the same time they would be leaving the administration.   What does that mean?   Well, if you have a billion-dollar estate and there is a tax on that,  you can eliminate the first $10 million, $11 million of that, but you  have a 40 percent tax on the remainder. Well, that is about $400  million in estate tax.   Who would have a billion-dollar estate?   The President, Mr. Ross, the Treasury Secretary, maybe the Education  Secretary, maybe others.   So who is going to benefit from this?   The superwealthy, to the tune of millions upon millions or hundreds  of millions of dollars of the estate tax itself.   There is much more to that. American corporations would see their top  rating from 39 down to 20. Who is going to benefit from that?   Well, we heard the Treasury Secretary say the American workers will.   Where is the evidence for that?   There is no evidence for that, none at all; in fact, quite the  contrary. The Treasury Department's own tax analysis section says that  70 percent of the after-profit taxes now go to, guess who. Stockholders  and executives, not to the workers.   It used to be that way back in the sixties and seventies. Maybe 70  percent went to the workers, went to increasing plants and equipment,  investments in the United States. It is not that way anymore. Quite the  contrary. The American workers will be left behind once again by those  tax reductions.   That is not to say we shouldn't reduce the nominal tax rate for  corporations. Yes, we should, but we should do it in a way that  actually helps American workers. It keeps investments in the United  States. But, no, not this tax proposal. This one actually creates what  is called territorial accounting for international corporations.   Let's suppose that you have an international corporation located in  Silicon Valley. We have some really big ones there. Territorial taxes  would be that all of the earnings that that corporation has outside of  the United States would be beyond being taxed by the United States,  even though it is an American corporation that can manipulate the price  of its goods and services to actually push, overseas, its profits.  Brilliant.   You want to bring jobs back to America? Don't do territorial tax  reform. It doesn't work for the American worker. It works for the  stockholders. Their stocks and stock prices will go up. They will be  able to receive even more benefits.   That is only $3 trillion over 10 years of reduction for corporation  taxes.   Who benefits?   Wall Street corporate executives.   Who loses?   The American worker loses.   One more thing that is on my mind is that I used to hear last year,  the year before last, the year before that--in fact, for the last two  decades--a lot of talk from about more than half of the Members of this  House of Representatives who would talk about the horrible impact of  the American deficit and that it would lead to ruin for the American  economy, our grandchildren would be left to pay it off, and all the  horrible things that the deficit would bring to the United States,  ultimately leading to the collapse of the American economy.  [[Page H8591]]    Well, there is some truth in that. The hyperbole was a little bit  more than necessary, but, indeed, it is a problem to see our deficit  ever increasing.   Every now and then, we come up against the debt limit, and, oh, my  goodness, the debate that took place here: We have got to stop it. We  have got to stop deficit financing. We have got to bring our budget  back into balance.   Not a bad idea. In fact, it is the right thing to do. And, by the  way, it was actually done during the Clinton administration.   For 2 years, almost 3 years, the American Federal Government ran a  surplus, and it was estimated that in the 2000 to 2010 period, if that  surplus were to continue, it might lead to a significant and  troublesome reduction in the American debt. That is a complex question  as to why that would be troublesome, but, nonetheless, it was said.                                time  2000    So what happened?   George W. Bush came in, cut taxes, decided we would go to war, first  war ever in America's history that was not financed by taxes but by  borrowing, mostly from China, and the deficit began to explode. And  then there was the great collapse in 2008, and the deficit went right  through the roof.   So we have been living, since that time of the George W. Bush tax  cuts with a deficit, a structural deficit that has not been solved  despite all the rhetoric from the deficit hawks.   Now, I guess the deficit hawks, like the Canadian geese, have somehow  migrated to the far south of Washington, D.C., because I don't hear any  around here today. They have migrated somewhere far away from  Washington. But what I hear from those previous folks that called  themselves deficit hawks is that they want to drive up the American  deficit, that they have a proposal to actually increase the American  deficit.   Oh, wonderful, they say, not to worry. We can increase the deficit by  well over $1.5 trillion in the next decade and it will be lovely. We  will create more jobs.   I am going: Excuse me. I must have missed something in this debate.  You just said a year ago that those deficits would somehow create a  calamity for the American economy, that we would lose jobs, we would  lose our competitiveness, that we would come to ruin, and now you are  telling me I shouldn't worry about a $1.5 trillion increase in the  deficit over the next decade?   Wow, how does that work? How does that happen?   I want to share something with you. I became--trying to understand  what this was all about, how could it be 6 months ago or a year ago  they were deficit hawks and they had to do away with the deficit and  now they want to increase the deficit? What is this all about?   So I asked my staff: Give me some numbers. Don't we have what we know  as a structural deficit built into the budget of the United States tax  revenues significantly lower than the expenditures, and therefore we  have this structural deficit? Show me what those numbers are.   So they did, and here they are.   Structural deficit, 2018, the structural deficit is $567 billion.  That is half a trillion. That is the structural deficit that exists  today without any of this discussion about tax cuts.   Next year, 2019, it is expected to be $689 billion, two-thirds of $1  trillion in 1 year--in 1 year.   And it goes on.   The structural deficit in 2020, $775 billion. That is the ongoing  structural deficit in the Federal budget: revenue received,  expenditures--expenditures $775 billion more than the revenue in 2020.   This isn't talking about the new tax cuts that are being discussed  now here in Congress.   And so it goes.   In 2022, it is $1 trillion annual structural deficit.   So what does this tax cut mean?   Oh, it is only $1.4 trillion or $1.5 trillion over a 10-year period,  but that is on top of the existing structural deficit.   So here you have it. This year, the existing structural deficit  before any tax cuts, we are talking about $563 billion. Added to that,  as a result of the Republican Ryan-McConnell-Trump tax cuts, we are  adding $114 billion on top of $563 billion so that the structural  deficit, should this new tax cut ever come into place, will be $677  billion--not millions, billions.   Over the next 10 years, by the end of the 10-year period, as that tax  cut, this new tax cut goes into effect, with the addition adding to the  existing structural deficit, in the year 2027, 10 years from now, you  can expect a $1.6 trillion structural deficit.   This is a problem. It is a problem that is made even worse--even  worse--by the fact that the benefit of the tax cut does not go to  economic growth, but quite the contrary. It does not go to the working  men and women, the middle class of America who really do need to have a  better way, better wages, more money in their pockets, a better living,  a better ability to take care of their family and their children, a  better education, a better opportunity, and a better infrastructure.  No. No. None of that will happen. Instead, what will happen as a result  of the Republican tax cut is that the wealthy will get wealthier.   Remember this: 50 percent of all of the tax cut benefits--and we are  talking trillions here, as much as $3 trillion over a 10-year period.  Fifty percent of that will go to the top 1 percent of Americans. We are  talking the superwealthy here.   That is not a better way. That is an awful way to run a government.  That is an awful thing for an economy when you continue to skew the  American economy to the superwealthy and leave behind the American  worker, the American family struggling to do better, struggling to have  a better opportunity for their children in school, a better road or a  better bus or a better train on which to travel, a better  transportation system.   So here we are. Here we are in the House of Representatives debating  in committee today how to make the deficit worse, how to increase the  structural deficit over the next 10 years, how to literally run this  country into bankruptcy.   No, we are not going to go bankrupt, but what we will do, we will  terminate key programs as we struggle to find ways of balancing the  budget with so little Federal revenue available to us as a result of  these tax cuts. I could probably go on for an hour and just work myself  into a rage about the lost opportunity.   We Democrats have proposed a better solution, a better way to deal  with the tax policies, one that actually provides benefits to the  working families of America, who, as our Republican friends like to  say, sit around the kitchen table and worry about their debts. Yes,  indeed, they do. They worry about it. We have a better way of providing  for the infrastructure, a better way of providing for our national  security, our education, and on and on.    The architect of those programs that lay out a better way for the  American economy and the American worker and the American family is  with us here tonight, our minority leader, Ms. Pelosi.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi).    Madam Leader, if I might, you said SALT. It is like  really pouring salt on a wound. But SALT is State and local taxes.   So for California, New Jersey, New York, Illinois, and other States  that have big populations, they collect this revenue, and it cannot be  deducted. The numbers you have, I understand those came from the  Department of the Treasury and the IRS.    Madam Leader, you raised a very important point early  on here about the way in which--I just heard you ask to reach out to  Republicans to sit down and talk about how to structure a decent tax  reform, not just a tax cut for the wealthy.   My understanding is the Republicans have not even offered a moment--a  second--to discuss these tax bills with any of us, nor have they had  even one hearing on the most consequential economic policy that this  Nation could put forward. Not a hearing at all, but rushing out  secretly. Today, I understand they had a markup, but no witnesses,  other than someone to answer questions as to the impact.   And there has been discussion about the past major tax cut of Ronald  Reagan's in 1986, in which we heard that there were 2 years of hearings  all around the Nation and, I guess, more than 30 hearings in Congress  before that major tax bill passed in 1986. But now here we are rushing  this huge monumental and very detrimental tax bill through.    Now, that is what I have heard, and I am not in the leadership, but,  as far as I know, they haven't talked to you.    You said it. I was astounded that, during the first  Special Order hour, there were about 12 members of the Republican Party  who came down here on some weird conspiracy theory, and I am going:  Wait a minute, guys, why don't you talk about your tax bill; why don't  you sit up here and brag about all of the good things you are doing on  the tax bill?   Apparently they want to hide.    That is middle-income.    You were laying out, Madam Leader, our Republican  colleagues from California who seem to ignore or want to not even think  about the State and local tax deduction, and also the mortgage interest  deduction. Trying to find a house in California that is for less than  $500,000 or $700,000 is virtually impossible. Certainly in the bay  area, much of southern California, and in the Sacramento region, it is  almost impossible.   So by reducing that mortgage interest deduction, together with State  and local taxes, you are seriously increasing the tax burden on  homeowners and on working men and women in California.   You laid it out so very well. In the district directly to my south-- Mr. Denham's district--101,000 of his constituents currently have a  $7,982 average deduction for State and local taxes, and for the  mortgage interest. They will lose that, and they will wind up paying  somewhere between 25 to 30 percent on that lost deduction. So let's say  25 percent of $8,000 is what, $2,000? New taxes right there.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Madam Leader for joining us  tonight.   I remember here on the floor, when the debate occurred over the  budget that did pass the House of Representatives a couple of weeks  ago, you spoke eloquently on the floor about what this budget would  mean, that it would open the door to some very bad public policies, in  fact, public policies that would harm individual Americans as well as  the American economy, and you were very passionate about it. You said  that about the budget, which passed the House only on Republican votes,  no Democrat votes.    Yes. Jeff Denham, Mr. McClintock, and the other  Republicans from California included.    You laid it out. You made it very, very clear that it  would lead to a tax bill that would be harmful. We had some ideas then  what it would be, but we had no idea that it would be such a horrendous  problem for the American economy and particularly for the American  workers and middle class. You laid that out very well.   You also laid out very, very clearly that in that budget was the  blueprint for the evisceration of programs that Americans depend upon.  You talked about Medicare and you talked about Medicaid, of which 60  percent of Medicaid goes to seniors in nursing homes across this  Nation, and the potential cut that would come to Medicare.   You also talked about how it would, as you just did, go after the  education system, after research that we need for medical research, and  economics, and all of the sciences. You talked about the  infrastructure.   You laid out that that budget bill was the template. We are now  seeing that template come to reality on the floor of the House first  with this tax cut. Probably within months, should this tax bill pass,  we are going to see the rest of what you told us to watch out for.  Watch out for the cuts coming to Medicare, watch out for the cuts  coming to Medicaid, to education, to infrastructure, to the things that  Americans depend upon in their daily lives, the Meals on Wheels  program, and then the supplemental nutrition programs.   Standing right here, I remember I was in the back of the room here,  and I heard you speak about what would happen if that budget bill  passed the House. It did. Now we are seeing the first step. There will  be another step. They will come back after the Affordable Care Act and  medical care and all of that. I wish you were wrong.    What you did standing here warning us, I wish you were  wrong, but you are not. You are absolutely correct. Now we are seeing  it play out here in secret without public hearings.   We are going to talk about this, and I hope the American people will  hold those accountable who vote for such a horrendous economic policy,  one that actually creates a structural deficit that will be virtually  impossible for America to get out of, and all of the harm that will  come by shifting enormous wealth to the men and women who already are  the wealthiest ever in the last 400 years. The wealthy in America have  accumulated more wealth in a smaller group than at any time in the last  4 centuries dating back to the Spanish Crown in 1500 and 1600. That is  bad economics, bad social policy. That is what they are doing.    Thank you so very much for joining us tonight.    We are going to drive this and make sure the American  public knows what is coming down.    I thank you, Madam Leader.   As I close, I will just say that this is not the last of this debate.  We are going to make sure that the American public knows what is  happening to them and what this Republican Congress is doing to the  American public.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 38 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, November 8, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
