 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this Friday is our deadline to fund 25  percent of the Federal Government, which remains unfunded as a result  of the short-term continuing resolution that was passed to keep it open  until February 15, pending negotiations to deal with border security  measures.   During the last shutdown, for 35 days, we know that 800,000 Federal  workers were not paid, including some 36,000 Texans. During that time,  we heard about families who could not afford to buy the necessities of  life, whether they be medicines or providing the funding to run the  heat in their homes and to keep their utility bills low--families who  went from donating food at food banks to then being a recipient of food  at those food banks.   Even though this all began as a battle over border security, the  impact was much bigger. Employees from the Coast Guard, the  Transportation Security Administration--the folks in the blue shirts  who usher us through security at airports--NASA, or the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Environmental Protection  Agency, the IRS, and a whole host of other Federal Agencies were caught  up in the crosshairs of our disagreements here and forced to deal with  financial uncertainty for weeks on end.   I personally believe that we were sent here to govern, not to preside  over shutdowns, and that we make tough decisions every day here by  negotiation and compromise. That is the way the Constitution  contemplates how the legislative branch will act.   None of us are dictators. None of us can dictate 100 percent of what  we want on any given occasion, so that means we have to negotiate. We  have to compromise, and obviously a shutdown represents a failure to  compromise.   I have to say that compromise and negotiation require good faith.  They require a desire on the part of all parties to actually solve a  problem, not to play ``gotcha'' and point score when it comes to  politics.   Unfortunately, this last shutdown was a result of some outlandish  positions taken by the Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, and the  Democratic leader here in the Senate, Mr. Schumer. They said, for  example, ``Let's be crystal clear. There will be no additional  appropriations to pay for the border wall. It is done.'' That was the  Democratic leader Senator Schumer.   Then Ms. Pelosi said, ``A wall, in my view, is an immorality.'' She  said it is immoral.   I agree with President Trump when he said what is immoral is allowing  the poison that is imported across our borders from the South, which  has contributed to the 70,000 drug overdose deaths we saw last year as  monitored and reported by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention; that is immoral--not doing anything about that, not dealing  with the human trafficking, the sex slavery, and the involuntary  servitude of young women and children. That is immoral.   I realize we have gotten caught up in this silly game of semantics.  Some people call a wall a fence, and others call a fence a wall. But we  all know what we are talking about are physical barriers that form a  necessary part of border security.   Again, I go back to the experts. I come from a border State with  1,200 miles of common border with Mexico. I look to the Border Patrol  and the Department of Homeland Security to answer this most basic  question. My question to them is this: What do you need in order to  accomplish the mission we have asked you to accomplish?  [[Page S1189]]    What the experts have always told me is that they need a combination  of three things. They need physical barriers in some locations that are  hard to control. They need technology to scan the trucks and the cars  that come over the ports of entry; they need ground sensors and radar  in the places between the ports of entry. Then they need the boots on  the ground; they need the Border Patrol, the law enforcement agents, in  order to detain people who come across the border.   I really find this debate over this one component of border security,  this physical barrier component, surreal. It really is hard work to try  to avoid a solution where the solution is staring you right in the  face, where we know that if people of good will were willing to talk  and to work through them, we could solve these problems, just as we do  so many other problems every day.   I was glad to learn that last night the negotiators on the conference  committee reached at least an agreement in principle to fund the  remaining Departments and Agencies of the Federal Government. I know we  are all eager to see the final details of the agreement and to learn  exactly what was included, and I understand, based on reports we heard  at lunch, it will probably be tomorrow before we can see the language  and make sure the language reflects what we see reported in the press.   As I said, again, I hope this agreement takes into account what we  have reportedly heard from the experts--that smart border security is a  combination of barriers, technology, and personnel.   I also hope it includes funding for our ports of entry to promote the  legal movement of goods and people across the border without  compromising security.   I think we all know that a lot of the high-end drugs--what I am  talking about are heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamine, and the like--that  come across the ports of entry are secreted within compartments in  trucks and cars, and what we need is to have the scanning devices to be  able to locate those places within those vehicles so that we can find  those drugs and hold the people smuggling them accountable. But that  means that at our ports of entry we are going to need the personnel and  the technology in order to do that. So I hope the negotiators on the  conference committee have provided adequate funds for that, in addition  to the physical barrier.   For my constituents in Texas, a secure border is not just a political  talking point, it is a vital part of their lives. Our communities  depend on Customs and Border Protection to stop both dangerous people  and goods from crossing illegally. But they also depend on Customs and  Border Protection to facilitate legitimate trade and travel, which  fuels our economy. About $300 billion of goods were transported both to  and from Texas ports of entry along the border last year alone. So I  hope this agreement includes funding to strengthen our border and to  protect our people.   I want to thank all of our colleagues who have been engaged in these  negotiations for their continued commitment to finding a solution that  everybody can support, and I plan to review the text as soon as  possible.   I happened to come back from El Paso last night with President Trump,  who was reviewing the bare bones of this proposal, and he has not yet  said whether he will sign it, but I want to make a couple of points.   First of all, if this agreement does, as I believe it is reported to  do, provide for 55 miles of additional physical barriers along the  border, then the President has won, and Ms. Pelosi has lost because she  said not one penny more--I am sorry, that was Senator Schumer--for  border walls or border barriers. Ms. Pelosi called them immoral.   But if Democrats on the negotiating committee have now agreed to 55  miles of additional physical barriers, it sounds to me as though they  are not in the same place Ms. Pelosi is. I don't say that to try to  blow up the deal because, frankly, I believe a shutdown would be a  mistake. But what I would encourage the President to do is to count his  victory here and then to build on that. He has additional authorities,  particularly under the Defense authorization bill, on a nonemergency  basis, to reprogram money that has been appropriated already for the  Department of Defense.   There are other areas that Congress has already approved the  President's reprogramming money through previously passed legislation,  so I would encourage the President to bank the win and then to build on  that and to do what is necessary to protect our country and to secure  our border.                          Nomination of William Barr    Madam President, on another matter, this week the Senate will vote on  the nomination of William Barr to serve as Attorney General of the  United States.   It is hard for me to imagine a better qualified person for that job.  It is particularly impressive to me that some 27 years after he last  held the job as Attorney General, he would be willing to step forward  and accept the responsibilities of that job once again. But that is  exactly what he has done.   More than two decades ago, he was nominated and unanimously confirmed  for three incredibly important positions at the Department of Justice,  culminating in the very position he is being considered for right now.   Since he first held the job of Attorney General, times have changed-- something he acknowledged during his hearing. But his steadfast  commitment to the rule of law has not shifted. That is undoubtedly why  Mr. Barr has received the endorsement of former Attorneys General,  Department of Justice alumni, State attorneys general, and several  important law enforcement groups.   He has also received support from some of the toughest critics in  Washington: the editorial boards of some of the newspapers. Following  his hearing, the USA Today editorial board wrote a piece called  ``Confirm William Barr as attorney general,'' and that says it all,  although they went on to say:         There are times for Democrats to confront President Trump       and times not to. The nomination of William Barr to be       attorney general, pending before the Senate Judiciary       Committee, is an example of the latter.    In that piece, the editorial board discussed something that was a  major focus during Mr. Barr's hearing--the Mueller investigation. Our  Democratic colleagues were eager to hear him say that he would allow  the special counsel to continue his investigation without intervention,  which he did repeatedly.   At one point, Mr. Barr said: ``I believe it is in the best interest  of everyone--the President, the Congress, and, most importantly, the  American people--that this matter be resolved by allowing the special  counsel to complete his work.'' I agree with that, and I agree with the  conclusion of USA Today's editorial board that the sooner he is on the  job the better.   We saw, I would note, pieces from the Wall Street Journal, the Los  Angeles Times, and the New York Daily News to the same effect. Even the  Washington Post believes that Democrats should vote for William Barr.  They wrote that he ``came across as a highly qualified person and  committed to the traditions, procedures and mores of the Justice  Department.''   Good for them. The headline of that editorial was ``Confirm William  Barr--and hold him to his pledge of independence.''   I have said before, and I will say it again, that being Attorney  General is probably the most difficult job of the President's Cabinet  because not only are you the chief law enforcement officer for the  country, you are really a political appointee of the President. But I  am satisfied that Mr. Barr can balance those two responsibilities in a  responsible and ethical sort of way. I believe he will bring the same  independent voice to the DOJ that he did more than two decades ago and  will continue his longstanding reputation of being an unwavering  defender of the rule of law.   I hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will judge this  nominee based on his qualifications, not on the person who nominated  him.   It has been common, it seems these days, that anyone or anything that  President Trump is for, our Democratic colleagues reflexively oppose  without thinking about the issue at hand or the qualifications, in this  case, of the nominee.   I hope, rather than a reflexive, partisan rejection of President  Trump's nominee to be Attorney General, that our colleagues will give  him the fair  [[Page S1190]]  consideration that he is due and will provide, as the Constitution  provides, advice and consent on this nomination, and join me in  consenting to this nomination, and confirm William Barr as the next  Attorney General of the United States.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
