 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mrs. Nancy Nelson Lewis, who passed away on June 7 at the age of 91.   Mrs. Lewis used her exceptional gift for the arts to brighten the  lives of individuals throughout the Savannah community. After attending  art  [[Page H5073]]  courses both in New York and at the Savannah College of Art and Design,  she painted countless portraits of Savannahians around town, free of  charge. In lieu of payment, she asked for donations to local charities.   Working hard to grow the art community and develop young artists, she  established a fine arts hall at Savannah Christian Preparatory School.   In 2016, the Savannah College of Art and Design's president inducted  Mrs. Lewis as a Savannah Woman of Vision to celebrate her talents that  helped to shape our Savannah community.   Mr. Speaker, our city truly would not be the same without the life of  Mrs. Lewis. Her family will be in my thoughts and prayers during this  most difficult time.                            ____________________
