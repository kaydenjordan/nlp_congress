 Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House and the  Committee on Homeland Security, and as Chair of the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, and a member  of the Equality Caucus, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3485, the  Global Respect Act of 2021.   I strongly support H.R. 3485 the Global Respect Act, which would  mandate the listing of, and visa restrictions on foreign persons  responsible for or complicit in human rights violations against  lesbian, gay, bisexual,  [[Page H1084]]  transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) persons.   Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) people around  the world continue to face discrimination, violence, and bigotry.   Sixty-eight countries criminalize same-sex sexual relations, which  means that more than one-third of United Nations Member States  criminalize consenting, adult, same-sex sexual relations.   In up to nine countries, same-sex sexual relations may be punishable  by death, and so-called anti-LGBTQ+ ``propaganda'' laws inhibit LGBTQ+  advocacy in at least three countries.   While many countries have made tremendous strides in embracing  equality for LGBTQI+ community members, other countries remain stagnant  or, worse, are undertaking steps to further marginalize or harm LGBTQI+  community members.   That is why I support H.R. 3485, a bi-partisan bill, which requires  the Administration to provide Congress with a list of foreign  individuals found responsible for human rights violations against  LGBTQI+ persons abroad, and equally important, mandates that  individuals included on this list are ineligible for visas to, or entry  into, the United States.   The U.S. Department of State's annual Country Reports on Human Rights  Practices has documented hostility toward LGBTQ+ citizens in every  region of the world.   These violations include murder, rape, torture, death threats,  extortion, imprisonment, and loss of employment and access to health  care, as well as restrictions on freedoms of assembly, press, and  speech.   The Global Respect Act would provide a means to prevent individuals  who violate the human rights of LGBTQ+ people from entry into the  United States.   The Global Respect Act also would require the Executive Branch to  biannually send Congress a list of foreign persons responsible for,  complicit in, or who have incited extrajudicial killing, torture, or  other gross violations of human rights based on actual or perceived  sexual orientation or gender identity.   As I stated, there is teeth in the legislation because it requires  the denial or revocation of visas to individuals placed on the list,  with waivers only for national security or to allow attendance at the  United Nations;   Finally, the legislation requires the annual State Department Report  on Human Rights to include a section on LGBTQ+ international human  rights, as well as an annual report to Congress on the status of the  law's effectiveness; and requires the Assistant Secretary of State for  Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor to designate a staffer responsible  for tracking violence, criminalization, and restrictions on the  enjoyment of fundamental freedoms in foreign countries based on actual  or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation and urge all Members  to join me in voting for H.R. 3485, the Global Respect Act.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in strong support of H.R.  3485, the Global Respect Act of 2021, which mandates a listing of and  visa restrictions on foreign persons responsible for or complicit in  human rights violations against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,  queer, and intersex (LGBTQI) persons.   It is very difficult for these individuals to suffer what they  suffer. This community, of course, faces discrimination, violence, and  bigotry all over the world. Sixty-eight countries criminalize same-sex  sexual relations, which means that more than one-third of the United  Nations' member states criminalize consenting adult and same-sex sexual  relations. It includes nation-states in Africa. In up to nine  countries, same-sex sexual relations may be punishable by death, and  so-called anti-LGBTQ-plus propaganda laws inhibit LGBTQ-plus advocacy  in at least three countries.   Let me thank Mr. Cicilline and the leadership for putting this bill  forward. This is a bipartisan bill with a list of foreign individuals  found responsible for human rights violations against this community.   I am supporting this bill because it has teeth because it requires  denial of and limitations on visas. Let me ask the Senate to pass  Global Respect Act, H.R. 3485.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me acknowledge just a  stunning and very pivotal and important Black history message that our  whip has given. He really is our historian, and I certainly want to pay  tribute and give credence to the great work that he has established  here for us.   Mr. Speaker, it was so powerful to be able to reorder critical race  theory to critical race fact. I just want to reinforce that everyone  knows, and it has been for decades, that critical race theory is an  aspect of graduate teaching, master's, Ph.D.s, and in law schools. The  basis of it is the seeming infusion of racism in society by way of laws  and other actions.   Black history has always been, and the founder of Black history  always wanted it to be, an opportunity for healing and bringing us  together by understanding. I think the whip has laid out a stupendous  story, a better understanding of Charles Drew and a better  understanding of the light bulb.   Why wouldn't boys and girls from all walks of life want to understand  how we are better together than we are separate?   I just want to take a moment to take up a different theme that speaks  to the issue of Black history. I want to talk about the 13th, 14th, and  15th Amendments. As well, I want to make sure that we highlight some  aspects of Black history.   Mr. Speaker, let me, first of all, indicate that Black history is an  important element of who we are. I am just going to call off the kinds  of names that I hope will be welcomed in any classroom: President  Barack Obama, 44th President of the United States, the first African- American President; Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Supreme Court  Justice Thurgood Marshall; U.S. Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce; U.S.  Congresswoman Barbara Jordan; U.S. Congressman Mickey Leland; Dr. Guion  Stewart Bluford; Mae C. Jemison--people that I knew because, living in  Houston, they were astronauts that went out of Johnson Space Center-- Dr. McNair, whose life was lost in the service of this Nation as an  astronaut.   Why wouldn't we want to talk about such beloved personalities who  overcame obstacles to do great things? Activists and intellectual  authors and artists like Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington,  these were individuals in the era of post-slavery and post- Reconstruction, in many instances, who still laid the groundwork for  us.    James Baldwin, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, Toni  Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks, just to name a few of the countless  number of well-known and unsung heroes.   James Baldwin, of course, an author; Toni Morrison, an author; and  Gwendolyn Brooks. Obviously, Toni being maligned because of not being  understood. Harriet Tubman, an unbelievable story with the Underground  Railroad. Rosa Parks, who sat down along with others. Maya Angelou,  poet laureate.   I also want to put into the Record names of historical figures, some  of whom have passed, from my own community: Reverend F.N. Williams,  Sr.; Dr. S.J. Gilbert, Sr.; Reverend Crawford W. Kimble; Reverend E.  Stanley Branch; Reverend William A. Lawson, emeritus; Reverend Johnnie  Jeffery ``J.J.'' Roberson; Mr. John Bland; Ms. Ruby Moseley; Ms.  Dorothy Hubbard; Ms. Doris Hubbard--all of them infused liberty and  liberation into our community--Acres Homes; Third Ward; Fifth Ward;  South Park; Sunnyside; Willie Bell Boone; Ms. Holly Hogrobrooks, one of  the first student protesters at Weingarten's; Mr. Deloyd Parker, who  founded SHAPE, a pivotal agency in our community; Ms. Lenora ``Doll''  Carter; and Mr. Gerald Womack. At 16 years old, Gerald Womack opened  his own real estate company, and he is one of the most generous  humanitarians and businessmen living in our community today.   I only call these names out to align myself with the issue of facts.  Why wouldn't we want to know the facts of each of our communities? Why  wouldn't we want to know those who descended from those who came on  Pilgrims' pride? Why wouldn't we want to  [[Page H1096]]  know those who are the legacies of the indigenous people, Native  Americans, and many different Tribes, many of whom, of course, married  African Americans as slaves or in the post-slave era?   Why wouldn't we want to know that history? I am stunned that we would  not want to do so.   I believe it is important to not only know history that is pleasant  but that we can call off wonderful people in our community who, in  spite of the challenges and tribulations, became great leaders. But I  also want to bring to the attention--because I have such an affection  and love for this book taught to me by not only the whip, who  appreciates this book called the Constitution, but Barbara Jordan  reminded me to always carry it, for ladies, in their purses.   George Washington called the Constitution ``the guide, which I will  never abandon.'' He is absolutely right.   ``The Declaration of Independence was the promise; the Constitution  was the fulfillment.'' A Republican judge, Warren Burger, said that. It  couldn't be more true.                                time  1315    That seems to be taken sideways today because you can wrap the  Constitution in the history of Black America, Mr. Speaker. So I rise  for us to discuss today both the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. As I  cherish the Constitution, I can assure you that I cherish those  amendments.   I think we should remind America that we are the only population--we  don't do it angrily--that were held in bondage for a period of time,  longer than two centuries, 246 years longer than the Nation is old--we  will meet that timeframe probably this July--but for a long time,  longer than the Nation was old.   We know that President Lincoln had many reasons. He frankly thought  he could bring the Union together if he could crush the rebellion in  the South by freeing the slaves. In 1862, President Lincoln came to  believe--and by the way, I and my friends, all of us call ourselves  Lincolnesque. We look to the other party as the party of Lincoln, those  wonderful stories that we learned in school, and we just knew this tall  man called Abe Lincoln.   He was humble, not rich, but rich in spirit and courage. He believed  firmly that emancipating the enslaved people in the South would help  the Union crush the Confederate rebellion in the Civil War and win the  Civil War.   Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation which took effect in 1863  announced that all persons held as slaves within any State shall be  then, thenceforward, and forever free.   Wouldn't that be a good lesson to understand, whether you are in  first grade or whether you are in fourth grade or whether you are in  middle school?   The largesse and the values embedded in the Constitution to create a  more perfect Union, here we are in the 1800s trying to proclaim that  value. That is a value. That is a fact. But as we know, the  Emancipation Proclamation itself did not end slavery in the United  States, as it only applied to the 11 Confederate States then at war  against the Union and only to the portion of those States not already  under Union control.   To make it permanent, it would have to be a constitutional amendment.  So in 1864, the U.S. Senate passed a proposed amendment banning slavery  with the necessary two-thirds majority, but it faltered in the House of  Representatives. So when Congress reconvened in 1864, the emboldened  Republicans put the proposed amendment up for a vote again, and Lincoln  threw himself into the legislative process, inviting individual  Representatives to his office to discuss the amendment and putting it  forward.   Isn't that like sweet music?   The Republicans, the Lincoln Republicans, got going. Lincoln was  committed to the passage of the 13th Amendment, telling his allies to  see what is before you to focus on the most important thing, that this  amendment protects the slaves now born and in the United States but  settles the question for all time for the millions yet to be born.   What an emotional and moving set of words. How emotional for the  world to see how small it was at that time of this new experiment that  left the shores of Europe.   What is this thing called the United States of America?   Can they actually govern? Can they lead?   Can they live? Is democracy real?   It is a democratic republic wrapped up in the history of slaves,  Black history, the history of African Americans.   The allies got busy and got working, and he reportedly told them: I  leave it to you to determine how it shall be done but remember that I  am President of the United States, clothed with immense power, and I  expect you to procure these votes.   That gives a sense of democracy that he didn't go in and drag people  out. He actually told his allies: Let's try to get it done. I have got  the power, but let's try to get votes.   We have seen that happen with some sadness to lack of success, but we  stand on this floor in tribute to a man who wanted to see voting rights  continue and continue and continue.   So on January 31st, 1865, the House of Representatives passed the  proposed amendment with a vote of 119-56, just over the required two- thirds, and the following day Lincoln approved a joint resolution of  Congress submitting it to the States for ratification.   That is a beautiful story. That is a fact. That is Black history.  This is American history. I think that is the point that I want to  make, that Black history is American history. It is no less and no  more.   There should be no doubt in trying to teach American history that has  the wonderful tinge of Black history.   Yesterday, February 8, 2022, honored the 15th Amendment--which I will  speak somewhat about--to the United States Constitution which outlaws  discrimination in voting on the basis of race, color, and previous  conditions of servitude, therefore, advancing suffrage for African  Americans.   This was the last and most difficult and hard-fought of all the  Reconstruction congressional constitutional amendments to confer  citizenship upon the formerly enslaved. The intention of this amendment  was to codify permanently the right to vote for all freed men.  Immediately the impact of this amendment proved transformative as freed  men--women still were not allowed to vote--exercised the right to vote  and in coalition elected several hundred African Americans to office.   How powerful this history is. How factual this history is. How coming  together this history was, that you had, by birthright citizenship, the  right to vote no matter whether or not you were previously enslaved or  the color of your skin or previous condition. That is history.   So why do we talk about history today?   I said it was in the name of our dear, late friend and the many  people who Whip Clyburn spoke to, but we do it because--although the  13th and 14th Amendments, the 14th giving due process rights--1921,  this is a picture that we saw: captured Negroes on the way to the  convention hall during the Tulsa race riot.    The freed slaves actually did everything that America said they shall  do. They built this community on land given to them. They had hotels  and hospitals. They had schools, and they had marching bands. Yet,  unfortunately, it triggered a dislike.   Maybe this should be a continuation of an understanding and grades  that would appreciate the fact that there were those who stood, had  economic development and did all that citizens were expected to do,  integrated into society but happened to be some freed slaves and some  the descendants of enslaved Africans.   The Tulsa race riots were 1921. So the question of race continues. It  started in the origins of slavery and slaves coming to the United  States, but it continued.   But true history, Mr. Speaker, is a recognition that the facts won't  hurt you, that they give you strength and allow you to continue to  grow. But I think that is what I think this little book represents.   Quickly, I want to show a more potent picture, for that is what  happened in America for 246 years.   Again, the anguish and anger are not the approach that we want to  leave with our fellow Americans. It is the appreciation of the  significance of Black history and the significance of a presence of a  people in this country. And  [[Page H1097]]  the fact that this Constitution wanted to get rid of that, that is a  good thing. That is the goodness of America. That story should be told.   So when we talk about the many Members of Congress who have come to  accept the healing powers of a bill that studies slavery and  establishes a commission to deal with its repair and restoration and  results like H.R. 40, 33 years filed in this Congress, what happens is  that we have the facts, we have the approach, and the approach is  healing.   So as I close my remarks, let me say that we are a continuing work in  progress. I am so grateful to the whip for allowing me this moment to  remind us that our special history is this book.   So when we hear a Brian Flores lawsuit about our friends in the NFL  and the numbers that are so awkward--I won't pursue that now.   But what I will say is: Can we work together? Because issues still  exist. Can we teach our children the goodness of the history of a  people? And then, can we take the next step to work with institutions  who have not yet fulfilled the beginning of this book that says we  organize to create a more perfect Union, and the 13th and 14th  Amendment which rids of us of all discrimination?   Mr. Speaker, I hope we can do that for this month, and I hope we can  do that forever.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of this body and the Committee on the  Judiciary, I am pleased to join my colleagues in this Special Order  marking the anniversary of the passage on December 6, 1865 of the 13th  Amendment to the Constitution and celebrating the passage of the 14th  and 15th Amendments, known as the Civil Rights Amendments.   I thank my colleague, Congressman Butterfield, for anchoring this  important Special Order and am remembering our late colleague, John  Lewis, a great and beloved man, who risked and gave his life to make  real the promise of those amendments.   The 13th Amendment, the first of the three great Civil War  Amendments, was passed in 1865 and abolished slavery.   The 14th Amendment conferred citizenship on the newly emancipated  slaves, and the 15th Amendment prohibited abridging the right to vote  on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.   Taken together, these amendments were intended and have the effect of  making former slaves, and their descendants, full and equal members of  the political community known as the United States of America.   By 1861, when the Civil War broke out, more than 4 million people  (nearly all of them of African descent) were enslaved in 15 southern  and border states.   By 1862, President Abraham Lincoln came to believe firmly that  emancipating enslaved people in the South would help the Union crush  the Confederate rebellion and win the Civil War.   Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect in 1863,  announced that all enslaved people held in the states ``then in  rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and  forever free.''   But the Emancipation Proclamation in itself did not end slavery in  the United States, as it only applied to the 11 Confederate states then  at war against the Union, and only to the portion of those states not  already under Union control.   To make emancipation permanent would take a constitutional amendment  abolishing the institution of slavery itself.   In April 1864, the U.S. Senate passed a proposed amendment banning  slavery with the necessary two-thirds majority but it faltered in the  House of Representatives, as more and more Democrats refused to support  it.   When Congress reconvened in December 1864, the emboldened Republicans  put the proposed amendment up for vote again and Lincoln threw himself  in the legislative process, inviting individual representatives to his  office to discuss the amendment and putting pressure on border-state  Unionists (who had previously opposed it) to change their position.   Lincoln was committed to the passage of the 13th Amendment, telling  his allies to ``see what is before you, to focus on the most important  thing; that this Amendment protects the slaves now born and in the  United States, but settles the question for all time for the millions  yet to be born.''   He authorized his allies to entice House members with plum positions  and other inducements, reportedly telling them: ``I leave it to you to  determine how it shall be done; but remember that I am President of the  United States, clothed with immense power, and I expect you to procure  those votes.''   On January 31, 1865, the House of Representatives passed the proposed  amendment with a vote of 119-56, just over the required two-thirds  majority, and the following day, Lincoln approved a joint resolution of  Congress submitting it to the state legislatures for ratification.   Mr. Speaker, the United States is the world's only superpower and  boasts the largest economy in the history of the world and for many  years was the world's indispensable nation and the example that all  aspiring democracies wished to emulate.   But at the same time, this nation has also been home to many searing  instances of social unrest resulting from racial injustices, as we  witnessed this year on the streets of big cities and small towns in  urban and rural communities.   We saw Americans, by the millions across the country, coming from all  races and ages, engaging in what the late John Lewis called ``good  trouble'' by protesting and demanding an end to the systemic racial  inequality in our criminal justice system that too often victimizes and  disproportionately treats black Americans worse, ceteris paribus, when  it comes to suspicion, apprehension, arrest, detention, trial,  sentencing, and incarceration.   While the brutal deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna  Taylor in Louisville shocked the conscience of the nation, most black  Americans will tell you what they experienced is not new, but has been  occurring for generations, if not centuries.   What is critically important to understand is that the instances of  brutal and unfair treatment the nation has witnessed this year cannot  be attributed to the proverbial few ``bad apples in the bushel'' but is  instead the foreseeable consequence of systemic racism and racial  inequality in the system.   Not just the criminal justice system, but the health care system, the  economic system, and the educational system to name the most glaring  examples.   To find our way out of this dark time, we need to understand how it  came to be.   That is why in January 2019, I introduced H.R. 40, which establishes  a commission to examine slavery and discrimination in the colonies and  the United States from 1619 to the present and recommend appropriate  remedies.   Among other requirements, the commission shall identify the role of  federal and state governments in supporting the institution of slavery;  forms of discrimination in the public and private sectors against freed  slaves and their descendants; and lingering negative effects of slavery  on living African-Americans and society.   Official slavery ended with the Civil War and ratification of the  Thirteenth Amendment.   But unofficial slavery was continued with the new institution of  sharecrop farming, a criminal justice system that would press convicts  into work once done by slaves, and labor policies that dictated income  for work done based upon skin color.   And, of course, all of this was reinforced by the systematic  disenfranchisement of black Americans, the ``discrete and insular  minority'' excluded from ``those political processes ordinarily to be  relied upon to protect'' them, to quote Chief Justice Hughes' famous  Carolene Products Footnote 4.   For these reasons, the history of the United States is intertwined  with the history of enslaved Africans in the Americas.   There is blood and there are tears, but there is also redemption and  reconciliation.   But to get there, we must have the complete truth and lay our history  bare.   It is the light that sheds the way to the more perfect union all  Americans want.   The Commission created and empowered by H.R. 40 is a necessary first  step in that effort to get to truth and reconciliation about the  Original Sin of American Slavery that is necessary to light the way to  the beloved community we all seek.   Finally, I join all my colleagues in pointing out that the most  fitting and proper means of paying tribute to the beloved John Lewis's  extraordinary life is for the Senate to immediately take up and pass  the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, landmark legislation to  protect the precious right to vote for all persons and to ensure that  our democracy has the tools needed to remain strong.   Mr. Speaker, this February we recognize and celebrate the 40th  commemoration of Black History Month.   This month we celebrate the contributions of African Americans to the  history of our great nation, and pay tribute to trailblazers, pioneers,  heroes, and leaders like the 44th President of the United States,  Barack Obama; Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Supreme Court Justice  Thurgood Marshall; U.S. Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce; U.S. Congresswoman  Barbara Jordan; U.S. Congressman Mickey Leland; Astronauts Dr. Guion  Stewart Bluford, Jr., and Mae C. Jemison; activists, intellectuals,  authors, and artists like Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington,  James Baldwin, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison,  and Gwendolyn Brooks just to name a few of the countless number of  well-  [[Page H1098]]  known and unsung heroes whose contributions have helped our nation  become a more perfect union.   The history of the United States has been marked by the great  contributions of African American activists, leaders, writers, and  artists.   As a member of Congress, I know that I stand on the shoulders of  giants whose struggles and triumphs made it possible for me to stand  here today and continue the fight for equality, justice, and progress  for all, regardless of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation.   The greatest of these giants to me are Mrs. Ivalita ``Ivy'' Jackson,  a vocational nurse, and Mr. Ezra A. Jackson, one of the first African- Americans to succeed in the comic book publishing business.   They were my beloved parents and they taught me the value of  education, hard work, discipline, perseverance, and caring for others.   And I am continually inspired by Dr. Elwyn Lee, my husband and the  first tenured African American law professor at the University of  Houston.   Mr. Speaker, I particularly wish to acknowledge the contributions of  African American veterans in defending from foreign aggressors and who  by their courageous examples helped transform our nation from a  segregated society to a nation committed to the never ending challenge  of perfecting our union.   A few years ago about this time, I was honored to join my colleagues,  the late Congressman John Lewis and former Congressman Charles Rangel,  a Korean War veteran, in paying tribute to surviving members of the  Tuskegee Airmen and the 555th Parachute Infantry, the famed ``Triple  Nickels'' at a moving ceremony sponsored by the U.S. Army commemorating  the 50th Anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.   The success of the Tuskegee Airmen in escorting bombers during World  War II--achieving one of the lowest loss records of all the escort  fighter groups, and being in constant demand for their services by the  allied bomber units--is a record unmatched by any other fighter group.   So impressive and astounding were the feats of the Tuskegee Airmen  that in 1948, it helped persuade President Harry Truman to issue his  famous Executive Order No. 9981, which directed equality of treatment  and opportunity in all of the United States Armed Forces and led to the  end of racial segregation in the U.S. military forces.   It is a source of enormous and enduring pride that my father-in-law,  Phillip Ferguson Lee, was one of the Tuskegee Airmen.   Clearly, what began as an experiment to determine whether ``colored''  soldiers' were capable of operating expensive and complex combat  aircraft ended as an unqualified success based on the experience of the  Tuskegee Airmen, whose record included 261 aircraft destroyed, 148  aircraft damaged, 15,553 combat sorties and 1,578 missions over Italy  and North Africa.   They also destroyed or damaged over 950 units of ground  transportation and escorted more than 200 bombing missions. They proved  that ``the antidote to racism is excellence in performance,'' as  retired Lt. Col. Herbert Carter once remarked.   Mr. Speaker, Black History Month is also a time to remember many  pioneering women like U.S. Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm; activists  Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks; astronaut Mae C. Jemison; mathematicians  like Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson; authors  Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks; all of whom have  each in their own way, whether through courageous activism, cultural or  intellectual contributions, or artistic creativity, forged social and  political change, and forever changed our great Nation for the better.   It is also fitting, Mr. Speaker, that in addition to those national  leaders whose contributions have made our nation better, we honor also  those who have and are making a difference in their local communities.   In my home city of Houston, there are numerous great men and women.  They are great because they have heeded the counsel of Dr. King who  said: ``Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. You only need  a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.''   By that measure, I wish to pay tribute to some of the great men and  women of Houston some of whom who have passed:   Rev. F.N. Williams, Sr.   Rev. Dr. S.J. Gilbert, Sr.   Rev. Crawford W. Kimble   Rev. Eldridge Stanley Branch   Rev. William A. Lawson   Rev. Johnnie Jeffery ``J.J.'' Robeson   Mr. John Bland   Ms. Ruby Moseley   Ms. Dorothy Hubbard   Ms. Doris Hubbard   Ms. Willie Bell Boone   Ms. Holly HogoBrooks   Mr. Deloyd Parker   Ms. Lenora ``Doll'' Carter   Mr. Gerald Womack   As we celebrate Black History Month, let us pay tribute to those who  have come before us, and pay forward to future generations by  addressing what is the number one issue for African American families,  and all American families today: preserving the American promise of  economic opportunity for all.   Our immediate focus must be job creation, and enacting legislation  that will foster and lay the foundation for today's and tomorrow's  generation of groundbreaking activists, leaders, scientists, writers  and artists to continue contributing to the greatness of America.   We must continue to preserve the American Dream for all.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here in celebration of the heroic  and historic acts of African Americans and their indispensable  contributions to this great Nation.   It is through our work in creating possibilities for today and future  generations that we best honor the accomplishments and legacy of our  predecessors.
