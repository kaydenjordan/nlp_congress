 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962, the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and I ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, if this unanimous consent request cannot be  entertained, I urge the Speaker and the majority leader to immediately  schedule the born-alive bill so we can stand up and protect the  sanctity of human life, and I ask others to join in that request.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and my colleague from  Florida for leading this Special Order this evening because I am not  quite sure that we talk enough about China here on the floor of the  House.   If you look at any time horizon, short-term or long-term, China is  the most serious challenge to our Nation's interests. There are other  challenges, to be sure, but let's take a look at what China is about.   Geographically, it is similar in size to the United States.   It is economically enormous, with more than $12 trillion GDP, which  is second only to ours on an annual basis. And on this point, it is  important to remember that they hold $1.1 trillion worth of U.S. debt.   They are militarily mighty. The PLA, People's Liberation Army, is the  largest force on Earth, with more than 2 million personnel.   Gigantically populous, with more than 1.4 billion people, it dwarfs  the size of our own Nation's 325 million people.                                time  1945    Is it possible that those numbers indicate a stronger China than is  actually the case? Perhaps. After all, hundreds of millions of Chinese  citizens who don't live in the nation's most prosperous cities are  still living in poverty and probably will continue to do so for some  time to come.   It is also true that China's military today, while large in number,  does not have the advanced capabilities of our own military. But these  shortcomings are almost certainly temporary, and we should assume that  China will continue to close these gaps relative to our own Nation's  power.   So what should we do? I want to highlight four areas of concern, vis- a-vis China.   First of all, the South China Sea. Perhaps most, importantly, we need  to push back on any Chinese efforts to turn the South China Sea into a  Chinese lake. They have been doing this for decades now.   China is rapidly modernizing its naval capabilities and builds man- made artificial islands near the Spratly archipelago.   Well over $5 trillion worth of commerce passes through the South  China Sea each year.   We must continue to unequivocally assert U.S. rights to fly, sail,  and otherwise operate in these international waters, and we also must  make sure that our allies do, as well.   Taiwan, we must continue to reject China's efforts to bully Taiwan  into accepting a ``one-China'' policy.   Taiwan has been a great friend to the United States for the past 40  years that the Taiwan Relations Act has been in effect, and it is a key  strategic partner.   It is uniquely positioned to buffer China's eastward expansion into  the Pacific.   We need to continue to strengthen our critical relationship with  Taiwan.   Huawei and other Chinese technology companies jeopardize the security  of our Nation's telecommunications network. I strongly support the  Trump administration's efforts to prevent Huawei from participating in  U.S. 5G modernization efforts, and I hope that Secretary of State  Pompeo will be able to convince our Western European allies to do  likewise.   Finally, I will talk about trade. This subject is very much in the  news today.   I am cautiously optimistic that the Trump administration's carrot- and-stick approach to trade negotiations will bear fruit, even if the  tariffs are painful in the short term.   At the very least, I appreciate the fact that we finally have a  President who is willing to confront the Chinese about decades' worth  of bad behavior.   China has been a notorious currency manipulator ever since it began  to modernize its economy in the late seventies. It also shamelessly  rips off our Nation's intellectual property. We simply can't engage in  mutually prosperous trade with China if that nation refuses to play by  the rules.   My last remarks on trade are important because they highlight an  important point that I hope does not get lost in this discussion: Our  Nation can and should aim for a mutually beneficial relationship with  China. In fact, our two nations can continue to grow rich together.   Just because China will be our geopolitical rivals in the coming  years and decades does not mean that they will necessarily become our  enemies. But having said that, we must not be under any illusions about  China's great power ambition, and we must not give an inch when China  challenges our own Nation's prosperity or our interests.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage our Members in this body and I encourage the  administration to continue to do all we can to push back on China's  unfair trade practices and attempt to turn the South China Sea into a  lake controlled by China, thereby manipulating trillions of dollars  worth of trade.
