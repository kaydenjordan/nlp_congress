 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for  yielding to me, and I want to thank him for this leadership on this  very important issue.   I join him in calling for support and passage of the Transportation  Security Officers Act. We rely on Transportation Security officers to  keep us safe. They work hard, including going without pay for more than  5 weeks during the last government shutdown. Yet these TSOs have none  of the rights or the protections we have set for the rest of the  Federal workforce, and that is what this bill would finally correct.   H.R. 1140 offers TSOs the ability to organize themselves and fight  for better pay through collective bargaining and puts them on the  Federal general schedule pay scale, ensuring they see the same regular  step increases as the rest of the Federal workers who keep our  government running.   It would ensure TSOs can appeal personnel decisions to a neutral  third party--something their managers and others within TSA can already  do. It would give these workers the paid family leave and medical leave  that all other Federal workers now have, ensuring they can care for an  ailing parent, be home with a new baby, or deal with a new diagnosis.   H.R. 1140 finally gives TSOs equal footing, recognizing that they are  equally valued members of the Federal workforce--people we rely upon  daily to keep our skies safe.   I am grateful to our chairman, Mr. Thompson, for his work to bring  this bill through committee and for his tireless efforts of workplace  rights and protections for TSOs.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the passage of this bill.
