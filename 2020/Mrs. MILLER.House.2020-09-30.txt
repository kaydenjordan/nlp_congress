 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5901, the Information  Technology Modernization Centers of Excellence Program Act. This bill  will help our government catch up with private-sector innovations by  equipping agencies to take advantage of modern information technology  solutions.   Federal agencies remain challenged by inefficient, costly, and  unwieldy legacy technology systems that do not adequately deliver  citizen services and allow agencies to achieve their legally mandated  missions.   For example, the Government Accountability Office has reported that,  between 2010 and 2017, the Federal Government spent over $450 billion  just maintaining outdated legacy IT systems. That is over 70 percent of  the government's entire IT budget.   There is increasingly less and less Federal IT funding available for  new agency modernization projects. The government needs to take  advantage of the cutting-edge technology solutions already being used  by the private sector.   Recognizing the need for a different approach to transition large  Federal agency technology projects, the Centers of Excellence were  established by the Trump administration at the General Services  Administration to help agencies overcome persistent modernization  challenges.   These challenges include identifying the best new technology  solutions, purchasing that technology, and then integrating that  technology into an agency's unique operations and workflows. The GSA  Centers of Excellence teams serve as change management consultants that  bring private-sector best practices to Federal agency technology  challenges.   By adopting commercially available solutions, in conjunction with  deliberate enterprise-wide transformation planning, agencies can  effectively transition into modern operating environments. By improving  the operational efficiency of our Federal agency programs and mission,  we can save taxpayer dollars.   While modernizing government is good for the taxpayer, the Centers of  Excellence also deliver an additional benefit to Americans by bringing  a central focus to improving agency delivery on constituent services.   H.R. 5901 promises to make the citizens' engagement with our  government programs more intuitive and straightforward, like an  engagement with a modern business.   I am well aware of the challenges faced by veterans, senior citizens,  and businesses when interacting with the Federal Government. I am sure  that my colleagues are as well.   The current pandemic has shown how critical it is for all Americans  to be able to effectively and reliably interact with government  agencies. It is time the Federal Government leveraged modern cloud  computing systems, data-driven analytic capabilities, artificial  intelligence, and modern customer experience tools to offer the highest  level of service possible.   H.R. 5901 will give congressional backing and ensure regular  oversight of the existing GSA program in order to accomplish these  goals.   By giving legal authority to the program, we are also ensuring the  program's stability through the next two Presidential administrations,  which is critical to gaining agency buy-in and having the time to  realize the benefits of this new modernization approach.    The Congressional Budget Office's review of this bill found that it  will have no budgetary impact, which shows that there are still  legislative opportunities to modernize the government without spending  additional taxpayer funds.   I hope the House Oversight and Reform Committee and this Congress can  continue to work together on similar legislative reforms to bring our  government into the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues for their bipartisan work  on this bill. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 5901, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan government reform bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Chai Suthammanont Remembrance Act is well- intentioned legislation.   First, let me send my deepest condolences to Chai's family. He sounds  like such a beloved person. I am sure Chai is greatly missed.   Each and every COVID-19-related tragedy is a stark reminder of the  preciousness of life. America has faced astonishing challenges over the  last 6 months with this global struggle.   As the Nation's largest employer, the Federal Government has offices  and employees across the Nation in every State and territory. There are  unprecedented challenges facing our Federal workforce and the  management of our government's many facilities. Every single State and  territory is working overtime to operate under a disruptive emergency  declaration.   The work of our Federal agencies' diverse workforce is more critical  than ever, and they are working around the  [[Page H5075]]  clock. It is critical that the Federal agencies have stepped up to the  plate to answer the calls for help.   President Trump and his team at the Office of Management and Budget  and the Office of Personnel Management should be commended for issuing  timely directives that gave agencies the necessary guidance and  flexibility to accomplish their missions.   The requirements of this bill may duplicate planned administration  and agency actions. Therefore, the bill could have benefited from  further committee work to avoid potential duplication. However, H.R.  7340 is well intentioned, and I support governmentwide transparency.   I have heard my colleague, Mr. Connolly, speak passionately about Mr.  Chai, about his character and his passion for working with children,  and my thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and  colleagues that knew him so well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further comments on this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 7496, the COVID PREPARE Act of  2020.  [[Page H5076]]    The bill requires every Federal agency to report COVID-19 resurgent  action plans to Congress. These plans will cover agency pandemic  resurgence preparations to assure agency mission continuity.   The bill also requires agencies to outline their communication plans  to necessary stakeholders, including Congress, States, and localities,  and entities in the agency's jurisdiction. Finally, the bill requires  quarterly updates on these plans through the end of the pandemic. This,  of course, presumes a resurgence of the pandemic, which we hope will  not happen.   In discussing this bill, we would be remiss if we did not commend the  work the Federal agencies and their workforce have already done and  continue to do combating COVID-19 across our Nation.   We should recognize the progress we have made as a nation in fighting  this global pandemic. Thanks to this administration's leadership, we  are seeing continual progress in the coronavirus fight.   The President's Cabinet and agency leaders have been constantly  evaluating the pandemic and making decisions in real time, with the  safety of the Federal workforce and the American public as their  primary goal.   As our collective knowledge of COVID-19 evolves, Congress needs to  ensure that the legislation we advance empowers Federal agencies to  make these critical real-time decisions. Congress needs to be careful  about continually laying on new reporting requirements to already- strained Federal agencies.                                time  1300    These agencies are currently responsible to congressional oversight,  and new, broadly defined reporting requirements can have the unintended  consequences of redirecting scarce agency resources during a national  emergency.   H.R. 7496 requires, within 30 days of the legislation's enactment,  that every Federal agency communicates plans to Congress for how they  will handle the unthinkable; this pandemic worsening.   The bill's language is broad, and we didn't have the opportunity to  fully engage in debate on what it means and what metrics we are using.   Legislation like this could have benefited from additional work in  our committee to clarify its intentions.   Fortunately, the agencies already have plans in place, and we hope  the resurgence action plans envisioned by this bill won't be needed.   Thanks to the administration's Operation Warp Speed, the American  people are optimistic that the Food and Drug Administration will  shortly announce a safe and effective vaccine.   In the meantime, we need to work in Congress to assure that Federal  agencies are able to remain fully focused on handling their present  work and challenges so that we can stop this virus.   Our constituents sent us here to work together, put partisanship  aside, and ensure our Nation's government has the resources that it  needs.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on legislation that  helps our government remain effective at fighting this pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further comments on this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
