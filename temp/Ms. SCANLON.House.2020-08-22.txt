 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article, ``Quit Interfering  and Save the Postal Service,'' by the former chair of the Board of  Governors of the Postal Service, David Fineman.                               [Aug. 5, 2020]                Quit Interfering and Save the Postal Service                           (By S. David Fineman)         The U.S. Postal Service is in trouble and needs help just       like the airlines, large and small corporations, and       consumers. There are ways to save it if Congress takes action       very soon.        Where to start with its problems? The USPS is losing       billions because of the pandemic. Its leadership has said       running out of money is a question of when, not if. Its board       of governors temporarily lost its quorum this year and is now       made up only of Trump administration appointees. The       president of the United States called the Postal Service a       ``joke.'' And now state election officials are warning that       reduced mail service could interfere with mail-in ballots in       November.        I served as a governor of the United States Postal Service       from 1995 through 2005. I was nominated by President Bill       Clinton, and served as chairman during the administration of       President George W. Bush. By law, the USPS should have nine       members on its board, five of one party and four of another.       During my tenure, there was never any interference by the       president in the business of the USPS, like there is       currently.        What is happening now is unprecedented, and we wonder why.       Let us hope it is not to disturb the election process and       mail-in ballots.        During my first year on the board, it became clear the       rate-making process, which decides how much one pays to mail       a letter or a package, made no sense. Not until 2004 was       there movement on any legislation in Congress. Eventually the       chairman of the committee overseeing the Postal Service, Dan       Burton (R-Ind.), and the ranking member, Henry Waxman (D-      Calif.), agreed on the outline of a bill. The blll, with a       few changes, passed the House of Representatives, the Senate,       and then was signed into law by Bush in 2006.        One section of that legislation called for the USPS to       prefund its pension obligations for 75 years. I remember       meeting with the then-postmaster general, and after a       thorough briefing, we both concluded the USPS would never       have the necessary funds to and maybe naivety, I believed       congress would amend the law in due time to eliminate that       burden.        So here we are in 2020, in the middle of a pandemic.       Congress and the administration cannot agree on how to fix       the USPS. Everyone in the so-called postal community,       ihcluding its unions, agree the prefunding requirement is not       needed. Let us get legislation to eliminate the prefundlng       requirement passed.        What else can be done? First, let us stop the parochial       mindset of Congress. The USPS has needed to right-size for       some time, and not just close post offices. Because of       population shifts, it can consolidate large processing       plants, so they can process mail from various states and       municipalities.        Last week, Treasury released $10 billion already allocated       to the USPS, with conditions that are at best questionable.       It was required to share with Treasury details of contracts       it negotiated with Amazon and others. Congress should       allocate without any conditions, just like it has bailed out       multinational corporations as a result of the pandemic.        If we believe what we hear from the administration and the       postmaster general they seem to have two solutions: First,       raise the price of packages, although the rate-making process       has confirmed the prices set were fair, and within the       confines of the law. Second, cut the pay of the unionized       workforce, which has already suffered thousands of       coronavirus illnesses and, at last count, at least 60 deaths.        If the price of packages is raised, who pays? The consumer       and small businesses, not just on packages sent by USPS, but       by every private delivery service. That is the reality of how       business works, and to deny it is not dealing with reality.        As USPS raises its prices, you can be assured that the       private delivery services will raise their prices.       Considering the present composition of Congress, the       provisions of the law regarding how union contracts are       negotiated ls not about to change.        With the pandemic, the USPS is needed more than ever       before. Small businesses and the average American rely on       delivery of mail six days a week. They need to get their       checks, their letters, and packages, on time.        The USPS needs help! There is a way to fix it!        The administration must stop holding the USPS hostage to       its own private agenda. Rural America and the inner city       population would suffer more than anyone else. The solutions       are clear. Let us just get it done.     Madam Speaker, ``I'm writing to you today after having  skipped a day of my high blood pressure medication for the first  time.''   ``I have not seen a Postal Service carrier in my neighborhood for a  week or more, not received mail for 10 days. The last couple pieces of  mail were 30 days late.''   ``I am a small business owner. I am in a real bind. I usually ship  packages to customers. Switching to UPS or FedEx would be too  expensive. I would likely lose customers.''   These are just a few of the thousands of messages that my office has  received from constituents who have been caught in the crosshairs of  this administration's war on the U.S. Postal Service.   We are here today to deliver a message to this administration: Don't  mess with the USPS.   This vital public service is essential in our everyday lives. In a  pandemic, it is a lifeline.   These are the real consequences of this administration's ill- conceived efficiency measures, which have disrupted postal service  across the country. Those consequences have made their way to the  doorsteps of seniors, veterans, people with disabilities, and countless  families and businesses, large and small.   As millions of Americans are expected to vote by mail, many for the  first time, we need to give Americans the peace of mind that their mail  will be processed swiftly. That is why I am  [[Page H4265]]  proud to support the Delivering for America Act.
