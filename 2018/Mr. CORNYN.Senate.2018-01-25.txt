 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Madam President, now that the government is up and  running again, we need to look ahead at what our legislative priorities  should be. I can't speak for everybody, but I can speak for myself. My  priorities are threefold.   First, we need to expedite disaster relief. In December, the House  passed an $81 billion disaster relief bill designed to address the  natural disasters caused by Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Harvey, as well  as the wildfires out West. That has been sitting in the Senate since  December. We need to act and act with dispatch.   Everybody remembers Hurricane Harvey--we certainly do in Texas--which  pummeled us last August. It was last August; this is February. Most of  the media attention in the months since has focused on the city of  Houston, which quite literally was torn apart. This was the most  intense rain event in American history--more than 50 inches of rain  fell in 5 days.   Other areas beyond Houston fared worse--I am thinking of cities like  Rockport and Port Author on the Texas coast. I am thinking of cities  like Victoria and Beaumont. More than 28,000 square miles were flooded.  Crops rotted, livestock died, and almost 6 months later people are  still piecing together their lives.   In addition to Hurricane Harvey, as I said, there was Hurricane Irma  and Hurricane Maria, and there were the wildfires that burned across  California that later resulted in mudslides after the rains fell. I  know the Federal Government is not the only entity charged with  ensuring help gets to these places, but it certainly has an important  part to play.   This morning, I attended the U.S. Conference of Mayors and saw a  number of my mayors from Texas who were part of the success or at least  the management of this natural disaster in  [[Page S513]]  Texas. They have done their part. The State has done its part. It is  time for the Federal Government to step up, and it is time for the  Senate to pass this supplemental bill that was passed by the House in  December.   The second priority I have, personally, is lifting the spending caps  that impair our national defense, particularly our men and women in  uniform. In my remarks yesterday, I said this is a problem set in  motion by the Budget Control Act of 2011. While well-intentioned--for a  while it did hold down discretionary spending and reduced our deficits  and our debt--its implementation has not stemmed our national debt, but  it has tied the hands of our military. This is an important lesson. It  is not defense spending, it is not tax cuts, it is not discretionary  spending; it is the mandatory spending in our entitlement programs  which continue to run up deficits and debt and which threaten us and  our financial future, to be sure.   In the meantime, our military faces readiness challenges across the  globe. We simply must listen to people like Defense Secretary Jim  Mattis. We should lift the caps, end sequester so our military no  longer suffers and so our national security is on safer ground.   The third on my immediate to-do list is working with a bipartisan  group of legislators as well as President Trump on the issue of the  DACA recipients. As everybody who has been paying much attention in  recent days knows, this is a group of about 690,000 young adults who  came into the country as children because their parents brought them in  illegally, in noncompliance with our immigration laws.   In the United States, we don't hold children responsible for the  mistakes of their parents, nor should we punish these young adults who  have now grown up because their parents broke our immigration laws. We  know they face an uncertain future, and much of the responsibility for  our porous borders should be borne by Congress--not only the present  Congress, but past Congresses--for basically turning our heads the  other way while people continued to immigrate illegally into the United  States.    We are going to need to improve our infrastructure, personnel, and  technology to make sure we don't experience that sort of rush of  illegal immigration in the future, which is why some of our Democratic  colleagues like to say that we need to protect DACA recipients, which  we are willing to do. But we want to make sure there is not a  repetition of this in 3 years or 5 years hence. So there are important  measures we need to combine with that, and the President has told us  that he is going to insist upon--and he is correct in doing so--a  robust border security component, as well as ending chain migration and  the diversity lottery visas. From the news I saw this morning, it  sounds like the President made some statement about the first piece of  that puzzle last night. We are expecting to hear more from the White  House on how they expect Congress to respond and what the President  would find acceptable here in the next few days.   This bill can't become law without the President's signature. So the  President's views are not irrelevant, but we are the ones who have the  primary responsibility to resolve these complicated issues. Getting 60  votes is not the only thing we are aiming for. Certainly, that is the  hurdle we have in the Senate, but it would be a futile act if the  President wouldn't sign it or if it wouldn't pass the House of  Representatives. So we have our work cut out for us, and I know the  American people will not support it unless it is a serious and well- thought-out proposal. The blowback will be strong, and we will face a  harsh reprisal if we don't take into account the opinions and the views  of our constituents back home, which I intend to do.   Beyond these short-term actions, which we need to move on as soon as  possible, there are other priorities I would like to mention as well.  Infrastructure is something everybody likes to talk about, until you  ask the question: How are we going to pay for it?   Recently, I introduced a bipartisan bill with Senator Warner from  Virginia that would expand an infrastructure financing authority  already in use by many States and local governments across the United  States. This legislation is called the BUILD Act, which would raise the  caps on a specific category of what are known as private activity  bonds, giving additional access to tax-exempt bond authority for the  purpose of constructing highway projects.   I was with a number of Texas mayors earlier this morning, and they  told me they see that as a positive development, something they can use  in their cities. They appreciate that during the tax reform debate we  maintained the tax-exempt status of municipal bonds used for those  kinds of purposes.   In the near future, I intend to introduce a few other legislative  initiatives to help rehabilitate our Nation's infrastructure. I come  from a State that is growing because we are creating so many jobs, and  that is putting a strain on our existing infrastructure. So for the  interest of public safety and the environment, as well as our economy,  we need to repair and build out our infrastructure. I know the White  House has some plans in this area as well, and we look forward to  hearing more about them and working with the administration when it  comes to infrastructure.   Thinking about other areas that we could work on in a bipartisan  fashion, I firmly believe it is important for us to look at success  stories in the States, and then, once these laboratories of democracy  have done things that actually result in positive things, we can then  learn from them and scale them up at the Federal level.   That is one reason I am very interested in taking the lessons we  learned in Texas and other States on prison reform and offering a  better, more enlightened, and sensible path to reentry for people who  made mistakes and ended up in our jails and prisons. Not everybody is  going to take advantage of it. In my visits in Texas prisons, I know  illiteracy is rampant. Some people have drug or alcohol problems that  need to be addressed. Some people just need to learn basic job skills  if we expect for them to succeed once they get out of prison. We have  used various incentives for low-risk offenders in Texas to provide them  opportunities to address each of those concerns, and it has been quite  successful. Not only have fewer people recommitted crimes and ended up  back in prison, but our communities have become safer as a result, and  taxpayers have had to build fewer prisons in the process.   I have been working in the Senate on a bipartisan way with my  colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, and my colleague from  Utah, Senator Lee. I know this issue has gotten some real traction  thanks to President Trump and the roundtable he hosted at the White  House earlier this month.   More than 11 million people go to jail each year in the United  States, and there are currently 2.3 million people under confinement.  This is a matter of great public concern, but to me the No. 1 concern  is public safety. If we can keep the public safer, if we can save  taxpayer dollars, and if we can help people who are willing to accept  the opportunity to turn their lives around and become productive  members of our society, it seems to me that we ought to be doing that.   I look forward to hearing more--perhaps even from the President  during the State of the Union Address on Tuesday night, if he chooses  to mention his interest in that topic, which I know he is interested  in.   Finally, we have to keep filling our judicial vacancies. Last year,  we were able to put two Texans on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals,  but more district judges have come through the pipeline this year. One  of the judges we confirmed earlier this month is David Counts from  Midland, TX. He will be serving in the Western District of Texas. Just  this week, the President announced his intention to nominate another  judge for the Western District of Texas, Alan Albright, as well as Cam  Barker, Jeremy Kernodle, and Michael Truncale for the Eastern District  of Texas.   We are a big State. So we have a lot of judicial vacancies, and  Senator Cruz and I are working hard, together with the White House, to  make recommendations to President Trump for nomination. They go through  a very extensive vetting process. Senator Cruz and I have created  something we call the Federal Judicial Evaluation Committee, which is a  group of our  [[Page S514]]  most experienced practitioners in the State, on a bipartisan basis, to  evaluate the people who apply for these important life-tenured  positions.   I want to compliment the President for his sterling picks for the  judiciary, certainly so far, starting with the Supreme Court of the  United States. But at the intermediate appellate courts, like the Fifth  Circuit and these district courts, these are the people who do the day- in and day-out work of the judiciary to make sure that all Americans  have access to justice and the opportunity for a fair hearing before an  impartial judge. That is one of the most important things the Federal  Government provides through our judicial branch: ``Equal justice under  law,'' as the words above the Supreme Court building say.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Burr), the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Corker), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), the Senator from Kansas  (Mr. Moran), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Risch), and the Senator from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey).
