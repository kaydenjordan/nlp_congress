 Madam Speaker, I rise in support, strong support, for the  people of the Bahamas in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian. Residents  of the Grand Bahama and Abaco Islands are in a desperate situation.   This is a humanitarian crisis, the likes of which has never before  faced the Bahamas. I am grateful for the efforts of the USAID and the  U.S. Coast Guard, which have been instrumental in leading search-and- rescue efforts and providing emergency food assistance to Bahamians.   As the chair of the House Committee on Financial Services and co- chair of the Congressional Caribbean Caucus, I strongly support an  expedited U.S. visa application process or a waiver process for  Bahamians who are seeking to enter the U.S., and I am extremely  supportive of the extension of the Temporary Protected Status  designation for all Bahamians who cannot safely return to the Bahamas.   Displaced Bahamians must be treated with respect, and all  applications for visas must be processed efficiently and in an  emergency manner. The road to recovery for Bahamians will be long and  difficult, but all Bahamians must be treated with respect.   Madam Speaker, the United States is standing with the Bahamas during  this difficult time. We will do all that we can to aid in the recovery  efforts in the coming weeks and months.                            ____________________
