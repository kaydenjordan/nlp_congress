 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of an amendment I authored  to strengthen the broadband provisions of H.R. 2.   We often discuss the dangers of the digital divide, and I am proud of  the investment we are making today to help close that divide. But as  with most issues of economic inequality, its effects run deeper for  communities of color, immigrants, and low-income families.   So it is very important for us to quantify the impact that Federal  broadband investments have had on socially disadvantaged communities,  so that we can assure Federal resources are being invested fairly  throughout the country or if these programs are inadvertently widening  the racial and wealth connectivity gap.   I hope my colleagues will join me in this important effort.
