 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a true American hero and one  of our Nation's most distinguished civil rights lawyers, Attorney Fred  Gray, Sr., as he celebrates his 91st birthday on December 14, 2021.   A native of Alabama's Seventh Congressional District, Attorney Gray  was born in Montgomery, Alabama, and came of age during the height of  the Jim Crow segregation era.   One of Alabama's first Black lawyers, he successfully litigated  groundbreaking civil rights cases, representing the likes of Rosa  Parks, Claudette Colvin, Reverend Martin Luther King, and even our own  John Lewis and those protesters who dared to march across the Edmund  Pettus Bridge. His trailblazing work dared this Nation to live up to  its highest ideals, leading to the desegregation of the University of  Alabama, Auburn University, and Alabama's public schools.   Attorney Gray's long and accomplished career fought back against  injustice wherever it existed. To paraphrase one of his clients, the  Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Attorney Gray was a drum major for  justice, peace, and righteousness.   As we celebrate another year of Attorney Gray's life, it is my hope  that President Biden will strongly consider awarding him our Nation's  highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. There is no  one more deserving. Let's give him his flowers as he lives.                            ____________________
