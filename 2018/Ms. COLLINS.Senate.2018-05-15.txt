 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation I  have introduced with several of my colleagues--Senators Murkowski,  Barrasso, Stabenow, and Cassidy--that would remove a barrier that  prevents patients from getting the most affordable prescription drug  prices at the pharmacy counter.   Mr. President, Americans have the right to know which payment  method--whether it is using insurance or paying with cash out of  pocket--would provide the most savings when they are purchasing  prescription drugs. The two bills we have introduced would establish  some clarity in this incredibly opaque drug pricing system.   Nearly 60 percent of Americans, including roughly 90 percent of  seniors, take at least one prescription drug. In 2016, Americans spent  more than $330 billion, including a staggering $45 billion out of  pocket, on retail prescription drugs. The Federal Government picked up  another $139 billion through Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs.   Prescription drugs amount to nearly 18 percent of all healthcare  expenditures and are the second fastest growing expenditure within  healthcare. Moreover, two-thirds of personal bankruptcies in our  country have been attributed to the cost of medical care, including  prescription drugs. To make informed decisions, at the very least, we  should have the right to know how much our prescription drugs cost.   At a series of hearings held by the Senate HELP Committee, I have  questioned repeatedly one particularly egregious practice that conceals  prices from patients at the pharmacy counter. This practice is the  result of what are known as ``pharmacy gag clauses.'' These are  contract terms  [[Page S2665]]  that prohibit pharmacists from proactively telling consumers if their  prescription would actually cost less if they paid for it themselves  rather than using their insurance plan. In other words, if the consumer  is using insurance, pharmacists can actually be prohibited from  disclosing whether the consumer is paying the lowest possible price. In  fact, the pharmacist is prohibited from sharing this vital information  unless the consumer explicitly asks.   Most consumers would never guess that it would be cheaper for them to  pay out of pocket than to use their insurance plan to purchase the  medicine they need. Insurance is intended to save consumers money in  this situation, but that is not always the case. Gag clauses in  contracts that prohibit pharmacists from telling patients how to obtain  best prices obscure what the true cost of the drug could be and the  fact that it could be lower than what the patient is paying. Several  recent investigations, including by the New York Times and NBC News,  have highlighted this unacceptable practice. For example, a consumer  paid a copay of $43 for a cholesterol drug; however, had that same  consumer paid cash rather than using his insurance, the cost would have  been only $19. Another investigation told the story of a consumer who  used insurance to pay $129 for a drug when the cost would have been  just $18 had he paid out of pocket.   From Maine to California, the stories are endless. And this practice  is not an outlier issue. According to a survey by the National  Community Pharmacists Association, more than 50 percent of community  pharmacists reported that gag clause restrictions prevented them from  telling patients about other less expensive options, such as paying in  cash, at least 10 times in the past month.   Recently, I was at the pharmacy counter at a grocery store in Maine,  and the couple in front of me decided not to take the prescription they  needed because the copay of $111 was more than they could afford. I  could not help but wonder: If they hadn't used their insurance, would  they have been able to purchase that drug at a lower price? It is so  counterintuitive that very few consumers are going to think to ask the  pharmacist that question.   I first learned about these gag clauses from pharmacists in Maine who  were frustrated that they were prohibited from providing their patients  with information on the most cost-effective way for them to purchase  the medication they had been prescribed. Pharmacists are barred from  speaking up, and those who do face penalties for doing so. Pharmacists  are on the frontlines in helping patients manage multiple medications,  and they would also like to help ensure that their patients are getting  the best, most affordable price.   The first bill we have introduced, the Patient Right to Know Drug  Prices Act, which is S. 2554--which I have cosponsored with the four  Senators I mentioned, Senators McCaskill, Barrasso, Stabenow, and  Cassidy--would prohibit pharmacy gag clauses in healthcare plans that  are sold on the exchange and in group plans as well. The second bill,  the Know the Lowest Price Act, which is S. 2553--which I am a lead  cosponsor on with Senator Stabenow--would ban these clauses in Medicare  Part D and Medicare Advantage plans.   Specifically, both bills would prohibit health insurance plans and  any pharmacy benefit managers with whom they contract from restricting  the ability of a pharmacist to provide a plan enrollee with information  about any price difference that may exist between the price of the drug  under the insurance plan and the price of the drug purchased out of  pocket. Our bills would also prohibit penalties from being imposed on  any pharmacist who shares such vital and valuable information.    Some States have already taken action to combat this problem. For  example, the State of Maine enacted a law last year that prohibits  charging an insurance enrollee a copayment or other charge that is  higher than the cost of the drug to the pharmacy provider. The Maine  law also protects pharmacists who disclose information related to out- of-pocket costs from being penalized by insurance companies or PPMs  under gag clauses. These are commonsense solutions.   In announcing his drug pricing plan last week, the President, I am  pleased to say, stated his intent to ban any gag clauses that would  apply to pharmacies. While the administration can take some steps  administratively to curb this practice, the enactment of our two bills  would ensure that this protection for pharmacists and for patients is  required under law.   As consumers continue to face skyrocketing prescription drug prices,  we ought to do all we can to ensure that Americans are getting the best  prices possible. As Congress looks at innovative ways to bring down  prices and to increase transparency throughout the healthcare system,  our bills tackle an overlooked issue that directly affects consumers  and pharmacies across our country.   Our legislation has already received strong endorsements from more  than a dozen organizations, including Patients for Affordable Drugs,  the American Pharmacists Association, the Pharmaceutical Care  Management Association, and other groups, ranging from the Arthritis  Foundation to the AIDS Institute.   I ask unanimous consent that these letters and statements be printed  in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   It is only logical that pharmacists want to be able to provide their  customers with information that will help them afford the medications  they have been prescribed. It is absolutely unacceptable for  pharmacists in this country to be banned, under gag clauses, from  providing that invaluable information to patients, particularly those  who may be struggling with the cost of prescription drugs.   I urge my colleagues to support banning pharmacy gag clauses and the  passage of both S. 2554 and S. 2553.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                       Patients for                                            Affordable Drugs Now,                                                      April 2, 2018.      Hon. Senator Susan Collins,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Senator Claire McCaskill,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Senator Debbie Stabenow,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Senator John Barrasso,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Senator Bill Cassidy,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Senator Ron Wyden,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins, McCaskill, Stabenow, Barrasso,       Cassidy, and Wyden: As an organization that represents       patients hurt by high prescription drug prices, Patients For       Affordable Drugs NOW is acutely aware of the importance of       patient access to information on drug prices. Today we are       writing to endorse The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act       (S. 2554) and The Know the Lowest Price Act (S. 2553).        Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) often write contracts that       prevent local pharmacists from communicating with patients       openly about the prices of drugs. PBMs are a black box in the       drug distribution pipeline, and these contracts extend their       lack of transparency into our community pharmacies.        Patients For Affordable Drugs NOW has heard from patients       all over the country who are cutting pills in half, skipping       doses, and going without food to pay for their drugs. It's       wrong. At the very least these patients deserve to understand       where their costs come from and how to find the best price       for the drugs they need. Your leadership on this issue is       greatly appreciated, and these bills are a step toward giving       patients the information they deserve.        Patients For Affordable Drugs NOW strongly supports S. 2554       and S. 2553 and urges Congress to move quickly in passing       them.            Sincerely,                                                 David Mitchell,                                                            Founder,      Patients For Affordable Drugs NOW.                                   ____                                 American Pharmacists Association,                                                     March 22, 2018.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Claire McCaskill,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins and McCaskill: On behalf of the       American Pharmacists Association (APhA), and our 64,000       members, I am pleased to announce our support for the Patient       Right to Know Drug Prices Act, S. 2554--legislation to       permanently remove a significant barrier imposed on       pharmacists from pharmaceutical benefit managers' (PBMs) use       of ``gag clauses'' in contracts. APhA appreciates your       efforts to increase patients' access to more affordable and       cost-effective medicines by empowering pharmacists to inform       patients that a medication may be less expensive if purchased       at the ``cash price,'' rather than through their insurance       plan. For years pharmacists have  [[Page S2666]]       been frustrated by their inability to help their patients who       they knew were struggling with high co-payments.        APhA, founded in 1852 as the American Pharmaceutical       Association, represents pharmacists, pharmaceutical       scientists, student pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and       others interested in improving medication use and advancing       patient care. APhA members provide care in all practice       settings, including community pharmacies, physicians'       offices, hospitals, long-term care facilities, community       health centers, managed care organizations, hospice settings       and the uniformed services.        America's 300,000 pharmacists are the health care       professionals most often at the front lines of informing       patients about their medication costs or copay amounts and       explaining complicated insurance coverage policies. However,       under many contracts with PBMs, pharmacists cannot inform       patients that a medicine is less expensive if they pay the       cash price and do not run it through their health plans.        Thank you for your efforts in removing this barrier on       pharmacists--the medication expert on the patient's health       care team--to assist patients in receiving the affordable       medications they need. APhA is committed to working       collaboratively with you and other stakeholders to improve       the accessibility and affordability of effective medications.       If you have any questions or require additional information,       please contact Alicia Kerry J. Mica, Senior Lobbyist,       Government Affairs.            Sincerely,                                             Thomas E. Menighan,                                     BSPharm, MBA, ScD (Hon), FAPhA,      Executive Vice President and CEO.                                   ____                         [From PCMA, March 15, 2018]         PCMA Responds to ``Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act''         Washington, DC.--The Pharmaceutical Care Management       Association (PCMA) released the following statement on       legislation, the ``Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act,''       introduced today in the Senate:        ``We support the patient always paying the lowest cost at       the pharmacy counter, whether its the cash price or the       copay. This is standard industry practice in both Medicare       and the commercial sector.        We would oppose contracting that prohibits drugstores from       sharing with patients the cash price they charge for each       drug. These rates are set entirely at the discretion of each       pharmacy and can vary significantly from drugstore to       drugstore.        Fortunately: to the degree this issue was ever rooted in       more than anecdotal information, it has been addressed in the       marketplace.''                                   ____                                                     April 16, 2018.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Barrasso,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Debbie Stabenow,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Claire McCaskill,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Cassidy,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins, McCaskill, Barrasso, Cassidy, and       Stabenow: On behalf of the patient and provider organizations       listed below, all of which are members of the Coalition for       Accessible Treatments, we write in support of the bipartisan       Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act (S. 2554), which would       prohibit health plans offered through the exchanges or by       private employers from using so-called gag clauses that can       be used to prohibit the disclosure of pricing options to       patients.        We are also supportive of legislation you introduced with       Senator Wyden, the Know the Lowest Price Act (S. 2553). The       bill would similarly afford protections for patients enrolled       in Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Prescription Drug       Plans.        As you know, some pharmacists are required to sign ``gag       orders,'' which typically apply to generics and prevent the       patient from making the cheaper choice of paying out-of-      pocket rather than paying a higher co-payment. In fact, in       some cases if a patient were to pay the cash price, they       would pay less for their medication than if they used their       health insurance. However, a pharmacist that has signed a gag       order would be prohibited from informing a patient of this       option.        Research published earlier this month in the Journal of the       American Medical Association found that overpayments affected       23 percent of prescriptions filled out of the nearly 10       million claims that were evaluated. The study also calculated       that these overpayments totaled $135 million in 2013.        Thank you for your leadership. It is critical that patients       are made aware of payment options at the pharmacy counter and       understand whether utilizing insurance or paying out-of-      pocket would provide the most savings to purchase needed       medication. We look forward to working with you on these and       other important access issues affecting patients with chronic       diseases.            Sincerely,          The AIDS Institute, American Academy of Dermatology             Association, American Academy of Neurology, American             Autoimmune Related Diseases Association, American             College of Rheumatology, Arthritis Foundation,             Hematology/Oncology Pharmacy Association, Leukemia &             Lymphoma Society, Lupus and Allied Diseases             Association, Inc., National Psoriasis Foundation,             Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation.                                   ____                                                       CVS Health,                                     Woonsocket, RI, March 15, 2018.   CVS Health Applauds New Legislation to Better Inform Pharmacy Choices     Bipartisan ``Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act'' and ``Know the          Lowest Price Act of 2018'' introduced in the U.S. Senate         Woonsocket, R.I., March 15, 2018--CVS Health (NYSE: CVS)       today released the following statement regarding the       ``Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act,'' introduced by U.S.       Senators Collins, McCaskill, Barrasso, Stabenow and Cassidy       and the ``Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018,'' introduced by       U.S. Senators Stabenow, Collins, Wyden, Cassidy, McCaskill       and Barrasso. These bills prevent companies from instituting       contract provisions, known as ``gag clauses,'' which prohibit       pharmacists from informing patients if the cash price of a       prescription is lower than the cost the patient would pay       using their health insurance.        ``CVS Health applauds the introduction of the ``Patient       Right to Know Drug Prices Act,'' and the ``Know the Lowest       Price Act of 2018,'' which will help ensure all consumers can       make informed decisions about their prescription drug costs       at the pharmacy counter. CVS Health's own pharmacy benefit       manager, CVS Caremark, does not engage in the practice of       preventing pharmacists from informing patients of the cash       price of a prescription drug, known as ``gag clauses.''       Actually, our contracts with all dispensing pharmacies in our       network require that CVS Caremark members always get the       benefit of at least the lower of the pharmacy's cash price       and the plan's copay. If a CVS Caremark plan member's copay       for a drug is greater than the dispensing pharmacy's       contracted rate, it is not our practice to collect that       difference from the pharmacy. We are pleased to see these       bills align the industry to these consumer best practices and       applaud Senators Collins, Stabenow, Wyden, McCaskill,       Barrasso, and Cassidy for their leadership.''                                   ____                   [From CISION PR Newswire, Mar. 16, 2018]     express scripts endorses ``know the lowest price act of 2018'' and                 ``patient right to know drug prices act''                            (By Express Scripts)         St. Louis, March 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/--Express Scripts       (NASDAQ: ESRX) today released this statement in support of S.       2553, the ``Know the Lowest Price Act of 2018,'' introduced       by U.S. Senators Stabenow, Collins, Wyden, Cassidy, McCaskill       and Barrasso, and S. 2554, the ``Patient Right to Know Drug       Prices Act,'' introduced by U.S. Senators Collins, McCaskill,       Barrasso, Stabenow and Cassidy.        Express Scripts is against clawbacks and gag clauses, anti-      patient practices that have been used by other pharmacy       benefit managers.        ``Express Scripts has long supported the goals of S. 2553       and S. 2554, and we have worked with state lawmakers across       the country to prohibit the anti-consumer practice of so-      called ``gag clauses.'' We applaud the Senators for leading       on this important issue. Since we are already in compliance,       we are prepared for an effective date of today.        ``Drug makers want plan sponsors and patients to think that       pharmacy benefit managers gain from this anti-consumer       practice, which is clearly not the case. We encourage swift       consideration of S. 2553 and S. 2554 so lawmakers can focus       on the real issue--high drug prices set by manufacturers.''        As part of its mission to put medicine within reach of       patients, Express Scripts believes its members should pay the       lowest cost possible, and be informed about the out of pocket       cost of their medication in advance of filling a       prescription. We provide members real-time pricing       information, customized to their individual plans, via our       website and mobile app. Moreover, pharmacies in our retail       network are not permitted to charge a member more for their       copay under their benefit than the pharmacy's cash price.        While there is never an instance where a pharmacist or       pharmacy would need to tell an Express Scripts member about a       lower cost by paying cash because the claim would process at       the lower cost, we agree that so-called ``gag clauses'' are       not in patients' best interest. Therefore, they are not part       of our retail network agreements.
