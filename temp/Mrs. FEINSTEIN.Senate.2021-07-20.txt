 Mr. President: I rise today to reintroduce bipartisan  legislation. The ``Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimination Act of 2021'' is  cosponsored by Senators Pat Toomey, Bob Menendez, and Susan Collins and  would end the corn ethanol mandate in the Renewable Fuel Standard.   The mandate requires annual increases in the amount of renewable fuel  that must be blended into the total volume of gasoline refined and  consumed in the United States.   Our bill would amend the Renewable Fuel Standard to remove the volume  requirements for corn ethanol while leaving in place the requirement  that oil companies use low-carbon advanced bio fuels, including  cellulosic biofuel and biodiesel.   The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was initially included in the  Energy Policy Act of 2005 and subsequently amended in 2007. The RFS  sought to reduce our dependence on oil and increase production of  biofuels for transportation. It requires gasoline and diesel producers  to blend increasing volumes of renewable biofuels in their supply.   The law includes separate volume requirements for four categories of  biofuels: 1) unspecified (completely filled by corn ethanol, also  called the ``corn ethanol mandate''); 2) advanced biofuels; 3)  cellulosic biofuel; and 4) biodiesel.   The EPA is authorized to reduce the required volumes if supply does  not match the statutory volume. Every year since 2014, the total  production of all ethanol exceeded the ``blend wall''--the amount of  ethanol that can safely be blended into the fuel supply, which is about  10% of gasoline. A blend beyond 10% ethanol can damage car engines.   Unfortunately, rather than encourage the development of more advanced  biofuels with lower carbon emissions, the RFS has resulted in a market  flooded with ethanol, which has higher carbon emissions than other  advanced biofuels.   This year oil companies will be required to use 33 billion gallons of  renewable fuel, and next year the requirement will increase to 36  billion gallons of renewable fuel.   The original law requires that an increasing portion of this mandate  be met using low-carbon advanced biofuels that are not derived from  corn starch and reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by at least  50 percent.   However, last year, 15 billion gallons of the statutory requirement  was met using corn ethanol.   The corn ethanol mandate is unwise and unworkable for several  reasons.   First, the corn ethanol mandate results in 40% of the U.S. corn crop  being used for fuel and not food, nearly double the rate compared to  before the RFS was passed. Ethanol production requires 38 million acres  of land--an area larger than the state of Illinois--which could be used  to feed 150 million people.   We should prioritize our agriculture and land use toward feeding  people and combating the climate crisis, not perpetuating it,  particularly when severe drought threatens crops throughout the West.   Second, the corn ethanol mandate has increased the price of corn and  products made from corn, such as livestock feed. This has made it more  expensive for families to put food on their table.   Third, corn ethanol production achieves little to no reductions in  greenhouse gas emissions over regular oil and poses other environmental  risks, including deforestation, habitat destruction and diminished  water quality or availability due to cropland expansion.   Finally, as fuel economy standards and increased vehicle  electrification drive down gasoline consumption, the RFS mandate  exceeds the limit at which ethanol can be blended safely into the fuel  supply--roughly 10% of total gasoline consumption.   According to the Environmental Protection Agency's final 2013 rule  establishing renewable fuel standards, the ``EPA does not foresee a  scenario in which the market could consume enough ethanol . . . to meet  the volumes . . . stated in the statute.''   The Congressional Budget Office confirmed this judgment in a June  2014 report, saying that the statutory goal of escalating corn ethanol  volumes would be ``very hard to meet in future years.''   The Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimination Act would make necessary fixes  to the Renewable Fuel Standard, reducing our reliance on corn ethanol.   Our bill would address the blend wall directly, thereby allowing EPA  to continue increasing volumes of lowcarbon advanced biofuels.   It would also maintain important provisions that encourage the  development of low-carbon advanced biofuels, like cellulosic ethanol,  algae-based fuel and biodiesel.   This would increase the market for the innovative, nascent, domestic  industry that this statute was designed to support.   The Federal corn ethanol mandate no longer makes sense when better,  lower-carbon alternatives exist. I urge my colleagues to join us in  passing this important legislation to eliminate the corn ethanol  mandate in the Renewable Fuel Standard.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. Wicker, Mr.          Cramer, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Young, Mr. Marshall, Mr.          Cruz, Ms. Ernst, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Scott of Florida, and Mrs.          Hyde-Smith):   S. 2395. A bill to require an annual feasibility report on  cooperation between the National Guard and Taiwan, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print my bill for  introduction in the Congressional Record. The bill's purpose is to  require an annual feasibility report on cooperation between the  National Guard and Taiwan, and for other purposes.                                  S. 2395         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page S4983]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Taiwan Partnership Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that the United States should--        (1) continue to support the development of capable, ready,       and modern defense forces necessary for Taiwan to maintain a       sufficient self-defense capability by increasing exchanges       between senior defense officials and general officers of the       United States and Taiwan at the strategic, policy, and       functional levels, consistent with the Taiwan Travel Act       (Public Law 115-135; 132 Stat. 341), especially for the       purposes of--        (A) improving the interoperability of the military forces       of the United States and Taiwan;        (B) improving the reserve force of Taiwan; and        (C) expanding cooperation in humanitarian assistance and       disaster relief;        (2) expand and strengthen Taiwan's capability to conduct       security activities, including traditional activities of the       combatant commands, cooperation with the National Guard, and       through multilateral activities; and        (3) using appropriate authorities and consistent with the       Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et       seq.), seek to develop a partnership between the National       Guard and Taiwan as a means of maintaining a sufficient self-      defense capability.       SEC. 3. ANNUAL FEASIBILITY REPORT ON COOPERATION BETWEEN THE                     NATIONAL GUARD AND TAIWAN.         (a) In General.--Not later than February 15, 2022, an       annually thereafter, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to       the congressional defense committees (as defined in section       101 of title 10, United States Code) a report on the       feasibility and advisability of enhanced cooperation between       the National Guard and Taiwan.        (b) Elements.--Each report required by subsection (a) shall       include the following:        (1) A description of the cooperation between the National       Guard and Taiwan during the preceding calendar year,       including mutual visits, exercises, training, and equipment       opportunities.        (2) An evaluation of the feasibility of enhancing       cooperation between the National Guard and Taiwan on a range       of activities, including--        (A) disaster and emergency response;        (B) cyber defense and communications security;        (C) military medical cooperation;        (D) Mandarin-language education and cultural exchange; and        (E) programs for National Guard advisors to assist in       training the reserve components of the military forces of       Taiwan.        (3) Recommendations to enhance such cooperation and improve       interoperability, including through familiarization visits,       cooperative training and exercises, and co-deployments.        (4) Any other matter the Secretary of Defense considers       appropriate.                            ____________________
