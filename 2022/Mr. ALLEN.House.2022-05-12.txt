 Mr. Speaker, this week, the national average cost for a  gallon of gasoline hit an all-time high of $4.37. At this rate,  American families will spend an extra $2,000 on gasoline this year, on  top of already historic inflation.   President Biden has tried to shift the blame on this issue, taking no  responsibility for the crisis that he and his administration have  created. Let's be clear. This is not transitory inflation. This is not  the Putin price hike.   This is what happens when you dismantle American energy  independence--a war on fossil fuel. That is what the President has  done, and that is why energy costs started rising long before the  Russian invasion ever began.   The solution to rising prices is more domestic production. President  Biden would rather cling to his Green New Deal agenda than admit that  his policies have failed. America is home to an abundance of energy  resources. We have the solutions to this crisis right here under our  feet.   What we lack is an administration with political willpower to do what  is right. Until that changes, we will continue to suffer the  consequences of President Biden's anti-energy agenda.                            ____________________
