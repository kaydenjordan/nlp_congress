 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2353, the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.   I recently had the opportunity to visit our new Pathways in  Technology Early College, or P-TECH, program at Skyline High School in  Colorado.   P-TECH is a partnership between the St. Vrain Valley School District,  Front Range Community College, and IBM. It allows students to earn a  high school diploma and an associate's degree in 5 or 6 years through  dual enrollment.   I spoke with a number of students participating in P-TECH and they  shared with me how the program equips them with the skills they need to  get a well-paying, reliable job after graduation. That is exactly the  kind of innovation Congress should be supporting, and I am proud that  the Perkins reauthorization bill does just that.   I urge this bill's final passage in the House, and I call on my  colleagues in the Senate to take up this bipartisan legislation as soon  as possible so more students can enjoy the kinds of opportunities that  the students at the P-TECH High School and St. Vrain Valley School  District do.
