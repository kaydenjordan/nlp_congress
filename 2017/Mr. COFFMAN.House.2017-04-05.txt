 Mr. Speaker, I stand today in support of legislation to  remove the sunset date on the Veterans Choice Program and, in turn,  bring continuity to our Nation's veterans currently receiving their  health care in the community through the Choice Program. Although the  program is not perfect, it did provide our Nation's veterans with an  unprecedented choice in where they seek their health care and assisted  the VA in reducing the appointment wait times backlog.  [[Page H2724]]    While my colleagues and I on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee  work to streamline and reform the VA's in-community care programs, it  is critical that we pass S. 544 to extend the Veterans Choice Program  beyond the August 7 sunset date. This will provide help to veterans  seeking long-term care through the Choice Program and help meet our  Nation's obligations to our veterans who have sacrificed so much in  defense of our freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe for his leadership on this matter.
