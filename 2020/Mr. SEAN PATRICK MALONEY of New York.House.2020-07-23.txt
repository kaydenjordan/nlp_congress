 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of my amendment to H.R. 7608, Division B--Agriculture, Rural  Development Appropriations Act of 2021. My amendment, included in the  bipartisan en bloc, will increase funding for the Crop Protection and  Pest Management program by $1 million. In 2017, the Allium leafminer-- an invasive pest that threatens onion crops--was discovered in Orange  County's black dirt region. Orange County produces half of New York  State's onion crop, generates $25 million in annual sales, and employs  hundreds of residents. So, my office got to work with Dr. Brian Nault  of Cornell. By leveraging a grant from the Crop Protection and Pest  Management program, Dr. Nault has been working to find effective and  sustainable solutions for managing the Allium leafminer. But he needs  more help. My amendment will add $1 million into the program helping to  save Orange County's onion crop. I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.
