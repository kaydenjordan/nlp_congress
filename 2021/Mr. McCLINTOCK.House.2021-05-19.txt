 Madam Speaker, when the Democrats passed Mr. Biden's  $1.9 trillion spending spree in March, a lot of people got a lot of  free money, thousands of dollars in many cases. But the bill is already  coming due for that free money, and as many of us warned, it turns out  that free money is very expensive.   Indeed, it turns out that the very same families most harmed by the  lockdowns will be the most harmed by paying the bill for the lockdown  relief. It comes to about $15,000 for an average family, and the first  installment is reflected in the rising inflation sapping the purchasing  power of working families.   Government cannot put a single dollar into the economy that is not  first taken out of the same economy. When government spends a dollar  for you, it has already decided to take a dollar from you. And it can  only be taken back in three ways: from your current earnings through  higher taxes, from your future earnings through borrowing, and from  your savings and purchasing power through inflation. There is no other  way to pay for every dollar that government spends. Inflation is  the most insidious of these taxes because it silently hollows out  everything that a family labors to achieve.    Anyone who has gone near a gas station or a grocery store in the last  few months can now see where their relief checks came from and how they  are going to be paid back. The Democrats shut down productivity with  their lockdowns, and then they flooded the economy with dollars. More  dollars chasing fewer goods is the classic recipe for inflation. And  this is just the first installment of the bill already coming due for  the left's reckless spending.   The Consumer Price Index increased 4.2 percent in April. It was 2.6  percent in March, and it is 4.2 percent now. Core inflation is already  growing faster than at any time since the end of the Carter  administration.   Now, what does that mean, exactly? Well, it means that if you have  managed to save $100,000 for your retirement, the government has just  taken out $4,200 of it because your savings are now worth that much  less. Your balance hasn't declined, but its purchasing power has lost  $4,200.   Check your grocery bill or your utility bill. How much more are you  spending to put food on the table or heat your home? There are other  bad policies at work as well--green energy, for example--but a big part  of that difference is your inflation tax, paid directly from the  reduced purchasing power of your money. And that is true of everything  you buy.   It doesn't stop there. The Democrats are promising a massive increase  in corporate taxes while assuring the gullible not to worry, that only  the corporations will pay it. But corporations don't pay corporate  taxes; you do. You pay them as a consumer through higher prices. You  pay them as an employee through lower wages. And you pay them as an  investor through lower  [[Page H2546]]  earnings--your 401(k), for example. There is no other way that a  corporate tax can be paid. And the resulting reduction in productivity  will further feed their inflation tax.   The Democrats' sick joke is this: Everything that the government has  handed out to your family is already being taken back from your family  through higher prices, and that pain is only beginning.   What makes the Democrats think that socialism will work any better  here than every other country that has tried it? It consistently  produces shortages, unemployment, inflation, poverty, and malaise  wherever it is imposed. And I am afraid we will continue down this  dismal path until Americans awaken to the simple economic realities  that the Democratic socialists have now unleashed upon our country.   In his inaugural address, Thomas Jefferson surveyed the boundless  bounties of our Nation and asked: ``With all these blessings, what more  is necessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people? Still one  thing more, fellow citizens: a wise and frugal government, which shall  restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free  to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall  not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the  sum of good government.''   Madam Speaker, Americans deserve a wise and frugal government. But it  is not enough to deserve it. We have to demand it at the ballot box.                            ____________________
