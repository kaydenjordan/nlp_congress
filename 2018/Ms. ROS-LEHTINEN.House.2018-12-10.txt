 Mr. Speaker, though I still have a few days left  before the end of my term, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank  the constituents for allowing me to represent them in the U.S. House of  Representatives for so many years.   Whether it has been helping a veteran obtain the VA assistance he or  she needs, or fighting for our Dreamers, or securing funds for  important projects in our community, or passing critical legislation to  help those oppressed by totalitarian regimes, or one of the many, many  other duties that the people of south Florida have entrusted to me, I  have been honored to serve them in this distinguished body for almost  30 years, and I have played a small part in making our slice of  paradise an even better place in which to live.   Every day when I come to this floor, when I walk these hallowed  Halls, or when I look at that magnificent Capitol dome lit up, I pinch  myself to make sure that I am not dreaming.   That is because as a political refugee, I have a unique perspective  on the greatness of our Nation. America opened its arms to my family  and to me as we fled the Communist Castro regime. When we arrived in  Miami, it was in one of the last commercial flights out of Cuba. I was  only 8 years old.   So to think that I have been elected to serve in the U.S. Congress,  that I became the first Hispanic woman to serve in Congress and the  first woman to chair the House Foreign Affairs Committee, it is simply  astounding, not because it is about me but it says a lot about the  greatest democracy that man has ever created: the United States of  America.   We are a country that says: You can be successful no matter where you  started, and that is something that we do not ever take for granted in  my south Florida community where it seems like almost everyone seems to  be from somewhere else. My constituents are also a testament to the  endless possibilities that all of us have as free Americans.   Mr. Speaker, where I was born is not just a place listed on my  passport. It has defined how I view the world through the prism of  democracy, of freedom, of the rule of law, and of human rights. These  are fundamental American principles that have guided my legislative  record.   I have been honored to fight for equal rights for all people by  joining efforts that will put an end to the discrimination and the  violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation or  gender identity.   I have been proud to advocate for the natural allies of our country,  like the democratic Jewish State of Israel, her right to exist, and her  right to defend herself; to secure support for a free trade agreement  with Colombia, one of our biggest trading partners in Latin America;  and to promote U.S. assistance that allows Taiwan to resist Beijing's  increasing coercion. I have also worked to promote religious autonomy  for the people of Tibet who are also victims of Chinese aggression; and  to reestablish democracy and the rule of law in my native homeland of  Cuba, in Nicaragua, in Venezuela, in Syria, and in so many other  countries; and to sanction rogue regimes like that in Iran, in Russia,  in North Korea, and all those who wish to do us harm.   Domestic issues have been priorities for me as well, Mr. Speaker.  Growing up in south Florida, I learned to appreciate the wonderful  natural resources all around us, and I have made it my priority to  protect those treasures so that future generations are also able to  enjoy them.   I have worked to re-nourish our beautiful south Florida beaches, to  restore the seagrass beds and coral reefs, to provide for advanced  wastewater treatment in our beloved Florida Keys, and to reinvigorate  our Miami River. Throughout my tenure I have represented Miami  International Airport and Port Miami, two of the largest economic  engines to our county that serve as the gateway to the Americas and  support thousands of jobs and economic development across our Sunshine  State.  [[Page H9770]]    As the wife of a Vietnam veteran who was wounded in combat and a  stepmother to marine aviators, I have been proud to support our  military and our veterans. During my time in Congress, I authored  legislation awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to the World War II  Women Air Force Service Pilots, WASP, and supported efforts to  reinstate burial rights at Arlington National Cemetery to these women  pioneers.   I supported legislation to protect victims of domestic violence and  some of the most vulnerable people in our society.   Mr. Speaker, each one of these issues is important, not only to me,  but to our community in south Florida, and I will carry them wherever I  go next. I want to thank the hardworking staff and interns with whom I  have had the delight to work throughout my tenure in Congress. Some are  still looking for jobs; please hire them.    I want to thank my loving and supportive family, my parents, Abu  Mandy and Abu Kiki. I know they are watching me from Heaven, and I  thank them for encouraging me to run for office and for their love in  every step of the way.   I thank Dexter Wayne for supporting and joining me on this crazy  adventure and for his unwavering support. The same goes to our adult  children: Rodrigo, Patricia, Douglas, and Katharine. I am so proud of  each and every one of them. I know that they have accomplished so much,  and there is still some more to come.   I hope to have contributed to leaving a better world for our five  grandchildren to enjoy with a sixth one coming before the new Congress  is sworn in. I thank each one of my colleagues from both sides of the  aisle who have worked with me in a bipartisan manner throughout my  three decades in Congress. I will continue to cheer on my pals in the  bipartisan Congressional Women's Softball Game.   Mr. Speaker, it truly has been the highest honor of my professional  life to represent the great people of south Florida. I am excited to  start a new chapter in my life, and for whatever life throws at me, all  I have to say is: Put me in, Coach.   Muchas gracias. I thank my constituents.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an  American patriot and fallen hero, Captain Jahmar Resilard, who was  killed in a midair collision off the Japanese coast just a few days  ago.   A native of Miramar, Florida, Jahmar found a love for flying at a  young age as he pursued opportunities with the local Civil Air Patrol.   After his graduation from college, Jahmar began to consider a higher  calling, and when given the opportunity to serve his country and pursue  his passion for flying, his career as a Marine aviator took off.   Upon securing his commission, Captain Resilard was assigned to the  Marine All-Weather Fighter Attack Squadron 242, where he flew the F/A18  Hornet and worked tirelessly to defend the freedoms that we as  Americans hold dear.   Mr. Speaker, as the stepmother to Marine aviators who flew the F/A18  Hornet in Iraq, I am familiar with the courage and resolve that is  required to dedicate one's life to our country, and Captain Resilard  did just that.   My heart goes out to his family and his friends. To our hero, I say  rest easy in the skies above.   Semper Fi, Captain.                            ____________________
