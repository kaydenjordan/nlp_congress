 Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor a great Montanan  whose service to this country will never be forgotten and whose passing  will be mourned by many across the Treasure State.   Frank Koncilya was born in Roundup, Montana, where he graduated high  school in 1942. After graduation, Frank was drafted into the United  States Army and was quickly shipped off to England in preparation for  the invasion of Normandy.   Frank landed on Utah Beach nearly 2 hours before the main invasion on  D-day and served with distinction on that fateful day. After the Allies  secured northern France, Frank's platoon was deployed to Belgium, where  he was one of only two survivors in a fierce battle.   Frank was awarded five Bronze Star Medals for his heroic service.  After the war, Frank became a teacher and an active member of the  American Legion in Lewistown, Montana.   Frank's service to his country and his commitment to education are a  perfect example of Montana values. It was an honor to represent him in  Congress, and it is a privilege to recognize his legacy in the United  States House of Representatives.                            ____________________
