 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Comer for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record two articles from periodicals.                 [From the Washington Tmes, Aug. 18, 2020]    Democrats Fuel Post Office panic With Lies To Win Upcoming Election                              (By Andy Biggs)         There are two almost immutable laws of operation that form       the basis of America's political left. The first is that       Democrats and leftists foment fear in order to obtain and       maintain political power. The other is that they always       accuse everyone else, conservatives and Republicans, of acts,       words and ideas in which the left is engaged.        If that means that the truth must be adulterated in order       to craft a narrative that gins up panic and hysteria, they       will shade the truth. Lies beget panic, panic calls for a       solution--usually a big spending solution--and the Democrats       try to exploit that panic to get more power.        The Democrats are engaged in a disinformation campaign       regarding the upcoming election and mail-in ballots that is       deceptive and reflective of their goal of winning the       election by hook or crook.        Democrats and their left-wing publicists in the media claim       that President Trump is going to dismantle the United States       Postal Service (USPS). This absurdity typifies both of the       Democratic strategies: It is a lie to engender panic, and the       stealing of the election is their objective, not the       president's.        They claim that Mr. Trump is going to fiscally starve the       behemoth USPS in order to prevent all mailed ballots from       being counted. Of course, neither claim is true.        The president signed a bill that provided an additional $10       billion to the USPS just a few weeks ago. At the time,       Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said, ``While the USPS is       able to fund its operating expenses without additional       borrowing at this time, we are pleased to have reached an       agreement on the material terms and conditions of a loan,       should the need arise.''        And, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also confirmed       on CNN that the White House offered the additional $10       billion in funding to the Postal Service. Refreshing the       left's collective memory about the availability of massive       amounts of funding to the USPS ought to have put this phony       claim to bed.        But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is insisting that the House       of Representatives return to vote on additional funding for       the USPS, which illustrates the Democrats' overarching theme:       Just send money; it will always solve the problem, whatever       the problem is, even if there is no real problem.        The second deception that the Democrats are using to try       and steal the upcoming election is by conflating the long-      established practice of absentee balloting with the election-      fraud-producing scam that the left is selling of universal       mail-in ballots. By consolidating the two, very different       voting procedures, they are trying to scare Americans into       believing that Mr. Trump is going to cheat in the upcoming       election.        This is consistent with Democrats' operating strategy and       the methodology that they will accuse you of what they are       actually trying to accomplish. In this case, the Democrats       are trying to steal the election by sending ballots out to       every name on every voter roll. But they are fighting against       cleaning up the voter rolls.        Your uncle is dead but still on the voter roll? A ballot       comes to his last address in his name. Your cat is somehow on       the roll? Fluffy gets a ballot.        Democrats know that their demands will incentivize and       produce fraudulent ballots by sending out ballots to those       who haven't requested them. They are OK with that because       they think they can win the dead voter and pet cat       demographics.        They accuse Mr. Trump of defunding the USPS--when the left       really wants to defund the police--and their accusation is a       lie. They know that the president supports the long-standing       practice of absentee voting, but claim he is against that.       Another lie.        House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is so concerned that she is       bringing the House back into session to vote on legislation       that means nothing. Oh yeah, it's urgent alright, but only       after the Democratic convention is completed. Oh, and it's       only to give Democrats the opportunity to further the panic-      driven narrative, because the Senate isn't going to hear the       speaker's deceptive bill.        Never forget that the Democrats and left always accuse you       of what they are actually doing and that they will       prevaricate to further that claim. The left will try and       stoke panic in the country, then attempt to spend any amount       of money to quell that panic in order to arrogate power.        The deception surrounding the USPS ``crisis'' is just       another great example of Marxian-Democrat duplicity.                                   ____                       [From the Blaze, Aug. 21, 2020]  Postmaster General Promises Timely Delivery of Election Mail, Says USPS                         Doesn't Need Bailout Money                              (By Aaron Colen)         Postmaster General Louis DeJoy denied accusations that the       United States Postal Service wouldn't be able to handle       increased volumes of election mail in November, and told the       Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee       on Friday that the USPS was ``fully capable'' of getting the       job done, CBS News reported.  [[Page H4286]]         DeJoy has been a target of Democrats who believe the Trump       donor and logistics expert is handicapping the Postal Service       at the president's urging in order to discourage or limit       mail-in voting.        ``As we head into the election season, I want to assure       this committee, and the American public, that the Postal       Service is fully capable of delivering the nation's election       mail securely and on time,'' DeJoy testified.        DeJoy said even mail-in ballots sent one week before       Election Day would be counted, because USPS workers will       ``scour every plant each night leading up to Election Day''       to make sure no ballot is left behind.        Rather than being opposed to mail-in voting, as President       Donald Trump is, DeJoy told the committee ``I think the       American public should be able to vote by mail, and the       Postal Service will support it.''        DeJoy clarified that the potential issue with mail-in       ballots is related to state deadlines that are too close to       Election Day, which is why 46 states were notified of that       issue in a letter late last month. DeJoy said Americans       should vote early, if they can.        The U.S. Postal Service plans to ``send a letter to every       American'' explaining ``what our process is'' for mail-in       voting, DeJoy said Friday.        DeJoy, who has been in his role since June, said he has       never spoken to Trump or White House advisers about making       changes to service.        The USPS has long been in bad financial shape, and DeJoy       was hired as a logistics expert from the private sector to       address issues of cost and efficiency. Some of the changes       that have reportedly been made, such as the limiting of       overtime and the removal of some mail sorting machines and       collection boxes, have led to some delays in mail delivery in       some areas. Those operational changes were suspended by DeJoy       this week to avoid the appearance of tampering with the Nov.       3 election.        Some recent primary elections were disrupted by issues with       mail-in ballots. A New York congressional election was       delayed by six weeks due to a dispute over some ballots that       were not postmarked or that were received after the deadline.       Tens of thousands of votes that were mailed in weren't       counted for various reasons.        Democrats are pushing for billions of dollars in additional       funding for the USPS, partially to help with the election. On       Friday, DeJoy told Congress the USPS did not need a federal       bailout, but did advocate for reimbursement for service       provided during the pandemic even while revenues were down.     Madam Speaker, ``The Postal Service is fully capable of  delivering the Nation's election mail securely and on time.'' That was  the testimony of the Postmaster General.   But they don't trust the Postmaster General.   The post office has taken care of over 400 million pieces of mail  every day.   But they don't trust the Postmaster General.   That is intriguing to me, because they are going to give the  Postmaster General an additional $25 billion. They don't trust him, yet  they are going to give him $25 billion when he already has $15 billion  cash on hand and a $10 billion line of credit. We don't trust this guy,  but we are going to give him $25 billion extra.   But moreover, this is a crisis. We want reforms. We want changes. We  don't trust the current Postmaster General, so what we are going to do  is we are going to proscribe any kind of efforts to make the post  office, Postal Service, work better. We are going to stop that. Not  only are we going to stop that, we are going to give a new cause of  action to trial lawyers against the USPS.   That is what is going on in this bill, and I find that intriguing. It  reminds me of a Eugene Ionesco play, Luigi Pirandello. We are talking  theater of the absurd here. That is what we are talking about.   Democrats call the failures of USPS a crisis, but they are going to  prohibit reforms or changes. Think of the irony of that.   I would suggest that this illustrates the Democrats' overarching  theme: If you just send money, it will always solve the problem,  whatever the problem is, even if there is no real problem.   This is not a money issue. This is not an acute issue. This is a  long-term problem that has been there for multiple administrations.   Now, to come in at the last minute--and here is part of the  absurdity.    Madam Speaker, the richest part of this irony, this  absurdity, is: Here we are today. We are going to vote on this bill  today, and we are going to have the hearing on Monday in the committee.  That is the richest part of an absurdity that is going to cost us $25  billion.
