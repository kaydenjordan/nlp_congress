 Mr. Speaker, we take up this bill at a time when almost  three times as many people are crossing the border as were this time  last year.   Under President Obama, it was a bad day if we had 1,000 contacts at  the border. Now, we are having 3,000 contacts a day.   These bills are being introduced, advertising that people who come  here legally are suckers, and we are going to give preference to people  who didn't come here legally.   I would further like to ask that we delay the vote until the Biden  administration removes the muzzling of the Border Patrol. We do not  really know what is going on at the border, when this most opaque of  administrations tells the Border Patrol that they cannot tell the press  or Congressmen what is going on.   James Madison must be spinning in his grave. He gave the press  freedom, and they refuse to use it.
