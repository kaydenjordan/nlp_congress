 Mr. Speaker, as the chief sponsor of this  legislation, as well as the chief sponsor of the original Adam Walsh  Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, I rise in support of this  legislation and hope that it is swiftly enacted.   The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, enacted in 2006, is  landmark legislation intended to keep our communities, and, most  importantly, our children safe from sex offenders and other dangerous  predators.   This bipartisan bill strengthened the sex offender registry  requirements and enforcement, extended Federal registry requirements to  Indian Tribes, and authorized funding for Federal programs intended to  address and deter child exploitation.                                time  1615    The centerpiece of the Adam Walsh Act is the national Sex Offender  Registration and Notification Act, or SORNA for short. SORNA's goal is  to create a seamless national sex offender registry to assist law  enforcement efforts to detect and track offenders. SORNA provides  minimum standards for State sex offender registries and created the Dru  Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website, which allows law  enforcement officials and the general public to search for sex  offenders nationwide from just one website.   H.R. 1188, the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act of 2017, reauthorizes  two key programs from the original Adam Walsh Act: grants to the States  and other jurisdictions to implement the Adam Walsh Act's sex offender  registry requirements and funding for the U.S. marshals to locate and  apprehend sex offenders who violate registration requirements. These  programs are crucial to efforts to complete and enforce the national  network of sex offender registries, particularly in light of the  already passed deadline for States to come into compliance with SORNA.  [[Page H4399]]    Based on feedback from the States, H.R. 1188 makes targeted changes  to the SORNA sex offender registry requirements. The bill changes the  period of time after which juveniles adjudicated delinquent can  petition to be removed from the sex offender registry for a clean  record from 25 to 15 years, and provides that juveniles do not need to  be included on publicly viewed sex offender registries. Instead, it is  sufficient for juveniles to be included on registries that are only  viewed by law enforcement entities. I believe these provisions strike  an appropriate balance between being tough on juveniles who commit  serious sex crimes and understanding that there can be differences  between adult and juvenile offenders.   The bill also recognizes the unique challenges that tribes face in  implementing SORNA. H.R. 1188 provides technical assistance to tribes  so they can access, and enter information into, the Federal criminal  information databases.   Finally, H.R. 1188 amends the statute of limitations to allow  individuals who were victims of exploitation or trafficking as  juveniles to have 10 years after becoming an adult to file suit for a  civil remedy. It is my hope that, with these commonsense changes, more  States will come into compliance.   With the passage of this legislation, Congress can send a strong  message to all Americans about our continued commitment to keeping our  Nation's children safe. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
