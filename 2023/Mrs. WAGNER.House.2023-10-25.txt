 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 771.   Today, the House has an opportunity to demonstrate moral clarity and  moral courage. These past few weeks have exposed a level of anti- Semitism in this Nation that is frightening.   Whether it is schoolchildren chanting for the genocide of Israelis by  calling for removal ``from the river to the sea'' or radicalized  college students projecting anti-Semitic slogans on the side of school  property, it is clear young Americans are being indoctrinated against  Israel. These actions must be condemned.   Hamas is a terror organization that slaughtered innocent women and  children. Hamas is a terror organization that manipulated Western media  into doing their bidding by spreading lies about attacks Israel did not  commit. Hamas is a terror organization that steals foreign aid, using  it to construct rockets and attack Israel.   These are not my opinions, Mr. Speaker, they are facts. Yet too many  refuse to call Hamas out for what it is: evil incarnate, focused solely  on the destruction of the Jewish people.   Mr. Speaker, the United States Government must be united in support  of Israel and against Hamas and anti-Semitism.   There should be no equivocation from the White House when asked  whether the rise of anti-Semitism is wrong. There should be no  equivocation from a Member of Congress about whether to stand with  Israel or with terrorist groups like Hamas.   Today, this body is speaking loudly to the international community  that Israel must have the resources to defend itself from genocidal  terrorists.   With one voice, let us support H. Res. 771 and stand with Israel. If,  Mr. Speaker, you cannot bring yourself to support this resolution  today, I would encourage any such Member to do the right thing and  resign from this body.
