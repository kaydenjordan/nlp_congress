 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if my  remarks go over the time for the recess at 12:30 that they be allowed  to extend beyond that.    Mr. President, this is going to be a historic day for  the U.S. Senate, as we come to the floor after the recess, after lunch  here, to be voting on the confirmation of Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Jr.,  to be the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force--Gen. C.Q. Brown. I will  be voting for General Brown because he is the right man, at the right  time, for this very important job. Let me explain why.   General Brown has an impressive academic record and a sterling record  of service to our great Nation and, of course, to the U.S. Air Force.  He is a distinguished graduate of the Armed Force Reserve Officer  Training Corps, with a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering  from Texas Tech--the Presiding Officer might like that--as well as a  master's degree in aeronautical science from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical  University.   Currently, General Brown is the commanding officer--the four-star  general--in charge of Pacific Air Forces, all Pacific Air Forces. Of  course, Mr. President, you know that is really important because he is  literally on the frontlines in implementing the national defense  strategy, which has a focus on great power competition, particularly  China, as the pacing threat to our Nation for the next 50 to 100 years.  General Brown is in that battle right now, frontlines, every day, in  his current billing. That is really important.   Prior to being commander of the Pacific Air Forces, he was the deputy  commander of U.S. Central Command for 2 years. He knows all about the  national security challenges that we have from that region of the  world, which are still very significant--particularly violent extremist  organizations, like al-Qaida and ISIS--that continue to threaten the  United States.   From 2015 to 2016, he served as the U.S. Air Force's Central Command  Combined Force Air Component Commander, where he oversaw the strategic  bombing campaigns against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, as well as operations  against insurgent groups in Afghanistan.   With a record like that--pretty remarkable--he understands the  threats we are currently facing. He understands the big challenges we  are seeing over the horizon with regard to China. And he is ready to  lead the Air Force to take on those threats as a member of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff.   The Secretary of the Air Force, Barbara Barrett, said of General  Brown:         He has unmatched strategic vision and operational       expertise. His leadership will be instrumental as the service       continues to focus on the capabilities and talent we need to       implement the National Defense Strategy.    That is the Secretary of the Air Force on Gen. C.Q. Brown.   In my conversations with him, I certainly believe these qualities,  these characteristics, the Secretary of the Air Force describes to  certainly be true. I have had many good conversations with him on  strategy, on strategic basing, including in the Asia-Pacific region,  and I am very confident that, again, he is the right person for the  right job at this moment.   I also want to mention that he will be the first African-American to  serve as a chief in our military's history. I have known General Brown  for some time, but I was actually surprised when I realized this. Colin  Powell was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and did an amazing job, but we  have not had an African-American serve as chief in any other services  in the history of the United States.   I think that is very important right now. In many ways, this is a  historic nomination, particularly, as our country is roiling over the  killing of George Floyd and the protests that are taking place-- peacefully now, which is great--to demand justice for him and his  family, and as we look at some of the challenges we have in our Nation  with regard countering racism across America.   In a very moving video address last week, General Brown recently  talked about what is on his mind in terms of some of these challenges.  He talks about many of the things that are on his mind, many aspects of  his career. It is very powerful. I would recommend that people who care  about these issues take a look at that very powerful speech. He said  that he was thinking about the conversations his wife of 31 years,  Sharene, and his two sons, Sean and Ross, have had on these times  recently but, also, the immense responsibility that comes from his  historic nomination. He was thinking, of course, about how he could  make our country better for others from a national security standpoint  and with regard to other issues.   Think about that. That is a tremendous weight for anyone to carry,  but I firmly believe that General Brown's shoulders are broad and  strong enough to carry this weight.   I am going to be voting enthusiastically yes with regard to the vote  we are going to take at 2:15 this afternoon. I want to encourage all of  my colleagues to vote yes, to have a 100-to-0 vote for this important,  impressive nomination to be the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
