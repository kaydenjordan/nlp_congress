 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   For decades, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018 has had  longstanding and broad bipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress.  It has been used as a means to bolster United States manufacturing and  competitiveness by temporarily reducing or suspending tariffs on  certain imported goods and components.   I cosponsored this bill when it was introduced last November. I  supported it when we considered it on the floor earlier this year in  January.   The MTB returns to the House today for consideration of amendments  made by the Senate on July 26.   As the House takes up this bill again, I intend to support the bill,  as amended. I have always supported and will always support American  manufacturers, and will do everything I can to boost their ability to  compete. And I commend the chairman.   My home State of New Jersey will benefit greatly from the program,  with firms projected to save more than $100 million over the course of  a 3-year period. From chemicals to textiles, our State's industries  will benefit.   The largest industry in New Jersey is chemical manufacturing,  employing directly or indirectly over 100,000 workers. Several of those  firms will receive tariff relief from numerous imported chemicals that  I dare not try to pronounce.   I can't overlook the relief given to little, green peperoncino for  those subs and pizzas we all love. Even in Texas, they have that.   But today's vote raises important questions about what I consider to  be the chaotic approach to trade from this President and some of my  Republican colleagues, their unwillingness to challenge.   Since the passage of the MTB in January, this administration has  imposed tariffs on up to $47 billion of steel and aluminum imports from  around the world and $50 billion on imported goods from China.   The administration is now in the final week of a public comment  process to determine $200 billion of additional imports from China that  it intends to subject to tariffs.  [[Page H7786]]    This administration can and should take strong measures to make China  accountable for cheating our global trade system and ripping off  American companies and workers. On that, we can agree.   But what is confusing right now is the fact that, while the  administration continues to move forward with tariffs that will cover  nearly half of all imported products from China, the MTB will reduce or  remove tariffs on many of the same products. That is a little  confusing. To me, it is.   For the $50 billion in Chinese imports currently subject to Section  301 tariffs, there are up to 150 products that are covered by today's  bill. For the list of proposed goods valued at $200 billion in Chinese  imports that the administration is currently considering subjecting to  additional tariffs, the overlap with today's bill could be as high as  1,000 products.   Now, it is true that the MTB reduces or suspends tariffs on products  imported from any and all countries, not just China. But let me remind  everyone of this: While the administration has been imposing tariffs,  our trading partners have been responding in kind by hitting our  exports with retaliatory tariffs. As we consider suspending some 1,600  tariffs on imports from China and other countries, I haven't heard that  any of those countries is about to reciprocate and do us any similar  favors.   Because the administration is relying so heavily on the use of  tariffs as a trade enforcement tool--remember, a tool, yes, not a  weapon--the majority's push to move MTB, which reduces and suspends  tariffs, with a minimal amount of process, seems like a concerted  effort to contradict the administration's own trade agenda.   So, how does the MTB fit with this administration's trade agenda?  Well, we have been asking that question for many months.   Several months ago, the administration reached out to the Ways and  Means Trade Subcommittee to express concerns with the MTB, especially  as it will apply to import duties on goods from China, including  finished goods. In response, I expressed my strong interest in working  with the administration to address and resolve those concerns.   In May, as the administration turned up the heat on tariffs on China,  I asked the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee to convene a  hearing with administration representatives on these China trade  policies.   My Democratic colleagues and I were also open to marking up the MTB  in committee and considering the legislation under regular order. In no  case did we find willing partners.   Tomorrow, the Ways and Means Committee will hold a markup on my  resolution of inquiry, seeking information about the administration's  tariffs policy, and I expect to revisit the question.   Today, I will support the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of 2018. I  want to commend the chairman. I don't say that blindly. I think he has  asked many good questions when we have had tariff issues and trade  issues before the entire body as well as the subcommittee. I think that  this is good. I think that this is important.   But we are talking about a specific bill here today, and it is in  contradiction to what the administration has proffered.   I have also, on behalf of my fellow Democrats, extended every effort  to work toward bringing coherence to the policies. To my Republican  colleagues, the question I ask you is: What have you done to do that?   As we look to the future, in conclusion, I am committed to working to  improve the MTB process, to pursue a broader global economic strategy  that supports U.S. workers and firms.   Imposing or suspending tariffs is not enough. We need trade policies  that are strong, effective, and coherent.                                time  1630    We must remember what the purpose of the miscellaneous tariff process  is. If we don't produce it in the United States, then we will not place  a tariff on anything. That helps us and our manufacturers, who might  need those products from other countries. I think it is a wise process,  and I commend the chairman for pursuing this and sticking to it.   Madam Speaker, I think that this is important legislation. No one can  deny that. This is not frivolous legislation by any stretch, but it  cannot be in contradiction with the general agenda for trade  universally. This is what I am very concerned about. I have given  specific examples as to what I am talking about.   This is going to help my State; it is going to help a lot of States  throughout the union. I sincerely do commend the chairman for making  sure that we get this done before November.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
