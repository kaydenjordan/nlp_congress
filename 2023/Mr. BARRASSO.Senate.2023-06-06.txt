 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to rise in  opposition to the nomination of David Crane, who has been nominated to  serve as the Under Secretary of Energy for Infrastructure. It is a job  that involves sending taxpayer money to energy companies. Mr. Crane has  no business at all deciding how to spend taxpayer money on energy.   Mr. Crane spent 12 years--a dozen years--as CEO of NRG Energy, a job  from which he was fired. It is not hard to see why he was fired. In his  own words, he explained it. He said:         We were taking the profits from the coal plants and plowing       it into solar development . . . that got to be annoying to       the shareholders and to the board of directors of the       company.    According to the Wall Street Journal, investors were very unhappy  with Mr. Crane's investments in renewable energy. His strategy at the  company led to a 59-percent drop in the company's share price the year  before his departure. Once he was gone, the company's stock reversed  course, with a long and sustained rebound.   Mr. Crane has significantly focused his career on combating climate  change, which he has called the ``moral imperative of our time.'' He  has called for ``name and shame'' activism against companies that do  not share his extreme vision.   He once wrote that his ``green dream''--he said--included being  considered ``the Mother Teresa of clean energy.''   Mr. Crane is welcome to spend his own money however he wishes, but he  should not be permitted to waste hundreds of billions of dollars in  taxpayer money in his effort--and it is a delusional effort--to be the  next Mother Teresa.   America needs proven, reliable, cost-effective energy--affordable,  available, reliable. We must unleash American energy production and  therefore promote energy security for our Nation.   With our grids stressed and blackouts coming this summer, Mr. Crane  has absolutely no interest in reliable energy. Instead, he wants to  spend taxpayer money on sources of energy that make us more dependent  on our adversaries, like China.   David Crane's record is that of a climate zealot. It is not what we  need in this important post at the Department of Energy. We need  someone who is dedicated to promoting affordable American energy,  reliable American energy, available American energy. David Crane is  clearly not that person; nor is he Mother Teresa.   So I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this terrible  nomination.   I yield the floor.
