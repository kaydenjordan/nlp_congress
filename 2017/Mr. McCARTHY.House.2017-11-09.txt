 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour  and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30  p.m. On Tuesday and Wednesday the House will meet at 10 a.m. for  morning hour and noon for legislative business. On Thursday, the House  will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  tomorrow.   In addition, the House will consider the conference report to  accompany H.R. 2810, the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense  Authorization Act. This bipartisan agreement will strengthen our  military, give our men and women in uniform a 2.4 percent pay raise,  and ensure America's fighting forces have the resources they need to  secure peace both at home and abroad.   I want to thank Chairman Thornberry and the entire House Committee on  Armed Services for their hard work on this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, the House should also look forward to voting on the most  significant tax reform in over three decades, H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act, sponsored by Representative Kevin Brady.   America is among the highest taxed nations in the developed world.  Americans pay more in taxes than we spend on housing, clothing, and  food, combined.   Our current Tax Code is almost 2,600 pages long, with an additional  70,000 pages of forms and other regulations. That is just unacceptable.   We want to see economic growth in this country. Instead of ``closed  for business'' signs, we want to see ``now hiring'' signs.   We want to double the standard deduction.   What does that mean?   It means, for every American, the first $12,000 of income for an  individual is tax free; for a couple, that is $24,000 tax free.   We want to simplify the Tax Code so you can file it in minutes-- instead of spending weeks--on a form the size of a postcard.   We want to bring back the trillions of dollars of American wealth  that is forced to sit overseas, have it come back to America and invest  in Americans.   That is what voting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will accomplish.  That is why I look forward to the House passing this critical bill  without delay.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible in the  House. If anything is added to our schedule, I will be sure to inform  all Members.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I would not use that term, ``substantial,'' because, as you know, we  have gone through this process for quite some time. We are all writing  to the same number: $1.5 trillion. But, as you know, any bill, when it  moves through regular order, where it gets introduced in committee and  we have a markup, just as Ways and Means has done all week long--they  will come to the final vote today--whatever amendments pass will be  added.  [[Page H8680]]    You will then see that bill posted. You will then, next week, see the  Rules Committee take it up, and then you will see that bill on the  floor, just as with any other regular order bill in the process.    Mr. Speaker, for the last three decades, we have done  that, and I don't think the American people want to continue to wait.   I know we go through this every week, time and again, and so I can  quote you back the number of hearings. I can quote you back what people  even ran a campaign on and put out to the American public. But what is  most important that I can quote to you is the lack of growth that has  happened, how much people have to pay in taxes, the trillions of  dollars that are sitting overseas.   What I have found time and again, and I know we have talked about  this before, but just by the introduction of our bill, I was sitting in  the Oval Office last week and there was a company there, Broadcom, that  was created in America, but because of our Tax Code, they were forced  to leave America to try to be competitive.                                time  1130    They looked at this bill, and they told me a couple of days before:  If you really believe this bill is going to pass, we will come back.   When they come back, that is $20 billion in revenue each year. They  will spend another $3 billion each year on R&D. Then they will spend $6  billion in manufacturing.   The gentleman and I have had so many discussions about how to bring  manufacturing jobs back. That is why I am so excited about this bill  coming to the floor the next week.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am a little confused that the gentleman is not  enthusiastic about this bill. I have read what some people on the other  side of the aisle have said about this bill. I heard one phrase that  the gentleman recently used about the middle class. I would just  caution my friend in inferring anything negative to the middle class  with this bill because there were some on the other side of the aisle  that made some comments.   Like most things we say, we get fact-checked. The Washington Post, to  a few Senators and my own Senator from California, tried to claim this  was poor for the middle class.   Do you know what happened?   She did not receive one Pinocchio, she did not receive two  Pinocchios, and she did not even receive three Pinocchios. She received  four Pinocchios on that statement. That is the most Pinocchios you can  get.   Mr. Speaker, if I may, I wanted to do the research. I wanted to look.  Is this tax bill good for all of America? Especially because I want the  gentleman to be enthusiastic about it, I looked at Maryland's Fifth  District. Now here are just a few facts:   Currently, in the Fifth Congressional District of Maryland, 47  percent of the filers take the standard deduction. So not only will  they be better off, it will actually double, and they will see the  increase in their pay on day one, January 1.   Another 11 percent have itemized deductions. They will no longer with  our new higher standard deduction, so they will also save more money,  not to mention the time and confusion by not having to itemize. That  means, before we even look at lowering tax rates, 58 percent of my  friend's district is better off on day one.   Now, how about the median family of four?   A median family of four in Maryland's Fifth Congressional District  earns $123,000. For the 20 percent of those families that don't itemize  today, they will receive a tax cut of $5,000. For the 80 percent who  are itemizing today, they will get, on average, $2,200 in a tax cut.   But those are not the only people I am worried about. How about the  single mother who is earning $30,000 in your district?   Well, she will no longer have to pay any tax under this plan. In  fact, she will receive a refund of about $500 to $700.   How about the small business, the entrepreneur, the factory creating  jobs?   The small-business owner making about $400,000 in Maryland's Fifth  Congressional District will see a savings of nearly $19,000.   So what I am confused about is: How can't you be excited about this  bill?   In short, Mr. Speaker, to the people not just in my friend's  district, but all of America, let me state this: under our plan, the  average family of four earning $55,000 a year will not pay any tax.   For so many days and so many years, I have heard from the other side  of the aisle and my friend talking about the middle class. We have a  bill that is on the floor that is going to help the middle class, the  single mother not to pay any tax and getting money back; the median  family there getting $5,000 back; the small business getting 19--I  don't know how much more we have to do to get my friend excited, but  next week he will have the opportunity.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I just caution the gentleman on some of the things that he says  because I do not want him to end up with any Pinocchios. The gentleman  knows my fondness for him. Just today in The Washington Post we had a  joint editorial about our trip down to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,  and to the Keys in Florida.   The one thing I do want to say to the gentleman is I know he  mentioned a few people in the very beginning, NFIB, whether they  support the bill or not, I say: Just stay tuned.   When the gentleman talks about will there be changes in the bill,  this is the process. When you go through committee, do you not want to  have the committee to have input?   So there will be some changes. Substantially? No. But I do want to  also advise my good friend--maybe I could refer the gentleman to clause  5(a) of rule XXI of the House Rules. That will tell my friend how a  bill comes to the floor coming out of the Ways and Means Committee when  it deals with taxes.   Now, I know the gentleman talks about debt. I know the gentleman  brought up teachers, that it is a $250 tax credit. The only concern I  have is that it is only in Washington that they could be opposed to a  bill because they think we are eliminating a $250 tax deduction while  we are giving somebody $12,000 more tax free. There is a lot more there  going around, and I think that is a much bigger gift. If you ask the  American public what they wanted, I will guarantee you which side they  would pick.   Now, the gentleman talks about debt--and I have great respect for my  friend--but just a few weeks ago, the gentleman voted for a budget that  called to raise taxes by $3.9 trillion. That same budget would also  increase the deficit by $6.8 trillion--that is not what the gentleman  said on the floor; that is what he did on the floor--over 10 years. It  assumed a $764 billion deficit in 2027.   Now, we had a budget on our side. A budget lays out the framework for  the future. The Republican budget resulted in a $197 billion surplus in  2027 and a $2.6 trillion deficit over 10 years. So I am concerned about  the budget, and my votes show that. I want to put us on a path where we  balance.   We had this debate just a couple weeks ago, and that debate set up  the mechanism to go to tax. And the one thing I have learned time and  again--and my friend and I have had this discussion--we have got to  protect the entitlements for the future, but we know that is what is  going to break us if we don't do something about it.   We have got to grow the economy. As we have watched the history of  America, every generation has improved on the generation before it. But  75 percent of Americans believe this generation will not.   Why?   Because of the last 10 years. It has been our lowest growth that we  have seen in decades. We have always averaged more than 3 percent GDP,  but we didn't then. We have just gone through two quarters at 3 percent  where we had five hurricanes.   I watched the Atlanta Fed look at this and say that we could be above  4 percent.   Do you know what opportunities we have?   So it just won't be the Maryland Fifth District that is getting that  money back or the small businesses that are hiring more with that  $19,000.   But imagine what that family will do with that $5,000. They will get  to determine that. They will buy more than just a pencil. They will  invest in their kids' future.   So I think that it is an opportunity for all of us to come together,  put people before politics, and let's make sure this bill goes out in a  very strong vote.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The gentleman does know that we have put a task force together. I  happen to serve on that task force. We have met over a half dozen  times.   It is true that when the President made his decision, he made it  based upon whether it was legal or not for an action the executive  branch took. The courts said it was not. So it was, rightfully so,  moved back into this body, which is the legislative body.   He gave us 6 months to get the job done. That i what we are  continuing to work on. I look forward to continuing to work with the  gentleman to get this done. I believe we will be able to.    There is one point I do want to bring up to points the gentleman made  prior. I do know that he is concerned about this.   As the gentleman does know, if we just get 1 percent of growth in the  GDP, that will add over a trillion dollars of extra revenue. The  Atlanta Fed is already saying we are going to get 1\1/2\ trillion  dollars. Who knows how high we can go, but I would never want to put a  ceiling on America. I will always bet on America. I just want to  unshackle the things that hold us back.   You are correct; you talked about how we now have the lowest  unemployment in decades. For the 58th time since the election a year  ago, the stock market broke a record. Business confidence is at an all- time high.   Most of that is happening because America has the anticipation of us  passing a tax bill. That is why I think this is a moment that will be  significant for every Member.   They will look back on their vote for next week as one of the most  important votes they would ever take. What is the future you want to  have for your children; what is the opportunity you want to give them?   Did you put the rhetoric aside; did you look at the bill based on  constitutionality; did you look at the bill based upon your own  constituents?   Take your partisan hat off, and when you look at that at the end of  the day, if it empowers your small businesses, if it gives every  American more money in their own pocket, if the projections are that it  is going to grow the economy, do what is right. Do what is right for  America, and I believe, at the end of the day, history will treat you  well.
