 Mr. Speaker, I rise in overwhelming support of this  bipartisan legislation. The country needs  [[Page H1844]]  it, and American Samoa desperately needs it. American Samoa has unique  economic and geographic challenges.   So far, my constituents are without any coronavirus testing at all,  as NBC recently reported. The Army Corps of Engineers has reported our  LBJ hospital needs over $100 million, at a minimum, for improvements  just to meet compliance standards.   I want to thank the President for his leadership, and I thank my  colleagues for including my request that the Pacific territories and  the Freely Associated States are in the definition of ``State,'' so all  pandemic unemployment assistance programs apply to us.   Our people are strong and their faith is strong. Let's get this  funding to work and provide testing in American Samoa.   Mr. Speaker, may God bless us all.
