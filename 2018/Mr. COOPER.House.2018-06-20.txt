 Mr. Speaker, the opening prayer today was given by Rabbi  Mark Schiftan of Nashville, the senior rabbi of the oldest and largest  Jewish congregation in middle Tennessee. The congregation dates back to  1851, when the Vine Street Temple began worship services in downtown  Nashville, even before the Civil War.   Rabbi Schiftan has led today's temple, Congregation Ohabai Sholom,  for nearly 20 years and is well known and beloved in our community.   His family escaped the Holocaust from Vienna, Austria, fleeing first  to Shanghai, China, and then to San Francisco.   Rabbi Schiftan was educated at San Francisco State University, the  Hebrew Union of Los Angeles, and then was ordained at the Hebrew Union  of Cincinnati.   Under Rabbi Schiftan's leadership, the temple has been the  indispensable religious and cultural institution for all of middle  Tennessee.   I would like to personally thank the rabbi for his strong leadership  in our community, for our personal friendship, and for opening the  House with prayer today.                            ____________________
