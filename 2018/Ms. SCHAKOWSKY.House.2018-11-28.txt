 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague  from Ohio for introducing this legislation and shepherding it through  committee and onto the floor.   The SMART IoT, Internet of Things, Act is a product of bipartisan  cooperation. As I did during subcommittee markup, I want to thank  Chairman Latta and Congressman Welch for their leadership on this  issue, going back to the IoT Working Group in the 114th Congress.   This bill will require the Commerce Department to survey the  varieties of connected devices available and examine the Federal role  in this space. The study conducted under this bill should serve as the  foundation for future legislative efforts as we work to ensure that  Internet-connected devices are deployed to the benefit of the American  consumer.   The SMART IoT Act is being considered under suspension of the rules  after committee consideration under regular order. After a series of  hearings on the Internet of things, Republican and Democratic  staff worked together on a discussion draft of the bill.    Earlier this year, we held a legislative hearing where we heard  testimony from the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Chamber of  Commerce, and Intel. That hearing raised several issues that we should  continue to examine; including privacy, security, and safety. We are  leaving major consumer protection issues unresolved in this area and  other areas.   Earlier this month, in Chicago, we celebrated the 10th anniversary of  the passage of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which  included provisions that I worked on to include and improve the safety  of children's toys. Advocates there discussed how more work needs to be  done to ensure that children's toys are safe.   Someone mentioned how smart toys are becoming more and more  available, and questions were raised: Are these smart toys able now to  track our kids and where they are? So, the technologies have changed  the safety of toys, and we have to be sure that we are looking at that.   Our anger over misuse of consumer data has been bipartisan, but we  have not yet come together on solutions. I am hopeful that we will be  able to change that in the coming months.   As many Members of this body are aware, I have introduced the Secure  and Protect America's Data Act, which I believe is a good starting  point to begin discussion.                                time  1700    I continue to urge my Republican colleagues to bring their ideas to  the table so we can work together to find common ground. American  consumers deserve action.   For now, I am pleased to move forward on legislation where we have  reached consensus like this. I look forward to continuing our  cooperation on this legislation as it moves to full committee in the  weeks ahead.   Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
