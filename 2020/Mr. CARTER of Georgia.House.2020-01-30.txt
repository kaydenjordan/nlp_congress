 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Mr. Timothy Sweezey, who passed away on January 11 at the age of 50.   At the time of his passing, he was serving as the city manager of  Darien, in the First Congressional District of Georgia. In his own  words, that position was the dream job he always wanted. And, as city  manager, Mr. Sweezey did an exceptional job managing the unique  challenges in Darien, including multiple hurricanes, preserving  historical buildings, and new developments in the downtown area.   But nobody reaches their dream job without hard work. Prior to his  time with the City of Darien, he worked as a substitute teacher, led  city recreation departments, and headed a marine institute, all of  which prepared him for his excellent public service in coastal Georgia.   Mr. Sweezey is certainly leaving Darien a better place than he found  it, and his work in the city will be missed.   His family and friends will be in my thoughts and prayers during this  most difficult time.                            ____________________
