 Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here this evening, and  I am delighted to be hosting the Progressive Caucus Special Order hour.  We have a number of Members who are going to join us to discuss the  President's budget proposal, which appears to have been written at  Trump Tower, primarily for the benefit of people spending the weekend  at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), to  kick off our analysis of the Trump budget.                                time  1730     Thank you so much, Congressman Pocan from Wisconsin, a  distinguished leader in the House of Representatives, and the new co- chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, a budget, as we like to say, is not just a bunch of  numbers, but it is an ethical document. It is a reflection of our  values, and it is a plan of action for investment of our energy and our  resources into the future.   The Progressive Caucus has drafted The People's Budget based on the  actual needs of American society. So we have looked out, and we have  seen that the great American infrastructure is ailing; it is crumbling.  The bridges are falling down. The roads and the highways need repair.  The transit systems are under tremendous stress, including the Metro  system here in the Maryland, Washington, Virginia area.   The cybersecurity system is compromised. Our airports, our port  structure, our water systems, like in Flint, Michigan, need desperate  intervention and rescue and help. We propose a $1 trillion plan of  investment in the American infrastructure to create millions of jobs,  putting people to work on restoring the strength and the vitality of  America's basic institutions, the infrastructure that supports a strong  and flourishing economy.   So that is the heart of it. But we are also working to defend the  gains we have made in healthcare, to extend healthcare so that all  Americans are included in our health insurance system so we can squeeze  out the bureaucratic bloat and the money that is wasted on insurance  bureaucracy and red tape.   We are also working for investment in quality child care so working  families are not spending 30 or 40 or 50 percent of their family  budgets on trying to just pay for babysitters and piece together a  system.   America is the wealthiest society on Earth, and this is the  wealthiest moment in our history. We can provide healthcare for  everyone. We can create a childcare system that works for working  families in America. We can reinvest in American infrastructure.   But right now, there is no leadership, and there is no vision. We are  so disappointed that the White House did not come forward with a plan,  a bipartisan plan, to try to reinvest in American infrastructure,  which everybody says he or she supports so we could get behind that,  but we don't see anything.    Proverbs says that where there is no vision the people will perish,  and so we have offered a vision. And instead, they have come with a  plan that lacks all vision, lacks any plan for reinvesting in American  infrastructure, lacks any investment in the vital services that people  need and, on the contrary, works to dismantle healthcare services,  Medicaid, education, community development grants, senior workforce,  jobs training, you name it, the Peace Corps, National Endowment for the  Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities; slashed $6 billion from  NIH in order to undermine scientific research and medical progress on  colon cancer and breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease and asthma and  bipolar disorder.   We have been making progress on all of these things, and, for some  reason,  [[Page H4557]]  the Trump administration says they want to pull the plug on it and  slash $6 billion from NIH and all of the institutions around the  country that NIH supports.   Well, we have invited Congressman Ro Khanna to be with us tonight. He  is a leading expert on the economy and on the manufacturing sector, and  we have asked him to talk about investment in infrastructure and  manufacturing, what we need and what, instead, we have gotten from the  Trump budget.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Khanna for that  excellent discussion.   You would think, with all of the domestic budget of the country being  dismantled and slashed and reduced by the Trump administration that we  would end up saving money, but they don't in any way at all because the  money is just being shifted over to the Pentagon.   So the proposal is to slash $56 billion from things like Meals on  Wheels, NIH research into eating disorders and asthma and Alzheimer's  disease and heart and lung disorders and breast cancer and colon  cancer, and environmental cleanup like the Chesapeake Bay cleanup,  which they want to zero out, and then to shift the money over to the  Pentagon at a time when the Committee on Oversight and Government  Reform received a report and had a hearing on a McKinsey report which  showed that there was $125 billion in immediate savings available at  the Pentagon in waste, fraud, abuse, and contractor overruns.   So, at a moment when the Pentagon is drowning in money that they  don't know what to do with and all of the beltway bandits are buzzing  around in order to get their slice of the pie, President Trump decides  it is a good moment to try to dismantle services for the elderly and to  stop job training for young people, to stop job training in location  for retired citizens, wipe out funding for the Chesapeake Bay cleanup,  and roll back or abolish preschool development grants to the States.   The litany of attacks on the American people is really quite  astounding, and I invite everybody just to go and read the specifics of  this budget, which can be read as nothing more than an assault on the  health and the well-being and the security of the American people.   For example, the Department of Education budget proposes to cut $578  billion in title I, part A to support services for disadvantaged  students. It reduces IDEA funding by $113 million, seriously  jeopardizing special education services for students with disabilities  all across the country.   It eliminates title II, part A, which provides Federal funding for  teacher support and class size reduction. It eliminates or reduces more  than 20 additional programs promoting literacy in our communities. It  cuts Perkins Career and Technical Education funding by 15 percent. That  is just on the education side.   Department of Health and Human Services, it eliminates the Community  Services Block Grant. It eliminates the Low Income Home Energy  Assistance Program. It cuts the National Institute for Occupational  Safety and Health by 40 percent. It reduces funding for Child Care and  Development Block Grant programs by tens of millions of dollars. It  reduces support for Federal job training for adults by 40 percent, job  training for dislocated workers and youth.   It ends the Senior Community Service Employment Program, an excellent  program that has located work, meaningful work, for tens of thousands  of older Americans. It closes Job Corps centers. It eliminates funding  to counter the worst forms of child labor through the Bureau of  International Labor Affairs. It eliminates $11 million in OSHA safety  training grants for high hazard industries.    You have got to read it to believe it, but the amazing thing is,  despite pulling the plug on all of these essential domestic programs  that have been proven to work, it doesn't save us any money because the  money is just thrown at the Pentagon and is being saved to throw up the  wealth ladder in the country, send it up the wealth ladder through tax  cuts to the largest corporations and the wealthiest Americans.   That is the name of the game. Everybody understands it, which is why  this is the good news. At least we are hearing from both sides of the  aisle that the President's budget written in gold  [[Page H4558]]  at Trump tower for the people at Mar-a-Lago is DOA, dead on arrival.  Everybody is saying it, that there is no way that America could absorb  the shock of letting this budget come anywhere near to reality.   But the message that we get from President Trump and his  administration is very simple: Let them eat emoluments. Let them eat  emoluments. Now, of course, we don't get them; he gets them. But the  American people are left empty-handed at the end of this.   We don't get any meaningful investment in the infrastructure of the  country. There is no jobs program that is in here. There is no attempt  to guarantee the solvency and the strength and the resilience of the  Social Security program. We have got that as part of our plan in The  People's Budget for the Progressive Caucus.   It is far from trying to stabilize and strengthen Medicare and  Medicaid, those two great victories of the Great Society. There is an  attempt to undermine and ravage Medicaid and Medicare, again, to send  all of the wealth up the income ladder, all of the wealth to the people  who need it the least in the country, pulling the plug on everybody  else.   Well, our hope is that we are going to be able to organize people to  stop it, but the tragedy here is that there are so many needs in  America that need to be addressed. Working people have seen a major  erosion in their living standards over the last several decades.  Working people have lost pension security.   Working people need to have retirement sources stabilized. We have  got to use Social Security as a way to make sure that everybody can  experience a decent and dignified retirement. Social Security is a  great accomplishment, maybe the greatest antipoverty program ever  created in the history of the Earth. It lifted millions of senior  Americans out of poverty; and despite the opposition of the GOP at the  time, now everybody concedes that Social Security was a brilliant idea  with administrative bureaucratic overhead less than 1 percent, and it  lifts millions of seniors to a state of at least a modicum of dignity  in retirement. And there are millions of children who are on Social  Security because of survivors benefits and disability benefits.   So we need to strengthen the Social Security system. We need to  reinvest in it, and we need to expand it, because it used to be that  there were supposed to be three pillars for people's old age: one was  Social Security, another was a defined pension, and another was  personal savings.   But the pensions from private employment are increasingly gone. They  have been scattered to the winds. And people's personal savings have  been eroded by the dramatic increase of economic inequality in the  country and the erosion of the living standards of working people.   Tens of millions of Americans are relying exclusively on Social  Security now, so we have got to reinvest in Social Security and make  sure it works, and we have got plans for doing that, too.   But the point is that the real problems of the country have been  ignored. There is no vision. There is no program. There is no policy  for reinvesting in America coming from the Mar-a-Lago set, from this  Cabinet of billionaires.   We are not getting any of it. Instead, we get an almost laughable,  comical, cartoon version of rightwing GOP economics, which proposes to  slash everything and to uproot the basic programs that the American  people rely on for a civilized society. We can do better than this.   I see I have been joined by my very distinguished colleague who will  pursue the discussion. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).    I thank Congressman Ellison for his eloquent remarks and  extraordinary service as co-chair of the Progressive Caucus. He has  been replaced this week by Congressman Pocan, who we heard from earlier  this evening, but it was in deference only to the busyness of his  schedule, since he has also become, in addition to the distinguished  Congressman from Minnesota, the vice chairman of the Democratic  National Committee.   Let's begin to wrap this up. Let's review some of the extraordinary  assaults on the health and the well-being of the American people that  are embodied in this atrocious budget.   First, the President says: let's cut children's health insurance by  more than $600 billion.   This would strip countless children of dental care, asthma treatment,  and other medical visits.   It eliminates over $190 billion to the SNAP program, a supplemental  assistance program that is the food assistance program which helps  prevent 42 million working families from going hungry in America.   It calls for billions in cuts to Medicaid. It, unbelievably, in the  middle of an opioid crisis across the country, would reduce access to  drug addiction treatment and drug prevention services with a $1.2  billion cut to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.                                time  1815    At a time when we need to be doubling down on investment in drug  prevention and drug treatment and dealing with the opioid crisis, the  Trump administration simply hides under the bed.   The budget would cut the Department of Labor's job training programs  by an astonishing two-thirds--that is job training for our people at a  time when we are going through dramatic structural shifts in the nature  of the economy with robots and mechanization, and they want to cut by  65 percent the Department of Labor's job training programs.   They want to sell off our national parks and public lands for oil  drilling, gas exploration, and fracking. They want to sell the land of  the American people--the trust that we have had for centuries--that a  great Republican President, Teddy Roosevelt, once insisted on. They  want to sell it off to their friends at Exxon Mobil and the frackers  across the country.   They have spent $10 billion building their stupid wall--a 14th  century answer to a 21st century problem. Maybe they will have a moat  and some alligators to go with it. But didn't I hear somebody say on  the campaign trail that Mexico was going to pay for that wall? I heard  millions of people chanting that at rallies, and the President was  saying: Mexico--you can believe me--Mexico is going to pay for it.   Already they are putting $2 billion in our budget while they are  stripping schoolchildren of their lunches. While they are slashing  scientific and medical research in the country, they want to put $2  billion into a wall that nobody needs at a time when illegal  immigration from the southern border is at a decade's record low. They  want to take $2 billion and put it into that.   They want to cut billions of dollars from afterschool programs, from  teacher training, and from student loans. They want to eliminate  funding for Planned Parenthood, which millions of women and men depend  on not just for family planning but also for basic medical attention,  purely out of animosity toward Planned Parenthood which has not  received one penny for abortion services in many decades. They just  want to dismantle it. They would destroy it if they could, despite the  fact that millions of Americans depend on Planned Parenthood.   They want to cut Social Security--which they promised not to touch-- by $72 billion by restricting enrollment in the disability insurance  program--and on and on. You name your favorite, most important Federal  program, and I guarantee you, unless you are a Big Business beltway  contractor defense bandit, it is going to be cut in this budget. You  can go and check it out.   Now, if a foreign power--a foreign repressive power--like Putin's  Russia or Duterte's Philippines or Orban's Hungary set out to injure  and demoralize the American people, they could not have done better  than the budget which President Trump sent to Capitol Hill this week.  This is a budget that is drafted seemingly by an enemy of the American  people.   It is not the media that is the American people's enemy, as the  President insisted, it is whoever drafted this budget. That is the  enemy of the American people.   Let them eat emoluments, they are telling us with this. Let them eat  emoluments. They have got all the emoluments. They are the ones taking  the money from the foreign governments. But they are saying, Let them  eat emoluments, because the American people have been robbed by this  budget if it were ever to see the light of day.   Mr. Speaker, a great Republican President once spoke of government of  the people, by the people, and for the people. Abraham Lincoln was a  Member of this body. He sat where we have the honor of sitting in this  body, and he talked about government of the people, by the people, and  for the people. This is a budget of the super rich, by the super rich,  for the super rich. It was drafted by a Cabinet of billionaires for the  people who are lounging at Mar-a-Lago today, and they give the finger  to the rest of the country. That is what this budget says.   If my friends on the other side of the aisle are smart--and I know  they are--and they know what is good for them--and I know they do, Mr.  Speaker--they will say immediately this document is DOA and they have  got nothing to do with it and very quickly distance themselves from it.  We need to return to that great vision of a government that is of the  people, by the people, and for the people. That is who we are as a  country.   The government right now is experiencing a hostile takeover by a tiny  elite, and that is what is taking place around the world today. If you  look at Putin's Russia, if you look at Orban's Hungary, if you look at  Duterte in the Philippines, if you look at what they tried to do with  Le Pen in France, there is a new model, my friends, all over the world.  Government is a moneymaking operation for a tiny elite in each society.  They want to go back to something like kings and queens where the  government serves the tiniest portion of the people.   They might get elected spouting populist rhetoric and slogans, but  the minute they get in, Wall Street takes over. We have got a President  who campaigned against Goldman Sachs, and his Cabinet is dominated by  Goldman Sachs. How long are people going to fall for that magic trick?  Not very long if anybody still believes in it out there. I don't think  anybody's faith or confidence in this President as a populist will  survive this budget--what a joke, and what an insult to the great  populists of American history like the populist movement in William  Jennings Bryan, that they would dare to associate themselves with  populism.  [[Page H4561]]    This is a budget that is based on elitism and class warfare, top-down  class warfare: the richest people in this country against everybody  else. That is what this budget represents. That is what it embodies.   So check out the Progressive Caucus' People's Budget. It is a real  reinvestment in the infrastructure of the country: our bridges, our  roads, our highways, our transit systems, our port systems, our  airports, and cybersecurity--where America really needs investment, not  stealing from poor people, not stealing from the working class, and not  ripping off NIH and the Centers for Disease Control in order to put  money in the Pentagon for a bunch of beltway bandits and defense  contractors who have so much money they don't know what to do with it  anymore. That is not what we need. We need a real investment in  America.   This budget is an affront, and it is an insult to the American  people. We should reject it immediately. I call on all of our  colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to repudiate this document in a bipartisan  fashion, and let's get down to work for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
