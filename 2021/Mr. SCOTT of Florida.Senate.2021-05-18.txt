 Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of  National Lupus Awareness Month.   This is an important time to pause to reflect on what more we can do  to solve the cruel mystery of this disease, while providing caring  support to those across our Nation who suffer from its impact. Lupus  affects around 1.5 million Americans and 100,000 Floridians, including  men, women, and children of all ages. It is a chronic autoimmune  disease that is difficult to diagnose, and there is no known cause or  cure.   I want to recognize the hard-working Americans fighting to  understand, educate, and find a cure for this disease, and I want to  thank the Florida Chapter of the Lupus Foundation of America for their  work to raise awareness, support research, and conduct education  programs so every Floridian affected by lupus can have an improved  quality of life.   I also want to thank the volunteers that generously give their time  throughout the year to educate and help patients with lupus, including  two outstanding Floridians: Anne Bright and Denise Brown.   Anne Bright, who suffers from lupus herself, is one of the founding  members of the Florida chapter and has dedicated her life to growing  the organization and providing help to so many Floridians struggling  with lupus. Anne leads the Butterfly Bash committee, which has raised  over half a million dollars over the past decade. As a spirited lupus  advocate, she touches countless lives, providing hope, resources, and  comfort to those affected by lupus.   Denise Brown lost her 18-year-old daughter, Brooke, to lupus in 2017.  Brooke had been diagnosed with lupus at the age of 12, and her  courageous battle with lupus inspired her dreams to become a nurse.  Unfortunately, Brooke never got to pursue those dreams. Denise honors  Brooke's memory every day by dedicating her life to raising awareness  of lupus and its effect on people of all ages, especially children, and  helping those going through the unimaginable stress and hardship of  this disease.   This Lupus Awareness Month, I thank the brave and hard-working  volunteers like Anne and Denise and the wonderful organizations in  Florida and across the Nation working hard to improve the quality for  those struggling with lupus and getting us closer to a cure.                            ____________________
