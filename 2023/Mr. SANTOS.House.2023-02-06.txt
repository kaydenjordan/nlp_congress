 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor a former volunteer  firefighter who was at Ground Zero on 9/11, Michael Weinstock. He was  an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn's special victim's bureau  and a volunteer firefighter and EMT.   On the morning of 9/11, Michael witnessed the black smoke billowing  out of the World Trade Center. Without thought, he voluntarily rode  with first responders to help in any way he could. Michael had been  unloading medical equipment out of an ambulance when the South Tower  crumbled and nearly crushed Michael to death.   Today, Michael suffers from a painful and incurable disease:  neuropathy.   Michael has been a strong advocate for neuropathy to be covered by  the World Trade Center Health Program. Neuropathy is a medical  condition that results in damage to the nerves outside the brain and  spinal cord. Those who suffer from neuropathy experience weakness and  numbness which typically occurs in the hands or feet. This can be  incredibly painful and debilitating, and many are unable to live normal  lives. This is also known as the suicide disease due to limited  effective treatments and the fact that there is no cure.   Studies from the International Journal of Environmental Research and  Public Health have linked neuropathy with the 9/11 dust. The data from  the 2019 study found that nearly 10,000 firefighters and emergency  medical workers were exposed to toxins at the World Trade Center.   The World Trade Center Health Program covered conditions categories  include: acute and traumatic injuries, airway and digestive disorders,  cancers, and mental health conditions, to name a few.   In 2016, the World Trade Center Health Program was petitioned to add  peripheral neuropathy to its list of covered conditions, which it  declined to do. In 2017, an FDNY responder again petitioned the program  to add peripheral neuropathy to its covered conditions list.  Unfortunately, the World Trade Center Health Program declined to update  its list a second time citing insufficient evidence.   Michael's story is one of many that have yet to be told to a wider  audience. This issue goes beyond the political pale of Republican  versus Democrat. As a Member of the 118th Congress, I will use this  opportunity to raise awareness of what the men and women who suffer  from this debilitating disease are going through due to the exposure of  the toxins from the World Trade Center.   Since the World Trade Center Health Program does not cover  neuropathy, people like Michael must pay out of pocket for treatment,  medication, and other medical needs.  [[Page H688]]    Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues that we work together and find a  solution to have conditions such as neuropathy be covered under the  World Trade Center Health Program.   Tomorrow, I will be proud to have Michael as my guest for the State  of the Union Address. I am proud to be his Member, as he is a  constituent of the Third Congressional District.                            ____________________
