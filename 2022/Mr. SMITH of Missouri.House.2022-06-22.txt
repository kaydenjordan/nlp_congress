 Madam Speaker, families everywhere are feeling  the pain of Washington Democrats' radical climate agenda.   President Biden launched the war on American energy when he canceled  the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office. He has also banned  new lease sales for oil and gas, and his regulatory onslaught is  limiting U.S. energy production.   As a result, Americans are paying the price for the far left's costly  energy agenda every time they flip a light switch, buy groceries, or  drive to work.   But that is the goal of Washington Democrats' climate agenda: Drive  up the cost of traditional energy sources to force our Nation's  transition to alternatives that are less reliable, widely unavailable,  and even more expensive.   America cannot afford the left's war on affordable energy. What  America needs right now is the all-of-the-above energy agenda put in  place by President Trump and Republicans in Congress.                            ____________________
