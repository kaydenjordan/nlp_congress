 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York, Chairman    Gregory Meeks, for the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Congresswoman Barbara Lee's  resolution to repeal the outdated 2002 AUMF, which was used to start  the Iraq war, which killed more than 4,500 American soldiers and  approximately 200,000 Iraqi civilians.   As the chair of the Out of Iraq Caucus, I worked with Congresswoman  Lee and our former colleague, Lynn Woolsey, to end the Iraq war and  bring our troops home.   The Iraq war finally ended in December 2011. We cannot allow this  outdated AUMF to be used as a blank check for future wars. It is long  past time for Congress to reassert its constitutional role in  authorizing and providing oversight over United States military action.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.
