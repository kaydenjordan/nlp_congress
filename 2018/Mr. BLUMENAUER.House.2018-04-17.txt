 Mr. Speaker, this week, the House Committee on  Agriculture will be marking up the most important bill that almost no  one pays attention to, rolled out with very little fanfare. And  actually, we can kind of understand why it has been sort of played down  a little bit. The draft farm bill makes it more difficult to get SNAP  benefits, while weakening the meager limits for farm subsidies and  while cutting investments in conservation and innovative programs which  people care deeply about.   The draft bill cuts billions from those SNAP benefits. It creates  burdensome work requirements for caretakers of children over 6 and  people between the ages of 50 and 59. Under this provision, people  would have to find work or attend job training for at least 20 hours  per week. The provisions won't do anything at all to address poverty.  Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that, even for those in  the general population, securing a job within 3 months is virtually  unattainable.   There will be a spirited debate about whether we ought to reduce  nutrition for low-income people, but there are a whole range of other  items that need to have attention.   The commodities programs that channel 94 percent of the subsidies in  the farm bill to people who grow six commodities. This bill will exempt  most corporate farms from payment limits and make it easier for large  agriculture entities to call themselves family farms and get even more  subsidies. It gets rid of payment limits for marketing loan gains and  loan deficiency payments and exempts partnerships, joint ventures,  LLCs, and Subchapter S corporations from means testing, opening the  loopholes wider.   In the area of conservation, which matters deeply to Americans across  the country and makes a big difference to farmers and ranchers in  Oregon, this bill gets rid of the Conservation Stewardship Program, one  of the largest conservation programs in the farm bill. It cuts the  conservation title by $1 billion over 10 years and cuts funding for the  working lands program by nearly $5 billion over 10 years, and it  weakens the Endangered Species Act by allowing pesticides to be  approved without considering the impact on endangered species.   Mr. Speaker, one of the most important areas that needs our attention  deals with local food and regional infrastructure to promote local  sustainable agriculture. It effectively eliminates funding for farmers  markets, value-added producer grants, and cost-sharing programs for  organic certification by failing to reauthorize mandatory funding for  these programs.   Mr. Speaker, I spent the better part of 2\1/2\ years traveling Oregon  after the last farm bill asking people what they wanted. And I will  tell you, people in Oregon--farmers and ranchers, people who eat,  sports people, people who are involved with food production and  nutrition--this is not the approach that people in our community want,  nor, frankly, by all available evidence, the vast majority of farmers  and ranchers.   They want to see reforms. They want to have a crop insurance program  that isn't wasteful support for large commodity producers, but actually  is available for people who grow food, specialty crops for nursery, and  the wine industry. It ought to be helping beginning farmers and  ranchers get a toehold. It ought to deal with the efforts to cut down  food waste, to provide protection for animal welfare.   Mr. Speaker, the draft proposal that has been released is a missed  opportunity, a missed opportunity for the committee. But I am hopeful  that Congress, as this process works out, will step up and do its part  to make it better, to focus on people who eat; people who care about  clean air, clean water; people who want to protect animal welfare;  people who want to have a vibrant, thriving local food scene; and to be  able to provide food security for people who are at risk.   Mr. Speaker, we can do better. I strongly urge my colleagues to take  a hard look at this proposal and think about what a farm bill would  look like for their community. I think they will find this bill falls  far, far short.                            ____________________
