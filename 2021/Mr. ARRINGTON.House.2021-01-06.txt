 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the great  State of Florida (Mrs. Cammack), my friend.   Madam Speaker, as Americans, we believe governments receive their  just powers from the consent of the governed. That sacred transaction  can only happen legitimately in a free and fair election.   Election integrity is the very lifeblood of our unrivaled system of  self-government. The law and the Constitution gave Congress not only  the authority but, I believe, the responsibility to serve as the last  check on the integrity of our Presidential elections. We either  believe, according to statute, that every elector was ``lawfully  certified'' and ``regularly given,'' or we don't.   States certainly have broad delegated powers to administer Federal  elections, but they still must operate within the bounds of the  Constitution.   Despite receiving numerous petitions--to the detriment of the  country, I might add--the Supreme Court failed to answer the most  important question of the 2020 election: Can entities outside of the  State legislatures make election law?   The plain language of Article II of the Constitution answers the  question unequivocally no.   The decisions made today in these Chambers are of the utmost  consequence, and the horrible precedent that will be established if we  don't act will have lasting impact on our beloved Republic.   Madam Speaker, this proceeding is not just about the integrity of  this election. It is about ensuring the integrity of all future  elections.   I take no pleasure or pride in making my objection today, nor do I  wish for any State electors to be disqualified. However, based on the  law, the Constitution, and my conscience, I cannot support certifying  votes from any State that violated the Constitution.   Madam Speaker, this decision is not about loyalty to a President. It  is about my fidelity to the Constitution and the oath that I swore.
