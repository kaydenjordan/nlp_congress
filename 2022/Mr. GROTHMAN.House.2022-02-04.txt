 Madam Speaker, as we go on recess for a couple of days,  I want to call, one more time, attention to Robert Rector's article in  The Heritage Foundation talking about the one group in America that is  genuinely discriminated against: the hardworking middle class with a  nuclear family with a dad.   As Rector points out, changes made in the Build Back Better Act,  particularly a lot more money for low-income housing, will create up to  a $14,000 penalty that nuclear families will face when the husband and  wife get married as opposed to a single family.   This is true, and this does not include other things such as, for  example, Pell grants. I know the Democrat Party wants to give free  college to illegal immigrants, whereas if you are a child with a mom  and dad at home working, Madam Speaker, you have to go deeply in debt.   I strongly want people in this institution to focus on the nuclear  family, a sizeable segment of the population, and stop discriminating  against them. Give them the same things that the more favored classes  get.                            ____________________
