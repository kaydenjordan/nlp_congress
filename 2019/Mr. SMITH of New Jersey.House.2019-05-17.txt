 Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5 puts the Hyde Amendment  and other federal and state laws that bar taxpayer funding for abortion  at serious risk.   H.R. 5 also weakens conscience protections for health care providers  opposed to being coerced into participating in the killing of unborn  babies.   H.R. 5 defines ``sex'' to include ``pregnancy, childbirth, or a  related medical condition.'' The term ``related medical condition''  means ``abortion.'' In the case Doe v. C.A.R.S., the Third Circuit  stated, ``We now hold that the term ``related medical conditions''  includes an abortion.'' Furthermore, the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission (EEOC), which enforces Title VII, interprets abortion to be  covered as a ``related medical condition.''   To further clarify, the bill goes on to state:         (b) Rules.--In a covered title referred to in subsection       (a)--``(l) (with respect to sex) pregnancy, childbirth, or a       related medical condition shall not receive less favorable       treatment than other physical conditions; . . .    In other words, a provider may not withhold a ``treatment option,''  including ending the life of an unborn baby.   In a legal analysis released today, the United States Conference of  Catholic Bishops states:         Existing prohibitions on the use of government funds for       abortion can be undercut in three ways.        First, federal and state governments are themselves       providers of health care. Therefore, they would themselves be       subject to the constraints that the Equality Act places on       all health care providers and, as such, would likely be       required to provide abortions. This conclusion is reinforced       by the bill's expansive definition of ``establishment,''       which is not limited to physical facilities and places.        Second, it would seem anomalous to, on the one hand,       mandate that recipients of federal funds provide abortions,       as the Equality Act can be read to do, but, on the other       hand, prohibit use of such funds for abortions. It can (and       likely will) be argued that these newly-enacted provisions,       which would likely require recipients of federal funding to       perform abortions, would thereby repeal by implication       previously-enacted legislation forbidding the use of those       very same funds for abortion.        Third, even if the bill were not construed to require the       federal government to fund abortions, it could still be       construed to require states that receive federal funding to       do so with their own funds, which would be a departure from       the longstanding principle that the federal government not       require government funding of abortion even on the part of       state governments.        The possibility that the Equality Act may be used to       undercut the Hyde principle against government funding of       abortion has been noted even by those endorsing the bill.

But instead of denying that this problem exists, or       (even better) urging an amendment to avoid it, one supporter       of the bill has suggested that the issue simply ``has to be       navigated super carefully.'' Id. In other words, there is a       problem and the suggested ``fix'' is simply to keep it from       becoming politically visible.    I include in the Record the full analysis by the United States  Conference of Catholic Bishops for the record. I am also submitting an  analysis by National Right to Life (NRLC) that lists similar concerns  and provides further insight into these issues.               [From the Secretariat of Pro-Life Activities]       The Equality Act: Its Impact on Government Funding of Abortion         The Equality Act will likely have an adverse impact on       existing provisions that prohibit the use of federal funds       for abortion.        Below we review relevant provisions of the bill. We then       consider the likely consequences for current restrictions on       federal funding of abortion.                         I. Text of the Equality Act         The followings bill provisions are relevant.        I. Public accommodations. The Equality Act (H.R. 5) forbids       discrimination based on ``sex,'' including ``sexual       orientation and gender identity,'' in places of ``public       accommodation.'' H.R. 5, Sec. 3(a)( 1 ). The bill defines       ``public accommodation'' to include ``any establishment that       provides . . . health care . . . services.'' Id.       Sec. 3(a)(4). The term ``establishment'' is not limited to       physical facilities and places. Id. Sec. 3(c). The term       ``sex'' includes ``pregnancy, childbirth, or a related       medical condition.'' Id. Sec. 9(2). The bill also states that       ``pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition shall       not receive less favorable treatment than other physical       conditions.'' Id.        2. Federally-funded programs and activities. The bill also       forbids discrimination based on ``sex,'' including ``sexual       orientation and gender identity,'' in any program or activity       receiving federal financial assistance. Id. Sec. 6. The term       ``sex'' is again defined to include ``pregnancy, childbirth,       or a related medical condition,'' and the listed items       ``shall not receive less favorable treatment than other       physical conditions.'' Id. Sec. 9(2).               II. Consequences for Federal Funding of Abortion         These changes in federal law will likely undercut existing       prohibitions on the use of government funds for abortion.        For years it has been an accepted predicate in federal bill       drafting that laws forbidding discrimination based on ``sex''       must have abortion-neutral language to blunt any inference       that non-discrimination requires the provision or coverage of       abortion. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and       Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, are       illustrative. Both titles forbid discrimination based on sex,       and both titles have abortion  [[Page H3949]]       neutral amendments to mitigate or foreclose the claim that       this prohibition requires a covered entity to provide or       cover abortion. The fact that abortion-neutral language       appears in Title VII and Title IX shows that Congress knows       how to exclude abortion when it wants to. The failure to       include an abortion-neutral amendment in the Equality Act       therefore suggests a legislative intent to require the       provision of abortion; otherwise, the Act, like Titles VII       and IX, would have included such language. This conclusion is       reinforced by (a) the bill's definition of sex to include       ``pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition,''       (b) agency and judicial interpretations construing this       language, and (c) the added qualification that pregnancy and       ``related medical condition[s] shall not receive less       favorable treatment than any other physical conditions.''        The same reasoning--and the same conclusion--applies to the       bill's non-discrimination provisions as applicable to       federally-funded programs and activities. Indeed, abortion       advocates themselves are currently reading the federal       funding provisions of the bill to permit women to       successfully challenge the denial of abortion.        Existing prohibitions on the use of government funds for       abortion can be undercut in three ways.        First, federal and state governments are themselves       providers of health care. Therefore, they would themselves be       subject to the constraints that the Equality Act places on       all health care providers and, as such, would likely be       required to provide abortions. This conclusion is reinforced       by the bill's expansive definition of ``establishment,''       which is not limited to physical facilities and places.        Second, it would seem anomalous to, on the one hand,       mandate that recipients of federal funds provide abortions,       as the Equality Act can be read to do, but, on the other       hand, prohibit use of such funds for abortions. It can (and       likely will) be argued that these newly-enacted provisions,       which would likely require recipients of federal funding to       perform abortions, would thereby repeal by implication       previously-enacted legislation forbidding the use of those       very same funds for abortion.        Third, even if the bill were not construed to require the       federal government to fund abortions, it could still be       construed to require states that receive federal funding to       do so with their own funds, which would be a departure from       the longstanding principle that the federal government not       require government funding of abortion even on the part of       state governments.

Date: May 16, 2019.      Re: Memorandum: H.R. 5, the Equality Act, and Implications on           the Hyde Amendment.         H.R. 5, the Equality Act, contains language that could be       construed to create a right to demand abortion from health       care providers, and likely would place at risk the authority       of the government to prohibit taxpayer-funded abortions.        Historically, when Congress has addressed discrimination       based on sex, rules of construction have been added to       prevent requiring funding of abortion or nullifying       conscience laws. No such rule of construction is contained in       H.R. 5.        Section 9 of the Equality Act would amend the Civil Rights       Act of 1964 (CRA) by defining ``sex'' to include ``pregnancy,       childbirth, or a related medical condition.'' It is well       established that abortion is regarded as a ``related medical       condition.'' See 29 C.F.R. pt. 1604 App. (1986) and Doe v.       CARS Protection Plus, Inc., 527 F.3d 358 (3d Cir. 2008).        With abortion regarded as a pregnancy-related medical       condition, H.R. 5 goes on to state that ``pregnancy,       childbirth. or a related medical condition shall not receive       less favorable treatment than other physical conditions.''        While the CRA had previously prohibited discrimination in       certain places of ``public accommodation,'' such as hotels,       restaurants, and places of entertainment, H.R. 5 amends the       CRA definition of ``public accommodations'' to include any       ``establishment that provides health care.'' The bill states       that the term establishment ``shall be construed to include       an individual whose operations affect commerce and who is a       provider of a good, service, or program.'' This provision       would apply to individual health care providers who object to       abortion, including those with religious objections (indeed,       the bill explicitly overrides the protections contained in       existing federal law under the Religious Freedom Restoration       Act, 42 2U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.).        Further, there is an additional provision that goes on to       state that health care providers ``shall not be construed to       be limited to a physical facility or place.''        So to the extent that non-physical entities, including       States administering Medicaid, could be considered an       ``establishment that provides health care,'' funding       restrictions, including the Hyde Amendment, will be put in       jeopardy.        In late 2018, Executive Director Mara Keisling of the       National Center for Transgender Equality said in an       interview, ``The worry is that extending sex-based       protections to government programs could create a backdoor       legal challenge to abortion restrictions like the Hyde       amendment, which could potentially threaten whatever       conservative support the bill may have.''        From 1973, when abortion first became legal, until 1980,       when the Hyde amendment first took effect, the joint federal-      state Medicaid program was paying for roughly 300,000       abortions annually.   In Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980), the Court upheld the Hyde  Amendment, which restricted federal funding of abortion to cases where  the mother's life was endangered (rape and incest exceptions were later  added). While the Court insisted that a woman had a right to an  abortion, the state was not required to fund the exercise of that  right.        Currently, 17 states fund Medicaid coverage of abortion       voluntarily or have laws in place requiring funding (of       these, 13 are due to court decisions). Twenty-seven (27)       states and the District of Columbia have laws that limit       funding to cases of life endangerment, rape, and incest; six       states limit abortion funding to a lesser extent.        Even if, under H.R. 5, the federal Hyde amendment was still       applied to block federal funds for Medicaid abortions, States       currently not funding abortion, under Title VI as federal       funding recipients, could now face challenges to require them       to use their own state or local funds for Medicaid abortions.       Further, the CRA Sec. 20l(d) and Sec. 202 explicitly       supersede state laws for purposes of ``public       accommodations'' law.        For example, in New Mexico, which adopted a state Equal       Right Amendment (ERA), the state affiliates of Planned       Parenthood and NARAL relied on this state ERA in a legal       attack on the state version of the Hyde Amendment,       prohibiting Medicaid funding of elective abortions. The case       was NM Right to Choose / NARAL v. Johnson, No. 1999-NMSC-005.       In its 1998 ruling, every justice on the New Mexico Supreme       Court agreed that the state ERA required the state to fund       abortions performed by medical professionals, since       procedures sought by men (e.g., prostate surgery) are funded.       If enacted, H.R. 5 would open the door for widespread similar       litigation wherein any attempt to restrict the funding of       abortion would constitute discrimination.        Enactment of H. R. 5 would open the door to legal       challenges that will amount to this: pregnancy-related       medical conditions (including abortion) could not be treated       less favorably than other physical conditions, so any       ``public accommodation'' that treats abortion differently       from procedures than other procedures constitute       discrimination.
