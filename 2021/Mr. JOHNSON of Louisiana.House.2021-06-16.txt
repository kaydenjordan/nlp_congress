 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, during my time tonight, my  colleagues and I will address the major crises happening here at home,  happening close to home, and now happening abroad. Our message tonight  will cover many topics, but the theme is consistent. These crises are  self-inflicted. There are the direct results of disastrous policy  decisions from the Biden administration.   We have a large number of Members who want to participate tonight, so  I will begin immediately by yielding to the gentleman from central  Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. The  American people are counting on us, and they deserve a President who  will ensure their safety, security, and freedom, both here at home and  abroad.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida ( Mr. Speaker, my friend is exactly right.  The people do know better, and the pain hardworking Americans are  feeling is very real.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser),  who represents Pennsylvania's Ninth Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, my friend said it so well.  This administration either doesn't understand those fundamentals of the  economy or doesn't care. It is very perplexing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird), who  represents Indiana's Fourth Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, ``reckless'' is a word we hear  over and over tonight and as we talk to our constituents because there  is no better word to describe what is happening with this  administration.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gimenez), the  former mayor of Miami who represents Florida's 26th Congressional  District.    Mr. Speaker, my friend is exactly right.  That language is dangerous, and our colleague that he referenced is  contributing to the foreign policy crises that have developed rapidly  over the last few months.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Mr. Speaker, my friend from Arizona is  exactly right. This crisis with China and the Chinese Communist Party  is perhaps the greatest threat that we face as a people today, and we  need the White House to stand strong. I am so grateful she brought that  good word.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller),  who represents Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Keller is correct. When we  were kids, they taught us the value of a dollar. That is not what our  Democrat colleagues are teaching anymore. Now they are subscribing to  what we call fantasy economics, modern monetary theory and all the  rest. Mr. Keller is exactly right, and I am so grateful that he brought  that word tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin),  representing the 36th District.    Mr. Speaker, despite the obvious magnitude  of that big problem on the border that we have seen and talk about all  the time, hammering home that theme, there have been zero visits to the  border by the President or the border czar, the Vice President.   In fact, when Kamala Harris was asked in an interview this week if  she planned on visiting the border, she laughed about it. But I tell  you, those Customs and Border Patrol agents will tell her that it is no  laughing matter. I am grateful that Mr. Babin brought that forward  tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose),  my good friend, who represents the Sixth District.    Mr. Speaker, that is such an important  point. The evidence is mounting that China is indeed responsible for  the COVID crisis, and we must hold them accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins),  who represents the Third District, and is the third Louisianan on the  floor now.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Captain Higgins for  those impassioned words. He is exactly right.   One of the things that is so heartbreaking, frustrating,  unconscionable about this is we can solve this crisis at the border  pretty simply. All we need the White House to do is reimplement the  Trump-era policies because that increased border security, it  discouraged illegal immigration and it reinstituted law and order, and  we can do that, but they won't.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), who  represents Georgia's First Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, that is a great reminder of  who the President serves, and it is confounding to us that he doesn't  understand these basic truths.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett),  who represents Tennessee's Second District.    Always.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman covered a lot,  and he is right, this crisis we have, the jobs and the economy was so  preventable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Wilson), one of my heroes in the Congress.    Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration  Democrats continue to push policies that pay people more to stay at  home than go back to work, so the results are not surprising at all.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry),  who represents Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional District.                                time  2120     Mr. Speaker, out of business.    Mr. Speaker, I am very grateful for those  comments.  [[Page H2885]]    Mr. Perry is exactly right. He mentioned Economics 101. Some of our  colleagues would do well to go take a refresher course.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde), who  represents Georgia's Ninth District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for those  remarks, and I thank him for his service.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert), who represents Texas' First Congressional  District.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Gohmert is exactly right.  And the scope of that tragedy is something that is hard to wrap your  mind around.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr.  Mooney).    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on the  clock?    Mr. Speaker, I will need to summarize,  then.   I am delighted to have had so many of my colleagues here tonight to  help us sound the alarms and inform the American people what is going  on here.   We have a crisis here at home. We have a crisis on the southern  border. And we have multiple developing crises abroad. You heard the  broad spectrum of all those tonight, Mr. Speaker.   Whether it is our concern about jobs in the economy with the rising  inflation, with this humanitarian crisis with young children and  traffickers and drug cartels at the border, or whether we are talking  about this administration's critical foreign policy blunders, you can  summarize it all, Mr. Speaker.   Maybe it was summarized best tonight by the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry). He said in one phrase: We have a leadership  crisis.   We certainly do. But I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, all these issues  and everything that my colleagues talked about tonight can and should  be addressed in a bipartisan way. All of us on this side of the aisle  want to do that. We are anxious to do that. We should all want  Americans to get back to work. We should all want to end the  humanitarian crisis at the border. We should all want to achieve peace  through strength on the international stage.   It is time for President Biden and it is time for our Democrat  colleagues to work with Republicans for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
