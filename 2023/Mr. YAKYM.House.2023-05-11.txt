 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1163,  the Protecting Taxpayers and Victims of Unemployment Fraud Act.   The Department of Labor's inspector general pegs pandemic-era  unemployment insurance fraud at $191 billion, though other experts say  it could run as high as $400 billion. These are staggering figures.   This fraud enriched criminals. It harmed innocent Americans who faced  processing delays, stolen benefits, and stolen identities. These were  not victimless crimes.   H.R. 1163 takes a couple of important and commonsense steps toward  addressing this fraud.   First, it extends the statute of limitations so that we can continue  to investigate reports, recover taxpayer dollars, and prosecute the  fraudsters.   More importantly, it incentivizes States not just to recover  fraudulent payments but to shore up their systems against future fraud  by allowing them to use a portion of recovered funds for program  integrity and fraud prevention efforts.   The unemployment insurance program is an important part of our safety  net that helps Americans recover from a job loss. The pandemic exposed  major flaws that are in desperate need of attention.   I support the bill before us today because we shouldn't just catch  the fraud that was. We need to stop the fraud that will be. H.R. 1163  takes steps to ensure that we in Congress and Americans across the  country have faith in this program to deliver during difficult times.
