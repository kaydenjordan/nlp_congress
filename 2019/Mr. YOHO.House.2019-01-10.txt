 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express and demonstrate the  importance of STEM education in the lives of America's youth.   STEM education is vital to the economy, with STEM-related jobs  growing faster than ever and the need for well-educated and well- trained young STEM professionals greater than ever.   STEM education also facilitates critical thinking skills, innovation,  creativity, as well as cooperative learning.   Just one example of the impact that STEM education has at an early  age is Janani Kumaran, an eighth grader from Gainesville who placed  second out of over 2,000 entries in the Broadcom Foundation MASTERS of  STEM middle school competition.   Janani created a project using snails to reduce the negative effects  of the invasive aquatic plant hydrilla found in many bodies of  freshwater in Florida.   Congratulations to Janani. I look forward to everything you and the  other great youth of America will be able to achieve because of STEM  education, to keep our country great.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the President has shown his willingness to  negotiate and has negotiated. The President has proposed various dollar  amounts he is willing to accept for border security, has said he is  ready to discuss DACA, and has listened to the other side's request for  materials other than concrete to be considered for a structure on our  southern border.   The crisis at the southern border should not be a partisan issue. It  is an American and immigrant crisis. The solution should be one that is  best for America and not a party; for if it is best for America, we all  benefit from that. Yet the Democrats continue to dig in their heels and  not budge. Republicans have shown time and again that they are willing  to talk.   The House should oppose this bill that will not bring our country any  closer to a border security solution or resolve the partial government  shutdown.
