 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Bucktail Medical Center CEO Timothy Reeves for receiving a  Community Star from the National Organization of State Offices of Rural  Health.   Community Stars recognize men and women nationwide who work to  improve, protect, and advance health and wellness for those living in  rural America.   Timothy Reeves is the chief executive officer at Bucktail Medical  Center, which is a critical access hospital, skilled nursing facility,  community clinic, and BLS ambulance service in Renovo, Pennsylvania, in  Clinton County. It is the only medical facility for more than 30 miles  in any direction. Bucktail Medical Center is believed to be the most  remote hospital in Pennsylvania.   When Timothy came to Bucktail, the small hospital was on life  support. The organization had significant financial issues, but it had  a dedicated, strong-willed staff and supporting board. Through a  carefully planned financial restructuring process, Timothy has helped  bring the facility back to life. It is growing, modernizing, and  acquiring the equipment, technology, and provisions needed to advance  healthcare for the community.   Mr. Speaker, thanks to Timothy and his team, Bucktail is looking  towards the future, and the community is grateful for it.                    Congratulating Dr. Lorraine Rosamilia     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate a Centre County dermatologist for being named one of  Pennsylvania's Top Physicians Under 40 by the Pennsylvania Medical  Society. Dr. Lorraine Rosamilia, a native of Lock Haven, Pennsylvania,  treats skin conditions and skin cancers in patients of all ages at  Geisinger Health System in State College.   In 2018, she will serve as the president of the Pennsylvania Academy  of Dermatology and Dermatologic Surgery. She attended medical school  and residency training in dermatology at Penn State's Milton S. Hershey  Medical Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania.   Geisinger Health System recently honored Dr. Rosamilia at its annual  Top Patient Experience Clinicians Awards Dinner for ranking in the top  10 percent in patient experience nationally.   Dr. Rosamilia currently serves on the editorial and review boards of  several medical journals. She is certified by the American Board of  Dermatology. In addition to practicing, she teaches dermatology  residents and primary care practitioners and delivers lectures on  dermatology locally, nationally, and internationally.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly congratulate Dr. Rosamilia on this  outstanding achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, tonight, one of the  biggest Christmas events will take place in New York City: the lighting  of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.   This historic event has ushered in the holiday season since the first  official tree lighting in 1933. Tonight's event is the 85th tree  lighting, and  [[Page H9475]]  while it will be a star-studded event with various entertainers  performing on the plaza, the biggest star of all is from State College,  Pennsylvania: the Christmas tree.   The 75-foot-tall Norway spruce was chosen as the yuletide  centerpiece. The 12-ton tree was trucked into Midtown Manhattan earlier  this month from State College. Rockefeller Center's head gardener was  visiting State College a few years ago for a high school football game.  He saw the tree from the road and knocked on the homeowner Jason  Perrin's door to ask about the spruce.   Mr. Perrin is a Penn State graduate who worked for the State College  Area School District for 17 years. He believes the tree is about 80  years old.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to State College's tree playing a  starring role in tonight's festivities. Merry Christmas.                            ____________________
