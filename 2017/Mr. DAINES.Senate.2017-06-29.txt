 Mr. President, this week I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Marvin Qualley, a dedicated basketball official from  Roosevelt County. This past week, Marvin was selected by the Montana  High School Association for induction into the 2017 Montana Officials'  Association Hall of Fame.   Marvin's recognition as a hall of fame official is clearly well  earned. He has been a bedrock official in the northeast Montana  basketball circuit for many years. From Plentywood to Poplar, the  communities of northeast Montana have benefited from Marvin's  officiating. The 36-year duration of Marvin's contributions to youth  sports is simply amazing. The quality of his hall of fame career is  evident in his frequent selection to officiate postseason competitions.  He was behind the whistle for 15 State basketball tournaments and 60  total tournaments. In addition to his accomplishments as a referee,  Marvin has spent many years behind the wheel of a school bus helping  students in the Froid and Medicine Lake communities safely reach their  destination.   Both behind the wheel and behind the whistle, Marvin's commitment to  safety and fair play has helped a generation of Montana students.  Officiating youth sports is often a thankless task. Looking back on  Marvin's distinguished career, it is appropriate to sum it up with a  sincere ``Good job, ref!''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:    Mr. President, as a father of four and a traveling  family, I know how important and challenging it is for nursing mothers  to find a space to care for and feed their children. As our society and  economy becomes ever more transient, we need to provide spaces for  mothers on the go and ease their return to the workforce. Last  Congress, I helped ensure the Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment  Screening Act became law, which eased the burden traveling mothers  experienced. We need to continue easing this burden and expand  facilities in public buildings.   Federal agencies, under current law, are required to provide space  for nursing mothers to pump breastmilk for their newborns.  Additionally, General Services Administration requires installation of  these spaces for all newly constructed federal buildings, as well as  those undergoing modernizations. These rooms are a simple hygienic  place, other than a bathroom, that are shielded from view, free from  intrusion, contain a chair, a table surface, and an electrical outlet.  This is good policy and should be extended to the public when visiting  Federal facilities for business or other purposes.   That is why I am introducing the Fairness For Breastfeeding Mothers  Act. This legislation would simply extend the use of these facilities  in public buildings to visitors, ensuring all mothers can continue to  care for their children.   I want to thank Senator Merkley for being the Democrat lead as well  as Congresswoman Norton's lead in the House of Representatives. I ask  my Senate colleagues to join us in support of this important  legislation.
