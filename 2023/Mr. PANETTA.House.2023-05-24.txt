 Mr. Speaker, I recognize Ann Berry, who, for the past 44  years, affected the lives of students, teachers, and families in the  Carmel Unified School District.   This month, Ms. Berry is retiring as Carmel High School's attendance  secretary, where she ensured that students not only attended school but  enjoyed school.   She started in 1979 as a parent who showed up to ensure that her  daughter wasn't skipping class. She did such a good job in that role  that Carmel High School hired her to keep other students in school.   It was a vocation for Ms. Berry that affected thousands of other  Padres, including my two older brothers, myself, and now my two  daughters, who attend Carmel High School.   Through her work, our community relied on Ms. Berry as a cop for  keeping kids in class, as a comedian for keeping kids happy, as a  counselor well aware of teen mental health concerns, as a coach for  common sense, and as a supporter of Padre athletic and academic  success.   For four decades, Ms. Berry was that dependable school administrator.  She was that voice of reason for parents, and she is that trusted adult  for teenagers.   As one of her students and now as her Congressman, I thank and  congratulate Ms. Ann Berry for her service, for her support, and for  being that solid cornerstone of the Carmel High community.                            ____________________
