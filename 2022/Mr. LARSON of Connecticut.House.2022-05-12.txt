 Madam Speaker, I am here this morning to  talk about Social Security.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record two articles: The first is  entitled, ``It's time for U.S. Congress to debate Social Security  reform in the light of day'' by The New York Times reporter Mark  Miller.   The second is ``The Early Impact of COVID-19 on Job Losses among  Black Women in the United States'' submitted by Michelle Holder.            It's Time For U.S. Congress to Debate Social Security Reform in the                                Light of Day                       (By Mark Miller, May 5, 2022)         (Reuters).--Social Security has never failed to make its       benefit payments since the mailing of monthly checks began in       1940, but most Americans these days are worried about the       future of the program.        Who can blame them? Social Security's two trust funds are       projected to run dry in 2034, and the program would be able       to pay only 80 percent of its obligations to retirees and       disabled workers at that point. Politicians don't exactly       generate confidence when they make irresponsible--and wrong--      comments claiming that Social Security is going bankrupt or       running out of money.        The result is public skepticism and concern. Forty-two       percent of working Americans tell Pew Research Center       pollsters that they doubt they will receive any benefits from       Social Security. An equal share thinks they will receive a       benefit, but at a reduced level.        The Social Security trustees have been projecting this       shortfall since the early 1990s, but the U.S. Congress has       failed to act. What we need is a full, public debate on       reform legislation--and an actual vote by lawmakers. The       window is open for that to happen this year--the Democratic       Party has developed an internal consensus on legislation that       addresses the solvency problem, and also expands benefits       modestly. It controls both legislative chambers--at least for       now. The Social Security 2100 Act is supported by 202 House       Democrats--in other words, nearly the entire party caucus.       The bill probably cannot jump the hurdle of a Republican       filibuster in the U.S. Senate, but it is imperative to get       everyone in Congress on the record with a vote on this issue.        ``People have got to know where you stand,'' said U.S.       Representative John Larson, a Connecticut Democrat and chief       sponsor of the legislation.                              EXPANDED BENEFITS         The Social Security 2100 legislation would close 52 percent       of the long-term shortfall, according to an analysis by the       Social Security actuaries. It would push the trust fund       depletion date back to 2038 by adding new payroll taxes to       wages over $400,000--currently, taxation stops at $147,000.       Earlier versions of the bill restored solvency for 75 years       by also gradually increasing payroll tax rates, but that has       been eliminated to reflect President Joe Biden's campaign       pledge not to raise taxes on people with incomes below       $400,000 per year.        The bill does recognize the need to expand benefits, which       can help address rising income inequality, and racial and       gender gaps in retirement security. The COVID-19 pandemic has       widened those gaps. What's more, Gen-Xers and Millennials are       likely to fare even worse than boomers and today's seniors       when they reach retirement. This is the result of factors       including escalating higher-education costs, staggering       student debt burdens, wage stagnation, soaring housing costs       and the decline of traditional defined benefit pensions.                  Social Security 2100 includes a modest 2 percent across-      the-board boost in benefits, and it would shift the annual       cost-of-living  [[Page H4873]]       increase to a more generous formula. It also includes       targeted benefit increases such as a new minimum benefit       level for very low income seniors, and improved benefits for       widows and widowers. It also would provide caregiver credits       that increase benefits for people who take time out of the       workforce to care for dependent family members. And it would       repeal the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and       Government Pension Offset (GPO), which currently penalize       many people who work in the public sector.        What would Republicans do to solve the Social Security       problem if they take control of Congress next year?        Earlier versions of Republican reform plans have called for       benefit cuts in the form of higher retirement ages and means       testing. U.S. Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican,       recently set off a small firestorm with a proposal to sunset       all federal legislation every five years--an idea that at       least in theory would require regular reauthorization of       Social Security and Medicare. He also wants every American to       pay income taxes--no matter their level of income.        Republicans have also made clear that they prefer to handle       Social Security reform behind closed doors. Senator Mitt       Romney, a Utah Republican, has proposed the ironically named       TRUST Act, which would create a closed process for       legislators to propose changes to the Social Security and       Medicare trust funds, culminating in an up or down vote       process.        This approach is a favorite play for lawmakers looking to       keep their fingerprints off unpopular legislation--bills       emerge from faceless, bipartisan committees. The last time it       was attempted for Social Security was the unsuccessful       Bowles-Simpson commission, which proposed a range of       unpopular benefit cuts in 2011 that would have impacted       middle-class seniors.        Fighting to improve Social Security would fulfill a promise       that Biden made as a presidential candidate, and it could       energize voters. Public opinion polling has consistently       shown strong public support for maintaining current benefit       levels, even if new taxes are needed.        New polling by Data for Progress shows that increasing       benefits would make a large chunk of independent voters more       likely to support Democratic candidates for Congress this       fall. The idea of shoring up Social Security polls extremely       well with middle-class Americans: 63 percent of those without       a college degree tell Pew pollsters that Social Security       finances should a top priority for Congress and the       president.        This is a battle worth fighting in 2022.                                   ____              [From Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, July 2020]                           Working Paper No. 963    The Early Impact of COVID-19 on Job Losses Among Black Women in the                               United States                                     By      (Michelle Holder, John Jay College, City University of New York)                 (Janelle Jones, Groundwork Collaborative)        (Thomas Masterson, Levy Economics Institute of Bard College)                                            INTRODUCTION         The COVID-19 pandemic seemingly appeared out of nowhere but       changed nearly everything. Until February of 2020, the       American economy had been at what is considered full       employment levels--3.5 percent overall. Even African       Americans, who traditionally occupy a less favorable position       in the labor market (as measured by unemployment and wage       disparities) were experiencing historically low levels of       unemployment. However, the first signs of the massive job       losses that were to come appeared when initial claims filed       for unemployment insurance rose to unprecedented levels in       March, leaping from approximately 220,000 new claims filed       each week since the start of the year to an astonishing 3.3       million by the third week in March, then more than doubling       the following week to 6.9 million. While this pace slowed       down in May, new claims for unemployment insurance in the       United States still numbered in the millions each week. With       shelter-in-place orders implemented across the country in       February and March, along with state-by-state mandatory       shutdowns of ``nonessential'' businesses, aggregate demand       for many goods and services ground to a halt, leaving tens of       millions of American workers jobless.        As the pandemic unfolded, industries deemed nonessential,       such as leisure, hospitality, and retail trade, were leveled.       Many occupations in these industries are low-wage, and women       constitute a greater share of the low-wage labor force in the       United States than men (Holder 2018, 689). Moreover, the       largest share of minimum wage workers in America is female       (Holder 2017, 12). Thus, when the US Department of Labor's       Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released their monthly       ``Employment Situation'' report for April on May 8 (a week       later than it normally would have) it was met with only       modest surprise that the April unemployment rate for women       exceeded the unemployment rate for men--16.2 percent versus       13.2 percent, respectively (US DOL 2020). The pattern of       higher unemployment for women as compared to men is also true       in the Black community, along with the US's long-standing       pattern of an unemployment rate for Blacks that routinely       exceeds that of Whites--16.7 percent and 14.2 percent,       respectively (US DOL 2020).        As COVID-19 deaths began to mount, it became clear that       African Americans were disparately affected not only with       regard to their livelihoods, but also their very lives; while       the Black community is 13 percent of the US population, given       inequitable access to healthcare as well as other structural       inequalities, they accounted for roughly one-quarter of all       deaths in the country as of May 28, 2020 (US CDC 2020).       Moreover, as some American workers were able to do their jobs       from the comfort of their homes, a high proportion of       ``essential'' workers (somewhat loosely defined as those who       work in supermarkets, public transportation, pharmacies,       grocery stores, nursing homes, hospitals, and correctional       facilities, among other industries) were African American,       other people of color, women, and an intersection of the       these groups--women of color. The goal of this paper is to       closely examine the contours, depth, and causes of COVID-l9's       impact on Black women's employment in the United States.       Because the early job loss numbers indicate that women in the       United States have thus far borne the brunt of the COVID-19-      inspired downturn, most demographic comparisons we make in       this text will be between female demographic groups,       primarily Black and White women, using the lenses of both       feminist economic theory and stratification economics.                   GENDER AND RACE IN THE COVID-19 DOWNTURN         The recession of the early 1980s, as well as the Great       Recession, were downturns in which men, Black workers, and       Latinx workers experienced disproportionate job loss, mostly       attributable to the industrial distribution of these groups--      they tend to be employed in industries that are more       vulnerable to cyclical downturns (Hoynes, Miller, and       Schaller 2012). Although there were across-the-board job       losses among all major demographic groups during the Great       Recession, according to Haynes, Miller, and Schaller (2012)       the smallest absolute increase in unemployment during that       downturn occurred among White women. Those researchers       attributed this to the industrial distribution of women whom,       they posited, tend to be employed in industries less       vulnerable to cyclicality than industries in which men are       concentrated. Women of color, however, were more vulnerable       than women overall, given the roles of race and ethnicity in       that group's industrial distribution.        The current economic downturn in the United States,       however, is quite unlike business cycle downturns of the       past. The normal predictions and expectations of where job       losses were going to occur have not closely followed past       patterns. Industries such as leisure and hospitality, retail       trade, construction, manufacturing, and ``other services''       (including personal care services) were labeled as       ``nonessential,'' and companies operating in these industries       were ordered, state by state, to temporarily cease or slow       down operations. Industries operating in the sphere of       ``essential services'' were allowed to continue, but with       significant restrictions, resulting in significant declines       in economic activity. With much of the US population       sheltering in place during the early phases of the pandemic--      including those employees who were able to work from home--      other industries still considered essential, like       transportation, experienced a massive slowdown m activity.       Unlike the Great Recession and the recession of the early       1980s, women, particularly women of color, were bearing the       brunt of early job losses given the extraordinary nature in       which economic activity was deliberately, not organically,       slowed down or halted. Rising unemployment among women, given       their overrepresentation in service industries and       occupations, became pervasive (see Boushey and Sanchez       Cumming 2020). While jobholding by Black women in services       deemed essential (like hospitals and supermarkets) offered       some insulation against job loss, this was not enough to       offset large job losses in other sectors.    CHANGES IN LABOR FORCE INDICATORS FOR WOMEN DURING THE EARLY PANDEMIC         The seasonally adjusted US unemployment rate for April 2020       climbed by slightly more than 10 percentage points, to 14.7       percent from 4.4 percent in March. This increase was the       largest month-to-month change in over 70 years. Moreover, the       April unemployment rate was nearly 50 percent higher than the       average US unemployment rate during the 18-month period of       the Great Recession. This was clearly an astonishing rate of       job loss. Drilling down the numbers by gender and race,       Latinas appear to have experienced the highest unemployment       rate in April--20.2    percent--followed by African American women at 16.2 percent; White       women's unemployment rate reached 15 percent (US DOL       2020). However, the change in the rate of unemployment       only captures part of the story; after averaging       approximately 63 percent for the first quarter of 2020,       the overall labor force participation rate declined to       just over 60 percent in April, signaling the start of an       exodus from the American labor force. The official       unemployment rate does not capture individuals who are not       in the labor force, and that number swelled by about 8       million in April, with nearly half of this increase       attributable to persons who wanted to work but who could       not find employment.        Among major female demographic groups for whom the BLS       provides monthly data, Black women possessed both the highest       labor force participation rate as well as employment-      population ratio, leaving this  [[Page H4874]]       group especially vulnerable to the COVID-19-inspired       downturn, given their strong attachment to the workforce.       Black women's unemployment rate for April shot up to 16.4       percent, higher than that for Black men, whose unemployment       rate reached 16.2 percent that month. Unlike the Great       Recession of 2007-9, where the unemployment rate for Black       men significantly exceeded that of Black women, the early       impact of COVID-19 on unemployment has clearly been       ``gendered,'' with more intense ramifications for African       American women.        In comparing Black and White women, in February of this       year, prior to the initial impact of COVID-19 on US       employment, Black women not only had a higher unemployment       rate than White women (4.8 percent versus 2.8 percent,       respectively), but also a higher labor force participation       rate (63.8 percent versus 58.2 percent, respectively).       Feminist economists such as Nina Banks (2019), Cecilia Conrad       (2005), and Randy Albelda (1985) have long highlighted the       historically higher labor force participation rate of Black       women compared to White women in the United States. As noted       in the preceding paragraph, this attachment to the labor       force also makes Black women more vulnerable during economic       downturns. In examining table 1, while there appears to be       little difference in the increase in the unemployment rate       from February to April for Black women compared to White       women, because of Black women's more entrenched--and, at the       same time, more precarious attachment to the American       workforce (evidenced by historically higher unemployment       rates than White women)--the impact of COVID-19 on Black       women's position in the labor force has been somewhat deeper       than that for White women, with slightly larger (and       statistically significant) declines for Black women than       White women in both the labor force participation rate and       the employment-population ratio.                          DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION         The early job losses during the COVID-19 pandemic were       characterized by gender and racial disparities. With regard       to job losses by industry, the ``healthcare and social       services'' industry accounted for nearly 14 percent of all       workers in the United States but 28 percent of employed Black       women and 22 percent of employed White women; the 17 percent       decline in employment in this industry, therefore, was bound       to have an outsized impact on women. Feminist economic theory       has explored the role that discrimination plays in       occupational crowding by gender, notably the historical       exclusion of women from jobs that are deemed more appropriate       for men (see Beller 1982). In addition, Black women, along       with Black men, suffered disproportionately staggering losses       in the ``accommodation and food services'' industry, an       industry leveled during the pandemic, where the       overrepresentation of Black female and Black male workers       exceeds that of their White counterparts. This industry       offers notoriously low wages and stratification economic       theory suggests that privileged groups have a material       interest in maintaining sexism and racism--as well as other       forms of oppression--because benefits accrue to advantaged       groups as a whole (see Darity et. al. 2017). This is true       even though the benefits do not necessarily accrue to all       individual members of the privileged group at all times.       Thus, discrimination can and does persist in market-based       economies. The crowding of Black workers in low-wage       industries is suggestive of opportunity hoarding by White       workers, consistent with stratification economic theory.        Occupationally, the roles of both gender and race proved to       be disastrous for employment losses for Black women. The only       two major occupational categories that experienced employment       declines greater than 50 percent--``food preparation and       serving'' (which accounts for just over 5 percent of all       workers) and ``personal care and services'' (which accounts       for nearly 3 percent of all workers)--are two occupations       where, among Black and White employees, Black women are the       only demographic group overrepresented in both.        The pandemic has catalyzed a public health and economic       crisis on a scale not seen since the Great Depression. In one       month, the unemployment rate increased by 10 percentage       points, the largest month-to-month increase in more than a       generation. While the devastation has been widespread, it is       not shared equitably across race and gender. There are two       main reasons why Black women are disproportionately impacted       by the COVID-19 recession. First, Black women in the labor       market face high levels of occupational and industrial       segregation. Second, Black women's strong attachment to the       labor market, as measured by their labor force participation       rate and employment-to-population ratio, makes them more       vulnerable to economic downturns, and this current recession       is no exception.        Unlike previous economic downturns, industries once thought       immune to recessions were ordered by government officials to       stop or significantly slow their activity. Between February       and April, when the economy shed millions of jobs, Black       women experienced larger-than-overall declines in employment       due to their concentration in parts of the economy. Black       women are overrepresented in ``essential'' jobs, like nursing       assistants and cashiers, while at the same time also       overrepresented in occupations and industries that are       shedding workers by the millions, such as hotels,       restaurants, and retail trade. In responding to this economic       crisis, policymakers must firmly commit to a policy agenda       that provides immediate relief to those who need it and make       our economy more stable and equitable in the future. In the       short term, we should continue to give direct support to       families through cash payments and an expansion of       unemployment benefits. In the long term, we can enact       policies that fix the structural flaws of our system,       including using economic measures tied directly to the       position and status of Black women in order to more       accurately determine when an economy has reached those often       left behind.     Madam Speaker, I think as Martin Luther  King would say, it is the ``fierce urgency of now'' that we are dealing  with, and by that I mean the fierce urgency being the pandemic that  this country is currently going through.   That pandemic has taken more than 740,000 Americans over the age of  65. That same group over the age of 65 is the group that is hurt most  by inflation. Why? Because they are on fixed incomes. They are Social  Security recipients. And they need our help now.   The good news, thanks to the efforts of Chairman Neal and the Ways  and Means Committee, we have established a Racial Equity Task Force.  The gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell), the gentleman from Nevada  (Mr. Horsford), and the gentleman from California (Mr. Gomez) have all  put together extensive reporting that talks about the inequality that  exists in what our colleague John Lewis said was the next civil rights  movement, and that is to make sure we uplift everybody in this country  who has worked all their lives, paid into a system, and receives below- poverty-level checks from their government.   That is about to end with the passage of Social Security 2100: A  Sacred Trust, called the sacred trust by President Biden because it is.  We no longer have to go back to the Great Depression to talk about the  impact of Social Security and why it came into prominence. You only  have to go back as far as 2008-2009 to understand that during that  recession, people saw their 401(k) become a 101(k).   During that same time period, Social Security never missed a payment,  not a spousal, not a dependent coverage payment, not a pension payment,  and not a disability payment.   With Memorial Day approaching, it was good listening to the Members  come and talk about honoring our veterans on Memorial Day. Several came  down this week honoring National Police Week as well, talking about  police officers who need help. Millions of police officers and their  spouses across this country, because of WEP and GPO, are penalized and  don't receive the Social Security benefits that they richly deserve.  President Biden has put an end to that.   Richard Neal has also introduced legislation as well with respect to  that. So has Mr. Davis and Mr. Brady on the Republican side. It is long  overdue. If you want to help police officers, if you want to help our  veterans, so many of whom rely more on Social Security Disability than  they do on the VA, we need to reform Social Security. Congress has not  enhanced Social Security in more than 51 years. A gallon of milk in  1971 cost 72 cents. Look at the cost now, not only of milk but of bread  and butter and gas and rent, and understand the absolute necessity to  help out the people who during this pandemic need it the most.   Congress can no longer kick the can down the road. This is our  responsibility on our watch; and on Memorial Day, every citizen in this  country ought to be asking Congress what it is going to do. What do we  have to do? A very simple thing that we take an oath of office and  raise our hands and pledge allegiance to the Constitution, and that is  vote. Vote on an issue that will help the people of this great Nation  out: People who have been neglected, more than 3 million who have paid  in all their lives and get below-poverty-level checks; millennials and  Gen Xers, who are going to need Social Security even more than the  10,000 baby boomers a day who become eligible for Social Security. The  time to act is now.   Let's heed the words of Martin Luther King and understand the  ``fierce urgency of now'' so that people won't have to put food back on  the shelves that they can't afford or be turned  [[Page H4875]]  back from the drugs that they need to purchase and that they have a  quality of life that they richly deserve in the wealthiest nation in  the world.   We can pay for this all by just simply raising the cap on people over  $400,000. Those wealthy people can afford to pay the same level that  people making $50,000. It is long overdue. The time to act is now.                            ____________________
