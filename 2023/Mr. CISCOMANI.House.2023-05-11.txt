 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud product of the  American Dream. I became a U.S. citizen in 2006, and today, 17 years  later, I stand here as a Member of the United States Congress.   I also stand here as a representative of southeastern Arizona. What  is happening at the border is not part of the American Dream my family  pursued and thousands of other families continue to pursue.   We have seen babies abandoned in rivers, migrants dying in deserts,  high-speed car chases through neighborhoods, and 85,000 children  disappear after being released from HHS custody.   We have a border crisis, a humanitarian crisis, and on the front  lines are our border communities. Americans have been failed by the  government designed to protect them.   While our country suffers because of this administration's inaction,  House Republicans have proposed a solution. H.R. 2 gives our agents and  officers the resources they desperately need, closes loopholes in an  abused asylum system, and protects innocent children from harm.   This bill is a step away from the chaos we are seeing and a step  closer to helping others achieve the American Dream I have been so  blessed to live.                                time  1200
