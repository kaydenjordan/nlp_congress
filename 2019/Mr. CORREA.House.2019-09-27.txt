 Madam Speaker, I want everyone to join me in  congratulating the Chapman University, in my district, men's baseball  team and head coach, Scott Laverty, for winning the NCAA Division III  Baseball Tournament.   Congratulations, Panthers.   This is their third national championship--the first one in 1968,  second one in 2003. In 2011, they were runner-up, and in 2019, here  they are.   California's 46th Congressional District is the home of champs.  Please join me in congratulating Chapman University Panthers on a job  well done.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
