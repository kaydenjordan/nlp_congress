 Madam President, reserving the right to object.    Madam President, I am glad to see my distinguished  friend from Vermont of many years, and what I would like to say to him  is that we, all together, appropriated a record amount of $3 trillion-- another $3 trillion in credit--most of which, much of which has not  even been spent yet, and some of which hasn't been distributed to  States yet. We are in the midst of reviewing the spending of that  money. I know our own committee has had five hearings this month on  COVID and its consequences, and I think the wiser course with the  taxpayers' money is to wait until the $3 trillion we have appropriated  has been distributed to States, has been spent, and is carefully  reviewed. In the meantime, we will work very closely with our friends  on the other side to determine what else needs to be done during the  month of July. So I object.
