 Mr. Speaker, that was such a beautiful 1-minute speech,  it is hard to follow it. It was such a great thing to say.   This morning when I got up, I read a column by one of the talking  heads around here saying that there was a fictional war on Christmas,  and I thought I might address the issue with my 1-minute speech.   There may or may not be a war on Christmas around here, but there is  certainly a war on putting Christ in Christmas, and I am going to  comment on the background music that we hear throughout the Christmas  season.   In Washington, D.C., we have WASH, a typical radio station around the  country. From 4 o'clock in the morning until 1 o'clock this afternoon,  the only song that they played that mentioned Christ was ``God Rest You  Merry, Gentlemen.''   This is corporate America at its best. They have a list of their 50  favorite songs for Christmas, and ``God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen'' was  50. They managed to find 49 great songs that didn't mention Christ.   If you get around shopping, Kohl's department store, and whatnot, Mr.  Speaker, you will again and again hear the music background leaving out  ``Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,'' ``Joy to the World,'' ``O Come, All  Ye Faithful''--all the songs that people my age grew up with.    I would hope that America will step forward and be aware of this and  demand more of corporate America.   I finally would like to thank Sheboygan North High School in my  district for playing ``Joy to the World'' and ``Away in a Manger'' in  the Christmas parade.                            ____________________
