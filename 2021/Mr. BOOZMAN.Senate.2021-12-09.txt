 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  100th birthday of World War II veteran Leville Stephens.   I am proud to celebrate this milestone and honor his service and  sacrifice in our Nation's uniform.   Mr. Stephens answered the call to serve. He trained at Fort Huachuca  in Arizona, one of 30,0000 African-American soldiers who prepared for  battle at this location before deploying overseas. He was assigned to  the 93rd Infantry Division and shipped to the Pacific theater.   As a private first class, Mr. Stephens served in a number of  dangerous locations during the war, including the Philippines, New  Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. He was on his way to Japan when the  United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, bringing about the  Japanese surrender.   Mr. Stephens described his mindset while in uniform as simply ``doing  his  [[Page S9092]]  duty as a soldier.'' He believed his job was to follow his orders and  do what needed to be done. That attitude, shared by so many of his  fellow soldiers among the Greatest Generation, helped the United States  achieve victory and secure a desperately needed peace.   He is rightfully proud of his service, alongside his family and  friends among whom he also inspires admiration and gratitude by being a  devoted husband to his wife Hattie and a dutiful father and  grandfather.   Mr. Stephens is a true American hero whose determination and  dedication helped change the course of history. He answered his  country's call to arms with courage, bravery, and honor. Our Nation  owes him a debt of gratitude for his efforts to defend the freedoms we  hold dear and defeat tyranny around the globe.   I am honored to recognize his serve and sacrifice, and wish him a  very special and wonderful 100th birthday.                            ____________________
