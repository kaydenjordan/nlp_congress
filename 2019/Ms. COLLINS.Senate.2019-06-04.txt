 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    As the senior Republican woman in the Senate today, I am  pleased to begin a series of speeches, along with my good friend from  California, the senior Democratic woman Senator, Mrs. Dianne Feinstein,  to commemorate a significant milestone in our Nation's history. One  hundred years ago today, the Senate finally passed the 19th Amendment,  which affirmed the right of women to vote in elections.   All of us recall that in 1775, as the Second Continental Congress was  forging a new Nation conceived in liberty, Abigail Adams admonished her  husband John to ``remember the ladies.'' Despite Abigail Adam's advice,  it took nearly a century and a half for women to achieve their rightful  place as full U.S. citizens.   On June 4, 1919, the U.S. Senate passed the 19th Amendment to our  Constitution. The courage and determination exhibited by generations of  women and men were rewarded in just two sentences:         The rights of citizens of the United States to vote shall       not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any       State on account of sex. Congress shall have the power to       enforce this article by appropriate legislation.    That is it. Those are the words of the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing  women the right to vote.   It is an honor today to join my 24 women Senate colleagues in  cosponsoring a resolution commemorating this centennial. The yellow  roses that we are wearing are a historic and enduring symbol of the  victory that we celebrate today.   It has often been said, as Emerson put it, that ``there is properly  no history; only biography.'' The story of women's suffrage is an  anthology of remarkable biographies.   Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott led the Seneca Falls  Convention of 1848. This marked the first time that American women  formally demanded the vote. The convention produced the landmark  Declaration of Sentiments. Using the Declaration of Independence as a  template, it states: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident: That  all men and women are created equal.''   The early women's rights movement was closely linked to the abolition  of slavery. Lucretia Mott made her position clear. She said:         ``I have no idea of submitting tamely to injustice       inflicted either on me or on the slave. I will oppose it with       all the moral powers with which I am endowed.''    Among the most vigorous advocates of women's suffrage were those who  knew too well the lash of oppression, the escaped slaves Frederick  Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and Harriet Tubman.   Another very important incident in the march of history occurred in  1872. Susan B. Anthony and 14 other women in Rochester, New York,  illegally voted in that year's Presidential election. They were  promptly arrested. Susan B. Anthony was put on trial, convicted, and  ordered to pay a fine of $100 or face imprisonment. Imagine--for  voting.   She bravely refused, saying that she would never submit to this  ``high-handed outrage upon my citizen's rights.'' The authorities  wisely chose not to pursue collecting the fine.   Suffrage leaders realized that nothing short of a constitutional  amendment would do--one modelled after the 15th Amendment, which  granted the vote to all men regardless of race.   With new leaders--such as Carrie Chapman Catt and, later, Alice  Paul--stepping forward, a strategy was developed to use every peaceful  instrument to change the hearts and minds of political leaders and the  public. In addition to marches, rallies, and petitions, they enlisted  the power of the pulpit and the press in their just cause.   It took more than four decades for this strategy to succeed, and  strong Maine women played key roles. Katherine Reed Balentine, the  daughter of the legendary Speaker of the House of Representatives,  Thomas Brackett Reed, led the Maine Woman Suffrage Association. Author  and activist Florence Brooks Whitehouse became a nationally known  suffrage organizer and offered these words to opponents of this cause:  ``This you must know; the world is mine, as yours.''   I am proud to report that when the 19th Amendment came to the Senate  floor on that historic day, exactly 100 years ago, both of Maine's  Senators, Republicans Bert Fernald and Frederick Hale, were among the  56 voting in favor. Following Senate passage, all  [[Page S3189]]  that remained was for 36 of the 48 States to vote for ratification.   Maine became the 19th State to ratify the 19th Amendment, but it  wasn't easy. An earlier popular referendum on women's suffrage in Maine  got clobbered at the polls by a margin of nearly 2 to 1. Of course,  women were not allowed to vote on their own future, which obviously  skewed the results.   Recognizing the inherent unfairness of the situation, Maine's  Republican Governor, Carl Milliken, called an emergency session of the  State legislature and ushered the measure through by a vote of 72 to  68.    By the summer of 1920, only one more State was needed to reach the  magic number of 36. The Nation's eyes were on the State of Tennessee,  where the amendment was before the legislature. The outlook was  discouraging. After two rollcall votes, suffrage opponents, who wore  red roses on their lapels, were in a dead heat with the yellow rose  supporters. If the measure failed to pass in Tennessee, the 19th  Amendment would not be ratified.   At the last possible moment, the youngest Tennessee lawmaker, Harry  Burn, despite the red rose that he wore--which indicated you were in  opposition--cast his vote in favor of ratification.   After evading an angry mob by climbing out of a third floor window in  the Maine Capitol Building and hiding in the attic, Representative Burn  explained that he changed his mind after he received a letter from his  mother, telling him: ``Don't forget to be a good boy'' and to do the  right thing.   I am sure the Presiding Officer is very familiar with this story.   One of my inspirations in public service, Maine Senator Margaret  Chase Smith, once addressed the question of what is a woman's proper  place. Her famous short answer was this: ``Everywhere.''   The rest of her answer describes the importance of the struggle and  the success that we celebrate today. She said: ``If there is any proper  place for women today, it is that of alert and responsible citizens in  the fullest sense of the word.''   It is a great pleasure to join my colleagues--particularly the senior  Democratic woman Senator, Dianne Feinstein of California--in saluting  those great, courageous, and persistent women who, over many long  decades and through much difficulty, guided our Nation to that proper  place by giving women the long, overdue right to be full citizens in  this country--the right to vote.   Madam President, it is now my great pleasure to yield to my friend  and distinguished colleague, Senator Feinstein.    Madam President, I thank the Senator from California for  her remarks and yield time now to the Senator from Illinois, Ms.  Duckworth.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I recognize the Senator from Alaska,  Ms. Murkowski.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for her  eloquent comments.   I now yield to Senator Murray.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her good remarks  today.   I am very pleased to yield time to the Senator from Tennessee, Mrs.  Blackburn.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for  giving us such a great history lesson, and I appreciate her remarks.   Next on our list of speakers is Senator Ernst followed by Senator  Shaheen.   I yield to Senator Ernst of Iowa.    Mr. President, before I yield to my friend and neighbor  from New Hampshire, I recognize, in the back of the Chamber, a truly  extraordinary woman, an outstanding former U.S. Senator who served in  this Chamber from 1987 to 2017, some 30 years, Senator Barbara Mikulski  of Maryland. She has served on the Commission that has worked very hard  to make sure we commemorate this centennial of women's suffrage, and  she has been a mentor and friend to all of us who had the pleasure of  serving with her.   I welcome Senator Mikulski back to the U.S. Senate, which was her  home for so many years and where she still has so many friends and  admirers, of whom I count myself one.    The Chair is a very wise man.   Now I yield to Senator Jeanne Shaheen.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire,  and it is now my pleasure to yield time to the Senator from Nebraska,  Mrs. Fischer.    Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Nebraska  for her very kind comments and her eloquent remarks, and I am now  pleased to yield time to the Senator from Wisconsin, Ms. Baldwin.    Mr. President, I am now pleased to yield to the Senator  from Maryland, Mr. Cardin.    Mr. President, I am pleased to yield to the Senator from  Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar.    Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from West  Virginia, Mrs. Capito.    Madam President, earlier, I recognized Senator Barbara  Mikulski, an outstanding leader and former colleague and member of the  Women's Suffrage Centennial Commission. I also want to acknowledge that  there are other members of the Commission who are here with us today.  We welcome them as they observe this debate, and we thank them for  their hard work to make sure this significant occasion is recognized.   It is now my great pleasure to yield time to the Senator from  Washington, Senator Cantwell.    Madam President, I simply want to thank my colleagues  for their participation today in bringing to the attention of the  American people that this truly is a historic occasion, a date on which  we celebrate the Senate's passage of the 19th Amendment granting women  a long-overdue right to vote. I want to thank all of my colleagues who  participated in the speeches. The history they brought from their  individual States was fascinating indeed.   It is my understanding that we will now move to pass commemorative  coin legislation introduced by the Senator from Tennessee.   I yield the floor.
