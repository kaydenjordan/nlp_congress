 Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the innocent  lives lost as a result of Roe v. Wade.   It has now been 44 years since the Supreme Court made this  unconstitutional ruling, and over that period of time, more than 58  million--I repeat, over 58 million--children have had their God-given  right to life denied. Every single one of these lives was important and  unique, and we grieve this loss.   At the same time, we celebrate the fact that, increasingly, our  culture recognizes the value of human life. A poll released last year  found that a majority of young Americans support increasing  restrictions that protect the unborn. Another recent poll found that 61  percent of Americans oppose using tax dollars to fund abortions in the  United States.   I agree with them, and that is why I support the No Taxpayer Funding  for Abortion Act that we voted on earlier today. I am pleased that it  passed the House, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly  consider this important bill.   But we must not stop there. We must work to ensure that taxpayer  dollars do not continue to support the abortion industry, including  Planned Parenthood, our Nation's largest abortion provider.   Additionally, we must encourage the new administration to nominate a  Justice to the Supreme Court who follows the Constitution and respects  the most basic and fundamental right of every human being born and  unborn: the right to life.   As a father of three young daughters, these issues are personal for  me. During my time in Congress, I will stand up for those who cannot  stand up for themselves. I will protect and defend human life and  advance these deep- and long-held values upon which our Nation was  founded.
