 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this en  bloc amendment. I want to thank Mr. Quigley for working with Members  from both sides of the aisle here to pull together a combination of 15  different concepts and amendments that we have included in this one  amendment here and six of which are Republican amendments. So I  appreciate Mr. Quigley's cooperation as we work through these issues  that are important to all of us.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Kustoff), who is offering an amendment that is included in the en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Steil), one of our newest Members, who would like  to speak on his amendment.    Mr. Chair, again, I thank the chairman of the  subcommittee. He has done a wonderful job putting together 15 good  amendments that we can all agree on, and I yield back the balance of my  time.  [[Page H5179]]         Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.   This is another en bloc amendment, and, unlike the one we spoke on  previously, this is purely a partisan amendment with really no  reflection of a bipartisan tone whatsoever. In fact, it is really  nothing more than a partisan attack on the administration and an  attempt to make their lives a little bit more difficult, which we see  every day around this place.   It would be nice if the other side would recognize that the  administration needs certain resources and needs access to those  resources in order to carry out the functions of their job, just like  we do here.   Mr. Chair, because of those reasons, I object to the amendment,  encourage a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment, and not in opposition to Mr. Connolly in any way. I know  that he is representing his district, his constituents, and his  interests in OPM doing their job and doing it well. But there are some  challenges.   There is no doubt OPM has made it clear they want to perform their  duties and their function, but in order to do that, they must  reorganize. They must modernize. They must update themselves as an  agency and an organization.   We are seeing that across all agencies, but this one in particular  needs some assistance.   Mr. Chairman, I will add, their current funding, where they are  today, is  [[Page H5185]]  what is driving them to this decision to make this notice that, if  things don't improve, they really don't have any other choice but to  furlough individuals. Their option is to reorganize.   But why are we in this position? It is because of the conference  committee report earlier this year. The Financial Services bill was a  part of the conference committee report. You will recall that.   Maybe the focus was more on homeland security and on border walls and  border security and other things, but this bill was a part of that. As  a result of the product that came out of this body under the new  majority, it was insufficient for OPM. Therefore, they are having to  forewarn of decisions they are going to have to make.    But we should give them credit. They are looking for an alternative,  and that is to reorganize, to change, to modernize, to update.   But do you know what, Mr. Chairman? In this bill, the underlying  bill--not this amendment--they are prohibited from protecting these  jobs. As a result of this bill, under this majority, they are  prohibited from protecting the jobs.   Now an amendment comes all the way back around the other end to say:  Wait. You can't do what you want to do to protect those jobs, and you  can't fire anybody. You can't furlough anybody. You can't reorganize.   What are they to do? What are they to do?   So I heard a really nice argument for this amendment, but I really  didn't hear a solution for OPM.   It would be nice that, if we are going to micromanage--and I think we  heard a great quote yesterday: ``Just because you can micromanage  doesn't mean you have to.'' But if we are, maybe we should provide some  guidance and some assistance.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the leader's  comments. He is an observant Member, been here for many years. He has  seen how government operates. And, quite frankly, there have not been  too many examples of the consolidation of government agencies.   But in a time of technology and advancements and modernization, I  think government could merge some things together, could find some  synergies, could save some dollars; and in this economy that we are  experiencing today, what better time to do that?   The unemployment rate is at the lowest it has been in 51 years.  Allowing others to experience that opportunity of growth and wealth  throughout the economy and additional job opportunities, take their  skills somewhere else, that is great.   But that is not really what OPM wants to do. They are being forced to  do that because of last year's--or earlier this year, the inadequacy of  a funding bill that put them in this position. It was the first big  test of this new majority, and, unfortunately, it put these agencies in  a tough spot.                                time  1300    The only choice is to come up with other ideas and solutions, and  that is, maybe we have to reorganize, maybe we have to modernize, but  certainly we have to analyze how we can serve the American people  better. In some cases, that might mean we can be leaner, more  efficient, and more effective, and that might mean merging different  agencies together and creating some new synergies.   Mr. Chair, with that, I will oppose the amendment and ask others to  do the same. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.                     Amendment No. 32 Offered by Ms. Dean     Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at  the desk.    Yes, Mr. Speaker, in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, while I don't support this  underlying bill, I thought I would take a different approach with this  MTR today.   We are heading into a long break. We are going to be separated from  one another, and I thought it would be nice if we just thanked the  other side for some of the things they have done in this bill.   First, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friends on the left for  including and codifying Hyde-like protections for the innocent unborn.  With this vote today, it is encouraging that our friends on the other  side of the aisle do agree--they do agree--that the lives of the  innocent unborn deserve our protection, and that is in the underlying  bill today.   I would also like to thank my friends for their strong stand against  the growing threat and spread of socialism around the world and  recognizing that democracy is the answer. That is in this bill. Thank  you, Mr. Speaker.   I am glad that we came together in favor of boosting States' rights,  standing behind the 10th Amendment for all of our States when it comes  to banking for certain small businesses. That is in this bill, Mr.  Speaker. Thank you.   Lastly, let me thank my friends on the other side for recognizing the  hard work and dedication of our Federal employees. The majority leader  has allowed the 2.6 percent cost-of-living adjustment, a pay raise, to  stay in this bill.   Yes, Mr. Speaker, that raise does extend to all Members of this  House. That took courage from the majority leader, and we want to thank  him before we leave here this week. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   That is not what the MTR is about, but we just wanted to say ``thank  you'' for a moment.   This MTR focuses on one major bipartisan issue, Mr. Speaker: keeping  us out of war and enforcing sanctions, sanctions against Iran, North  Korea, Venezuela, Russia, and others which seek to harm our Nation.   I can think of no one better that I could yield to at this moment to  discuss the importance of this MTR than a Green Beret who has served in  multiple combat missions around the world, has 20 years of service in  the U.S. Army, an American hero, our colonel of the Army,  Mike Waltz  from Florida.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Waltz).  [[Page H5195]]         Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
