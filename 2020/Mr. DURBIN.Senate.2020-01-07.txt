 Madam President, this morning, the Republican majority  leader took to the floor and spoke at great length about the execution  of General Soleimani. General Soleimani, who was the head of the  military forces in Iran, was killed by a drone strike at the  authorization of the President of the United States, Donald Trump.   Senator McConnell, this morning, made a lengthy case about the  background of General Soleimani. It is hard to argue with the facts he  brought to the floor. In fact, I would concede and most would agree  that General Soleimani, in his time, was an architect of terrorism and  that, in the course of his career, there has been American blood on his  hands. That is fact, but it wasn't a fact just discovered in the last  few weeks. The Presidents of both political parties have known this  about General Soleimani for a long period of time. They have had  opportunities to end his life, yet they didn't seize those  opportunities. Presidents of both parties decided it was prudent not to  do it.   The question that has been raised now is why this President, at this  moment, made the decision to execute the general. We know this general  and his past activity have had an impact not only on the United States  but on the Middle East and many other innocent people. The question  that has been raised is, Why at this moment? Why did it make sense at  this moment?   But for a few Members of the Senate, most of us have not had  extensive briefings or an opportunity to ask questions of this  administration about the timing of this critical decision. We will get  our chance tomorrow. There is a classified briefing in which  representatives at the highest level of this administration will come  before us and explain why they believe the President's decision at that  moment was the right thing to do for America. So many of those who come  to the floor and defend the decision or criticize those who question  that decision really have not had the benefit of a classified briefing,  which will be offered to Members tomorrow.   I am going to withhold any comments about those elements, as much as  I can possibly say publicly, until I get the chance to have more  information. But this much I do know: Regardless of that decision on  General Soleimani, we know for certain the Constitution of the United  States empowers the American people, through their elected  Representatives in the Senate and the House, to make the ultimate  decision about whether the United States will go to war with Iran or  any other country on Earth. We have learned, bitterly, that the  ignorance or refusal of Congress to exercise that constitutional right  can be disastrous.   Many of us have memories of the war in Vietnam, where 58,000 American  lives were lost, 2 million Vietnamese were killed, and $170 billion-- now, in today's terms, $1 trillion--was spent on a conflict that  divided America and cost so many American lives. Congress did not  exercise the authority given to it under the Constitution to make the  initial decision about that war in Vietnam. Many times thereafter,  people said: Why didn't you step up and make the decision before this  costly mistake was made?   If there is to be a war with Iran, I join with Senator Kaine of  Virginia in saying that the American people, once again, need to make  this decision under the Constitution through Congress, article I,  section 8, which provides, in clause 11, that only Congress has the  power to declare war.   If we are going to proceed down a path to war with Iran, the American  people have the right to know and the right to hear the fulsome debate.  In the time I have served in the Senate, I have seen Presidents in the  past who have come before the American people with flimsy evidence or  even misleading evidence to justify military action. I know the bitter  consequences of war. Even the best American troops are going to suffer  casualties and deaths in the execution of a war.   Let us make certain that if we are going to move forward with  hostilities against Iran, we do it under our constitutional requirement  to have a fulsome debate before the American people and have an  official declaration of war before we move forward. We owe the American  people nothing less.    Let me read one paragraph from Commander Oxford:         As veterans are aggressively targeted due to their service       to our country, they must be afforded the right to group       relief. The Department of Education's ``Borrower Defense''       rule eliminates this right, forcing veterans to individually       prove their claim, share the specific type of financial harm       they suffered, and prove the school knowingly made       substantial misrepresentations. The preponderance of evidence       required for this process is so onerous that the Department       of Education itself estimated that only 3 percent of       applicants would get relief.    Whether you are a Democrat or Republican, don't go waving that flag  and tell everybody how much you love our veterans and ignore this  letter. The leader of the largest veterans group in the United States  of America--a nonpartisan group--told us these schools exploited  veterans, and Secretary DeVos's new rule means that these veterans will  never get relief. Ninety-seven percent will never get any relief.   In a matter of a few days--maybe weeks--I will be calling this matter  to the floor. I am asking my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  put the party labels outside, hang them up in the cloakroom, come on  inside here, and stand up for students across America who did their  best to get a college education and were deceived in the process, stand  up for students who were loaded up with student debt, which could  destroy their lives, and give them a fighting chance for a future by  saying that Secretary DeVos's borrower defense rule is unfair to  veterans, unfair to students, and unfair to American families.   I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the right thing  when the time comes and give these borrowers a second chance at being  financially independent Americans who can contribute to their families  and our national economic growth. For our veterans, please join me in  making sure that Secretary DeVos's borrower defense rule is disapproved  by both the House and the Senate.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Cardin), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator  from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.
