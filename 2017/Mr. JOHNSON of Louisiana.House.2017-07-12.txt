 Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak on the  National Defense Authorization Act being considered this evening and on  my amendment No. 22 to require an Army cyber training readiness  assessment.   It is vital that we adequately fund our military with the necessary  training and tools they need to succeed. Our men and women in uniform  deserve the greatest amount of resources we can possibly provide at all  times.   If agreed to, my amendment requires the Army to review the combat  training centers, or CTCs, and the resident cyber capabilities and  training to make certain the needs of prerotational cyber training are  fully met.   These CTCs' rotations serve as the premier events to evaluate  collective training, and the rotations provide feedback to commanders  on how well they have trained their units and their leaders and what  they need to do to improve readiness.   Including cyber training is a commonsense step to meet the threats  our Nation will face. The Army has testified before Congress that this  area is falling short and additional resources are desperately needed  for cyber training.   Our Armed Forces must be able to operate within highly defended  environments, possibly at the leading edge of a joint force, to control  the air, sea, space, and cyberspace domain. My amendment will assist us  in this endeavor, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
