 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bay County Deputy  Sheriff Mike Clancy for his heroic efforts in  [[Page H3160]]  saving the life of a 6-year-old boy in Panama City Beach.   Deputy Clancy recently responded to a drowning call at a hotel to  find an unresponsive child. He immediately took action, and his quick  thinking and response saved young Jaxon's life.   Deputy Clancy said in his own words that he is not a hero, but to  Jaxon and to his family, he is a hero.   Deputy Clancy attributes his skills to 22 years in the U.S. Army and  training at the Bay County Sheriff's Office.   Every day, despite great personal risks, law enforcement officers  across the country put on their uniforms and carry out their duties to  protect and serve. Mr. Speaker, I thank Deputy Clancy and all who wear  the badge. Their actions reflect great credit on the Bay County  Sheriff's Office and exemplify the best in the American people.                            ____________________
