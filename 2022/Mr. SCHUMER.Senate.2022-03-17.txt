 Madam President, first, I see that you and many on the  podium are decked in green. Happy St. Patrick's Day to all of you and  to all of America.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have an announcement to make for the  information of Senators. In a few moments, I will take the next  procedural step to advance the jobs and competitiveness legislation so  important to so many of us in this Chamber.   Last summer, the Senate passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill that  will bring manufacturing jobs back to America, fix supply chains, fuel  scientific research, and ultimately lower costs by a significant  amount. The bipartisan bill will be great news for our economy, our  entrepreneurs, our innovators, and especially families who are feeling  the sting because of the chip shortage.   We all know the chip shortage is hurting so many people. It is  hurting the auto industry that has had to temporarily shut down  factories. It has hurt our tech industry, our healthcare industry, and  so many others. So let's solve this quickly.   In order to go to conference, the Senate needs to amend the House- passed COMPETES bill with the Senate-passed U.S. Innovation and  Competition Act and send it back to the House. That is what we will aim  to do next week as quickly as we can.   Again, this jobs and supply chains legislation will help lower costs.  Let us have bipartisan cooperation on this bill. Now, despite cloture,  it is far better for Democrats and Republicans to reach an agreement to  vote on this bill quickly, and we will keep working on that over the  next few days.   It is regrettable that a small band of Republicans are determined to  stand in the way of quick action after all the good work we have done  in recent weeks passing bipartisan legislation. Let's add to that tally  by quickly passing this bill. Creating jobs, lowering costs, and fixing  supply chains shouldn't be partisan, and I hope to see an agreement to  expedite this process soon. In the meantime, the process is moving  forward.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 282,  H.R. 4521.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, March 17, be waived and that  following the 1:45 p.m. vote, the Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, due to the current events happening in  Europe, the Republican leader and I have agreed to increase the  membership to the Senate NATO Observer Group by two additional  Senators. The additional Democratic Senator will be named at a later  date.                            ____________________
