 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of America's  50 million seniors who rely on Medicare.   Medicare ensures Americans aged 65 and older have guaranteed health  coverage, protecting countless families from bankruptcy, ensuring our  seniors can enjoy retirement and pass on life's lessons to their  grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   The Medicare Board of Trustees announced on Tuesday the program's  trust fund will be exhausted by 2026, 3 years earlier than last year's  announcement.   Eight years ago, Congress and the Obama administration worked  together to extend Medicare solvency by 12 years when we passed the  Affordable Care Act.   Medicare's solvency is now threatened by policy passed by the current  Republican majority and enacted by President Trump.   2026 is 8 years away. We should be extending the life of Medicare,  not threatening it.   Mr. Speaker, this is not acceptable. America's seniors deserve  better. Congress should take action and protect the Medicare guarantee  for today's and tomorrow's seniors.                            ____________________
