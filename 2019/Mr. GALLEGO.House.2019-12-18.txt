 Madam Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``YEA'' on rollcall No. 694.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, today I will vote to impeach President  Donald Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.   Those still defending the President's actions are desperately  grasping at straws while living in an alternate universe where facts do  not exist.                                time  1515    To those still unwilling to search their souls, ask yourselves: Would  you support a Democratic President using taxpayer dollars to pressure a  foreign government to investigate a Republican political opponent based  on false Russian conspiracy theories?   Of course not. That is absurd.   Any President who does that has abused the power of the Presidency  for personal gain and undermined our most sacred tradition: our  elections.   In a few hours, every Member will make a choice. Will you fall into  the  [[Page H12159]]  age-old political trap of thinking blind partisanship is all that  matters? Will you vote to defend the Constitution and our democracy so  that President Trump and every future President will know that they are  not above the law and will be held accountable for their actions?   I have made my choice. I hope every Member puts the defense of our  Nation first and joins me.
