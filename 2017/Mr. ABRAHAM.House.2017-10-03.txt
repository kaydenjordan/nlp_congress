 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my support to the  Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   This legislation is crucial toward protecting the most vulnerable  among us: the unborn.   As a doctor, it is my job to stay current with the latest medical  research, and I have done so in my job in Congress, too.   The research overwhelmingly shows that children 20 weeks or less are  capable of showing pain. This is brought forth by the fact that when an  in-utero procedure is done, both the mother and the unborn child are  given anesthesia. Not to do so allows that child to recoil in pain and  show a stress response in the uterus.   I have heard, personally, as a physician, heartbeats in babies as  early as 6 weeks of age in utero.   So this legislation is critical, it is needed, it is past due, and I  urge my colleagues to support this.                            ____________________
