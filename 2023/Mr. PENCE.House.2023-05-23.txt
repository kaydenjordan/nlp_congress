 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two fallen Hoosier  police officers who were killed in the line of duty while serving our  community last year.   Noah Shahnavaz of Elwood and Seara Burton of Richmond were honored  for National Police Week this year, and their names were added to the  National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial right here in Washington,  D.C.   Noah was a 5-year Army veteran and had been with the police  department for 11 months. Seara was a 4-year member of the Wayne County  Police Department and was the first female canine officer in the  department's history.   We will never forget Noah and Seara's service and sacrifice to our  Indiana community and our entire Nation.   May our brave fallen police officers rest in peace.                         Congratulating Ms. Munjuluri     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ms. Munjuluri, a  junior at Columbus North High School, on winning the State of Indiana  Poetry Out Loud Competition and then going on to become the 2023 Poetry  Out Loud National Champion.   She has truly made Indiana's Sixth District proud, and she has a  bright future ahead.   I congratulate Ms. Munjuluri, and I wish her the best of luck in all  her future professional and personal endeavors.                        Honoring Officer Dustin Moody     Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I would like to honor  Officer Dustin Moody on the House floor.   Officer Moody was seriously injured in the line of duty, paralyzing  him from the waist down just last year.   Before his injury, he had been serving in law enforcement for 10  years and had been with the Trafalgar Police Department since December  2020.   Throughout his career as a police officer, Officer Moody was  dedicated to protecting our communities in Johnson County, Indiana.   God bless Officer Moody, and I thank all our brave Hoosier police  officers for their service.                  Recognizing the 317 Ryders Motorcycle Club     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 317 Ryders  Motorcycle Club, which is a group of motorcyclists in Shelby County,  Indiana, for the philanthropic work that they do.   Since they were founded in 2002, the 317 Ryders Motorcycle Club's  mission has been to provide fun motorcycle rides for its members while  at the same time giving back to the Hoosier community.   I thank the 317 Ryders Motorcycle Club for all the funding and  volunteering work that they do for Indiana's Sixth District, and I look  forward to seeing what more the 317 group does.                               Energy Concerns     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise concerns with the EPA's  newest attempt to create the Clean Power Plan 2.0.   By setting unattainable emission targets and relying on untested  technologies, this rule will raise utility bills and threaten the  reliability of our electric grid. Once again, EPA is driving out  affordable baseload power plants to fulfill their rush to their green  agenda.   We are already seeing a reliability crisis play out across the  country, and EPA is doubling down on their attempts to regulate fossil  fuels out of existence.   It is past time for this administration to face reality and put our  Nation on a sustainable path forward to keep the lights on.                        Green Agenda Will Raise Costs     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness of the  direction of this administration's American energy strategy.   Just last week, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation  again raised alarms about potential blackouts this summer.   The administration is making a bad situation worse by continuing to  roll out unattainable and unworkable emission standards. At the same  time, agencies are forcing electrification of everything from cars to  stoves.  [[Page H2506]]    Mr. Speaker, this rush to a green agenda will raise the costs to turn  the lights on, cook your meals, or heat your homes. Hoosiers and all  Americans will be the ones to foot the bill for an incoherent energy  strategy.                            ____________________
