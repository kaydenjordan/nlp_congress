 Madam Speaker, I call on my Republican colleagues today  to stop holding our Nation's economy hostage.   It is dangerous, and it is unconscionable knowing the devastating  impact it is going to have on American working families.   Kim from Van Buren Township in my district called my office yesterday  scared. She is in the process of buying a house and thinks she should  stop because she is worried that the Nation's economy is going to tank.   She reflects the American people and their concerns, but Republicans  will be posting messages of support for veterans on social media this  weekend  [[Page H2621]]  while advocating for a plan that will abandon all of those veterans and  their families at the moment they need their country most.   I am staying. I am missing my goddaughter's wedding because I have a  job to do.   Where are Republicans?                            ____________________
