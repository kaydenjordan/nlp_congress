 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Carrie  Barnette, a woman who was known for her love of pickles, hummingbirds,  and willingness to help others.   Carrie loved country music, and she grew up listening to it at her  grandparents' house. She frequently went to country music concerts and  had traveled to the Route 91 Harvest music festival with her childhood  friend, Jenn.  [[Page H8607]]    Carrie was a lifelong Californian who had just celebrated her 10th  anniversary as a culinary team member at Disney California Adventure in  Anaheim.   Carrie loved the children of her relatives and friends like her own,  and friends say that she would have made a great mother. She also had  the nickname of Aunt Carrie because all the children loved her.   I would also like to extend my condolences to Carrie's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
