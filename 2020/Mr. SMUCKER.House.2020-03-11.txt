 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory  of Mrs. Susie Schlomann of Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, who suddenly  passed away unexpectedly last week.   Mr. Speaker, after Pennsylvania's Congressional District boundaries  changed, I had the privilege to represent southern York County. I  quickly came to know Susie. Susie was passionate and proud of her  conservative, political beliefs, volunteering much of her time  furthering the causes which she supported, and she was never shy to  share her thoughts about what was happening here in Washington.   Susie came to Shrewsbury from Long Island, where she raised her  family, including her three children, Tristan, Ted, and Rebecca, and  where, in 1978, she married the love of her life, her late husband,  Rick. In addition to her three children, Susie is survived by five  grandchildren, her brother Andrew, and her sister, Amanda.   Mr. Speaker, we wish all those who are grieving, comfort. And we give  thanks for having had the opportunity to know Susie, who filled so many  people's lives with happiness.                            ____________________
