 Good morning.   Barbara, thank you very much. It is always a great honor and a real  pleasure to be back here in the House Chamber and especially being here  with friends and so many colleagues. Thank you all for being here.   Let me begin by thanking Speaker McCarthy for inviting our  association into the House Chamber for this annual report. You may  recall that it wasn't that long ago in December when we were here to do  the 2022 report. You may wonder why are we back so soon. Well, the  reason for that is that we are returning to normal. We had changes  during COVID, and now we are back to what we have done for a very long  time. I am so pleased that we are here and so pleased that you all have  joined us.   I want to welcome a very special group of guests who are with us  today. We are very pleased to have more than a dozen of the Irish  Association of Former Parliamentarians and their guests who traveled to  Washington to join our annual meeting. They are led by their  association's president, Mary Flaherty, and they will be with us today  for the activities of the day. They will experience the Gettysburg  battlefield tomorrow and Congressional Baseball Game tonight, which is  a wonderful bipartisan tradition where the Democrats and Republicans  play each other at the Nationals Ballpark. We thank you all so much for  coming a long way to join us, and we are very honored by your presence  here.   Like most of you here, I consider my service in Congress to be the  most important and impactful chapter of my professional life, and the  memories that are evoked standing here in this Chamber are ones that  are really very, very special. I cherish these relationships, and I  cherish the relationships I had with my colleagues and the  congressional staff when I was a Member of Congress.   I am proud of the legislation that I was involved in. There is a  great sense of satisfaction, as you all know, that comes with public  service. That is what I remember most, and that is what I try to  highlight when I speak about our Congress, our Article I branch of the  Constitution.   That is why I am so committed to this organization, the U.S.  Association of Former Members of Congress, because it empowers those of  us who have served to be able to continue to give back. We do so by  both involving Senators and House Members, and more importantly--and  this is really important today, more than a lot of other times--we are  doing this in a completely bipartisan manner. Today, you will hear  members of the Democratic Party and members of the Republican Party  speaking about our organization, the U.S. Former Members of Congress.    We will focus today, my colleagues and I, on two of the main programs  that achieve our mission. First is the Congress to Campus program,  which aims to engage the next generation in representative democracy.  Second are the Congressional Study Groups, which have become an  unparalleled resource to current Members, and they serve to strengthen  our important international relationships with our allied countries,  including Korea, Japan, Germany, the EU, all while fostering  bipartisanship in Congress.   Let me just briefly highlight some of our accomplishments, our  organization's accomplishments, during the first half of this year  before we get to those two main programs. We had a record year this  year for recruiting, with an unprecedented number of new former Members  joining us both as annual members and sustaining members.   Of the Members who left in the last election, more than half have  already joined our organization, and the recruiting process is still  going on. This new class of former Members has yielded our biggest  number yet of new sustaining members, which is a special category of  membership. These folks make financial commitments to ensure the  longevity of FMC, our organization, the Former Members of Congress. I  want to thank all of the former Members who have made this commitment.   I am inserting into the Congressional Record their names to help  express our appreciation and our gratitude.                         Sustaining Members of FMC         The Hon.

Rob Woodall (Georgia)        The Hon. John Yarmuth (Kentucky)        The Hon. Ted Yoho (Florida)     In addition, we have supported the work of the House  Democratic Partnership, so ably led by two of our good friends and  colleagues, David Price and Peter Roskam, both of whom will be with us  today. The HDP aims to support the legislative branches of emerging  democracies and when invited to do so, we involved former Members in  overseas legislative strengthening projects. This year, for instance,  former Members have traveled to places like Kenya, North Macedonia, or  Guyana to support the important work of the HDP.   These are some of the 2023 highlights of two of our three objectives:  teaching about Congress and supporting Congress as an institution. The  third is FMC's original mission: to serve as an alumni group for former  Senators and Representatives. We are aware that this is an important  aspect of our work, and today's annual meeting clearly is a good  example of that work.   In addition, we have hosted author presentations. We have tapped into  our membership's institutional knowledge. For example, during the  recent debt ceiling negotiations, our members held seminars that others  learned from. When the new rules package was adopted by the Congress in  January, we explained to the public what that meant,  [[Page H2896]]  and we have sent former Member delegations overseas to places like  Iceland and Korea.   At this point, I want to give my colleagues an opportunity to talk  more about our two main programming staples that the Former Members of  Congress are rightfully very proud of. They are the Congress to Campus  program, as well as our Congressional Study Groups.   I invite my colleague, Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, to make some  remarks. He will be followed by Loretta Sanchez of California. We will  then hear from Dennis Ross of Florida and Bart Gordon of Tennessee who  will each talk about the Congressional Study Groups.    Bob, Loretta, Dennis, and Bart, thank you very much for  those informative remarks, and thank you very much for all you do for  FMC.   Bart has told you about the important work done by the Congressional  Study Group on Korea. I want to note that the study group is a program  that is exclusively offered to current Members of Congress and current  staff. However, there is a very active former Member program with  Korea, which we call Korea ExDel, that runs in parallel with the study  group.   While wholly separate, both programs strengthen the U.S.-Korean  relationship, and it would not be possible without the tireless work of  two very dear friends of ours, former Member of Congress Jay Kim, who  was the first Korean American elected to Congress, and his wife,  Jennifer Ahn. Both of them are committed to the active and high-level  dialogue involving the U.S. and Korea. Through Jay and Jennifer, we  have sent several delegations to Korea.   I thank them both very much for all that they have made possible and  for their incredible support of FMC as an organization.   I will take this opportunity to include in the Congressional Record a  statement of appreciation for all of their very good work.                                            Wednesday, June 14, 2023      Hon. L.F. Payne,      FMC President of Virginia House of Representatives,     Honoring the Impact of Mr. and Mrs. Jay Kim to U.S.-ROK Relations         Madame Speaker, I rise today to thank our former colleague,       the Honorable Jay Chang Joan Kim (R-CA, 1993-1999) and his       spouse, Mrs. Jennifer Ahn Kim, for their incredibly positive       impact on United States-Republic of Korea bilateral       relations.        A survivor of the Korean War and witness to the birth of       the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance, Mr. Jay Kim was born       1939 in what is now Seoul, South Korea, and notably became       the first Korean American Member of Congress.        After immigrating to the United States, Jay Kim completed       public schools in California and earned his undergraduate       degree in engineering in 1967 and subsequently, his master's       degree in environmental engineering in 1969, both from the       University of Southern California. A shining example of the       American Dream, Mr. Kim founded his own engineering business       with a loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration.       Later, he tried his hand at local government and completed a       PhD in Political Science at Hanyang University in Seoul,       South Korea. In 1992, Mr. Kim handily won the race for the       newly drawn 41st Congressional District in California.        In the 103rd Congress, Mr. Kim was assigned to the House       Public Works and Transportation and Small Business       Committees. He served on the panel for both the 104th and       105th Congresses, where he spoke out against the North Korean       regime. His tenure in the House helped pave the way for more       Korean American Member of Congress to follow. After departing       Congress in 1999, Mr. Kim continued to advance U.S.-ROK       relations as Chair of the Washington Korean-American Forum,       later founding his own organizations to promote the       advancement of U.S.-ROK relations, including the Jay Kim       Foundation.        His wife, Mrs. Jennifer Ahn Kim, serves as Vice President       of the Jay Kim Foundation,  [[Page H2900]]       and has worked diligently for many years to strengthen U.S.-      ROK relations by developing delegations for Former Members of       Congress to South Korea, among numerous other programs. She       most recently has collaborated with the U.S. Association of       Former Members of Congress to help connect Korean government       officials, corporations, and civil society groups with our       membership.        I wish to honor Former Member and Mrs. Jay Kim, for their       years of dedication and hard work to continue fortifying the       relationship between the U.S. and one of our key allies, as       well as for being a great partner to the U.S. Association of       Former Members of Congress. They have had a tremendously       positive impact on the two countries they both love so much:       Korea and the United States, and they are highly deserving of       our recognition and appreciation for all they have       accomplished.     I also thank all of the many volunteers, the former  Members of Congress who make FMC's success possible.   All the work that you have heard about today is done by volunteers  who are former Members of Congress. It is estimated that more than  7,000 hours a year of volunteer time is donated to FMC, enabling us to  carry on what we consider to be this very important work.   In addition to volunteering their time, there are five members of the  Executive Committee, and I thank Barbara Comstock, Donna Edwards,  Dennis Ross, and Charles Boustany for that work.   I thank our Board of Directors, a number of whom are here today.  There are 30 of us on the board, and we certainly appreciate all that  you do. You are really a great board, and you do great work. Thank you  all.   In that vein, we are asking now the membership of FMC to elect the  2023 class of board members to a 3-year term. In the interest of  expediency, I will read their names, four Democrats, four Republicans,  and ask for a vote.   The candidates are:   Russ Carnahan of Missouri,   Val Demings of Florida,   Elizabeth Esty of Connecticut,   Bob Goodlatte of Virginia,   Brenda Lawrence of Michigan,   Peter Roskam of Illinois,   Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, and   Fred Upton of Michigan.   Do I hear a motion and a second?   All in favor, say ``aye.'' Opposed, ``no.'' The ayes have it.   Congratulations, and I thank all eight of you for your willingness to  serve. You will be a great class.   One last thank-you goes, importantly, to the staff of FMC: Pete  Weichlein, who is here with us today; Sabine Schleidt, who is not with  us at the moment; and all the folks who are here who are part of our  FMC staff.   When Pete first came 20 years ago, he was sort of all there was at  FMC. Today, we have 13 very capable staff members, and I would like  them, if they would, to stand. Let's give them a round of applause for  all the good work they do.   Finally, as many of you know, every fall, the FMC organizes a quite  moving memorial service to pay tribute to the current and former  Members who we lost in the previous year. We will do so again in  September, and we hope you will be able to attend that. We are  coordinating with Speaker McCarthy the best date for that to be held,  usually in September in Statuary Hall.   Unfortunately, we have lost a number of our friends and colleagues  since we last gave our report to the Chamber in December.   I include in the Congressional Record the names of these public  servants.     Members Who Have Passed Away Since Sept. 2022 FMC Memorial Service         Standish ``Fletcher'' Thompson of Georgia        James ``Jim'' Florio of New Jersey        Mark Souder of Indiana        Bill Brewster of Oklahoma        William Conover II of Pennsylvania        Gary A.

Thank you very much.   This concludes our report. Let me remind you that, today, we have a  full and exciting program, including tours of the Supreme Court and the  Library of Congress, followed by a luncheon with the Ambassador and the  people of Ukraine. Tonight, we have the Congressional Baseball Game,  and tomorrow is our excursion to Gettysburg.   I want to highlight, too, that all Members and former Members by now  should have received a survey. I would really appreciate it if you  would take the time to complete this. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes,  but it is going to give us a lot of information, not only about your  insights into today's politics, but as we are embarking on a strategic  planning process, this will be very helpful information about what you  think is important for us to be doing over the next 5 years.   With that, I conclude my remarks, and I thank the Speaker for giving  our association the opportunity to return to this place, which we  cherish very much. Thank you all.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Caribbean American  Heritage Month. It is a great time to celebrate the contributions of  Caribbean Americans to this country.   It is a culture known for delicious food and drinks, such as Jamaican  jerk chicken and the Cuban mojito, which is a drink that is wonderfully  tasty. Caribbean artists brought influential music to America, such as  reggae and calypso.   Some of our greatest Americans have Caribbean roots. Alexander  Hamilton, America's first Treasury Secretary, was born in the  Caribbean. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell was the son of  Jamaican immigrants. Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman to be  elected to Congress and run for President, was the daughter of an  immigrant from Barbados.   Today, Caribbean Americans are making a difference across the  country, and we celebrate all of them this month.                            ____________________
