 Mr. Speaker, it was said by our friends on the other  side of the aisle that this censure motion is profoundly stupid. What  is profoundly stupid is an adult man, who has been elected as a Member  of Congress, held to a high esteem, pulling a fire alarm like a child,  like throwing a tantrum. What is worse is that he violated the law. He  broke the law when he did it.                                time  1800    It wasn't just something to say, oh, I am sorry. He broke the law  because he wanted to obstruct the meeting of this body, the vote of  this body. The January 6 individuals have been talked about. If someone  had done that on January 6, they would have been put in jail. The  American people know it.   They see that there is a double standard. They see that this side of  the aisle cleans up its House. The other side is going to let people  who have committed crimes continue to sit in office.   The other side of the building is going to let someone who has taken  bribes in the form of gold bars--apparently cash isn't good enough  under Biden inflation. For a Democratic Member of the Senate to take  cash is not enough. You have to take gold.   We clean up, and we have a standard on this side of the aisle, and  the American people know it. The standard on this side of the aisle is  high. What is clear today is the standard on that side of the aisle is  not.
