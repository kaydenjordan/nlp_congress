 Mr. President, 36 years ago, President Ronald Reagan  stood at the Brandenburg Gate that separated East from West Berlin. He  said to the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet  Union:         Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.    Only a few years after his historic speech, the Soviet Union  collapsed,  [[Page S5770]]  bringing in decades--decades--of freedom and prosperity in Eastern  Europe and a welcome end to the Cold War.   Now there comes a man named ``Vladimir Putin'' who is clumsily and  dangerously trying to regain that dystopian Soviet glory with a bloody  war in Ukraine.   So I can only wonder what President Reagan would be thinking now,  with so many of his Republican Party Members refusing to support  critical military assistance to keep Ukraine from falling to Russian  tyranny.   Yes, we have other legislative needs in Congress, but refusing to  support the forces of freedom in Ukraine in a war against a resurgent  evil empire in the name of partisanship is nothing short of reckless.   It is not hard to understand how we got here. Putin gambled and lost  a botched attempt to quickly overthrow Ukraine. Now he has to juggle a  formidable Ukrainian resistance, huge losses of Russian conscript,  isolation on the global stage, a struggling economy, domestic  opposition, and an upcoming election in Russia that he needs to rig  again to stay in power. Meanwhile, he has been branded a war criminal  and has to carefully choose the nations that he visits so he isn't  arrested on the spot.   So, given his tenuous position, what is one of his greatest  opportunities for clinging to power? It is hope that the partisan chaos  in the U.S. Congress will stall or end support for Ukraine. And make no  mistake--the President of Ukraine told us point-blank when he visited  here several months ago, in a private meeting in the Old Senate  Chamber, that if the United States cuts off military assistance to  Ukraine, his country will lose the war with Vladimir Putin.   That is what is at stake. The White House was clear. We know that  Putin is watching this activity by Congress; so is China and so is  Iran.   The White House was clear in warning that the United States is ``out  of money to support Ukraine in this fight.''   And President Zelenskyy told us the obvious: Ukraine will lose  without American support.   So this is not an abstract political theater; what we do has  consequences--global and historic consequences. As such, I implore my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, think long and hard about  what President Reagan would say today about showing weakness to  Vladimir Putin. Let's not flinch when it comes to standing up to such  obvious threats to freedom.   It is time to pass President Biden's national security supplemental  request. It is hard to imagine that we would actually let history  record that we walked away from Ukraine at this moment. And it isn't  over a debate of the merits of his defense of his country; it is over  an unrelated issue: our border security.   It is obvious that we need to do something on our border. The number  of people presenting themselves for refugee status is at a record high.  The system that was designed 60 years ago to deal with refugees never  envisioned the volume of demands that we are facing on the border every  single day, week, and month.   This is not unique to the United States. Refugees all around the  world are mushrooming in size for a variety of reasons: conflicts, the  war in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, environmental changes. All  of these have the world in flux. And many people are looking for  safety, safety in countries like the United States.   I support the refugee system. I think it was designed at a time when  we realized that turning away Jewish people in World War II was a stain  on our reputation. We decided after World War II to enter into a pact  with other countries around the world to accept refugees under certain  circumstances, and we have lived by that ever since through  Presidents--Republican and Democratic.   Now, we are being tested. We can meet that test. We can adjust our  refugee system to the reality of today, and we can stop the abuse of  the system that is taking place on the border. But we don't want to  walk away from the very fundamental values of our country. It is trying  to find that delicate balance between those values and the disorder  that we face on the border that leads us to the point we are today.   I have been involved in immigration issues for as long as I have  served in this Chamber, and I know how hard they are to negotiate. And  to put this stark choice before the Senate of either finding a solution  to a decades-old problem in a matter of days and hours or cutting off  aid to Ukraine is a terrible choice.   It is a deadly choice for the people of Ukraine, and, sadly, it is a  deadly choice for the dominance of the United States and shaping world  opinion. I hope we find our senses and do it soon.    Mr. President, I have come to the floor many times to  voice my frustration with the timid, ineffective job by the Food and  Drug Administration in protecting American children and consumers from  Big Tobacco. With new threats like vaping, the FDA has failed--utterly  failed--to use its authority under the law to clear the market in the  United States of unauthorized e-cigarettes. These addictive products  are targeting children with sweet and fruity flavors. Yet the Food and  Drug Administration has largely neglected its public health  responsibility to regulate these products.   But, today, I want to discuss an area where the FDA can make progress  that has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives. Last  month, the FDA submitted a regulation to the White House for final  review. This proposed regulation would ban the sale of menthol  cigarettes and prohibit the use of flavorings in cigars.   Scientists have known for years that flavors play a powerful role in  addicting people to tobacco by masking the harsh taste of their  product, but when Congress banned the use of most flavors of tobacco in  2009, Big Tobacco secured a loophole for menthol. Why? Addiction is  profitable.   For decades, menthol cigarettes, in particular, have been marketed  aggressively to the African-American community in the United States,  through free samples, sponsorship of cultural events, and heavy  advertising. As a result, today--today--85 percent of Black smokers use  menthol cigarettes, compared to 30 percent of White smokers.   It is part of the reason why Black adults are 30 percent more likely  to die from heart disease and 50 percent more likely to die from  stroke, compared to White Americans.   Right before Thanksgiving, I met in my office with Marsha Hike, who  lives in Chicago. She was in Washington because November is Lung Cancer  Awareness Month. She shared the fact that lung cancer is the No. 1  cause of cancer death in America. The No. 1 cause of cancer death in  America: lung cancer, killing more Americans than breast cancer,  prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer combined.   She met with me because six of her dearest family members have died  from lung cancer due to smoking. I am glad there is greater attention  today on topics like health disparities, equity, and the underlying  factors for why Black people live sicker and die younger in America.   FDA's proposal would eliminate the racial disparity among cancer  deaths between Black and White Americans, saving 650,000 lives.   I take this issue very personally. When I was a sophomore in high  school, my father died of lung cancer. He was 53 years old. He spent 90  days--almost 100 days--in the hospital before he died, and I was by his  bedside regularly. It made a profound impact on me as a high school  kid, and little did I know that I would be able to follow up on this  issue when I came to the House of Representatives by passing  legislation to ban smoking on airplanes and taking Big Tobacco on ever  since. The battle continues.   I know what the reaction is that the decision to ban menthol in  cigarettes would be unpopular among the African-American population and  may be reflected in the next vote. I think that is greatly exaggerated.   The majority of the Members of the Black caucus in Congress support  this ban on menthol. And I want to make it clear, they are peddling  stories--Big Tobacco is--that we are going to go out and arrest African  Americans if they use menthol cigarettes, but that is not the case at  all. The FDA proposal would take all of the action against the  producers of the cigarettes, not the consumers. The consumers are not  drawn into this in terms of any legal liability nor should they be.  [[Page S5771]]    The question is, do we care enough about these African Americans,  their families, and their future to make an unpopular--to some-- decision to move forward to make America a healthier, safer place to  live? I hope we do.    I don't want any more families to experience the suffering that I  went through and families do every day.   The Biden administration has an incredible track record of taking on  big challenges and delivering. It has launched the Cancer Moonshot,  created a new Federal research Agency, ARPA-H, to accelerate cures for  patients. President Biden has taken on the gun lobby and Big Pharma and  secured important victories with the passage last year of the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.   Now is the time to do the same against Big Tobacco, which is  responsible for nearly half a million deaths per year. I urge the Biden  administration to look carefully at the proposal from the FDA and  swiftly finalize its rules on menthol and flavored cigars, which will  save lives and reduce suffering, especially for communities of color.   This is an issue that is personal to many Americans. We didn't choose  it. Addiction led our family members to face illness and sometimes  death. Are we going to do something for the next generation of African  Americans who are being harassed in the advertising and marketing of  this product to the detriment of their future?   I hope that President Biden will do that.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Schumer for his remarks.   Imagine, if you will a family event that you look forward to each  year. That was the Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, IL.   Highland Park, a leafy suburb of Chicago, is a wonderful community,  truly a community. And every year on the Fourth of July, families ask  their sons and daughters to put on that patriotic T-shirt, carry the  little flag, stand out and enjoy this commemoration of the birth of the  United States of America.   Well, a little over a year ago, that Fourth of July parade became a  terrible day for so many families.   Last year, in Highland Park, IL, a shooter on a rooftop, with an  assault rifle, was able to fire 83 rounds in 60 seconds--83 rounds in  60 seconds--killing 7 and wounding dozens before law enforcement could  even identify where he was. One of those was a little 8-year-old boy, a  twin, who will be unfortunately disabled for the rest of his life  because of the injuries that he sustained.   This mass shooting in my home State of Illinois was one of hundreds  across America last year. Since 2020, the United States has suffered  from over 600 mass shootings every year, almost 2 a day.   I ask those who are listening to my remarks to reflect on one fact:  There is no other country on Earth not engaged in active war where this  type of killing occurs on a daily basis.   In Highland Park and in communities across America, shooters have  used military-style assault weapons to cause irreversible harm in just  a matter of minutes.   I listened to my friend from Wyoming object to the effort to bring  this legislation to the floor and cite the fact that we were being  disrespectful to gun owners. He made reference to ranchers and farmers  in his State and how it is important for them to have firearms. I don't  quarrel with that, but I do have to ask, in all seriousness: 83 rounds  in 60 seconds? That is what a farmer needs? That is what a rancher  needs? I think not. This is a military weapon designed to kill people.  That is it. It is designed to kill massive numbers of people. I don't  think that is part of farming or ranching in modern America.   Already this year, there have been 627 mass shootings, including the  October 25 attack in Lewiston, ME, where a gunman opened fire and  killed 18 people. Literally, the entire State of Maine was on alert,  wondering if this shooter would have another victim.   Americans are rightfully afraid when they see their friends and  neighbors killed in schools, in places of worship, in bowling alleys,  at work, at the mall, at grocery stores. People are asking: What is  safe? Mothers and fathers are asking: Is it safe to send our children  to school?   Is it safe to send their children to school?   What can we do to stop this madness? It is madness. Firearms are now  the leading cause of death of children in the United States. Firearms-- the leading cause of death of children in the United States of America.   Mass shootings with assault weapons are a uniquely American  phenomenon. Continuing to allow firearms meant for war to be used on  the streets is disgraceful.   Last year, Congress took critical steps on gun safety reform with the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, but we must do more. When a shooter  is armed with an assault weapon, the number of deaths in a mass  shooting is, on average, twice as high. If we can prevent that many  deaths when these tragedies strike by passing an assault weapons ban,  what are we waiting for?   Finally, I would like to take a moment to talk about my former  colleague and true trailblazer, the late Senator Dianne Feinstein,  whose voice and leadership in this fight is an inspiration to us all.   Senator Feinstein experienced the devastation of gun violence  firsthand the day that George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were  gunned down in the San Francisco City Hall. That was carved into her  memory and inspired her response.   In 1994, an assault weapons ban was passed and considered a major  step forward. Senator Feinstein's work in the Senate and then  Congressman Chuck Schumer's work in the House made it a reality.  Congress failed to reauthorize this critical legislation--a big  mistake.   Today, we can honor Senator Feinstein's legacy with the lives we will  save by bringing forward this bill. After Highland Park, I said that I  hope, for our children's sake, we don't run away from the problem. That  community and so many others are counting on us to stand up and face  this issue head on. I urge my colleagues to unite and do what is right  for the safety of the American people. Let's pass the assault weapons  ban.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Shaheen.   In reserving the right to object, in 1978, before I was elected to  Congress, I had the opportunity to take a trip to the Soviet Union and  spend 3 weeks there. I saw a lot. In addition to the visits to Russia  and Moscow, we visited countries like Lithuania, where my mother was  born, and I witnessed firsthand the vision of Vladimir Putin and the  Soviet Union.   Make no mistake, his goal is to restore the Soviet Union, to take  vulnerable countries and to subsume them with his own ego and his own  view of the world. To visit Lithuania and see what they had done to the  freedoms that we just take for granted in America was an eye opener to  me: to see the cathedral in Vilnius, with its beautiful frescos  whitewashed by the Soviets because they didn't want people to practice  religion; to realize that they controlled everything--radio stations,  newspapers--and to realize that they dictated who would win an  election. There was no freedom in that country.   That is the communist view. That is the Soviet view. That is the  Vladimir Putin view. Are we in favor of that, Senator? I don't think  so. I know you aren't personally, and you don't want to see that  lifestyle imposed on people around the world any more than I do.   In Ukraine, they had the courage to stand up and say to Putin: We  will fight you to the death to stop this from happening.   They have surprised a lot of people. I remember the briefing--the  Senator from Kansas might have attended it--where we asked the  intelligence experts: How long can Ukraine hold out when the Russian  military machine comes marching in?   They said: A matter of days--days--maybe weeks, but not much more.   They were wrong. And do you know why they were wrong? Because they  underestimated the Ukrainian people and what they were willing to do to  protect their country.   I have a special, as they say, selfish interest in this because I  know that if Putin is successful in Ukraine, if this war criminal has  his way and takes over the Ukrainian country for his Soviet Union--his  new Soviet Union--the next country on the list is probably Lithuania  and the Baltics: Poland, Latvia, Estonia. They are obvious targets  because they are small and vulnerable, but they do have the NATO  alliance standing behind them.   So not only do I support the Ukrainian effort because of the courage  of the people and their success and how much I abhor Vladimir Putin and  his agenda, I also realize it is in America's best interest that  Ukrainians prevail. It is in our best interest to stop Putin in Ukraine  so that we don't have to use the NATO alliance to stop him in a country  where we would be sending American troops to fight the battle. We  should stand foursquare behind Ukraine because it is the right thing to  do, and it is the right thing for America.    Today, the Speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament came to my office, Mr.  Stefanchuk, and he had a very simple message for me and the Senators  who had gathered there: Without U.S. assistance, Ukraine will struggle  and probably lose this war.   Oh, he reminded us that they would fight to the death, and I am sure  they will if it comes down to that dire situation. It also reminded me  that this is not just another political debate. What we are talking  about is assistance to a country where people today are fighting and  dying for their freedom, a country for which we promised support for  over 2 years, a country we need to stand by.   Now you have asked us to support Israel. I will tell you this as  well. Last week, many of us, on a bipartisan basis, watched videos from  the October 7 invasion of the Hamas terrorists into Israel. It was  horrifying. It was a terrible 40 minutes. I had to avert my eyes  several times because I couldn't stand to look at the scenes of  systemic rape, of attacks, murder. I will never forget those two little  boys whose parents had just been killed outside the living room,  sitting in their living room, saying: Are we going to die? It was these  two little boys, and it was on tape. That was the reality of the  atrocity of October 7.   Israel has the right to exist. Israel has the right to defend itself,  and I stand behind Israel as most Americans do. I want to see their  support. But please don't give us this ``Sophie's Choice'' of picking  our favorite child to die. I don't want either Israel or Ukraine to  die. I want them to have bright futures, and to have that, they need  the United States now more than ever. Don't separate our loyalty. Our  loyalty should be common and unified for both countries, Ukraine and  Israel.   There are things we can say about humanitarian issues in the Gaza  territories and what is happening there, but I am going to spare that  for another day.   I will just say this: I stand behind Ukraine. I stand behind Israel.  Don't separate them. Let's stand behind both of them because they are  both consistent with the values of the United States.   I yield to the Senator from Washington.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3416         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
