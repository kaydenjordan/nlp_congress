 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill, the  Protecting Diplomats from Surveillance Through Consumer Devices Act.  [[Page H6320]]    Earlier this year, a private sector analysis revealed the risks of  using wearable technologies, such as Fitbits and Apple Watches, which  use GPS tracking. As the report stated, researchers were able to track  the movements of the deployed troops in overseas locations.   This, obviously, poses an enormous national security risk for our  soldiers serving abroad. Enemies could track patrol routes or discover  the locations of secret foreign installments.   This exposure puts our diplomats at risk as well. We have men and  women engaging in diplomatic efforts all over the world, often in  sensitive and high-risk areas. We must not make it easier for our  enemies to track their movements.   As such, our bill requires the Department of State to establish a  policy on use of location-tracking devices by diplomats at U.S.  facilities around the world.    As the chairman said, many of us here have been to these hot spots-- Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt, Tunisia. I got briefed by the  Libyan team in exile after Benghazi. And they deserve to be protected.  This bill will do just that.   I would like to thank my good friend Congressman Castro for his  friendship and leadership on this issue, as well as Chairman Royce and  Ranking Member Engel on this important legislation.
