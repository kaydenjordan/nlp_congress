 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the chaos  the Republicans have created by playing with our debt limit. The GOP's  default on America plan is disastrous for American families and our  economy.   There is no reason why we should debate whether America should honor  its obligations and pay its debt on time. Extreme Republicans would  even prefer us to default for purely political and partisan means.   Instead of bringing a serious proposal that could be passed in the  Senate and signed by the President, Republicans brought a bill to the  floor that would threaten Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and  veterans benefits.   Time and again, we have asked Republicans to show us their budget and  to present us with a comprehensive plan for our Nation. They can't do  it. Instead, they come to the table with extremist policies that fail  to do the one thing it is supposed to do: pay our bills on time.   President Biden and leaders Jeffries and Schumer have all made it  crystal clear that we must pass a clean debt limit and honor our  commitments. There is no other option.   As we get closer to June 1, I implore my Republican colleagues to see  how much they are hurting the American families they claim to serve and  present us with a real solution for the debt limit.                            ____________________
