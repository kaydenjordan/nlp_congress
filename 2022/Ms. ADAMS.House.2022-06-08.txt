 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember my friend who was  a champion for the people of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, and North  Carolina; a trailblazer for Black women, especially those in public  service; and a sincere, authentic, and humble servant of God who always  looked out for ``the least of these'': the Honorable Ella Butler  Scarborough.   I include in the Record, Madam Speaker, a remembrance from her  colleagues on the Mecklenburg County Commission that reads in part:  ``Commissioner Scarborough's passion was limitless, and her loss is  immeasurable.''                       Board of County Commissioners     Statement from the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners--Ella                     Scarborough, Congressional Record         The Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners was saddened       to learn of the passing of Commissioner Ella Butler       Scarborough.        Commissioner Scarborough was more than a colleague or       public figure. Throughout her life, Commissioner Scarborough       was a pillar in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg community who made       an immense impact, especially on the lives of our most       vulnerable and marginalized citizens.        Commissioner Scarborough was elected to the Mecklenburg       Board of County Commissioners in 2014, and went on to serve       as Chair from 2016 to 2018, making her the first African       American woman to be elected to that position.        Prior to serving on the Board of County Commissioners,       Commissioner Scarborough made history as the first African       American woman to be elected to the Charlotte City Council,       serving from 1987 to 1997 (district and at-large). She was       also a statewide candidate for U.S. Senate in 1998 and ran       for Charlotte mayor in 1999 and 2001. In 2008, Commissioner       Scarborough served as a North Carolina delegate at the       Democratic National Convention. In the 1960s, during her       youth in South Carolina, she became known for her activity in       the civil rights movement.        A fierce advocate for youth literacy, solutions to       homelessness and equality, Commissioner Scarborough's       tireless efforts and dedication to the community at-large was       exemplary and instrumental in eliminating inequities that       created challenges for many in our community.        Commissioner Scarborough was a member of Friendship       Missionary Baptist Church. She was the devoted mother to two       children and widow of Levern ``Pete'' Scarborough. She       graduated from South Carolina State University with a degree       in library science education and earned a master's degree       from the University of Charleston in West Virginia in       organizational leadership.        Commissioner Scarborough's passion was limitless. and her       loss is immeasurable. Our prayers go out to her family,       friends and the entire Mecklenburg County community that is a       better place today due to her dedication.        Signed--The Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners:        Chairman--George Dunlap, District 3.        Vice Chair--Elaine Powell, District 1.        Pat Cotham, At-Large.        Leigh Altman, At-large.        Wilhelmenia I. Rembert, Temporary At-Large.        Vilma D. Leake, District 2.        Mark Jerrell, District 4.        Laura Meier, District 5.        Susan Rodriguez-McDowell, District 6.     Madam Speaker, Ella's loss is immeasurable in part because  she was a veteran of the civil rights movement going all the way back  to her youth in South Carolina. The consciousness and her conscience of  that movement was seen in her work as a pillar of our community who  fought for our vulnerable and marginalized.   She worked for equality and equity not only for Black Americans but  for every community. She worked for the homeless and unhoused; she  worked for youth literacy and public education.   Even as her health failed, she never stopped fighting.   Like many HBCU graduates from her generation, she made history. She  was the first African-American woman elected to the Charlotte City  Council and the first to serve as the chair of the Mecklenburg County  Commission. Her leadership opened doors and inspired others. She  encouraged other Black women to run and serve.   But Ella was the kind of person who was more concerned about the work  she did than the history she made. She was a true child of the civil  rights generation. She was the great-grandniece of the legendary Mary  McLeod Bethune. Her entire family was involved in the movement.   When she was 17, she put her body and her life on the line to  integrate a segregated movie theater in her community. Five years  later, as a student at South Carolina State, she did the same at a  bowling alley in Orangeburg. This time the activists were not so lucky.  South Carolina Highway Patrol officers fired into the crowd of  students--Ella's friends--killing 3 and injuring 10 times as many. Ella  was spirited away out of danger by a member of the football team.   It is a blessing that Ella was spared that day to continue her fight.  Even when she was jailed in the fight to end Jim Crow, she never  stopped fighting, and she never forgot her blessings.   However, overcoming adversity and integrating segregated spaces was  something she had done since the day she was born.   As Charlotte's Hannah Hasan wrote:         She has been fighting since birth. She was born premature;       3 pounds. At that time Black babies weren't guaranteed an       incubator, so her little body had to fight just to exist.    Indeed, when her father convinced the hospital to admit baby Ella to  the ICU in Sumter, she became the first Black baby in that space.  Perhaps that miracle was why she was never afraid. It was a miracle.   But the greater miracle of Ella Scarborough was that after she  counted her many blessings, she extended those blessings to others,  both as a member of her faith home, Friendship Missionary Baptist  Church, and then as an elected official and public servant.   Blessings are not just ours to have but to give.   That was the lesson that I hope we can all learn from Councilwoman,  Commissioner, and Chairwoman Ella Scarborough as we honor and remember  her today.                            ____________________
