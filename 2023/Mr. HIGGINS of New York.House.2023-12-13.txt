 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  work of Sara Capen, chair of the Alliance of National Heritage Areas.   Sara, who also serves as executive director of the Niagara Falls  Heritage Area, is a dedicated leader, collaborator, and facilitator  committed to preserving and celebrating the Niagara region's rich  history.   From the growth of the Discover Niagara Shuttle to the success of the  Niagara Falls Underground Railroad Heritage Center, Sara has been the  energy behind projects connecting people to stories, destinations, and  to one another.   At the national level, Sara was the driving force behind approval of  the National Heritage Areas Act, which reauthorizes all 45 heritage  areas for the next 15 years, safeguarding and strengthening economic  opportunities across the country.   We thank Sara Capen for her passion and commitment to ensuring  America's history is woven into our future for generations to come.                            ____________________
