 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for which time I might consume, and my guess is it  will be about 15 minutes.    Mr. President, first of all, my usual 1-minute speech  after I open the Senate.   Last week, I spoke about consistent congressional oversight, the  checks and balances of government, Congress is to make sure that the  executive branch of government faithfully executes the laws under the  Constitution.   In that speech, I talked about how the Democrats have ignored their  own party's use of Russian and Ukranian Government connections to  undermine Trump. I noted how the Democrats' action literally fit their  own definition of collusion.   Congress ought to conduct aggressive oversight. It is a  constitutional demand. However, if you want to be taken seriously in  this body and by the American public, you have to be very consistent.  Of course, I am pointing out some inconsistencies by the other  political party.   When Democrats ignore their own leadership collusion with foreign  governments, yet investigate the President after alleging he did the  same, that is a lack of consistency and creates doubts about  credibility.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another subject, I recently  introduced the Whistleblower Programs Improvement Act of 2019, a  bipartisan bill, and I have the support of the bipartisan  whistleblowers caucus.   This legislation strengthens whistleblower protection for  whistleblowers working in a variety of key sectors, including our  securities and commodities industries and the foreign service.   There has been a lot of talk about government whistleblowers lately  that is very appropriate. It is important to remember that many of our  whistleblower laws are there to protect just ordinary average Americans  who don't work in government at all. Many of the groups helped by this  bill work in private industry. In some cases, they are investors or  businesspeople who have been on the receiving end of financial fraud.   In other cases, they are employees, like stockbrokers, traders,  investment advisers, administrative professionals, and other support  staff, who see activities in the course of their work that they know  are outright wrong, and these good people decide to speak out. Speaking  out, many times, causes you to eventually seek whistleblower  protection.   Among these brave whistleblowers are people like the three employees  at Merrill Lynch who had evidence that between 2009 and 2015 their  company was misusing customer cash. Now, just think how lucky these  savers were who were helped by whistleblowers willing to come out and  say a wrong has been committed.   They did it this way: The whistleblowers told the Security and  Exchange Commission what they knew. In doing so, they provided  information critical to an investigation of the company's practices.  That investigation uncovered multiple violations of Federal rules.   Among other things, the Securities and Exchange Commission found the  company was not depositing cash in reserve accounts as law required.  Instead, the company was using tricky accounting maneuvers to free up  billions of dollars per week and then using that money to finance its  own trading practices. In the process, it is quite obvious the company  was putting its customers' cash at risk.   The Securities and Exchange Commission said: ``Had Merrill Lynch  failed in the midst of these trades, the firm's customers would have  been exposed to a massive shortfall in the reserve account.''   The information provided by whistleblowers led to a successful  enforcement action, which involved an admission of wrongdoing by the  company and a $415 million settlement.   Now, getting back to the importance of whistleblowers. If these  whistleblowers hadn't stepped forward, then, who knows, those shady  accounting practices might still be going on this  [[Page S5908]]  very day instead of having been stopped--stopped cold. Investors might  still be facing the same unnecessary risks.   Now, there are plenty of examples from the commodities industry as  well--people like Edward Siedle, a whistleblower who informed the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission that JPMorgan Chase was failing to  disclose conflicts of interest with some of its clients. Because Mr.  Siedle decided to speak out about what he knew, the government  collected hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements.   Whistleblowers like Mr. Siedle and the employees at Merrill Lynch  deserve our gratitude, and they deserve our support. They help the  Security and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission to do their job, and they help to promote transparency. With  transparency comes accountability--in this case, for our financial  system.   I will tell you something else they deserve. They deserve assurance  that when they put their jobs and their reputation on the line, they  will not be fired just for trying to do the right thing.   They deserve to know that if the government recovers money because of  their disclosures, they will be able to get a decision on their award  application in a timely fashion. Currently, whistleblowers don't have  these assurances.   Last year, despite strong objections that I raised in a brief to the  Supreme Court in the case of Digital Realty v. Somers, the Court ruled  that a whistleblower who reports violations of our Nation's securities  laws is protected from retaliation not all the time but only when he or  she discloses the wrongdoing directly to the SEC.   Because of this ruling, if a whistleblower in the securities industry  reports a concern to a supervisor at their place of work without also  going to the SEC, they can be fired without any recourse; in other  words, fired for the so-called crime they did, and what did they do?  They did nothing more than what you might call the crime of committing  truth. They have no legal protection or means of getting their job  back.   That is not what Congress intended when it created the current  Security and Exchange Commission Whistleblower Program, and that was  done back in 2010. It is not what I intended when I voted for that  whistleblower protection.   That law was supposed to protect whistleblowers who report  wrongdoing. It was supposed to prevent them from being fired without  just cause.   This decision has far-reaching implications that potentially affect  others beyond those working in the securities industry.   Because the commodities whistleblower program was established through  the same public law as the Security and Exchange Commission program,  that program incorporates many of the same provisions, including  similar language to that which the Supreme Court ruled on during the  Digital Realty case.   That means whistleblowers in yet another program face the prospects  of having anti-retaliation provisions Congress put in place a decade  ago suddenly yanked away from them. That is unacceptable to me. It is a  scenario that should be unacceptable to every Member of this body who  cares about keeping our financial system very strong, protecting the  investor.   My bill prevents the Supreme Court ruling from becoming the status  quo. It makes it clear that whistleblowers who report concerns about  possible violations of our Federal securities and commodities laws are  fully protected, whether they take their concerns to the Security and  Exchange Commission or to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or  to anyone else in their company who they reasonably believe has the  ability to address their concerns. That is what companies should want.  They should want it anyway, to keep their public respectability.   It is also a commonsense goal that we ought to be seeking, and it is  common sense.   When an employee tells his or her company about a concern, it gives  the company a chance to investigate and address the concerns, and, if  necessary, to self-report any problems to the Federal regulators.   Companies that come clean and self-report almost always receive  reduced penalties. That is an outcome that is better for the company,  and it is obviously better for the investors.   On another matter, my bill addresses concern for securities and  commodities whistleblowers. I said before that if the government  recovers money as a result of a whistleblower's disclosure, the  whistleblower deserves at least an initial decision concerning their  award application and to do it in a timely fashion. Unfortunately, my  office has heard of far too many cases where whistleblowers have had to  wait years to get a decision from the Securities and Exchange  Commission after they apply for an award, and you apply for the award  after you make the case for the government. Waiting that long is  unacceptable. A year should be more than enough time for regulators to  reach an initial determination regarding an award application.   My bill makes the 1-year standard law for both the Securities and  Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  whistleblowers. If the agency takes longer than a year to reach an  initial decision, the whistleblower office must notify the chairman and  the whistleblower of the cause for the delay.   Recently, I had the chance to sit down with Securities and Exchange  Commission Chairman Clayton to discuss these changes. My staff worked  closely with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity  Futures Trading Commission to craft the language. Now I urge all of my  colleagues to support change, as well.   In addition to these changes, my bill irons out other differences  between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity  Futures Trading Commission whistleblower programs and ensures that  whistleblowers reporting to both of these bodies have access to the  same judicial remedies.   It also enables the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to hold more  in the consumer protection fund. That is the fund used to pay out its  awards to the whistleblower, and it allows the Commodity Futures  Trading Commission to use money from the fund to teach stakeholders  about the opportunities that are available to them through the  whistleblower program.   Finally, my bill addresses a critical gap in protections provided to  Foreign Service employees through the Whistleblower Protection Act. Due  to a drafting error in the law, the Office of Special Counsel has  stated that it doesn't have the authority to investigate instances of  possible retaliation against Foreign Service workers when the  retaliation comes in the form of a poor performance evaluation. That is  an important task of the Office of Special Counsel and an important  protection that Congress has afforded to other government  whistleblowers. The Foreign Service office's people should have that as  well. My bill closes that gap and makes it clear that Foreign Service  workers should receive those same protections.   In closing, this bill contains commonsense changes. It reinforces and  extends protections that Congress already granted in the past and  ensures that whistleblowers working in different industries who make  similar kinds of disclosures are equally treated and equally protected  under the law. It also tells the Supreme Court of the United States:  You didn't get it right. That is something I am certain we can all get  behind--straightening out the Supreme Court when they don't follow  congressional intent.   The bipartisan coalition of support for this bill is a strong  testament to that. I thank my original cosponsors, Senators Baldwin,  Durbin, and Ernst, for their enthusiastic support of this legislation.  When it comes before the Senate for a vote, I urge all of my colleagues  to do the same.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
