 Mr. Chair, the chairwoman, the ranking member, and I  wholly support the U.S. Navy and, also, the Navy's plan to get to the  355-ship number.   This bill already supports the purchase of 12 new ships, including  two new Virginia-class attack submarines. However, this amendment for  an additional two more Virginia-class subs will wind up cutting, as you  heard, much-needed money from other vital programs. The Department of  Defense estimates that it would cut $7 billion from other programs over  the next 5 years, by the way, impacting military readiness and other  vital equipment procurement.   So, again, while we must obviously pursue an aggressive shipbuilding  program, it must be balanced. The Virginia-class sub is absolutely a  critical national security capability, but we do not want to sacrifice  other equally critical capabilities while we do that.   Mr. Chair, I would respectfully urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 8 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, June 28, 2018, at 9 a.m.  [[Page H5813]]                                ____________________
