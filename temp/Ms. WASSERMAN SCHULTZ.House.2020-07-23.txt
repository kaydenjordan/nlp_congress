 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding, and I stand here in support of her courage.   I rise to remind every man and woman on this floor that we were sent  to Washington to destroy hostile work environments, not build them.   Few women here, or watching, have not felt a man's bullying breath or  menacing finger in our face as we were told exactly what our place was  at work. I certainly saw and felt it as a 20-something lawmaker and had  a highly public, similar experience here in the Halls of Congress as a  30-something Member, once again, from a then-Florida Member of  Congress. That former Member was just elected as the Chair of the  Republican Party of Texas, by the way; so bullies continue advancing  unchecked.   Today, we take a stand for my colleague and friend, Ms. Ocasio- Cortez, and all women who endure this archaic behavior. Today, we take  a stand and say enough is enough.   Sadly, most capitols, including this one, endure this archaic  behavior, and we must stand shoulder to shoulder to say that today is  the last day that we will tolerate it.   Sadly, most capitols, including this one, are still undeniably boys'  clubs, but women have critical numbers now, my friends, and all of us,  women and men, have had it with bullies.   The Halls of Congress are not middle school playgrounds. We have  serious business to do. People across the country are sick, dying,  unemployed, and facing eviction; yet, misogyny was this Member's  highest priority messaging. Unbelievable. I guess really not  unbelievable.   It is a new day, gentlemen, and I use that term loosely with some  cases. So just to reminder for those who still want to wield the  workplace tool of intimidation, your time is up.   To my sisters on this floor, and listening at home, to my daughters,  listening at home, we must not let those who may be intimidated by our  strength scare us away.   I am proud of and proud to stand by my colleague and friend,  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez today.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Golden for his  extraordinary military service to our country and for his leadership on  this urgent issue.   Madam Speaker, no veteran should be forced to choose between seeking  care away from loved ones or forgoing treatment altogether. I applaud  my friend for his tireless advocacy for local mental health services  for veterans in the VA appropriations bill.   I look forward to continuing to work together to prioritize greater  accessibility to these vital mental health services to veterans.   Madam Speaker, I wish the gentleman a happy birthday this Saturday.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New  York, Chairwoman Lowey, for yielding and for all of her hard work and  leadership during this process and for her distinguished years of  service. I am sad this is the last time that we will do this together,  but I am so appreciative of her leadership and mentorship of me  personally. I will truly, truly miss her.   Mr. Speaker, the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related  Agencies division of the bill highlights our continued commitment to  our servicemembers and their families and to our veterans.   Constructing the barracks, bases, and facilities that our military  needs is crucial to our country's military readiness. Properly funding  the Department of Veterans Affairs is how we deliver on the promise of  medical care and other benefits that our veterans have earned through  service to our Nation.   The related agencies, including the American Battle Monuments  Commission and Arlington National Cemetery, demonstrate to the world  how we honor the sacrifices of those who served. That is why I am proud  this bill includes $115.5 billion in discretionary funding, which is a  $5.1 billion increase above the enacted fiscal year 2020 funding level  and $2.3 billion above the President's budget request.   For Military Construction, we provided $10.1 billion, rejecting the  President's proposed cut of $3.6 billion below the current level for  critical infrastructure needs on military installations. This includes  $439.5 million for the Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment  Program, which is $297 million above the request, and $1.49 billion for  family housing construction, which is $135 million above the request,  as well. We added these resources in order to fund critical oversight  to address unacceptable conditions in military family housing, like  mold, vermin, and lead.   Mr. Speaker, $200 million is provided to clean up PFOS and PFOA  contamination at previously closed installations.   The bill also includes a new provision to prohibit military  construction projects on installations named for Confederate officers  until a process is initiated to rename those bases. No servicemember  should live or train on a base named for a person who betrayed  America's pursuit of a more perfect Union.   For the VA, this bill provides a total of $240.2 billion, including  mandatory spending; $104.8 billion is discretionary funding. This  amount represents an increase of $12.3 billion above the fiscal year  2020 enacted level.   The $90 billion within this total for VA medical care fully funds the  budget request.   I am proud that this bill will improve the quality of veterans'  healthcare through significant investments in women's veterans' health,  the ``whole health'' model, mental health and suicide prevention,  homelessness assistance, rural health, and opioid abuse prevention.   We also finally achieved consensus with the Senate that the cost of  VA healthcare cannot remain within the budget caps. So $12.5 billion  within the overall total of $104.8 billion for VA programs is  designated as emergency funding to adequately fund VA healthcare for  its more than 7.2 million patients.   The bill boosts funding for VA research by 5 percent over the fiscal  year 2020 enacted level to support the important work studying rare  cancers and prosthetics for women veterans, just to name a few.   It also provides funding for infrastructure improvements to ensure  the VA has modern, safe facilities to treat our veterans, as well as  supports continued implementation of the Electronic Health Record  Modernization implementation and efforts to reduce the disability  claims backlog.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of what this bill does, but I am equally  proud of what it does not do.   It does not fund the border wall, nor does it allow the President to  bypass congressional intent and divert vital military construction  funding from previously approved national security projects in support  of an ineffective, unnecessary barrier. We cannot allow Presidential  bigotry and xenophobia to be prioritized over American lives, our  servicemembers, or our national security.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my ranking member, subcommittee partner, Judge  Carter, and Ranking Member Granger. We worked very well together. And  while we may not always agree on these issues, we are agreeable, and I  am proud to have them as partners and friends and truly appreciate  their insights.   I also thank the staff of both the subcommittee and in our personal  offices, whose expertise and commitment to our servicemembers and our  veterans is evident every day.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, it is a strong bill, and, most  importantly, it does right by our servicemembers, their families, and  our veterans.    I also would briefly discuss a few of our accomplishments in the  other divisions of this minibus.   The Agriculture division supports our Nation's farmers, strongly  invests in lifesaving nutrition programs, like WIC and SNAP, and blocks  Trump's cruel SNAP regulations.   The bill also includes funding and language to strengthen the  regulation of e-cigarettes to break the epidemic of nicotine addiction  that is gripping our Nation's youth.   The Interior division protects our invaluable public lands, invests  in climate resilience, and helps us restore our crumbling  infrastructure, like the sewage failures in Fort Lauderdale. And I am  particularly pleased that the bill includes language I requested that  would block offshore drilling in any new area, including Florida's  coastlines.   Finally, the State and Foreign Operations division empowers women by  increasing funding for international family planning and health  programs. The bill expands aid for those struggling within Venezuela  and for the refugees fleeing the economic collapse and oppression of  the Maduro regime, and it ensures our ally, Israel, can defend herself,  which is critical to our national security.   Mr. Speaker, I personally thank our incredible staff: Lisa Molyneux,  our clerk; Jennifer Hollrah; Sarah Young; Nicole Cohen; Keihysha  Cenord; Lauren Wolman, on my personal staff; Michael Harris on my  personal staff; and, of course, Shalanda Young, our intrepid clerk of  our full committee, and the entire front office staff as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this spending package,  and I thank everyone for their hard work.  [[Page H3796]]         Madam Speaker, I would like to take a moment  to address Congresswoman Miller and Congressman King's amendments in  the en bloc. Their amendments would strike provisions of the bill that  block the administration from diverting funds from critical military  construction projects to the border wall.  [[Page H3820]]    The bill also prohibits the administration from backfilling projects  in fiscal years 2016 to 2020 that were previously canceled for  construction of the border wall, and the amendments strike that  provision as well.   Stealing military construction funds from the intended purpose has a  direct impact on military readiness, compromises our national security,  and the safety and welfare of servicemembers and their families.   Thirty percent of the Department of Defense infrastructure, according  to the Department of Defense, is in poor or failing condition. The  military construction funds provided and approved by Congress were  intended for specific projects as requested by the services.   To support these two amendments is to declare that catering to  xenophobia is more important than making sure we have the best fighting  force in the world.   The amendments in question seek to grant the President the power of a  monarch and allow him to steal funding from our troops and bypass  Congress at will.   I thought Mexico was supposed to pay for the border wall. Instead,  these amendments ask our heroes in uniform to pay for it. We have to  take a stand against that, and we do that in this bill.   We stand up for our troops. These amendments steal from our troops. I  ask my colleagues to vote against the en bloc amendment.
