 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kansas farmers for  their long hours during this year's wheat harvest and for their work to  produce food for people all over the world.   With more than 15,000 wheat farms across the State and 5 million  acres of wheat in the Big First District alone, Kansas leads the Nation  in wheat production, is the largest exporter of hard red winter wheat,  and is aptly named the breadbasket of the world.   The United States exports that wheat to more than 100 countries  around the world, and some of that wheat from Kansas ends up abroad  under the U.S. food assistance programs, like Food for Peace. In fact,  it was the Kansas Farm Bureau who began sending surplus grain to those  in need around the world, continuing U.S. leadership in addressing  world hunger.   As I reflect on my own time on our family farm in Quinter, Kansas, I  am reminded that harvest season is about more than just harvesting the  crop. For Kansas farm families and communities, harvest is about coming  together.   Harvest is when we share tractors and other equipment with our  neighbor when theirs gets stuck. Harvest is when a grandmother takes  food to the field so the rest of her family doesn't have to leave the  field for a lunch break. It is when a father takes his child out on the  combine to show him how the work is done. And it is when we reflect on  our advancements in agriculture, thanks to land-grant universities,  like the wheat breeding research at Kansas State University, yielding  high-quality and plentiful harvests around the world.   Wheat harvest is a time for Kansas to be proud of the great strides  they take to feed, fuel, and clothe the world. At the end of the  season, we look back and know that each agricultural success is  inexplicably tied to our Kansas values of faith, family, community, and  grit. While we are at work here in Washington, they are back at home  making the world go round, and for that we owe farmers our sincerest  thank you.                      The Right to Life is Self-Evident     Mr. Speaker, I also rise today in support of one of the  most basic functions of any government, the right to life.   Our Founding Fathers wrote 245 years ago, ``We hold these truths to  be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed  by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.''   To them, the right to life was so overly obvious that they called it  self-evident.   But, today, in America, some policymakers insist on denying the right  to life to millions of Americans. Instead, they diminish that right  through murderous abortion policies, policies that fail to recognize  life until a child lets out his or her first cry in the delivery room,  policies that justify abortion based on the belief that any unborn  child may have Down syndrome, and policies that funnel taxpayer dollars  to funding abortions and abortion services.   Today's technology and science has shown us proof of life inside the  womb. We see 3D ultrasounds of a baby sucking her thumb and moving  around. We know unborn babies can experience pain as early as 12 weeks.  At 20 weeks, we can reveal if a baby is a boy or a girl.   Yet some of our country's leaders still proceed to support policies  that devalue and eliminate the innocent child's life. For decades,  these elected officials have spent more time protecting the right of  potentially endangered species, like the lesser prairie-chicken or sea  turtle eggs, than they do protecting unborn babies, human babies.    But not to me. I strongly believe life begins at conception. I  believe every life matters. I support adoptions, foster care, and  crisis pregnancy centers that work tirelessly to care for mothers and  their babies. I have cosponsored pro-life legislation, including H.R.  18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, permanently prohibiting  Federal funding for abortions and abortion services. I even introduced  my own, H.R. 714, which would require the executive branch to notify  Congress and the American public before issuing any new executive order  pertaining to pro-life provisions and the right to life guaranteed by  the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.   Devaluing the life of unborn children has desensitized our Nation,  and I pray we soon wake up and realize the horrors it has done. It is  time to stop using taxpayer dollars to fund abortion services and focus  on lifesaving resources that value the life of both the mother and the  child. The right to life is self-evident, and I will fight to protect  it at all costs.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for hosting this Special  Order.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce you to the newest resident of  western and central Kansas. She greets every store's patrons at the  business front door and every farmer at the farm gate. She is in the  newspaper, on the radio, and all over social media. She goes by Help  Wanted, and you have probably met her, too, as she has made herself  quite popular under President Biden's policies.   It has been more than a year since the pandemic shut down the  country. America is finally getting back to normal. Businesses across  the country are ready to reopen and welcome back customers.  Unfortunately, President Biden's bonus, the monthly unemployment checks  being distributed on top of the already existing unemployment checks,  is paying a premium for potential workers to remain at home rather than  finding work.   The data doesn't lie. There are nearly 8 million job openings in  America right now, a new record. Businesses in the Big First of  Kansas--agriculture, hospitality, food service, manufacturing,  construction, and healthcare--cannot find workers, leading to reduced  hours or closures to accommodate the staffing shortages.                                time  1745    Help is wanted at the North Central Kansas Hospital, short 50  employees and regularly turning away patients as the hospital is unable  to properly staff and serve them.   Help is wanted in McDonald's in that same north central Kansas town,  closing early each night.   Christina, the owner of hair salons in Garden City, Hays, and Dodge  City, Kansas, wants help as she temporarily shuts down one location,  only opens another for a few days a week, and shortens hours at all  three.   Help is wanted at the ethanol by-products plants in south central  Kansas, unable to find workers even after offering a salary of a  $35,000 plus health and retirement benefits.   And PureField Ingredients, a food ingredient manufacturer in Russell,  Kansas, wants help as they are staffed at only 30 percent of their  normal levels.   Mr. Speaker, hear me say this: If you can get to work, you should. Do  it for our local businesses and our State's economy. Do it for your  family. Most of all, do it for yourself.   I recently joined fellow Kansas Republicans in urging the Kansas  governor to opt out of the enhanced unemployment benefits.  Additionally, I cosponsored the Help Wanted Act, which addresses the  severe labor shortages caused by the Federal unemployment policy and  the Get Americans Back to Work Act, which would shorten the extension  of the pandemic unemployment checks.   It is time to take off the masks, get our kids back to school, get  our businesses open, get people back to work, and get the country back  on track.
