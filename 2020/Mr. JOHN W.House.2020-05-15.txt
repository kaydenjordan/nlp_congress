 ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, today, I am standing up  for those who have stood up for this Nation throughout the current  crisis: nurses, doctors, farmers, truck drivers, food service workers,  distribution and supply chain workers, the millions of Americans who  can't stay home and expect our country to survive.   Haven't we learned our lesson about outsourcing? Apparently not. Now,  some of the Members of this House want to outsource their votes as  well.   I will be voting ``no'' on this resolution, and I would encourage  those ready to hand over their votes to someone else to just go ahead  and hand over their seats to someone else.   With unemployment the way it is, I would bet that there are more than  a few people back home in your district who would gladly accept your  $174,000-a-year job and find a way to get to Washington and push a  button.   I will vote ``no.''                                time  1330     ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, today I will be voting  ``no'' on an 1,800-page, $3 trillion socialist wish list. This wish  list is the product of partisan scrambling meant to take advantage of  the present crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.   I, and the people in my district, won't stand for it. I am from  Tennessee where we balance our budgets, we don't write checks we can't  cash, and where common sense is still king.   Today, I will be using that common sense to represent the people of  the Sixth District of Tennessee and vote ``no.''
