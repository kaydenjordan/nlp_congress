 Mr. Speaker, 4 of the 10 largest wildfires in California  history are currently burning as we speak--3 of which are in my  district.   For decades, our national forests have been mismanaged, turning them  into tinderboxes that can ignite in an instant should lightning strike.  As a result, there are more dead trees in the State of California than  there are people.   This is a serious problem with serious consequences. If there is a  time for this body to pass a comprehensive forestry package, it is now.   Today, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will  consider the Emergency Wildfire and Public Safety Act. This bipartisan  bill, led by my colleague,   Jimmy Panetta, and I in the House, and  Senator Feinstein and Daines in the Senate, take great steps to  proactively manage our forests and minimize wildfire risk in the West.   Mr. Speaker, over three million acres in California have burned this  year as a result of disastrous wildfires. We have 150 million dead  trees in California. It is critical that the House considers the  Emergency Wildfire and Public Safety Act immediately.                            ____________________
