 Madam Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Garcia for  yielding.   I am from Vermont, and it is hard to be farther from the southern  border in the United States than being in Vermont, but the question  that people ask me in Vermont, really, more than anything else, is how  is it that in the name of our government, under the authority of our  flag, we have instituted a policy, since rescinded, to take children  away from parents? How is that possible?   The President talks about a crisis at the border. No argument about  that; there is a crisis at the border. But is the right response to it  that you separate families? Is the right response that you call the  people who are coming gang members and rapists and killers?   I went to the border, as well, and met many of the women and the men  and the children who were there, and as you know better than anybody-- and, by the way, I really appreciate your leadership on this and the  leadership of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus--the people who are  there are there out of desperation.   One woman I spoke to, who was from Guatemala, told us that she had a  13-year-old daughter, and her husband had already been murdered, and  the mother was told that her daughter was going to become the  girlfriend of one of the gang members. It was that fear that made her  leave her home.   People do not want to leave their home, and they only do it when they  absolutely have to to save their lives.   She and her daughter set out in the night for the more than 1,000- mile journey to the southern border. About two-thirds of the way there,  the mother started getting nervous, hearing stories, wondering what it  would be like, and said to her daughter: Honey, we have got to go back.   The daughter looked at the mother and said: Mom, we can't. We are not  safe. You are not safe, and I am not safe.   They arrived at the southern border, and they make an effort to cross  the bridge and are not allowed because of the go-slow policy and no  capacity to ``process.''   They wade across the river and turn themselves in, and their request  is for asylum. That has been criminalized by the Trump administration.  The daughter and the mother are separated.   When we were with the mom, she didn't know where her daughter was. Is  she a rapist? Is she a criminal? Is she an MS-13 member? She is a mom  trying to protect her daughter. She is a mother who lost her husband  already.   Now, there is not an easy answer to that, and none of us suggest  there is. But it is not the answer to say that anybody who is seeking  to save their life, fleeing economic desperation, fleeing physical  violence, seeking to protect a son or a daughter, is a criminal. They  are asking for help.   And it is a tough question: How much help can we give? We have to  have secure borders, but are we solving the problem by making it a  crime to ask for help? Are we solving the problem by taking kids and  separating them from their parents? Are we solving the problem where we  cut aid off to the countries Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador,  where most of the people are coming from? The answer to that is no.   And this is a hard problem, but it can't be resolved unless there is  some mutual recognition on both sides that it is something we have to  work together to try to address.   There are refugees around the world. There are some refugees who are  coming to our southern border. But this is becoming a worldwide  problem, and it is a combination of factors of failed states, of  environmental damage, of economic desperation; and we have to address  this in a way that we acknowledge the obligation we have to one  another.   So my hope is that the President, whose leadership on this is  absolutely  [[Page H7448]]  essential, tones it down and acknowledges that this is an issue that we  have to work together to solve, and it is not just the heel of the boot  that is going to solve it, not just the punitive measures of taking  kids from parents that is going to solve it, not just cutting off aid  to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador that is going to solve it.   We are ready to work, and we need to work because it is, more than  anything else, essential that we acknowledge the responsibility all of  us have, whatever our policies are, to treat people humanely.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Garcia so much for his work on this, and I  pledge to continue working with the gentleman every way I can.                                time  1845
