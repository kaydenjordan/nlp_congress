 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my dear friend,  Staff Sergeant Lewis Smith, affectionately known as Slugger and also  very affectionately known as the Mayor of Washington Mills, who  recently passed away at the age of 99.   Lew was born in Washington Mills, New York, in 1922 and graduated  from Sauquoit Valley Central School in 1940.   After the terrible attacks on Pearl Harbor, Lew immediately signed up  to fight for our country in the United States Air Force, with what at  the time was known as the 13th Army Air Corps 307th Bombardment Group  in the South Pacific.   A member of the Greatest Generation, Lew honorably served our country  in World War II, completing 50 combat missions in the South Pacific  with, as I said, the 13th Army Air Corps 307th Bombardment Group.   He wrote a wonderful book chronicling his experience in the war,  which I highly recommend to everyone who is interested in finding out  what it was really like to just be an average member of the Air Force,  enlisting and learning and growing and sacrificing.   After the war, Lew came home to Washington Mills and married the love  of his life, Jane, on May 5, 1945, after moving to Denver to complete  Lew's military service.   The couple moved back to Washington Mills, where they would live  together for 76 years until Jane's passing in 2021.   Upon moving back to Washington Mills, Lew worked as a welder for  Utica Structural Steel before taking over his father-in-law's service  stations with his two sons. Later, Lew would take on positions as a  maintenance man for the town of New Hartford highway and police  departments.   On top of his service as a mechanic, Lew also served our community as  one of the founding members of the Willowvale Fire Company Inc.,  serving since 1950, and as the leader of the Clonan Post 1000 American  Legion.   Lew was a wonderful person, a dear friend, and a tremendous community  servant. I thank him and his family for their friendship and for the  lifetime of service and commitment to our community by the entire  family.   He was truly a special gem in our community like no other person.  Probably my greatest inspiration, other than my own father, Lew was a  person of great integrity, great honesty, who gave wonderful, sage  advice to everyone he met. He was also one of the kindest people and  one of the most caring, giving people I have met in my life.   I thank him and his family and his wonderful wife, Jane, for all the  wonderful times and, actually, great experiences I had and their  support of our community and all those people who serve in the fire  service and police service and serve our Nation in uniform.   He truly embodied our Greatest Generation, and he is sorely missed by  our community.                           Honoring Edward Bradley     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Edward Bradley of  Chadwicks, New York, who passed away earlier this week.   Edward was a lifelong resident of the Utica area and dedicated his  life to serving our community and his family. He worked for several  companies in the area, including James Donovan Roofing and Mohawk  Containers, where he worked for 40 years. Incidentally, James Donovan  was one of our New York State senators from our region.   On top of his work, Edward was also a 50-year member of the  Willowvale Fire Company, where he served previously as president and  vice president. He also served as a member of the Oneida County Fire  Police and the State director of the New York State Fire Police  Association, and he was honored by the Willowvale Fire Company with the  very prestigious Ironman Award.   Edward was also a member of the Utica Elks Lodge and was nominated by  the United Way of the Mohawk Valley for the 100 Heroes of the Mohawk  Valley, recognizing his tremendous and honorable, dedicated service to  our community.   Edward, thank you for your lifetime of service, and may your memory  continue to be a blessing to all of us and the new generations of  people that come after us.   We will never forget your commitment to our region, and your family  remains in our thoughts and prayers. Your department is in great hands.  They learned from truly the best.                                time  1030          NATIONAL SURVIVORS OF HOMICIDE VICTIMS AWARENESS MONTH
