 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 68, to  prevent an unnecessary and unauthorized war against Iran.   I thank my friend from Virginia, Senator Kaine, as well as Senators  Dick Durbin, Mike Lee, and Rand Paul, for standing up for our laws and  for the U.S. Constitution, which gives Congress, not the President, the  power to make war and to authorize the use of military force.   The assassination of Iranian General Soleimani was a massive,  deliberate, and dangerous escalation of conflict with Iran by Donald  Trump. Rather than deterring new attacks on American interests, as the  administration insists, Soleimani's assassination invited them, and  they came in the form of airstrikes on U.S. air bases in Iraq.   But instead of sharing with Congress and the American people  information and intelligence that justify the Soleimani attack,  President Trump and his counselors have deflected, fabricated, and just  plain refused to tell the truth about the so-called imminent threat  that was prevented.   We now have press reports confirming that President Trump authorized  the killing of General Soleimani 7 months ago. The administration  doesn't just look to be misrepresenting the imminent threat of  Soleimani, it appears to be fabricating information intended to bypass  Congress's constitutional role to authorize war.   Last week, President Trump revealed more information on the killing  to a FOX News personality, and he gave more information to that  personality on FOX than he did in a 75-minute briefing to the entire  U.S. Senate. That is completely and totally unacceptable. FOX News  should not know more about our national security interests than the 100  Senators who sit here and have the responsibility to ensure that we are  a check and balance on the executive branch.   No evidence has yet been presented to support President Trump's  outlandish claim that Iran would ``probably'' target four U.S.  Embassies--an assertion that was contradicted days later by his own  Secretary of Defense. Perhaps that is why President Trump's latest  defense is just to simply throw up his hands and say: I am sorry; I am  not giving you the information that you need. He tweets that the  imminence test ``doesn't really matter because of [Soleimani's]  horrible past.'' So it is no longer imminent threat, from his  perspective, because he says it really doesn't matter. He decides, and  he decides without consultation with the Congress.   Here is the lesson Donald Trump seems unwilling or unable to learn:  The truth does matter. In matters of war and peace, the truth is  nonnegotiable.   Trump's reckless actions have put tens of thousands of American Armed  Forces, diplomats, and civilians at greater risk, and his continued  fabrications about intelligence threaten to draw the United States into  an illegal war with the country of Iran.   Look at what has happened as a result of Trump's escalation: Our  Iraqi strategic partners are demanding that U.S. troops leave bases in  Iraq prematurely, increasing the chance that ISIS will reconstitute  itself in the region. The truth matters.   Iran has announced that it is no longer bound by enrichment  restrictions under the deal. This only makes it more likely that Iran  will hasten its quest for a nuclear bomb. The truth matters.   Despite Donald Trump's best efforts, the United States is a country  that abides by the rule of law. Our laws say Congress has the sole  authority to make and to authorize war. Neither the 2001 nor the 2002  authorizations for the use of military force can be used to provide  legal cover for a war with Iran, and we owe it to the American people  to repeal these obsolete authorizations, which Presidents of both  political parties have abused to justify military campaigns in far- flung parts of the planet.   To guard against another quagmire as we experienced in Vietnam,  Congress acted, through the War Powers Resolution of 1973, to rein in  Presidential overreach when it came to war. That resolution, which  informs our debate on the Senate floor today, makes it clear that the  President cannot put our brave men and women in harm's way without a  vote by Congress or if there is an armed attack on the United States.   Neither the 2001 nor the 2002 authorization for the use of military  force provides legal cover for the killing of Soleimani or any other  future attacks against the country of Iran.   It bears repeating that a possible war with Iran did not begin with  Iran's attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, nor did it begin with the  President's decision to select the extreme option of assassinating  Soleimani. The uptick in Iran's attacks in the region and that of its  proxies can be traced to President Trump's unilateral and irresponsible  exit from the Iran nuclear deal--the deal to put inspectors in every  one of the Iranian nuclear facilities. The Iran deal was working. It  was the best tool we have to ensure Iran never obtains a nuclear  weapon--that was until Trump's capricious decision to pull out of the  deal and crush Iran by ratcheting up American sanctions.   Trump is now doubling down on his failed approach by ratcheting up  sanctions on new sectors of the Iranian economy. This escalation will  make the Trump deal that he says he wants all the more elusive.   Before the United States backed out of the Iran deal, the President's  own CIA Director, Director of National Intelligence, and the United  Nation's international watchdog agency all said Iran was upholding its  end of the deal. Iran was upholding its end of the nuclear deal. Since  then, however, Iran  [[Page S224]]  has moved away from its nuclear-related commitments in phases. Most  worrisome was Iran's announcement last week that it was no longer bound  by enrichment restrictions under the deal.   But we can still salvage a diplomatic outcome. All of Iran's steps  are reversible. For one, Iran remains party to the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty, requiring it to foreswear acquisition of a  nuclear bomb. Additionally, international inspectors from the  International Atomic Energy Agency maintain access to Iranian nuclear  sites to detect and deter any ramp-up in enrichment or reprocessing.   But pulling the United States back into a position where we are not  going to war will require a change in strategy by the President of the  United States. It means a commitment from the President to, one, cease  any further military action, as today's resolution calls for; two,  engage in talks with Iranian President Hasan Ruhani or other senior  leaders to defuse the crisis and to support our allies as they work in  good faith to preserve the Iran nuclear deal; three, make clear that  the United States does not seek to impose regime change in Iran--the  future of Iran must be decided by the Iranian people alone; and four,  cease any and all threats against Iranian cultural sites and civilians.  These would be war crimes. Destroying cultural sites is what ISIS does.  It is what the Taliban does. It is what the Chinese Government does.  That is not who we are in the United States of America. Finally, we  must repeal the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for the use of military  force immediately.   Americans strongly reject President Trump's deliberate and escalatory  action against Iran. They do so not just because it is wrong, but they  do not want to get embroiled into another costly war in the Middle East  without end. A poll last week shows that Americans by more than 2 to 1  say that the killing of General Soleimani has made the United States  less safe. Sadly, they are right.   In passing Senator Kaine's resolution, this body has a chance to  reclaim our Founders' vision for the proper role of Congress. We are  the direct representatives of the people. Congress must express the  will of the people to determine when, where, and against whom our  country decides to go to war.   We cannot and must not get pulled into war with Iran, and we cannot  allow Trump to start a war all on his own.   I thank Senator Kaine for his leadership on this resolution that I  call upon all of my colleagues here on the Senate floor to support.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I was necessarily absent but had I been  present, I would have voted no on rollcall vote No. 11, the motion to  invoke cloture on the nomination of Peter Gaynor, to be Administrator  of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.   Mr. President, I was necessarily absent, but had I been present, I  would have voted no on rollcall vote No. 12, confirmation of Peter  Gaynor, to be Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.                            ____________________
