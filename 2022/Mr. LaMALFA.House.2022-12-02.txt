 Mr. Speaker, California has suffered from water  shortages for a few years, partly due to low rainfall and snowpack  annually, but in big part due to the poor management of the water we do  receive.   Our lakes were basically full in 2019 and also in 2017, when you may  recall the Oroville Dam spillway incident.   Our water systems, both State and Federal, are designed to withstand  5 years of drought. It doesn't work when government regulators let all  the water out for dubious fish and environmental purposes.   Lake Oroville, in 2021, which was less than 2 years after being full,  had its lowest level in its history, so low it wasn't even making  hydroelectric power--this in a State that wants to electrify all of our  cars and appliances.   So, what are we going to do? Hundreds of thousands of acres of ag  land also have been idle with these crops that all of America depends  on, not just California. It is not just California farmers. These crops  are used widely across our whole country. Yet, they are not being grown  because they are wasting our water.    Rain season is now upon us. I hope we can get our Federal and State  regulators to be much wiser about saving our water and keeping it  stored so we don't run short of food and electricity due to their bad  management.                            ____________________
