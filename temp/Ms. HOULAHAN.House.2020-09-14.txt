 Mr. Speaker, I rise today before the House of  Representatives to commend Walter Puddifer, Tom Garner, Hugh Lofting  II, Dan DiGregorio, David MacDonald, and Burnett H. Wilson III for  their heroism.   On Tuesday, August 4, in our community of Chester County, amidst  fast-moving floodwaters, these six men risked their own lives and saved  a father and children from sinking in a vehicle.   It is so important in these trying times to try to recognize the  brave, heroic acts that everyday Americans are committing.   This story is not an isolated incident. There are countless stories  across the country of people stepping up to save lives: healthcare  workers, essential workers, and, indeed, the average person who sees  somebody in need and drops everything to help.   Mr. Speaker, I thank these brave Pennsylvanians, and I enter their  names into the Congressional Record for their selfless and courageous  acts of service.                            ____________________
