 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  efforts of Ray and Theresa Vogelpohl, who were recently named 2018  Arkansas Forest Stewards of the Year by the Arkansas Agriculture  Department's Forestry Commission.   The Forestry Stewardship Program recognizes and rewards landowners  who are managing privately owned forest land for multiple uses.  Arkansas is home to more than 1,200 certified forest stewardship  landowners. The Vogelpohls first enrolled in the Forest Stewardship  Program in 1996 and later became certified as forest stewards in 2016.   They operate the Diamond TR Ranch, a 350-acre working ranch on the  Perry-Pulaski county line. Their forest management efforts include  prescribed burns, tree plantings along the Maumelle River, forest  thinning, and planting of native grasses.   Ray and Theresa's dedication to forestry and environmental  conservation has safeguarded Arkansas forestland for generations to  come.   I join all Arkansans in congratulating them.                            ____________________
