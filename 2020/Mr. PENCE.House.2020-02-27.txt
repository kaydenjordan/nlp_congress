 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 75th anniversary of  the battle for Iwo Jima. I had the privilege of joining Senator Young  at a ceremony last week in Indianapolis to commemorate this fateful  battle that led to the allied victory in World War II.   With us at the Indiana War Memorial was Wayne Saucerman, a World War  II marine veteran of Iwo Jima and a true American hero.   Seventy-five years ago Wayne found himself thousands of miles away  from home in the midst of a fierce 5-week battle that would help change  the course of the war and history itself.   To Wayne and to other patriots who fight for the freedom and liberty  we hold so dear, thank you for your service.   Next month I will have the honor of returning to the island as part  of a congressional delegation invited to participate in the 75th  Reunion of Honor on Iwo Jima. We will be joined by the commandant of  the Marine Corps and dignitaries from Japan to renew this commitment by  remembering and honoring those who fought 75 years ago.                   Trump Administration Puts Farmers First     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend President Trump's  leadership on the Waters of the United States issue and support his  repeal of the burdensome Obama-era regulation.   As a result of this decision, our farmers can worry less about  government overreach on their own property and instead focus on  building and growing their farms and small businesses. We finally have  an administration that puts our farmers first, and for Hoosiers in my  district, that is a big deal.   I pledge my commitment to farmers and families in my district to  continue working with the Trump administration on this very critical  issue.                    Recognizing Ahaus Tool and Engineering     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ahaus Tool and  Engineering in Richmond, Indiana for their effective apprenticeship  program.   While recently visiting Ahaus, their leadership told me about their  nationally accredited apprenticeship program, which has been helping  Hoosiers for over 30 years.   Ahaus offers a full-time job while their employees attend school to  gain hands-on learning experience with peers in the company.   I wish Ahaus continued success and I thank them for their investment  in the community of Richmond.                  Recognizing the Good Samaritan Food Pantry     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Good Samaritan  Food Pantry of North Vernon and its wonderful manager, Ginger Miller.   The Good Samaritan Food Pantry served over 29,000 Jennings County  residents last year, including 1,000 veterans. The Good Samaritan Food  Pantry is run by an all-volunteer staff and runs completely on  donations.   Not only does this organization help feed those in need, but it also  provides clothing and household items for families in need.   God bless those that help the Good Samaritan Food Pantry run, and God  bless all the volunteers involved.                         Congratulating Silas Allred     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Silas Allred of  Shenandoah High School for winning the 195-pound weight class Indiana  Wrestling State Title.   This is Silas' second straight wrestling State title, and he joined  an elite group of only one of five Indiana high school wrestlers in  history to win the title by pin.   Silas is ranked fourth in the Nation for his weight class and  qualified for Team U.S.A. to compete at the Pan Am Cadet Games.   I congratulate Silas and wish him the best of luck in his future.                            ____________________
