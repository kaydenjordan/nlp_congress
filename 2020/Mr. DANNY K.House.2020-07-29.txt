 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I sincerely believe  that the best way to evaluate the effectiveness and greatness of a  society is by how well it treats its old, how well it treats its young,  and what it does for those who have difficulty caring for themselves.   Childcare is one of the most essential needs that exists in our  community. And I have just heard my colleague say $100 billion helps to  put childcare on the map. I know individuals who work in the childcare  industry who cannot put their own children in the programs that they  work for because they earn so little.   Madam Speaker, if we are to move America as we confront the pandemic,  as we deal with racism, as we deal with structures that have kept  disadvantaged people and communities disadvantaged, nothing would do it  better than making sure that every individual who needs childcare will  have it available.   Madam Speaker, events of the past few months have shown the need for  policies to strengthen child well-being as thousands of youth across  America marched and demonstrated as they challenged our systems of  social, educational and economic justice.   Child care powers both family economic well-being and our national  economic growth. Prior to the pandemic, federal funding only provided  child care for one in six eligible children. And parents in communities  weighed down by poverty and systemic racism experienced a shortage of  high-quality, affordable child care.   Today, we face a global pandemic that has disproportionately infected  and killed people in these same struggling communities, and the child  care crisis we had before is now much, much worse. Now, parents have  lost millions of additional child care options, and providers confront  new costs to keep children and workers safe, risking financial losses  for businesses already operating on the knife's edge of profitability.   In Illinois, nearly half of all previously available child care slots  are at risk of disappearing altogether due to the pandemic, and sixty  percent of child care programs are fully-closed. In Chicago, we did not  have much to lose. Pre-pandemic, five out of six Chicago children lived  in a ``child care desert'' where children outnumbered child care slots  by 3 to 1, or more.   The high cost of quality child care disproportionately affects Black  families because Black children are disproportionately likely to live  in homes with only working parents, but Black working parents earn 40  percent less, on average, than white working parents. For workers with  low wages, work is impossible without child care subsidies, and  difficult even with assistance. Latinx and Black workers are more  likely to work nonstandard schedules than their peers, which often  makes child care harder to find and more expensive. Moreover, people of  color are disproportionately represented in the child care workforce.  About 40 percent of the child care workforce are people of color who  are concentrated in low-level positions with lower credential  requirements and relatively low pay. The child care workforce alone is  94% female and 40% persons of color. Latinas--who represent 15% of all  workers--comprise 21% of child care workers, and Black women represent  15% of all child care workers. These data demonstrate that protecting  the child care industry is key to both economic priority and racial  equity.   As states lift stay-at-home orders and other economic restrictions,  more parents are returning to work, if they can. Quality, affordable  child care is a cornerstone of parents' ability to work and move up the  economic ladder. I know essential workers who couldn't work because  they had no one to watch their kids. I know parents who have lost so  much income that they can't afford child care to work.   As a Black man living in Chicago, I have grieved at far too many  funerals for friends lost to COVID-19, and I know far too many parents  who legitimately fear for their family's health when they return to  work and their children go back to child care. When I see the  devastation caused by this pandemic and the barriers to working due to  child care, I am offended by claims that people will refuse to work  because of the availability of supplemental unemployment benefits. This  charge is simplistic, insulting, and refuted by data showing that low- wage workers stay at work and return to work even when faced with  unsafe working conditions and inadequate wages.   As our nation grapples with structural racism, policymakers need to  enact policies that support workers and address the barriers they face,  taking care not to penalize communities weighed down by poverty and  racism. Big challenges call for big solutions. Now is the time for this  Committee and this Congress to take meaningful action to ensure that  high-quality child care is available to all who need it.   The two bills before us today demonstrate Democratic commitment to  growing our workforce and our economy by investing in families and in  our child care infrastructure--both the people and the buildings. I am  extremely proud to co-lead the Child Care for Economic Recovery Act and  to cosponsor the Child Care is Essential Act. Together, these bills  parents afford and help businesses provide safe, quality child care.   In addition to increasing the guaranteed investment in child care via  the Child Care Entitlement to States funds to states from $2.9 billion  to $10 billion for the next 5 years, the Child Care for Economic  Recovery Act helps ensure states can use these funds by waiving the  requirement that states match the funds for the first two years. The  bill includes critical investments in child care infrastructure to help  states and providers adapt, expand, and reconfigure child care  facilities and infrastructure in response to coronavirus. Further, it  helps qualified child care facilities weather the pandemic with  targeted tax benefits to help cover rent, mortgage, and utility costs.   The bill also includes two bills I have championed to substantially  help families afford child care. One centers on providing targeted  support to essential workers who need care for children or adults so  they can work, and the other modernizes the Child and Dependent Care  Tax Credit to provide tens of billions of dollars to help working  family cover child care costs. Specifically, there is an additional  $850 million in funding for the Social Services Block Grant to help  essential workers pay for family care. Importantly, states can use the  funding to support child care for any group of workers they deem  essential for in-person work, including sanitation and public safety  workers, grocery store employees and other workers designated by the  state. Further, the bill makes the full amount of the Child and  Dependent Care Tax Credit available to more families by raising the  current phase-out of $15,000 to $120,000, almost triples the maximum  credit from $1,050 to $3,000 per child, and it ensures that families  with the greatest need benefit by making the credit fully refundable.   The Child Care is Essential Act creates a $50 billion Child Care  Stabilization Fund to help stabilize the child care sector and help  providers reopen and operate safely. These grants will support  providers' ability to maintain employee benefits and salaries; follow  Center for Disease Control and Prevention health and safety guidelines  in the classroom; train employees on health and safety standards; make  mortgage, rent, and utility payments; and modify child care services as  needed as a result of the pandemic.   Substantively investing in child care is the right thing for our  economy, the right thing for our children, and the right way to give  everyone a fair shot in America.

He was the most angelic person I  have ever known, generous to a fault, easy to get along with.   John was known for marching, but I am reminded that the Bible says  that the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord. John was and is a  good man, always looking out for the underdog, always looking out for  the disadvantaged, the poor, the needy, the hopeless, the helpless.   John has been an inspiration for me for more than 50 years, when he  was a mere teenager. If I had a message, I would say that the  songwriter probably had John in mind when he said:         If you give the best of your service,        Telling the world that the Savior is come;        Be not dismayed when men don't believe you.        Pick up the cross and run swiftly to him.        He'll understand.    And we all say: John, well done. Well done.
