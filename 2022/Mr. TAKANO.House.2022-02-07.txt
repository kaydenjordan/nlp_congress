 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay my respects to the late,  former Congressman Esteban Torres, a devoted and beloved Chicano civil  rights champion. I knew Mr. Torres in the 1990s during my first  campaigns for Congress. I was honored by his support of my early  campaigns and benefitted greatly from his counsel and his goodwill. We  should all find inspiration in his rise from very humble beginnings to  becoming a highly respected and influential Member of Congress.  Indisputably, Mr. Torres was a trailblazing Latino leader and  immigration advocate, who opened the space of greater diversity and  representation in California politics for all people.   Mr. Speaker, I salute the life of a Korean war veteran, labor leader,  community development executive, diplomat, and Member of Congress who  continued to make a difference in his retirement.   To the Torres family and all those who have been inspired by him, I  offer my deepest condolences.                            ____________________
