 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, the Independent Payment Advisory Board was created, in  fact, by the Affordable Care Act, as we have heard. It will be a 15- member panel composed of Presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed  experts charged with developing proposals to prevent Medicare costs  from getting too high. It is about fiscal prudence.   The majority and its allies, however, spread many mistruths about the  board. It has even been called a death panel, if you remember that. In  reality, nothing could be further from the truth. Its recommendations  may not increase cost-sharing premiums or taxes, or reduce benefits.  They have no way to do that.   Not a single soul has been nominated to the board. It is not yet  instituted as an entity. Today, in the absence of an appointed board,  the Secretary of Health and Human Services is directed to submit  recommendations to Congress if a trigger is met.   The independent Medicare actuaries predict that this board will not  be triggered until at least 2021, 4 years from now.   Mr. Speaker, I think we have to ask: Why are we spending time today,  with everything facing us, addressing a problem that could exist 4  years from now? Is the majority so desperate to undermine the  Affordable Care Act that they are repealing a panel whose sole purpose  is keeping Medicare costs in line?   According to Gallup, 55 percent of the public approves of the  healthcare law. They want to see it strengthened, not eviscerated.   In contrast, under the majority's leadership, Congress has an  approval rating of just 13 percent.   Should 13 percent be telling 55 percent what they need to do?   Instead, since the majority has so far been unable to repeal it, they  are going to undermine it brick by brick. The President is even  sabotaging the Affordable Care Act administratively, slashing the  budget to publicize the law by 90 percent, and cutting the open  enrollment period in half.   In the interest of public service, let me say that the enrollment  period started yesterday and continues to December 15. Please go and  take care of your health insurance.   What the White House has done is make a direct attempt to cause chaos  to weaken signups under the open enrollment period that began this  week.   The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that, as a result of the  Affordable Care Act, Medicare growth has been historically low. The  growth in healthcare prices is at its lowest level in 50 years. The  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected that Medicare growth  rates will remain beneath this panel's targets until 2021, hence the  reason for not doing a panel for 4 more years.   It is really too bad that this Congress and the majority insist on  sabotaging  [[Page H8397]]  the Affordable Care Act, chipping away at its benefits. We should be  strengthening it. Remember that every President since Theodore  Roosevelt just about has tried to do a healthcare bill like the one  that we have today. Perhaps just because Barack Obama did it that there  is so much problem with it in the majority.   There is a bipartisan Senate bill crafted by Senator Alexander and  Senator Patty Murray that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  found last week would save money, stabilize the insurance marketplace,  and reduce the debt by $3.8 billion. That is all without anyone losing  their insurance.   Why won't we take up that bill?   We never get an answer for that question.   What is it about trying to take healthcare away from poor people or  that we won't put a bill on the floor that has all the advantages and  savings that we know and that is totally bipartisan? Is it because the  majority knows it will pass?   Our Nation has urgent problems. Our infrastructure is crumbling,  education costs skyrocket so high so fast that it is unattainable to  many students. We desperately need to stabilize our health insurance  markets by passing the compromise by Senators Alexander and Murray.  That is what we should be doing here today.   There are Members on both sides of the aisle who want to see  improvements to the board, but that is not what the bill does. It  terminates it altogether. It is the wrong approach at definitely the  wrong time.   Regardless of what you think about this board, we should be able to  agree that this Congress has more important things to do than address a  problem that might not exist for 4 years, if at all.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I am very troubled by this. I don't want to insult my  learned colleagues, but it plainly says in the legislation that IPAB  cannot ration healthcare, cannot raise taxes or increase deductibles  and copayments. Under the current law, section 1899A, 42 U.S.C. clearly  states: ``The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration  healthcare; raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums; increase  the cost sharing, including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments;  or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria.''                                time  1245    I regret I have to do that, because it is a direct contradiction of  what my good friends on the other side have told the country and what I  assume that they believe.   Mr. Speaker, Russia interfered with our 2016 election. That much is  clear from special counsel Mueller's investigation, which led to  indictments against two Trump campaign aides. The legitimacy of our  electoral system is at stake, and it is time the Republican-controlled  Congress sets aside the partisan politics and treats this threat with  the gravity it deserves.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up Representative Swalwell and Representative Cummings'  bill, which would create a bipartisan commission to investigate the  Russian interference in the 2016 election.  [[Page H8401]]    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, one of the worst political stories I have  heard in my lifetime is what we just talked about, the ``death panel,''  what it is going to do, even though it is prohibited by the written law  to do the things that it has been accused of being able to do. Most of  that, PolitiFact talked about the death panel part of it and said that  that was the 2009 lie of the year. But here we are, 8 years later, and  we keep hearing mistruths about the panel and its intent. The board is  about keeping Medicare growth in line, nothing more, nothing less.   So let's be honest about what the bill really is about: attacking the  Affordable Care Act. Regardless of what you think about the Independent  Payment Advisory Board, the Nation has immediate problems today that  deserve our attention, from healthcare to education, to infrastructure.   We should not be taking this valuable House time talking about a  board that may or may not come into existence 4 years from now. That is  not what we need to deal with today. So I urge a ``no'' vote on the  previous question and the rule.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that, I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, 33 days ago, funding for the Children's Health Insurance  Program, which 9 million children rely on for their healthcare and  well-being, expired after the program was allowed to lapse. States  crafted budgets, assuming Federal CHIP funding would arrive on time as  it has always done, and they are now scrambling to develop a patchwork  solution to keep the program alive.   Six States and the District of Columbia have warned they will run out  of funding by December, next month. Thirteen States say they will soon  have to tell enrollees they could lose coverage without immediate  congressional action. Utah officials have even considered sending  letters to enrollees as early as this week letting them know the  program is being forced to wind down.   The Kaiser Family Foundation has found that 32 States are expected to  run out of funding by March if Congress fails to act. I am glad we are  here today with a bill to reauthorize CHIP and other public health  programs, but they are woefully inadequate.   This bill is paid for by eviscerating funding from one of the most  important parts, again, of the Affordable  [[Page H8404]]  Care Act that helps to keep people well: the Prevention Fund. This fund  focuses on children's health, expanding access to lifesaving vaccines  and reducing the risk of lead poisoning, among many other things.   This is a particularly heartless cut when you consider that many  residents of Flint, Michigan, still can't get a clean glass of water  from the faucet or bathe in uncontaminated water 3 years after the  water crisis began. Children there in Flint will be forced to live for  the rest of their lives with impacts ranging from neurodevelopmental  damage and behavioral changes to hypertension and anemia, damage caused  by a government that failed to act.   If it fails to adequately fund Medicaid for Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands as they continue to try to rebuild following the  devastating recent hurricanes, that would be a compounding of the  tragedy. This bill fails to waive the requirement that both of those  islands match Federal investment before they can access any of the  Medicaid funding, and we don't deal with that at all, even for CHIP.   Seventy percent of Puerto Rico doesn't even have power 6 weeks after  Hurricane Maria hit. I am proud to say that a lot of New York utility  workers are down there now, and I am sure we will see results soon.  Residents of Puerto Rico are washing clothes and bathing in  contaminated streams and rivers, and drinking it as well. A million  people there still don't have any running water. They don't have the  ability to put up millions of dollars, either, to match these funds  because they are struggling to survive. We don't address that. These  are American citizens, and we have an obligation to help them.   These reauthorizations are a chance to really work together and  deliver, but we are worried about this opportunity because there is no  indication that this bill could pass the Senate with the cuts that it  has made to the Affordable Care Act. I am referring, of course, to the  ones that relate to preventive care. That would be a major tragedy.    As I have already said, so many States are right at the edge of not  being able to fund the program at all. Other States are ready to tell  both community health services and CHIP that they are no longer  providing for them.   This partisan approach will only delay the extension of the programs  even further. I consider that a major dereliction of our duties.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui), a distinguished member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my opposition to this rule  and to the underlying bill.   First, by the way, my colleague from California (Ms. Matsui) talked  about the Democratic substitute. But let's be clear, it is our  Republican colleagues, the majority, who would not make a Democratic  substitute in order that would allow us to come here to have a debate  on their proposal and what we proposed. How about that for democracy in  the United States House of Representatives? No Democratic substitute.   So let's leave that aside and focus on what we have here today.  Again, opposed to the rule, opposed to the bill.   The Children's Health Insurance Program is vital for millions of our  Nation's most vulnerable citizens--our children. The gentleman before  spoke about 9 million children. Yes. But do you know how long we have  waited for the majority to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance  Program? The length of time is shameful. But even more shameful is how  the majority intends to pay for the Children's Health Insurance  Program.   This is what the bill does. The bill includes massive cuts to  something called the Prevention and Public Health Fund. What is the  Prevention and Public Health Fund? It is inclusive of many of the  programs that we rely on in order to save lives.   Yes. They are the programs that go to help our community health  centers be able to treat people who come to their door. Twenty-three  million people in the United States use community health centers. It is  often their primary care.    But let me lay out for you what some of these programs are: the  Centers for Disease Control childhood vaccines--vaccinations and  immunizations for our kids being cut--lead poisoning prevention. You go  to any community in this country, and they will tell you whether it is  water or whether it is paint. Some of our children have the highest  levels of lead, and what we need to be doing is screening them at a  very early age so that we can address the issue. They cut this out,  also the Centers for Disease Control heart disease program, stroke and  diabetes programs, breastfeeding grants for hospitals, childhood  obesity prevention, and suicide prevention. We are looking today at an  opioid crisis in this Nation that so often results in suicides, and  they are willing to cut the heart out of the Prevention Fund programs  to fund the Children's Health Insurance Program.   So we are harming children at one end of the spectrum and robbing the  money from that end of the spectrum to pay for the Children's Health  Insurance Program, which I am a big supporter of. So we are stealing  from this prevention program.   Now today, my Republican colleagues have offered a tax cut proposal.  Take a hard look at it because the richest, the wealthiest, and those  with the most lobbyists are the biggest beneficiaries of these tax  cuts, and middle class working families will get the short end of the  stick. Those people who make over $1 million--several million dollars-- are going to get the benefit of the tax cut. Why aren't we taking that  money and paying to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program  rather than taking the money from the Prevention and Public Health  Fund?   So instead of providing tax cuts today for the richest 1 percent of  Americans, we could have a strong Children's Health Insurance Program,  and we could have a strong Prevention and Public Health Fund that does  not have to make these egregious cuts.   I think there is one more point that people need to know about this  bill. The bill cuts something that was in the Affordable Care Act--the  grace period. They cut that back to 30 days. That means if someone  misses one health insurance payment, they can lose their insurance for  the remainder of the year.   Today, our biggest economic challenge as a nation is that people are  in jobs that just don't pay them enough to live on. They can't afford  their healthcare. It is cruel, and it is a brazen attempt to undermine  the Affordable Care Act, which, quite frankly, has been the majority's  agenda for a very long time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Guthrie). The time of the gentlewoman  has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Connecticut  an additional 30 seconds.   Ms. DeLAURO. There is no need to play off children's health insurance  against the Prevention and Public Health Fund. There is no need to cut  back on the grace period for the folks who may miss one health  insurance payment.   So I urge my colleagues: don't be cruel; don't be inhumane. To those  of my colleagues who will say no to this, you stand on solid ground.  You stand with families in this Nation. You stand with children when  you say no to cuts that are going to hurt their lives.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), who is the distinguished ranking member of  the Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their  remarks to the Chair.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, let me make a proclamation here on  the floor of the House, and that is that all the sweat and tears of the  Democratic Members, although we offered the opportunity to our  Republican friends to do something about healthcare, all of our sweat  and tears proved to be a successful response to the 25 million  uninsured Americans.   No matter how much our friends on the other side of the aisle try to  nitpick and pick away at a successful affordable care program, they  simply cannot do it.   To the American people: It worked. It worked because we included and  supported healthcare for children with CHIP. It worked because we  supported and expanded community health centers. It worked because we  had IPAB, which is not going to be in effect until 2021 and not to do  anything but preserve Medicare.   On the other hand, today we have a pronounced tax bill that will  jeopardize the Medicare trust fund, will take millions and billions  away from Medicaid. The last hammer in the coffin will be the  destruction of the Children's Health Insurance Program and community  health clinics.   Let me be very clear: I happen to be in an area in the southern part  of Texas, from Corpus to Port Aransas, to Rockport, to Beaumont, to  Houston and Harris County, where Hurricane Harvey devastated our  community.   Healthcare is crucial. Many of our hospitals were under water. People  were not able to access healthcare. The community health clinics are  the best neighborhood source of healthcare.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, the legislation by my friends is to  destroy Peter to prop up Paul, rather than take the Pallone amendment-- which I want to thank Ms. Slaughter for offering in the Rules  Committee--to provide real funding and that would find a way to  effectively support the Children's Health Insurance Program and, of  course, the community health clinics, which, in the State of Texas, has  been a lifesaver for all of our communities.   We were the poster child for having the largest number--a quarter of  our people in Texas--who did not have health insurance. With the  Affordable Care Act and, of course, the community health clinics, we  were able to do it.   Let me finish by saying it was a bipartisan effort in 1997, with a  balanced budget, that we created the Children's Health Insurance  Program. It has been an effective, strong armor, if you will, around  children's health.   Everywhere I go, such as the Texas Children's Hospital, they are  raving about the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid.  Today or tomorrow, we are going to break that system by taking money  from somewhere else to destroy another healthcare program and putting  in this program.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, in May, the Republican majority recklessly passed  their healthcare repeal bill without any analysis at all from the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, finding out a month later that  it would have taken insurance away from 23 million people.   I fear the majority is going to make the same dangerous mistake with  their tax bill. The New York Times reported that some sections of the  bill released today are placeholders that will ``allow Republican  leaders to work out the details of a new set of revenue-raisers that  would be inserted in the bill before the full House votes on it''--in  other words, they will be a surprise.   After the Ways and Means Committee marks up the bill, they will  rewrite the bill in a back room and jam it through the House. It is  beyond irresponsible to vote on a bill of this magnitude without  knowing how it will impact hardworking Americans.   We employ dozens of well-qualified, nonpartisan expert economists and  public policy analysts with advanced degrees in the Congressional  Budget Office precisely for moments like this, and it appears the  majority is again, this year, prepared to move so fast that no Member  will have the benefit of their nonpartisan advice.   So if we can defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment  to the rule that will prevent this massive tax cut bill from coming to  the House floor unless nonpartisan analysis from the experts at the  Congressional Budget Office has been available for at least 2 days.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?  [[Page H8409]]    There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, we don't have time to spare playing games here with  the CHIP program. It is on life support in many States, with officials  scrambling to try to keep it alive. This is a program, you have heard  before, that 9 million children rely on.   And 2,800 community health centers are at risk of closing their doors  if we do not reauthorize the community health centers. That would leave  millions of people without healthcare, cost more than 50,000 jobs, and  already the centers nationwide have been forced to consider cutting  services following the majority's failure to reauthorize the program  before it expired on September 30.   Everybody knows that these centers do remarkable work. They deliver  quality care at lower cost. More than 330,000 veterans relied on them  for healthcare last year alone. They could be reauthorized under a  clean bill in seconds. Instead, the majority is putting them at risk  through this partisan bill, which seems unlikely to pass the Senate,  and we will then be nowhere.   If you want to know why only 13 percent of the public approves of  Congress under the leadership, just look at the bill before us today.  Republican leaders have turned even the most bipartisan programs into  endeavors that seem unlikely to become law.   They have disallowed the Democratic Party to have any substitute with  any other ideas that they did not have before so that we can, as Ms.  DeLauro mentioned, have an honest debate. We see that time after time  in the Rules Committee, the inability for our side to even get  amendments passed. But not to allow a substitute bill of this magnitude  is, I think, really a dereliction of duty. It speaks volumes about the  inability to get things done.   And lastly, Madam Speaker, I want to recognize George Agurkis. He is  sitting here with me. George has been on the Rules Committee staff for  9\1/2\ years. He is leaving us at the end of the week to take a  wonderful new job and new project. He is a Pennsylvania neighbor we  always could count on. He is a lot of fun. We are going to miss that  and his aunt, Rose, who works in the cloakroom. And we know that she  gives the best birthday parties in the world, and we don't know what we  are going to do. We hope that George will come back and celebrate those  with us and Rose will once again delight us with every kind of sweet  thing in the world.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        November 2, 2017, on page H8409, the following appeared: that  and his wife, Rose, who works in      The online version has been corrected to read: that and his  aunt, Rose, who works in    ========================= END NOTE =========================     So back to the bill at hand. I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous  question, on the rule, and on the bill, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
