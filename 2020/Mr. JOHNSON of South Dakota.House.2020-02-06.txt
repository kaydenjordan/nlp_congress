 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to  the misnamed Protecting the Right to Organize Act.   The American economy is thriving by almost any economic measure, and  it seems as though an important job of Congress would be to continue to  support the workers, the employers, and the jobs that have been  powering this, the longest economic expansion in American history.   What we shouldn't do is act to restrict State flexibility, worker  flexibility, and worker choice. Unfortunately, the PRO Act eliminates  the State's ability to decide that they want to be a right-to-work  State; and unfortunately, the PRO Act hurts the franchise sector by  imposing an aggressive new joint employer rule; and unfortunately, the  PRO Act hurts workers who are involved in the gig economy by enacting  unreasonable restrictions on who can be an independent contractor, and  how they can work.   Now, let's make no mistake about it. The impact of these changes  will, indeed, mean less freedom, less flexibility, and over time, it  will mean less prosperity. As a result, Mr. Chairman, I am voting  ``no.''
