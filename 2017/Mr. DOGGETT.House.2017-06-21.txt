 Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I would just ask the gentleman a couple  questions to underline a couple of the really important points you made  about the context in which this bill is considered, because while I  think every Democrat agrees with our colleague from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse) about the importance of civility and the importance of us  each taking responsibility for the tone here and certainly condemning  violence, condemning anyone who would suggest that if you come to the  rally and you protest that you ought to be beaten up by the people that  are there, the kind of thing that happened, unfortunately, last year,  that we should condemn all of that. Does the gentleman agree that the  House exercising vigorous oversight of the Administration when it  breaks its promises, when it mixes personal business with public  business, that this remains an important aspect of our job and no way  suggests a breach of civility?    If the gentleman would further yield, I heard a rather  bizarre comment last week in the aftermath of these shootings  suggesting that, in the aftermath of them, Democrats would be reaching  out to Republicans on healthcare, and I couldn't quite understand how  that could occur. Indeed, your comments about this particular set of  bills and the healthcare bill, isn't it a part of civility that we have  respect for one another and don't try to force through a bill with an  all-night, unnecessary session, not force through here a bill that  Republican Members say they didn't have time to read but then leave it  up there on the Speaker's desk for a month before even sending it to  the Senate? And if you have a legislative process where the majority  leader in the Senate says he won't even guarantee 10 hours to see a  huge bill that affects this much of the economy and the lives and the  livelihoods of millions of Americans, that that in itself is a breach  of the respect and the civility that we need to have in this Congress?    No. I served on the Ways and Means Committee. We could  not see the Republican House bill until hours before it came up.    It was under police guard downstairs so that even  Republicans, like Senator Rand Paul, couldn't get in and see the bill.   Then we have an all-night session without a single member of the  Trump Administration coming to respond to questions about it, while  every healthcare professional group that I have heard of opposed the  bill, not letting any of those people come to a hearing. I just suggest  that this is a breach of civility. That is a breach of respect. It is a  breach of the democratic process which we are all about. That needs to  be on the table and is as important as whether someone uses strong  language here in the House.    No. I think he has only wanted to listen to one side,  and I don't begin to think that even the Republican Members of this  House can contain President Trump. They seem to have sealed their lips  about it, and I wish they would speak out more.   But I think they can effect the processes in this House, and when  they pass a bill that President Trump says is ``mean, mean, mean,''  they need to go back and look at that process. And I see the same thing  happening, from what you have told us, about the two bills that are up  here.   Why is it that we have a process that is designed to exclude almost  half of the people in this House, to exclude their amendments, to give  them no opportunity to be heard at a markup, to bring in no witnesses  to defend the bill or to allow discussion of that bill? That is not  only not civil, not the democratic process, but it leads to worse  public policy.   Even if they have a majority to pass it, their ideas need to be  tested, and it allows them to perfect their legislation. That is the  way the democratic process is supposed to work. But with all the  secrecy, all the forced action, the tight timetables that are applying  here, they thwart our democratic process in a way that hurts all sides  and certainly impairs civility.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of  the House and offer the resolution that was previously noticed, asking  that it be read in full concerning President Trump's tax returns.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the resolution.   The Clerk read as follows:         Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that       the President shall immediately disclose his tax return       information to the House of Representatives and the American       people.        Whereas, President Nixon explained that ``People have got       to know whether or not their President is a crook'' when he       invited the Joint Committee on Taxation to audit his returns       after the Internal Revenue Service gave him an unwarranted       tax discount;        Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every       President since Gerald Ford has disclosed his tax return       information to the public;        Whereas, the Chairmen of the Committee on Ways and Means,       Joint Committee on Taxation, and the Committee on Finance       have the authority to request the President's tax returns       under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;        Whereas, pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the       Constitution, often referred to as the Origination Clause,       the House of Representatives has the sole authority to       initiate legislation that raises revenue for the national       government, and the Committee on Ways and Means is       considering a comprehensive reform of the Tax Code;        Whereas, according to media reports analyzing President       Trump's leaked 2005 tax return, we know that had his own tax       plan been in place, he would have paid an estimated mere 3.48       percent rate instead of a 24 percent rate, saving him $31.3       million;        Whereas, according to The New York Times, the President       used a legally dubious tax maneuver in 1995 that could have       allowed him to avoid paying any Federal taxes for 18 years;        Whereas, President Trump holds ``interests as the sole or       principal owner in approximately 500 separate entities,''       according to his attorneys, and the President's tax plan       proposes to cut the tax rate on such ``pass-through''       entities from 39.6 percent to 15 percent;        Whereas, one analysis estimated that President Trump would       personally save $6.7 million from two tax breaks included in       the Republicans' first tax cut, which they misleadingly call       the American Health Care Act;        Whereas, without the President's tax returns, the American       people cannot determine how much he will personally benefit       from proposed changes to the Tax Code;        Whereas, an ABCNews/Washington Post poll found that 74       percent of Americans would like President Trump to disclose       his tax returns and the most-signed petition on the White       House website calls for the release of the President's tax       return information to verify compliance with the Emoluments       Clause, with more than 1,097,000 signatures as of date of       this resolution;        Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns could       help those investigating Russian influence in the 2016       election better understand the President's financial ties to       the Russian Federation, Russian businesses, and Russian       individuals;        Whereas, after breaking his pledge to make his tax returns       available, President Trump instead presented a one-page       letter from a law firm giving him a clean bill of health on       any business dealings with Russians, but failed to note that       the very same law firm boasted of the ``prestigious honor''       of being named ``Russia Law Firm of the Year'' for 2016;        Whereas, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director       James Comey, before he was fired by President Trump, publicly       confirmed that the Bureau has been investigating potential       ties between President Trump's campaign and Russia since July       and that the Russian President Vladimir Putin favored a Trump       electoral victory;        Whereas, President Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor,       Jared Kushner, met during the Presidential transition at the       behest of the Russian Ambassador with Sergey N. Gorkov, a       graduate of a school run by the successor to the KGB and who       was appointed by Vladimir Putin to head a Russian state-owned       bank that is on the U.S. sanctions list;        Whereas, Mr. Kushner proposed establishing a secret back       channel of communications directly to Vladimir Putin, even       considering the use of Russian embassy facilities to do so;        Whereas, Attorney General Jeff Sessions falsely stated       during his Senate confirmation hearing that he ``did not have       communications with the Russians,'' when in fact he met at       least twice during the campaign with Russian Ambassador       Sergey Kislyak;        Whereas, former Director Comey testified before the Senate       Intelligence Committee that President Trump had asked him in       the Oval Office about ``letting Flynn go,'' referring to the       investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael       Flynn's business ties to Russia;        Whereas, President Trump stated on May 11, 2017, that he       had decided that he was going to fire Comey because of ``this       Russia thing'';        Whereas, former Director Comey, on June 8, 2017, testified       that Special Counsel Robert Mueller could investigate whether       President Trump's actions with regard to Director Comey and       the Flynn investigation constituted obstruction of justice;        Whereas, in 2013, President Trump said, ``Well, I've done a       lot of business with the Russians. They're smart and they're       tough,'' and President Trump's son, Donald Trump, Jr., told a       news outlet in 2008 that ``Russians make up a pretty       disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets'';        Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the       nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, the President has       refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses;        Whereas, the Director of the nonpartisan Office of       Government Ethics said that the President's plan to transfer       his business holdings to a trust managed by family members is       ``meaningless'' and ``does not meet the standards that . . .       every President in the past four decades has met'';        Whereas, the Emoluments Clause was included in the       Constitution for the express purpose of preventing Federal       officials from accepting any ``present, Emolument, Office, or       Title . . . from any King, Prince, or foreign state'';        Whereas, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.,       has hired a ``director of diplomatic sales'' to generate       high-priced business among foreign leaders and diplomatic       delegations;        Whereas, the Joint Committee on Taxation reviewed the tax       returns of President Richard Nixon in 1974 and made the       information public;        Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means used the authority       under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in       2014 to make public the confidential tax information of 51       taxpayers;        Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means has now voted       three times along party lines to continue to cover-up       President Trump's tax returns;        Whereas, the House of Representatives has now refused nine       times to act on President Trump's tax returns;        Whereas, the American people have the right to know whether       or not their President is operating under conflicts of       interest related to international affairs, tax reform,       Government contracts, or otherwise;        Whereas, the House of Representatives undermines its       dignity and the integrity of its proceedings by continuing       the cover-up of President Trump's tax returns: Now,       therefore, be it;        Resolved, That the House of Representatives shall--        1. Immediately request the tax return and return       information of Donald J. Trump for tax years 2006 through       2015, as provided under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue       Code of 1986, as well as the tax return and return       information with respect to the President's businesses of       each business entity disclosed by Donald J. Trump on his       Office of Government Ethics Form 278e, specifically each       corporation and each partnership within the meaning of       subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of       1986 where he is listed as an officer, director, or       equivalent, or exercises working control; and        2. Postpone consideration of tax reform legislation until       the elected Representatives of the American people in this       House have obtained President Trump's tax returns and return       information to ascertain how any changes to the Tax Code       might financially benefit the President.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Texas wish to  present argument on the parliamentary question whether the resolution  presents a question of the privileges of the House?    Mr. Speaker, I do wish to address the parliamentary  question and would appreciate the opportunity to speak at this time  about it.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized on the question  of order.    Mr. Speaker, I do wish to address the parliamentary  question and would appreciate the opportunity to speak at this time  about it.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized on the question  of order.    Mr. Speaker, you can certainly observe, as all the  Members can, the many troubling events that are reflected in the  resolution we just had read and why they do arise to the privileges of  the House.   Under clause 1 of rule IX, questions of the privileges of the House  are: ``those affecting the rights of the House collectively, its  safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.''   This resolution seeks to protect the integrity of the proceedings of  the House, and I believe that it is therefore privileged. There is just  not an issue that is more fundamental to the integrity of this House,  the people's House, than the faith the American people have in our  democracy.   That sacred faith is being undermined. It is under assault right now  by President Trump. This House must act to protect the integrity of its  proceedings.  [[Page H5014]]    Now, I know that there are many Members here who are eager to avoid a  direct up-and-down vote on the specific question of covering up the  Trump tax returns, and that there have been nine previous times when  Members have come to the floor and presented resolutions that were  focused on trying to get those returns and to end the coverup.   Recognizing the Speaker's prior rulings nine times against  considering this measure, I have, today, offered a different  resolution, taking a new approach that I bring to the Speaker's  attention. Unlike the last nine resolutions, my resolution does not  direct the Committee on Ways and Means to meet and consider action on  these secreted tax returns.   I believe it should not be ruled out of order on the grounds that  were used the previous nine times that this type of resolution was  blocked. This coverup of the Trump returns must end, and that is why I  have taken a different approach.   Pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the United States  Constitution, what we know as the Origination Clause, the House of  Representatives has the sole authority to initiate legislation that  raises revenue for the national government.   As the Speaker knows, that means the House Ways and Means Committee,  on which I serve, on which Mr. Pascrell, who I know wants to comment on  this point of order, is concerned, for this House to exercise with  integrity its authority to originate tax legislation. This is authority  that it solely possesses. The American people should know how the  President and his family might personally benefit from the tax  legislation, either in their direct personal income or through the many  business intermediaries with which they work. I believe some 500-plus  entities reported on their financial disclosure statement.   President Trump, we know, has bragged publicly about his ability to  bend the Tax Code to his whim in the past. He has said only he can  ``fix it.''   And the question is: Will he fix it for himself, or fix it for  working families? Will he enrich the middle class with jobs, or simply  enrich himself and other billionaires like him?   While recently Mr. Trump has provided us a single page of clues  concerning the contents of his tax plan that they now say will be  provided fully in September, he has not given us much detail. But he  does give us a few clues off that one page. One is his proposal to  repeal the alternative minimum tax. We know if that had been the law,  if that Trump proposal had been in effect for the one year, 2005, that  we have his return, he would have paid about the amount that an  employee does on their Social Security. It would have saved him $30  million.   I understand that there are many here that simply don't want to look  under the rock to see what is contained in those returns. And there are  many who believe that Mr. Trump is the golden ticket to more prized tax  breaks, to more ending of consumer protection, and they have been  rather quiet about the tax return issue, about the conflicts of  interest, and about the potential foreign collusion.   But after all the resolutions presented here on the floor, nine, plus  the amendments that I have offered in the Ways and Means Committee that  have been rejected, I can say that, while there has not been progress  yet on the House floor, there has been progress.   Mr. Trump has responded. He provided a one-page letter from a lawyer  that reviewed his tax returns, and that lawyer gave a Good Housekeeping  ``seal of approval'' to assure us--``to assure America he had no  business dealings with the Russians as a result of reviewing the  returns.''   What he did not say was that the same law firm had boasted of what  they call the prestigious honor of being named the ``Russia Law Firm of  the Year.'' I would just say today, in response specifically to the  point of order, that it is not sufficient to preserve the integrity of  this House to rely on the ``Russia Law Firm of the Year'' to be the  only entity that reviews these returns.                                time  1345    I believe that we can do better; that we must protect the dignity of  the House.   According to Mr. Trump himself, he is already being investigated for  obstruction of justice. It is important for us to have the tax returns  on tax reform. It is important to have it on the Russia investigation.   And, you know, there is hardly an hour that goes by, certainly a day  that goes by, that there is not some additional information. When I  opened The Washington Post this morning, right there on the front  page----   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman must confine his remarks to  the question of privilege.    Certainly.   And one of those aspects of the question of privilege is how  conflicts of interest interface with what we are doing here in the  House. I mentioned the tax returns and the Russia investigation, but  there is a new one out today, and that is in the budget. I assume  eventually we are going to have a budget resolution presented here,  though it is very late this year. But when we take up that budget  resolution and we take up the appropriation bills, The Washington Post  reports that, while there have been significant cuts in the Housing and  Urban Development budget, as many people cannot afford housing--   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman must confine his remarks to  the question of the privileges of the House.    I would do nothing else, Mr. Speaker.   And this particular example shows how the proceedings of the House  would be impaired if the only aspect of the budget that increases HUD  is one from which Mr. Trump personally benefits, which is what the Post  is reporting, and so we need the returns in order to see that.   Like so many other broken promises, we will not get these returns  voluntarily. I believe that the House needs to act. Unlike Sally Yates,  unlike the U.S. attorney in New York, and unlike James Comey, he can't  fire us, and we don't have to be accessories to a coverup.   I call on this House to protect the integrity of its proceedings,  including the integrity of our unique constitutional authority over tax  legislation, by declaring that this resolution is in order. This  resolution simply calls on the House to secure the tax return and  return information on Mr. Trump and his businesses. It further declares  that, in order to preserve the integrity of the House, we will not be  taking up tax reform legislation, which we certainly need to take up,  and we have ideas to offer and to cooperate in trying to see reform of  our taxes, but not do it until we have had an opportunity to review  thoroughly Mr. Trump's tax returns and return information to ascertain  how he may personally benefit.   I would hope that the Speaker, considering my comments, as well as  those that I know Mr. Pascrell wants to offer, would be ruling that we  can have that straight up-and-down vote, no hiding behind a rock, let  us look under the rock.   I appreciate the Speaker giving me this opportunity to emphasize the  very significant importance of this question to the integrity of the  House and to the future of the American people and our democracy.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on  the question of order?    Mr. Speaker, I most reluctantly, after the Speaker's  careful consideration of this, must appeal the ruling of the Chair.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the  Chair stand as the judgment of the House?                               Motion to Table     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15- minute vote on the motion to table will be followed by 5-minute votes  on ordering the previous question on House Resolution 392; and on  adoption of House Resolution 392, if ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 227,  nays 188, answered ``present'' 1, not voting 14, as follows:                               [Roll No. 311]                                 YEAS--227       Abraham      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)  [[Page H5016]]        Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
