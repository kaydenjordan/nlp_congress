 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Scott for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to S. 140, which would strip  protections from workers who are employed by a Tribally-owned business  but are not Tribal members. This includes protection from harassment  and discrimination in the workplace.   Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employers from  discriminating against employees, does not apply to Tribal enterprises.  A non-Tribal worker employed by a Tribally-owned casino, for example,  cannot file a harassment or discrimination claim in Federal court or  with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Instead, collective  bargaining agreements fill the gap by including provisions that enforce  their right to a fair workplace.   By stripping their collective bargaining rights, this legislation  eliminates the only recourse that these workers have against  discrimination and harassment. This is one of the many unacceptable  consequences of this bill.   Now, I have two letters. One from the International Brotherhood of  Teamsters and one from the American Federation of State, County, and  Municipal Employees, both of which raise strong objections to the  majority's attempt to exclude workers from the rights enshrined in the  National Labor Relations Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include these letters in the Record.                                          International Brotherhood                                                    of Teamsters,                                   Washington, DC, December 6, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members       of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, I am again       writing to  [[Page H117]]       express our strong opposition to H.R. 986, the Tribal Labor       Sovereignty Act. This legislation would exempt all Tribally-      owned and -operated commercial enterprises on Indian lands       broadly defined from the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).       We urge you to vote no when the House considers this       legislation.        If H.R. 986 were to become law, hundreds of thousands of       workers at these enterprises, including Teamsters, would be       stripped of their protections and rights under the NLRA,       including the right to organize and collective bargaining. It       would deprive both Tribal members and non-member employees of       the right to form or join unions and to bargain collectively       for better wages, hours, and working conditions. We should be       working to expand the rights and ability of workers to earn a       decent living for themselves and their families and to secure       a safe and healthy workplace.        While Tribal casinos have been the focus of discussion,       this legislation affects not just casino workers. Since the       1980's Tribes have expanded business interests beyond       casinos. They now operate many different revenue producing       commercial enterprises--construction companies, mining       operations, and power plants, to hotels, water parks and ski       resorts, to name a few.        In 2004, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) (in San       Manuel) ruled that Tribal casino workers should have NLRA       protections. Shortly after the San Manuel decision,       legislation, in the form of amendments, was twice offered to       block the NLRB from enforcing the San Manuel decision.        These amendments were rejected. Since then, the NLRB has       proceeded in a measured fashion asserting jurisdiction on a       case-by-case basis. The NLRB will not assert jurisdiction       where it would interfere with internal governance rights in       purely intramural matters or abrogate treaty rights.       Otherwise, the NLRB will protect workers' rights at tribally       owned enterprises by asserting jurisdiction. With its case-      by-case approach, San Manuel takes a careful approach to       balancing of tribal sovereignty interests with Federal labor       law.        It should be noted that other important federal laws that       protect workers apply to Indian businesses, such as the       Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Fair Labor Standards       Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and Title       III of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Indeed, courts       have denied attempts to gain exemptions on numerous occasions       ruling commercial tribal enterprises should not be excluded       from such laws. NLRA rights and protections should not be       treated differently.        Proponents assert that they are seeking the same exemption       as state and local governments. However, this is inaccurate,       The NLRA only exempts actual government employees and not       private sector employees performing contracted out government       functions. Also, a substantial majority of workers at these       enterprises are not Indian or Tribe members, and thus have no       ability to influence tribal governance, since non-tribal       members are prohibited from petitioning a tribe.        The bill could also undermine enforcement of existing labor       contracts and the decision workers made to organize and       bargain collectively. When a collective bargaining agreement       expires, a Tribe could unilaterally terminate the       relationship with the union without consequence under the       NLRA. The employer's obligation. to bargain could be       eliminated.        Employees of tribal enterprises have no constitutional       rights to protect against employers. Only the NLRA gives them       free speech rights. Absent the NLRA they have no protection.       Workers cannot be left without any legally enforceable right       to form unions and bargain collectively just because they are       employed at tribally owned enterprise.        Finally, the United States requires its trading partners to       implement and abide by internationally recognized labor       standards, while H.R. 986 deprives workers at these tribal       enterprises of these core rights--the right to organize and       bargain collectively.        To focus solely on the NLRA raises the question of the true       motivation for this legislation. It is regrettable that the       principle of tribal sovereignty is being used to cloak an       attack on the basic rights of workers to organize and bargain       collectively. The Teamsters Union respects tribal       sovereignty. However, we do not believe that this principle       should be used to deny workers their collective bargaining       rights and freedom of association. We urge you to oppose the       Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act and to VOTE NO on H.R. 986 when       the legislation comes to a vote in the House of       Representatives.            Sincerely,                                                    James P. Hoffa,      General President.                                   ____           American Federation of State, County and Municipal             Employees, AFL-CIO,                                   Washington, DC, January 9, 2018.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I am writing to urge to oppose S. 140, as       currently amended to expand the exemption of employers under       the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).        S. 140, as amended, is Just another attempt at passing the       so-called Tribal Sovereignty Act, which would deny protection       under the NLRA to many workers employed by tribal-owned and -      operated enterprises on Indian land. A great majority of       these workers are not Native Americans and in recent years       there has been a substantial expansion of enterprises that       would be impacted by this legislation, including not only       casinos, but mining operations, power plants, saw mills, ski       resorts, high-tech firms, hotels, and spas.        AFSCME supports the principle of sovereignty for tribal       governments, but does not believe that this principle should       be used to deny workers their collective bargaining rights       and freedom of association. We oppose any effort to exempt on       an across-the-board basis all tribal enterprises from the       NLRA, without regard to a specific review of all the       circumstances, as is currently provided by National Labor       Relations Board (NLRB) standards. Workers must not be left       without any legally enforceable right to form unions and       bargain collectively, especially in instances where they are       working for commercial operations competing with other       businesses.        AFSCME strongly urges you to oppose S. 140, as amended,       when it comes before the House for a vote.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,                            Director of Federal Government Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this  legislation.
