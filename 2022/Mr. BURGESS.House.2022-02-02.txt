 Madam Speaker, we had a colleague several years ago, Jim  McDermott from Washington State, a Democrat. The Republicans were in  the majority. Republicans, during the week of April 15, wanted to put  forward a bill on the floor of the House but didn't quite have it  together, so they put together a sense of Congress resolution on  fundamental tax reform.                                time  1245    I will never forget Dr. McDermott in the well of the House,  thundering against Republicans:   [[Page H351]]              You want tax reform, and this is the best you can do, a       sense of Congress resolution?        Why don't you just send a get-well card to the IRS?    Madam Speaker, let me tell you something: Republicans on the Energy  and Commerce Committee have been agitating, asking, and trying to work  with Federal agencies to get answers on the origin of the coronavirus  and answers on the origin of the pandemic. So, here we have the China  bill before us today, ironically, on Groundhog's Day, but here is the  China bill, and by golly, we are going to get to the bottom of the  coronavirus pandemic.   What do we get? We get section 30219B, ``Report on origins of the  COVID-19 pandemic.''   Now, what does the next line say? ``Sense of Congress. It is the  sense of Congress that,'' blah, blah, blah.   In other words, no force of law, no teeth, no requirement of any  Federal agency to do anything, no requirement really for even a real  investigation, which is what honestly we need.   We are sitting on the eve of Olympic Games that are going to be held  in Communist China, and we don't have answers for what caused this  pandemic. We are going to have a moment of silence later this week-- appropriately so, another milestone of lives lost--but we don't know  about the origins of this virus.   Let me tell you something else, Madam Speaker. Last night in the  Rules Committee, I tried to get one of Dr. Wenstrup's very thoughtful  amendments included. He has an amendment that says that this gain-of- function research that was carried out might be pretty dangerous; we  need to think about where it is conducted; and we shouldn't use United  States taxpayer dollars to fund this research in countries that are our  adversaries.   I offered that amendment on behalf of Dr. Wenstrup, and every  Democrat member of the Rules Committee said: Oh, it is good with us.  You go ahead and send those dollars over there and do this research.   We have this new W visa for startups that is language in the bill.  There is no language about protecting American jobs, but we are going  to give jobs to other people.   We are already funding the U.N. Green Climate Fund for $100 million  directly to China, and this bill gives them another $8 billion for that  same purpose.   Madam Speaker, $3 billion for a slush fund for solar manufacturing-- some of us have been in this body long enough to remember some  unpleasant activity with that in a stimulus bill in 2009.   This bill supposedly provides over $300 billion in new spending. And  I say ``supposedly'' because no one knows. No one really knows. We have  heard this bill in the Rules Committee, not in the authorization  committees, but in the Rules Committee with no CBO score. We are flying  blind.   We are approving this 3,000-page bill today having had it for a  little less than 72 hours. As you can see from the start of this, Madam  Speaker, the language is still being hammered out. It wasn't quite  right as it came to the floor last night from the Rules Committee.   This is a bad idea. We ought to take our time and do it right because  this is important, and people do want us to do this right.   It does appear that, right now, the Democratic leadership of this  House is more concerned with politics than policy, and that is so  unfortunate because we have an opportunity here to actually do  something right.
