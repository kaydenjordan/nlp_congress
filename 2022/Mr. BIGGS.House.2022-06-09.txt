 Madam Speaker, do you ever wonder how many of our  colleagues in the Democrat aisle receive  [[Page H5426]]  Bloomberg money to advocate for taking away Americans' Second Amendment  rights? I do.   You hear about the NRA. You sure don't want to confess the Bloomberg  donations that you receive as you emasculate America's rights. Yet, we  hear about your polling. But you know what, 6 in 10 Americans,  including almost half of Democrats, support armed officers and leaders  at schools to protect their children. Democrats oppose that.   We hear about due process. Due process doesn't mean you have an ex- parte hearing by an undisclosed informant who comes in and says, Look,  we think this person is a danger to themselves or others, when the  undisclosed informant has a grudge or an axe to grind. That is why you  have 8,000 of those in Florida.   Due process doesn't mean we take away your rights and then you get to  petition to have those rights reinstated. No, this bill is designed  specifically to get around the laws that are present in 50 States that  do address due process and do address people who are a danger to  themselves and society. This bill is ripe for abuse.   Some States have enacted similar laws. In Connecticut, for example,  nearly a third of all ex-parte orders are overturned once a judge hears  both sides of the story.   And why is that? You have already taken away their rights. But almost  a third of them are overturned.   In a markup last week, there was some confusion as to what due  process means. It does not mean that you can deprive an individual of  their rights first and then later let them have a hearing to reinstate  those rights. But that is what this bill does. Deprivation first, a  hearing later.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to take a few minutes.   The first point I will talk about, the most fundamental aspect that  this needs to be contextualized with is that the Democrats have  basically corrupted every institution in America, not the least of  which is this institution, not the least of which are the committees  and the roles of committees.   The gentleman from Pennsylvania said this is a show trial. He is  exactly right. This is designed for television. It is not designed to  find truth. It is not designed to say, let's come up with a legitimate  legislative purpose, which is what the Supreme Court says you have to  have if you are going to have a subpoena in the first place. You have  to have a legitimate purpose. They don't have any.   So these are the same folks that sit on this committee, that are  running this committee. Don't forget, they ran the two sham  impeachments. The last sham impeachment was such a debacle, such an  embarrassment to our institutions and the Constitution that the Chief  Justice of the Supreme Court said, I am not going to show up.   So who do we have and what do we see? Well, they are not going to  talk about tonight that four witnesses--four witnesses have testified  under oath that 4 days before January 6, President Trump authorized up  to 20,000 National Guard troops. Why won't they present that? Because  it is indicia of what we would call in law the mens rea or culpability,  your state of mind. And the state of mind said, we have to protect the  Capitol.                                time  1330    What that means is there is no intention to incite. There is no  intention to cause harm. But you are not going to hear about that, even  though that has been testified to four different times.   The FBI has indicated pretty clearly that there was no collusion by  President Trump to incite a riot on January 6. In fact, no collusion by  President Trump or by any Member of Congress.   In fact, FBI Director, Christopher Wray, testified in the Committee  on the Judiciary that he could not call what happened there an  insurrection. But that is not what you are going to hear from the  Democrats because they love that term, because they are all about  hyperbole.   How about our former colleague, Denver Riggleman, a former Republican  working for this committee? What did he say? Just the other day, he  said: ``There is no smoking gun indicating that President Trump planned  for the U.S. Capitol to be overrun by his supporters.'' But you are not  going to hear that because this is--as they have accidentally said a  couple of times--not about finding the truth but about narrative- building, and distracting the American public from the disaster that  the Biden administration, Speaker Pelosi and her Democrats in the  House, Chuck Schumer and his Democrats in the Senate, has perpetrated,  has foisted upon the American people.   So you know what the Democrats want? They don't want us talking  about: It costs me 85, 90 bucks to fill up my car with gas.   They don't want you talking about that.   They don't want you talking about: Hey, the size of that pack of  tortillas that I just bought last week before it came out, they used to  look like the regular corn tortillas. Now they look like mini  tortillas. Same price, the same packaging.   They don't want you talking about that.  [[Page H5442]]    They don't want you talking about: Hey, kids, we are not going to be  able to go on vacation this year.   They don't want you talking about any of that because that is what  Americans are talking about.   They don't want you talking about the border. They don't want you  talking about that.   When I was down to the border twice last week--two different borders,  three different sectors--everywhere I walked, there were people coming  up. You know what these folks told me? They said, ``We love Joe  Biden.'' In fact, in Mexico he has got a 52 percent approval rating,  while he is only 32 percent in the United States.   They want us to not talk about that stuff. They want to distract us.  But the bad news for them is this: The reason you have to bring in an  ABC producer is because your show stinks and that committee reeks, and  no amount of production is going to give Liz Cheney charisma. Sorry to  say. No amount of it is going to change and take that apart.   I know that there are others who want to talk about this but I just  have to ask four or five things, if I can, Mr. Perry.    Why is Nancy Pelosi off limits? Why isn't she testifying  before that committee?   Oh my goodness, we can't ask her what happened. We can't ask her what  she knew, what she didn't know.   We can't ask her why she didn't approve and encourage Mayor Bowser to  accept the authorized and offered 20,000 National Guard troops.   Why has the committee not released 14,000 hours of video of January  6? Why is that missing?   Why has the committee selectively, without appropriate context,  leaked documents or testimony?   Why did Adam Schiff come out here and put up a poster and later have  to admit that, yeah, he had doctored the poster?   Because they are lying. They altered evidence, as Mr. Perry said.   I will just close with this: Committee member, Jamie Raskin, he loves  to say that anybody who questions an electoral outcome of 2020 is  telling the big lie.   Of course, he questioned the 2016 election outcome. Was that the big  lie? Hillary Clinton questioned that.   Joe Biden has already said the 2022 midterms are going to be  illegitimate. Why? Because he is going to get his butt kicked, that is  why.   I will tell you something. Jamie Raskin selectively edited video he  used in the second Trump impeachment just a few days before the  President was going to be vacating the Oval Office. If anyone is  persisting in telling a big lie, it is members of the J6 Committee.   That is why they have to bring in a producer. That is why they  deleted the tweet from their star witness from tonight. And what did he  say back then? He said the Proud Boys were organizing together.   How many police were there at 11:22 on the steps of the Capitol? I  Count 1.   This is a deliberate act. And he wasn't talking about the people who  came in. He said someone in authority left the door open and the mob  walked in. That is their witness tonight. They deleted that text.   This is an illegitimate committee. You are going to see illegitimacy  on display meant to deceive the American people. That is what happens  in former Soviet Union. That is what happens in Venezuela. That is what  happens whenever tyrants and authoritarians get a little bit of power  or think they have any.    Madam Speaker, as I watch what this January 6th Committee  has done, as it unfolds, and the constant attack of President Trump,  here is what I find interesting: It wasn't too very long ago that Chuck  Schumer stood with a rabble attacking the United States Supreme Court.  Chuck Schumer said: We are going to come up on you like, Justices  Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, like a whirlwind. You will know.   He made threatening comments. And guess what? Last night, there was  an assassination attempt. A gentleman has been arrested for attempted  murder of Justice Kavanaugh. Not a peep from the President, not a peep  from Nancy Pelosi, not a peep from anybody here.   You had a President who said let's march peacefully up to the  Capitol. Let's let them know you are here. Let's fight for our rights.  Somehow, that is incitement.   That is not incitement, but this committee that is there, they don't  care about the truth. They don't care about equity. I don't even like  saying that term, ``equity.'' How about equality before the law? They  never are concerned with due process or equality before the law. That  is a political, sham, narrative-building exercise to divert the  attention of the American people away from the disastrous Biden  policies.
