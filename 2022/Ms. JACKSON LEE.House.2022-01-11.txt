 Mr. Speaker, ``We the people of the United States,  in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure  domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the  general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and  our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United  States of America.''   Formulated by the people of the United States to create a more  perfect union--we know these words. They are the core of our being. Our  Nation of over 300 million people embraces diversity and individualism,  has birthed a citizenry that speaks many languages, holds a plethora of  deep religious beliefs, or none, and practices customs and traditions  originating on distant shores.   We are unique. African Americans, in particular, have a unique  history embedded in slavery, discrimination, and the denial of our  rights, but voting rights have been our refuge.   Today I rise and say there is no option other than passing the John  Robert Lewis Voting Rights Advancement  [[Page H15]]  Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. There is no option. We do not just  survive; our Nation thrives because of our shared belief that helps us  against all odds. It helped us in World War I and World War II and the  conflicts in and around. It helps us in wars where we have lost our  young men and women.   We have a country formed out of many to become one people. Americans  share the same compact that we are a nation of laws that flow from the  most crucial and fundamental law, the Constitution of the United  States.   The impact of the Constitution and its basic premise can be  summarized by the simple belief that every individual is entitled to an  equally valid vote.   We saw in 2020 that fragile vote that saw the largest turnout in any  Presidential election in the history of the United States--that is a  very long time--challenged from its very beginning, challenged on the  day of the election, continued to be challenged and misrepresented and  distorted, and election officials attacked and intimidated, even  removed from office.   So I stand today on the shoulders not only of Dr. Martin Luther King,  who I view, in fact, as a modern-day prophet; and our own colleague,  John Robert Lewis; but I stand on the shoulders of a widow, Coretta  Scott King, who I got to know in the aftermath of her husband's death.  She worked without ceasing to have his principles, his values, his  understanding of the ``beloved community'' recognized and to continue  the sense of the rightness and righteousness of voting.   I had the privilege of working for the Southern Christian Leadership  Conference. It will always be a special part of my history. I had the  privilege of working with individuals with names that we know, the  young Hosea Williams, James Orange, some of the generals and foot  soldiers that were in the army of Dr. Martin Luther King's beloved  America.   Yes, I had the privilege--I call it that--of walking on plantations  to try to register Black sharecroppers frightened and intimidated,  though dignified, to vote. Their intimidation was real because those  who owned the general store or the plantation were not eager for those  Blacks in the South to vote or for those Hispanics and others who  worked, as Dr. King worked, with Cesar Chavez and the farmworkers. They  were not eager for them to vote.   Today, as we are about to watch as a step is to be made, both in  terms of the speech of a President and Vice President but the actual  vote in the Senate, we cannot isolate ourselves to focus on one or two  persons. We really have to focus on who we are as a Nation, that this  vote binds us together. It is the voice of the people.    And the Constitution, it trumps any figment of our imagination that  may consider something legitimate. The filibuster is not legitimate. It  is a rule of one body of this Congress. It is a rule that we adhere to,  as civil people do. We adhere to rules. We adhere to those in this  House. I agree with that until a rule is used to trump and deny the  basic constitutional values of the 14th Amendment and the Fifth  Amendment of due process and equality, as it was utilized in the 20th  century by segregationist Senators to deny civil rights laws.   Mr. Speaker, it is important that I stand here today on Coretta's  name and Martin's name and Bobby's name and John's name, that we must  demand courage. To not vote for the Voting Rights Act is not an option.  I will not allow that to happen because I will stand with every breath  in my body to ensure that the American people can vote without  intimidation, and they will be intimidated without the laws of the John  R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and as well the Freedom to Vote  Act.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, spoken like my good friend from  Colorado, Mr. Perlmutter--who I really insist that he remain in this  body for his astuteness and his way of analyzing--might I just take a  quick moment to say that the schools of America are open. But today,  the hospitalization rate for omicron is the highest ever since we have  had COVID-19.   And so I believe that school superintendents, teachers, parents, and  others--like Madam Speaker--are making decisions for our children to be  in school but also to be safe.   Madam Speaker, I move on these two very important legislative  initiatives, H.R. 1836 and H.R. 4673. I thank the gentleman from  Colorado. I thank my good friend who has served in the United States  military from Pennsylvania. I thank him for his service as well.   Madam Speaker, I rise enthusiastically on this legislation for a  number of reasons, but more importantly, I have worked extensively with  the Guard, particularly the Texas National Guard. We in Texas can  sometimes be called disaster alley as it relates to hurricanes and  tornadoes, as it relates to COVID-19. And alongside of us on those  battles, if you will, saving lives have been the National Guard. We are  grateful for their service. They are citizen soldiers.   I think we don't acknowledge that what the Guard is is individuals  who put on the uniform, leaving being a bus driver or a teacher or a  mechanic, lawyer or doctor; and in doing so, they sacrifice and leave  their families. So I am excited about H.R. 1836 by Mr. Levin because  right now in terms of education, it is Active Duty, those individuals  in active military service, including full-time training and annual  [[Page H26]]  training. But H.R. 1836 will expand the eligibility criteria to include  those training in full-time National Guard duty. They are on the front  lines.   In my hospital during COVID-19, it was the Guard that came as nurses  and support systems when we were literally overwhelmed with patients.  It is the Guard that is coming back again to be able to help us now  that we are also at the peak. Texas Children's Hospital seeing more  sick COVID-19-impacted children in their history, the Guard is vital.   And I would just say that this is not about data. It is about the  lives of our Guard. And I want to move to say how important it is to  get our young soldiers on to the healthcare system under the bill of  Mr. Takano as quickly as they come out. It is not about data, it is  about saving lives.   And that leads me to Governor Abbott's untimely and wrong policies in  Texas. I will be seeking an official investigation from the department  in Washington, the Secretary of Defense and the Pentagon.    Madam Speaker, the issue is very clear. In his  wrongheaded dispatching of our guard to the border--of course, this is  a Federal responsibility, the southern border--we now have documented  crises, guards committing suicide, guards not getting their paychecks,  and guards having their education tuition slashed. Yes, that is what is  happening in the State of Texas.   Madam Speaker, I am a fighter for the Guard. They have worked without  ceasing and question. And I demand that this Congress, this Committee  on Armed Services, the Pentagon, investigate when the commander of a  particular State abuses those individuals who have put on the uniform  as citizen soldiers and who are in desperate need of our help.   Suicide? Not getting your paychecks timely because you are  dispatching people to the border without order and without  understanding?   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation, but I am calling upon my  colleagues to help me, help these young soldiers with family members  who, at this point as we stand here, are not getting the kind of  treatment equating to their dignity, their service, and their  sacrifice.   Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the Rule for House  consideration of H.R. 1836, Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act, and  H.R. 4673, EVEST Act.   I thank Rules Committee Chairman McGovern for shepherding this  legislation to the floor.   I also thank House Veterans Committee Chair Mark Takano, for his  stewardship of the committee and unwavering commitment to our nation's  veterans.   H.R. 1836, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act will expand  eligibility criteria for certain education benefits.   Current law defines the term ``active duty'' as those individuals who  are on full-time duty in the active military service of the United  States, including full-time training duty, annual training duty, and  attendance, while in the active military service, at a school  designated as a service school by law or by the Secretary of the  military department concerned.   H.R. 1836, will expand eligibility criteria to include those training  in fulltime National Guard duty, which includes the National Guard, the  Army National Guard, and the Air National Guard, as well as those same  members when performing active duty.   H.R. 4673, the EVEST Act, would forward the goal of seamless  enrollment in health care coverage.   Specifically, this bill will require the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA) to automatically enroll new veterans into VA health care,  and notify veterans of their enrollment and instructions on how to un- enroll, if desired.   I rise today to pay tribute to all the men and women who have served  in the Armed Forces of the United States and risked their lives to  defend our freedoms and way of life and took and lived the oath to  ``support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all  enemies, foreign and domestic'' and bore true faith and allegiance to  the same, an obligation they took freely, without any mental  reservation or purpose of evasion.   Veterans are truly heroes walking among us.   I want to thank all of our armed serviceman and women for their  selfless dedication to our protection every day.   Today's Rule includes a very important bill that provides for our  nation's reservists, H.R. 1836, Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act.  When it is signed into law it will repair a disparity issue by placing  the Guard and Reserve on equal footing with regards to GI bill  benefits.   This Rule, in which we further the benefits and recognition that our  veterans deserve, also reminds us that we have an overriding duty to  protect the health and dignity of those service today.   For this reason, I would like to discuss the actions of the Texas  Governor, because he is taking whatever steps he can to prevent local  jurisdictions and municipalities in Texas from promulgating and  enforcing any mandate that may be necessary to respond to and mitigate  the substantial threat posed by the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.   It is no exaggeration to say that Executive Orders issued by the  Texas Governor have consigned thousands of Texans to needless death and  suffering.   According to virtually all public health experts, these deaths and  suffering could be alleviated by taking the simple but life-saving  precautions of getting a vaccination shot, wearing a protective face  covering, and maintaining recommended social distancing.   To date, the COVID-19 virus has afflicted more than 35.3 million  persons in the United States and more than 5.09 million Texas.   In Harris County alone, the number is approaching 753,000 cases and  already 9,821 persons have died of the virus, which represents more  than 10 percent of the 76,839 Texas lives claimed by this lethal  disease.   To exacerbate matters, in March 2021, the Texas Governor launched the  ill-fated and ineffective Operation Lone Star which he claimed was  necessary to stem a so-called invasion of migrants at Texas' southern  border.   As of November 2021, more than 10,000 Texas National Guardsmen have  been deployed to the southern border in pursuit of this folly.   According to published media accounts, National Guard members who  have been activated for Operation Lone Star are experiencing habitual  pay delays and poor working conditions during the border mission,  including being exposed to COVID-19, and many are missing the equipment  necessary for safety and mission success.   Finally, just last week the Texas Governor filed a frivolous lawsuit  in federal court challenging the authority of President Biden, the  Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to require that members of the  National Guard be vaccinated against COVID-19.   There is no merit to this nuisance law suit as demonstrated by the  summary rejection of similar arguments raised by neighboring Oklahoma  Governor Stitt.   The Texas Governor's failure to comply with the policies intended to  reduce the spread of COVID-19 among the Armed Forces will mean that  there will be less military personnel available national disasters that  have struck Texas in recent years, such as the winter freeze of last  year.   This will also mean that there are fewer personnel to respond to any  attacks on the homeland.   Encouraged by Governor Abbott's obstinacy, about 40 percent of the  members of the Texas Army National Guard are refusing to get  vaccinated, which puts at risk their colleagues and the persons they  are sworn to defend and protect.   This Rule governs debate of excellent and common-sense bills that  will enhance the respect and benefits of our servicemen and women.   We must also act to ensure that our servicemen and women are  protected from COVID-19, both for their own safety and the safety of  our nation.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to salute the late  majority leader, Harry Reid, who served his Nation for 48 years in  public service by appointment or election. But Harry Reid can be more  than the public service that he has given. He is and was a true  patriot, a family man, and someone who cared enough to not only secure  this Nation but to mentor and to love his State and to love America.   Thousands--no, millions of Americans, at all economic levels, have  healthcare because of Harry Reid. Nevada was prevented from being a  nuclear waste dumping ground because of Harry Reid. And I stood by him,  glad to have known him--I, as a member of the United States House; he,  then in the United States Senate.   It is with deep sympathy that I offer to his family and friends and  the people of Nevada for he truly was an American patriot--tough, but  strong and kind. And may I say, he served as a U.S. Capitol Hill police  officer. What a man--a boxer, but always a patriot.   May he rest in peace and may he know that his 48 years--44 of them in  the United States Congress--counts toward his historical mark of  changing America, making America the place where no matter who you are  you have an opportunity to succeed and to overcome. He did that and  helped others as well.   Thank you to patriot Majority Leader Harry Reid. May he rest in peace  and may he rest in power.                            ____________________
