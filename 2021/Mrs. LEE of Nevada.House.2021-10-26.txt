 Madam Speaker, I rise today, not alone, but on  the shoulders of hundreds of advocates and activists leading the charge  to fight this climate crisis with the urgency it demands.   Over the past couple months, I have stood here almost every week  calling for bold investments in clean energy infrastructure and climate  solutions in the Build Back Better Act.   But I know when we pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the  Build Back Better Act, it will be because of the efforts of so many  advocates.   For years, Nevadans from the Nevada Conservation League, the League  of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, Chispa, the Environmental  Defense Fund, and Battle Born Progress and so many other hardworking  organizations have come together to demand climate action.   Now, thanks to your hard work, I am confident that we will pass  historic investment in clean energy infrastructure and build back  better for our future.   The time to act on climate is now.                            ____________________
