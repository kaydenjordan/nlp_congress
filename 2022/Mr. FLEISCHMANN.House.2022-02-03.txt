 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of  Mr. Robert C. ``Bob'' White.   For 11 years, Bob has served the people of Tennessee's Third  Congressional District, first as my field representative, then as my  deputy district director, and finally, as my senior adviser.   Bob has been instrumental in helping myself and my office do the  people's work in the House of Representatives.   Bob retired last month from his career in public service. Throughout  his tenure as a public servant, he ceaselessly showed what we are all  here to do: to serve our constituents, those who have elected us to  represent them in Congress.   Madam Speaker, I thank Bob for his service, friendship, and devotion  to our State and Nation. I wish him success in the next chapter of his  illustrious career.                            ____________________
