 Mr. Speaker, sheriffs from across the country are in  D.C. this week, and they have a simple message for Congress: Secure the  border.   These sheriffs know that border security will help stem the flow of  illegal drugs and human trafficking which affect communities all across  the country.   The sheriffs warn that a new demand from my colleagues across the  aisle could mean over 8,000 criminals would have to be released by  authorities.   They wrote: ``This dangerous Congressional proposal not only  jeopardizes the risk of our national security, but hinders our law  enforcement officers from effectively enforcing and upholding the law  and protecting their communities.''   In other words, this demand does not make our country safer.   We need to empower law enforcement to hold criminal aliens, when  appropriate, to protect our communities. The last thing we should do is  release dangerous criminals from custody.   I urge negotiators to come to an agreement to secure our border,  build the wall--a barrier, a fence, a partition, a panel. I am less  interested in semantics and more interested in supporting the law  enforcement officers who are on the front lines every day protecting  our communities.                            ____________________
