 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the  time.   Before coming to Congress, I practiced medicine for nearly 30 years.  I had the privilege of delivering 3,000 babies. I dedicated my career  as a physician to protecting the lives of children and families and  running a pro-life practice in north Texas. I have seen both sides of  this argument, both as a doctor and a policymaker.   Indeed, the chairman of the Department of OB/GYN at Parkland  Hospital's Southwestern Medical School, when I was a resident, pointed  out to us that those of us who were privileged to begin the practice of  obstetrics were unique in medicine in that we are going to be charged  with taking care of two patients, with a combined life expectancy of  over 100 years, and almost nowhere else in medicine do you have that  ability to impact the future.   Back in 2002, I decided to run for Congress because I saw lawmakers,  particularly in Congress, who have never experienced taking care of a  patient, discussing and setting the stage for how you are supposed to  run a medical practice.   Today is no different. It is deeply frustrating to see individuals  discussing procedures with little understanding of how or why they are  performed and how they affect the patients involved, both the mother  and the baby.   Throughout my time as an OB/GYN, I have taken care of women with  ectopic  [[Page H5989]]  pregnancies--never any hesitation. That does not change after a Supreme  Court decision.   I have taken care of women who, unfortunately, were suffering from  miscarriages. That will not change after a Supreme Court decision.   I have had cases where a woman had an abortion at another location  and then presented to my hospital in a crisis because of complications.  Without hesitation, I would render care to those patients, irrespective  of any Supreme Court decision.   Many of those cases, indeed, were life-threatening, but each and  every time, my responsibility was to step in and save a life. Again,  that is done without hesitation. The Supreme Court decision changes  none of that, despite the heated rhetoric we are hearing from the other  side.   It seems like a simple answer: Have an abortion, take care of a  problem.   Back in 1973, when Roe v. Wade was first decided, medical sonography  was really just beginning. In the time since then, it has really  developed into a science unto itself.   In fact, two generations of Americans since Roe v. Wade was decided  have as their first picture in their baby book an ultrasound picture or  maybe a videotape of themselves as an unborn child. Indeed, two  generations of Americans have no trouble assigning agency to that  pregnancy because they know from whence they came.   An abortion is a highly complex and deeply emotional decision. The  decision affects, yes, the mother. No question that it affects the baby  and affects other family members. Yes, it affects the provider as well.   My belief in the right to life has influenced my professional career  for much longer than my time in Congress, and I will remain committed  to that. After a lifetime dedicated to pro-life work, there is no  question it is just the right thing to do. You always err on the side  of life. You always give life a chance.   This rule also includes consideration of the National Defense  Authorization Act. Yesterday, in the Rules Committee, there were a lot  of amendments submitted. There are a lot of amendments we are going to  debate on the floor. Most of them were amendments submitted by  Democrats. Republicans got very few of those.    I submitted amendments to require reports to Congress on  our military response in Ukraine and the chaotic withdrawal from  Afghanistan last August, something that we cannot allow to be repeated.   Russia invaded Ukraine in February, yet we have not had another  briefing by the generals and State Department as we did prior to that  invasion. The situation is vastly different on the ground. We were  given to understand that it would not take long for Russia to  completely overrun Ukraine. They didn't anticipate the response of the  Ukrainian people. Now, we see a war of attrition evolving, but Congress  is not read into any of the administration's plans.   Then, finally, we have to ensure that the chaotic withdrawal from  Afghanistan is fully investigated and understood. What advice was the  President receiving? From whom did he receive it? How do we prevent  that from ever happening again?   I thank the gentleman for yielding me additional time.                                time  1130     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   This en bloc includes my amendment No. 114 to require the Secretary  of Defense to submit a report to Congress every 6 months detailing the  short- and long-term plan for the Pentagon's response to Russia's  invasion of Ukraine.   Russia invaded Ukraine in February, and yet, we have not had another  briefing by our military generals and the State Department and Director  of National Intelligence as we did prior to that invasion.   Now, as was reported on FOX News by Jacqui Heinrich on February 5 of  this year, General Milley predicted that Kyiv would fall in 3 days'  time. That did not happen. The Ukrainian people have bravely been  fighting this war, and it has now evolved into a war of attrition.   But Congress has not been read into any of the administration's  plans. The Speaker of the House brought a bill to the floor rapidly to  provide $40 billion to the military effort in Ukraine.   I, like everyone else, am horrified by what Russia is doing on the  ground in Ukraine. I supported that bill. But you cannot bring another  bill to the floor of this House, asking for continued aid, when we have  not even had a report or briefing by the people advising the  administration on what is happening on the ground.   We have to have that information. Simply adding more money to what  has already gone without a strategy to back up that assessment is a  failure on the part of the House of Representatives and one in which I  will not participate.
