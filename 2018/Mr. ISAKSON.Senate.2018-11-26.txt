 Madam President, I wish to address the Senator before he  leaves.   I represent the great State of Georgia, which is north of the great  State of Florida. I have had the pleasure of serving with this Senator  for a long time in a lot of capacities. He has made a huge contribution  to his State and to his country. We worked together on a lot of other  interests, like the Prayer Breakfast in the Senate and many other  things like that.   I want to commend the Senator for his speech, commend him for his  remarks, and commend him for his lovely wife, amazing Grace, whom I  love very much. I thank the Senator very much for his service to the  people of the State of Florida and the United States of America. May  God bless him.
