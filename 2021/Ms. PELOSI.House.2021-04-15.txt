 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his leadership in bringing this important legislation to the floor of  the House.   This is about building back better with women, not stifling  innovation and entrepreneurship, but reaping the benefits of all that  women have to offer in our country.   Mr. Speaker, nearly 60 years ago, President John F. Kennedy signed  the Equal Pay Act into law, lauding it as ``a measure that adds to our  laws another structure basic to democracy.''   Today, I rise in support of a similarly momentous measure for our  democracy, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which will strengthen that law  and reaffirm this pledge: equal work deserves equal pay.   We all salute Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, the guardian angel of this  legislation, and so much of what Democrats' work on behalf of women and  families. Chairwoman DeLauro is relentless, introducing this bill in  each of the last 13 Congresses and securing bipartisan support and the  support of the entire House Democratic Caucus. And now, because of her  leadership, we have a chance for it to become law.   Many of us, with Chair DeLauro at the helm, have helped lead the  charge for equal pay for many years now. Twelve years ago, House  Democrats passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to protect women's  right to challenge unfair pay in the courts. We are proud that  President Obama made this bill the first bill he signed into law. You  talked about it earlier, Mr. Chairman.   Exactly 10 years later, when Democrats retook the majority, we were  honored to stand with Lilly Ledbetter, that courageous woman, as we  took another step forward for pay equity by again introducing  Congresswoman DeLauro's bill, the Paycheck Fairness Act.   Today, a Democratic Congress led by over 120 women in the House; with  an administration led by President Biden, a longtime champion of women;  and the first woman Vice President, Kamala Harris; and with a record  number of women in the Cabinet, those are great advances for women.   We will pass this landmark bill once more, send it to the Senate, and  then, hopefully, to President Biden to sign into law.   I am the mother of four daughters. I don't know anybody who has a  daughter, a wife, a sister, a mother who can say to them, You are not  worth it; your time is not worth the time of your brother, your father,  your whoever else.   What father, brother or son would not want the women in their lives  to have equal pay?   Sadly, equal pay is not yet a reality in America. Nearly six decades  after the passage of the Equal Pay Act, women working full time year  round are paid only 82 cents for every dollar paid to men.   And for women of color, the disparity is even greater. It is almost  sinful. For Black women, it is 63 cents; Native Hawaiian, Pacific  Islander, American Indian, and Alaska Native women, 60 cents; and a  Latina is making just 55 cents for every dollar for the same work as  men.   Equal work, equal hours, equal efforts, but not equal pay. And this  is not just about cents on a dollar. This pay  [[Page H1813]]  gap can add up to about $400,000 in lost wages over a career.   What does that mean to a woman's pension?   At the same time, the need for action has been accelerated by the  pandemic, which has worsened economic disparities for women. Last year,  women lost a net 5.4 million jobs during the recession, with losses  disproportionately experienced by women of color.   This unjust, uneven toll on women is expected to widen the wage gap  by up to 5 percentage points. Widen the gap by 5 percentage points,  even as the economy recovers.   As the House passes this landmark legislation, let us stand proudly,  unapologetically for what this does for the economy of our country. We  continue to work to advance progress for women and families. With the  strong support of President Biden, the House Democrats are proud to  have passed and sent to the Senate our bipartisan VAWA reauthorization  led by Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee; legislation to remove the  arbitrary deadline for ERA ratification led by Congresswoman Jackie  Speier; and to have enacted the American Rescue Plan, which is helping  many women to return to the workforce.                                time  1330    And we will continue this drumbeat of action ensuring that the Senate  passes the Paycheck Fairness Act and advancing legislation to  strengthen women's access to childcare, healthcare, workplace safety,  and more.   And as we move forward to ``build back better,'' President Biden's  alliterative phrase for how we have job creation in our country, we can  only build back better if women are central to that effort. Advancing  an economy in a country that works for all of the people in America is  very important to America's families and America's children.   I urge a strong and, hopefully, bipartisan vote on H.R. 7, the  Paycheck Fairness Act. Fairness is an all-American quality. Fairness  for women is essential because we know that when women succeed, America  succeeds.   I thank Congresswoman DeLauro and Chairman Scott for their  leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the outstanding service  of the Reading Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, Joe  Novotny, as he prepares for his retirement.   Mr. Speaker, as Reading Clerk, Joe Novotny has served as the voice of  the House, and his trusted leadership and valued presence on this floor  will be missed by Members and staff on both sides of the aisle.   Joe Novotny has dedicated his entire career to the people's House.  First serving as a congressional page at age 16, Joe returned to the  House after college, where he worked for the House Education and Labor  Committee for 15 years, rising to become chief clerk.   His service was respected by all, including my friend, Chairman  George Miller, who lauded Joe as ``an incredibly valuable asset to my  staff whose unparalleled integrity and dedication helped our committee  advance major policies that are making a difference in the lives of  working families.''   Mr. Speaker, I just learned from our colleague  Dan Kildee that his  uncle, Dale Kildee, a leading member of the Education and Labor  Committee, was also a good friend and benefited from  [[Page H1833]]  the service and leadership of Joe Novotny.   In 2010, it was my great and proud honor as Speaker of the House to  name Joe Novotny Reading Clerk, the first openly gay man to hold this  position. I am proud of that.   His historic service has made our Congress more inclusive, diverse,  and representative of the people we serve.   As the child of immigrants, Novotny's ascendance in the halls of the  U.S. Capitol is, as he has proudly said, the story of the American  Dream.   As Reading Clerk, Novotny has been vital in engaging the people of  our country with their democracy. Each day, he ensures that measures  debated in this House are clearly articulated not only to Members but  to the American people and to people around the world.   His commitment to making Congress more accessible and efficient has  been particularly important during this time of pandemic, as our  institution has adjusted to remote and virtual operations.   Since day one, Joe has brought his steady presence, professionalism,  and institutional expertise to the House floor. In doing so, he has  helped advance the ability of the people's House to do the people's  work.   I am taking this additional time, Mr. Speaker, because so many  Members have told me what Joe means to them, and I wanted to express  some of that in my remarks.   While Joe Novotny's service will be missed, his great love for the  House and his dedication to our democracy stand as an inspiration for  all who will follow in the path that he has blazed.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I wish him  the best in the next stages of his journey, and I thank Joe for his  patriotic service.   Thank you, Joe Novotny.                            ____________________
