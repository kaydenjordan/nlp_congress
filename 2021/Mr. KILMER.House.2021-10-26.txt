 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Richard  Trumka, a relentless champion for working people.   When I heard from labor leaders across the State of Washington  following his passing, without exception they spoke about what a  substantial loss his passing was.   But in the brief time that I have here to reflect on his life, I want  to talk about what a gain it was to have him as a leader in our Nation:  A gain for folks who, because of his work, can retire with dignity, a  gain for workers who, because of his leadership, are safer and better  compensated, a gain for every worker who can collectively bargain.   In fact, when I spoke to him last, we talked about how important it  was to support our Federal workers throughout the region I am proud to  represent, the brave public servants that protect our sailors through  their work at the shipyard, that prepare our timber sales in the  Federal forests, that welcome visitors to our national parks, that care  for our veterans, that ensure citizens get the services that they need,  and that keep us safe. We agreed that we need to do everything we can  to have their backs, and throughout his life, he did.   I also admire that not only did Mr. Trumka advocate for our  workplaces to work better for the American people, but he also wanted  our country and our democracy to work better for working people.  Advocating to protect access to the ballot box and to get big money out  of politics.   As president of the AFL-CIO, he proudly represented millions of  workers throughout our country and hundreds of thousands of workers in  Washington State: Shipbuilders and electrical workers, ironworkers,  letter carriers, machinists and pipefitters, and paper workers and  teachers and healthcare workers. I could go on and on and on. These  workers are the heartbeat of our Nation.   In honor of his life, we should commit to continuing his legacy to  ensure workers have dignity, to ensure workers have the right to  organize, so that they can seek fair pay and better benefits and safer  working conditions and to make our democracy work better for all  Americans.   Madam Speaker, my sincere condolences to his family, to his friends,  and to every worker and American who was touched by his life.                                General Leave
