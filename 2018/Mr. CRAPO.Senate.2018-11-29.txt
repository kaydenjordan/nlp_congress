 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  nomination of Kathy Kraninger to be Director of the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau.   Ms. Kraninger has had a distinguished career in public service, with  exposure to a diverse set of Federal agencies. She brings significant  leadership experience at Federal agencies on Capitol Hill, with  particular expertise in the budget and appropriations processes.   She has served as Associate Director for General Government at the  Office of Management and Budget since March 2017. In that capacity, she  oversees nearly $250 billion in the budgetary resources for seven  Cabinet Departments, and 30 other Federal Agencies, including the  Bureau.   In addition, she serves as OMB's principal policy official for issues  related to the Treasury Department, the Department of Housing and Urban  Affairs, and Federal financial regulators.   Prior to her time at OMB, Ms. Kraninger served in leadership  positions at the Department of Transportation and the Department of  Homeland Security, as well as having served on the staff of several  congressional committees, including on the Senate Appropriations  Committee.   As Director of the Bureau, Ms. Kraninger would be charged with  overseeing the market for consumer financial products and services,  enforcing many Federal consumer financial laws, and protecting  consumers. The Bureau's supervision, regulation, and enforcement  decisions have an immense impact on consumers' access to critical  financial products and services.   At her nomination hearing, Ms. Kraninger reiterated her dedication to  fulfilling the Bureau's congressional mandate of ensuring all consumers  have access to markets for consumer financial products and services  that are fair, transparent, and competitive.   At her hearing, Ms. Kraninger identified what her first four  priorities would be if she were to be confirmed: ensuring the Bureau is  fair and transparent, including the use of robust cost-benefit  analysis, notice and comment rulemaking, and tailoring regulations to  ensure that consumers are not unnecessarily and smaller companies are  not disproportionately harmed; improving collaboration with other  financial regulators in the States on supervision and enforcement;  limiting data collection to only what is necessary and strengthening  its protection; and making sure the Bureau is held accountable.   She was also forceful in saying:         Nothing is more destructive to competitive markets and       consumer choice than fraudulent behavior. Under my       stewardship, the Bureau will take aggressive action against       bad actors who break the rules by engaging in fraud and other       illegal activity.    It is good that Ms. Kraninger plans to prioritize limiting data  collection and strengthening the protection of consumers' sensitive,  personal financial information.   I have long been critical of big data collection activities by  private organizations and Federal agencies, particularly that of the  Bureau and its encroachment into the private financial lives of  Americans across this country. The Bureau's data collection is  especially concerning in light of the number of high-profile cyber  attacks in recent years and news about how outside groups have  collected private information from Facebook users.   It is important that the Bureau, other Federal agencies, and private  organizations comprehensively review their data collection processes  and narrow and enhance those processes to better protect consumers'  personal information.   Big data and privacy issues will be a major priority for the Banking  Committee in this next Congress. There is growing support to give  people the necessary tools to protect their privacy and opt out of  certain data collection.   I am confident that Ms. Kraninger is well prepared to lead the Bureau  in enforcing Federal consumer financial laws, in protecting consumers'  sensitive personal financial information, and in increasing its  transparency and accountability. In fact, many of these issues were key  points of discussion during Ms. Kraninger's nomination hearing.  [[Page S7213]]    Senator Tillis asked Ms. Kraninger about the Bureau's immense power  and level of accountability. Ms. Kraninger told the Banking Committee:  ``I have noted that my focus is on running the agency as Congress  established it, but, certainly, working with Members of Congress, I'm  very open to changes in the structure that will make the agency more  accountable and transparent.''   In responding to a question that Senator Toomey posed about the  Bureau's potential impact on small businesses, Ms. Kraninger said:         I absolutely believe that there is a limited intent for the       Bureau to be engaged in small business oversight or       engagement there. So that's something that should be limited.    Senator Moran asked Ms. Kraninger about providing greater clarity to  companies that are overseen by the Bureau, to which she responded:         I completely agree that it is critical to have clear rules       so that lenders, creditors, and consumers themselves know       what the rules are, that they are not, somehow, told after       the fact that they broke a rule they weren't even aware of or       that it had, somehow, changed without any proper notice and       comment process, to really understand the impacts and the       opportunity to tailor.    In addition, numerous key stakeholders have written to the Banking  Committee in support of Ms. Kraninger's nomination and to emphasize the  positive attributes that prepare her to lead the Bureau. Ms. Kraninger  has received widespread support from community banks and credit unions,  consumer bankers, housing organizations and Realtors, taxpayer advocacy  groups, and auto dealers.   Rebeca Romero Rainey, the president and CEO of the Independent  Community Bankers of America, said:         I believe she understands the critical role played by       community banks in creating access to consumer and small       business credit and supporting prosperity in American       communities. This perspective will strengthen the Bureau's       rulemaking. I also believe she has a strong commitment to       making the Bureau accountable, effective and efficient.    Following Ms. Kraninger's being reported favorably from the Banking  Committee, Rob Nichols, the president and CEO of the American Bankers  Association, said:         Ms. Kraninger detailed her substantial government and       management experience that would help her lead the Bureau,       and she committed to satisfying the Bureau's mandate of       ensuring consumers have access to financial products and       services that are ``fair, transparent and competitive.'' We       welcome that commitment and her pledge to maintain       transparency and accountability if confirmed.    Jim Nussle, the president and CEO of the Credit Union National  Association, said that until the Bureau's structure moves from a single  Director to a bipartisan commission, ``consumers and regulated entities  will be best served by a Senate-confirmed, permanent Director leading  the Bureau.''    Dan Berger, the president and CEO of the National Association of  Federally-Insured Credit Unions, said: ``A Senate-confirmed, full-time  Director of the Bureau will help provide regulatory certainty and  clarity while providing important leadership and long-term focus that  will allow credit unions to continue to meet the needs of their  members.''   Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer  of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said: ``Ms. Kraninger's experience  will serve her well as the Director of the Bureau, especially as it  aims to be a more transparent and accountable agency.''   Richard Hunt, the president and CEO of the Consumer Bankers  Association, said that until the Bureau moves from a single Director to  a bipartisan commission, ``it is imperative the Bureau have a permanent  and full-time Director to fulfill its mission, and we look forward to  working with Ms. Kraninger on commonsense regulations that protect  consumers while also allowing a well-regulated banking system to serve  families, small businesses, and local communities. CBA is grateful to  Acting Director Mick Mulvaney for his leadership at the agency and for  his willingness to listen to the opinions of all stakeholders.''   The Bureau was the most polarizing part of Dodd-Frank, and it is not  surprising that the confirmation votes of then-nominee Richard Cordray  and now Kathy Kraninger are contentious. Some of Ms. Kraninger's  opponents have raised questions about her potential involvement with  respect to the administration's zero-tolerance policy and the  administration's response to Hurricane Maria.   During her nomination hearing, I asked Ms. Kraninger to what extent,  if any, she was involved in the development of the administration's  zero-tolerance policy or the administration's response to Hurricane  Maria. She responded: ``I had no role in setting the zero-tolerance  policy.''   She also said, with respect to Hurricane Maria, that in the Office of  Management and Budget, including herself, ``we have a role in reviewing  disaster declaration recommendations that go to the President. So we  are involved from that point. We also put together, at the Office of  Management and Budget, the supplemental requests that the  administration puts forward to the Hill when they are necessary.  Clearly, additional resources were needed [last fall], and the Office  of Management and Budget supported the President in putting forward  those requests that Congress considered and obviously responded to in  providing the resources necessary.''   Since Director Cordray's departure, I know some of my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle have been frustrated by the Bureau under  Acting Director Mulvaney's leadership. Given changes at the Agency over  the last year and frustration felt on both sides of the aisle, now is  an appropriate time to reconsider the fundamental structure of the  Bureau to increase its accountability and transparency.   I continue to support a bipartisan commission instead of a single  Director, a congressional funding mechanism, and a safety and soundness  check. It would also be appropriate to give the Bureau its own  inspector general.   For the past year, the Bureau has been led by an Acting Director. It  is time for the Senate to confirm a permanent Director. I support Ms.  Kraninger, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting yes on her  nomination.   I yield the floor.
