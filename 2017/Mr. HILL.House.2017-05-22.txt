 Mr. Speaker, stories from the survivors of Assad's bombings  and chemical attacks are almost impossible to read due to the grotesque  descriptions of innocent people and children suffocating, foaming at  the mouth, and suffering from seizures.   If, in 2013, the Obama administration had taken decisive leadership  against the use of chemical weapons, insisted on a U.N. strategy to  isolate Assad and Russia, verified the elimination of Syria's chemical  weapons stockpile, and created no-fly zones, we might have avoided  500,000 innocent deaths and millions of refugees.   Through his appropriate and proportionate bombing, President Trump  told Assad that America will no longer ignore the unspeakable acts of  violence against innocent people. We also learned that the U.S.-led  coalition aircraft bombed, last week, pro-regime forces after they  breached a deconfliction zone and advanced on a base occupied by U.S.  special forces.   I call on the United Nations to follow America's lead by pursuing a  ceasefire in Syria, creating safe zones, and holding Assad accountable  for his war crimes.                            ____________________
