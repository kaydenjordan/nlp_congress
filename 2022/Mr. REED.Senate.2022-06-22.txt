 Mr. President, as we all know too well, rates of suicide  have risen to epidemic levels in the United States, with suicide now  the 10th leading cause of death in the country. On average, there are  130 suicides every day, roughly 1 every 11 minutes. These are  staggering statistics behind which there are tragic stories of loss.  That is why I am joining Senator Moran to introduce the Suicide  Prevention Act.   Our bipartisan, bicameral bill would provide new resources to help  turn the tide on this disturbing trend. It would authorize new funding  for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, partner with  State and local health departments to improve surveillance of suicide  attempts and other incidences of self-harm. Data collection efforts  regarding suicide often occur years after the fact, which limits the  ability of State and local health departments, as well as community  organizations, to recognize trends early and intervene. CDC has already  begun some of this work as a pilot program, but the Suicide Prevention  Act would expand these efforts and enhance data collection so we can  respond to new trends quickly and save lives.   We know that emergency healthcare providers are often at the  frontlines of responding to suicide attempts. Approximately 37 percent  of individuals without a previous history of mental health or substance  abuse who die by suicide make an emergency department visit within the  year before their death. According to the Suicide Prevention Resource  Center, the risk of suicide is greatest within a month of discharge  from the hospital. To help ensure our emergency healthcare  professionals have the tools to respond, the bill would also authorize  funding for a grant program within the Substance Abuse and Mental  Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, to help better train emergency  department staff to implement suicide prevention strategies, screen at- risk patients, and refer patients to appropriate followup care. The  legislation would also require SAMHSA to develop best practices for  such programs, so that healthcare providers are able to provide their  patients with the best possible care and advice.   Nationwide, suicide rates have skyrocketed over the last decade. In  2020, nearly 46,000 Americans lost their lives to suicide. That same  year, there were 1.2 million suicide attempts. We must renew our  efforts on suicide prevention and take a holistic approach. In addition  to the Suicide Prevention Act, we must reauthorize the Garrett Lee  Smith Memorial Act, which I am working with Senator Murkowski to do.  Despite the troubling national trend, programs under this law have  contributed to declines in the youth suicide rates in my home State of  Rhode Island over the last decade.   We must also invest in the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and  the new nationwide three-digit 9-8-8 number, which is scheduled to go  live this summer. Senator Moran and I have teamed up on the National  Suicide Prevention Lifeline Improvement Act that will increase funding  for the Lifeline and make key improvements, such as enhance texting  capability.   Today, I am pleased to have the opportunity to partner with Senator  Moran once again by introducing the Suicide Prevention Act. This bill  is one more step Congress can take to combat the mental health and  suicide crisis in our country. I look forward to working with Senator  Moran and advocates in Rhode Island and across the country to make a  difference in addressing this epidemic.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. King, Mr. Sasse, and Mrs.          Gillibrand):   S. 4456. A bill to prohibit certain former employees of the  intelligence community from providing certain services to governments  of countries that are state sponsors of terrorism, the People's  Republic of China, and the Russian Federation, and for other purposes;  to the Select Committee on Intelligence.
