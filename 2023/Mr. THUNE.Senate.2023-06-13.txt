 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, at the end of last week, President Biden  published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal touting his economic  record. It was not exactly new material. The President is well known  for attempting to put a rosy spin on his economic record. But I still  have to marvel every time the President claims that he is building the  economy from the bottom up and the middle out and working to give  families ``more breathing room'' because if there is one thing that can  be said about the Biden Presidency, it is that American families have  lost a lot of their breathing room.   The inflation crisis the President helped make is costing American  families $880 this month. Let me just repeat that. The inflation crisis  the President helped create is costing American families $880 this  month--$880 for just 1 month. Meanwhile, real wages have declined for  26 consecutive months under President Biden--26 consecutive months; 2- plus years.   So it is no surprise that in a poll last month, 49 percent of  Americans reported that their personal financial situation is getting  worse or that in another poll, 61 percent said recent price increases  had caused financial hardship for them or their household.   Let's be very clear. This is not a random situation that just  happened to occur on the President's watch. The President bears direct  responsibility for this inflation crisis, which was set off in large  part thanks to the bloated, Big-Government American Rescue Plan  spending spree the Democrats and President forced through shortly after  the President came to office.   You don't have to take my word on that. Here is what one former Obama  adviser had to say on the subject:         The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed in the early       days of the Biden administration will go down in history as       an extraordinary policy mistake.    ``Will go down in history as an extraordinary policy mistake''--that  from an Obama adviser.   Another former Obama adviser noted:         The original sin was an oversized American Rescue Plan.    Contrary to what he suggested in his op-ed, the President has done  exactly nothing to bring down inflation since. Indeed, he has continued  to pursue the same kind of Big-Government, big-spending policies that  helped land us in this mess in the first place.   It is frankly staggering to me that the President continues to have  the audacity to say things like ``[h]ardworking families are reaping  the rewards'' of his policies. Hard-working families are certainly  reaping something from the President's policies, but it isn't rewards.   As I said earlier, the President is well known for trying to put a  rosy spin on his economic record, and he trots out some of his favorite  misleading statistics in this op-ed.   Since he took office, he claims, the economy has created more than 13  million jobs. That sounds pretty good, right? Until you realize that  the vast majority of those jobs weren't newly created but are, rather,  just jobs that were naturally added back after the pandemic. Currently,  we are just 3.7 million jobs above where we were prepandemic--hardly  the historic job boom the President portrays.   The President also mentions that gasoline prices are down from their  peak in June of 2022, but he neglects to mention that gas prices are  currently up 50 percent from where they were when he took office.   Then, of course, the President brings up one of his favorite claims-- that he reduced the deficit by $1.7 trillion over the first 2 years of  his administration.   Here is how the Washington Post Fact Checker column has described  that claim: ``highly misleading.'' Highly misleading. The President  arrives at this highly misleading statistic by comparing his budget  deficit in fiscal year 2022 to the fiscal year 2020 budget deficit,  which was unusually large, to put it mildly, as a result of the COVID  pandemic.   A much more appropriate comparison would be to compare President  Biden's actual 2022 budget deficit to what the Congressional Budget  Office was projecting that deficit would be before the President's  American Rescue Plan spending spree was enacted. That tells a far  different story.   The reality, as the Post points out, is that ``the data shows the  deficit picture has worsened under Biden.''   The Washington Post Fact Checker column recently awarded President  Biden a Bottomless Pinocchio for his deficit reduction claims--a rating  the column gives for ``false or misleading statements repeated so often  that they [become] a form of propaganda.''   I can't close without mentioning the President's staggering claim  that he, again, ``fought so hard to bring Democrats and Republicans in  Congress together to compromise on the budget and prevent a  catastrophic default.'' As I have already highlighted, the President is  fairly well known for revisionist history, but this statement might  take the cake.  [[Page S2058]]    Can the President possibly think that people have already forgotten  that he spent months refusing to negotiate on a debt ceiling agreement  and only came to the table at the last minute? Credit to the President  for eventually recognizing that divided government requires compromise,  but to suggest that he set out from the outset to forge a compromise  between Democrats and Republicans is to skate the line between  revisionist history and outright falsehood.   After 2 years of painful price hikes at the gas pump and the grocery  store, I think few Americans would recognize the positive picture the  President paints in his op-ed. Unfortunately, it is clear from the  President's column that he plans to continue to pursue policies that  will further undermine the economic well-being of the American people.  So much for giving American families more breathing room.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Tillis).   Further, if present and voting: the Senator from North Carolina (Mr.  Tillis) would have voted ``yea.''
