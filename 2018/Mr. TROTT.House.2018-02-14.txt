 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3299, the  Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act.   I thank my good friend from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry) for his  leadership on this bipartisan, commonsense bill.   This is a commonsense piece of legislation that is sponsored by two  Republicans, two Democrats. It passed out of our committee with a vote  of 42-17. It is the kind of bipartisan solution that the American  people expect from their elected officials.   Yet, opponents of this bill want people to believe that it will hurt  consumers. We heard similar rhetoric on the recent tax bill passed in  Congress. In fact, we still hear it, even though millions of Americans  are getting bonuses, taking new and better jobs, and seeing their  savings account grow.   Now, let's be clear. This bill will allow banks and credit unions to  sell certain loans to investors, thus diversifying their risk and  freeing up capital that can be used to issue more loans in local  communities. Imagine that.   Why is this commonsense legislation necessary?   A recent case out of the Second Circuit ruled that certain loans  would be valid when held on the books of a bank, but would be invalid  the minute they are sold to investors.   I fail to see how a loan becomes more dangerous, usurious, or  otherwise problematic because the owner of the loan has changed. This  is like saying a house's roof becomes leaky the minute you sell it to  your neighbor. This is the sort of logic that can only thrive in  Washington.   What happens when banks and credit unions can no longer sell loans on  the public market?   They issue fewer loans. Fewer young parents can get a mortgage for  their new home. Fewer single mothers can get a loan for a new car.  Fewer students can get a critical loan to pay for their first year of  college. Fewer businesses can get loans to bring innovative ideas to  the market to create jobs.   This bill is not rent-a-bank. It will not result in usurious interest  rates.   I recently was at a restaurant and I struck up a conversation with  the waitress. She can't get a mortgage. She can't buy a home, even  though she and her husband have good credit. That is the kind of  problem we are trying to address.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask the opponents of this bill to put aside  politics and to join me in supporting legislation that will help young  families, new businesses, and students. This bill will make credit  accessible, and I urge all Members to vote for it.                                time  1500    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Chairman Hensarling has named the Members on my side of  the aisle, the Democrats who support this bill. None of them are on the  floor at this time. None of them came here to defend the position that  they took. Some of them are reconsidering the vote that they took, and  so I don't want him to try and wrap this bill around the fact that  there were some Democrats who supported it.   This is a Republican bill. This is a bill by the opposite side of the  aisle that supports payday lending and the ability for payday lenders  to continue to exploit their consumers in a new and different way. They  simply allow them to buy up this debt from the national banks to be  able to basically overcome usury laws.   So while he would like everyone to believe there is all of this great  Democratic support and he keeps saying over and over again how  bipartisan this bill is, none of them are on the floor at this time.  None of them came here to defend their position. None of them have  said, ``I know that I am absolutely correct.'' As a matter of fact,  some of them are raising questions about whether or not they should  have voted for the bill, understanding it in one particular way, and  some now understanding what it really does.   So I thank the gentleman for his position, and I thank him for being  a strong advocate for his position. I thank him for at least stepping  up to the plate to say, in essence, he believes that he is doing the  right thing, despite the fact that he has got Members on that side of  the aisle who are going against their own States' attorneys general.   But let us not believe that this is some great Democratic bill. It is  not.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
