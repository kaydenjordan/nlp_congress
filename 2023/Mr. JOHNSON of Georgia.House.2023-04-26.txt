 Mr. Speaker, I rise to announce that this  week I am reintroducing the FAIR Act, the Forced Arbitration Injustice  Repeal Act.   Forced arbitration has been a concern of mine for some time because  powerful corporations have stripped away Americans' right to have their  day in court.   These forced arbitration clauses are everywhere. Americans sign away  their rights when they buy a cell phone or sign an employment contract.   They are forced into arbitration, a private for-profit dispute  resolution process that bans claimants from banding together and where  the deck is stacked against the little guy.   That is why I have been championing this legislation since 2007, and  momentum has shifted in our favor. Just last year, President Biden  signed a law invalidating forced arbitration clauses in disputes about  workplace sexual harassment and assault.   That is progress, but we have more work to do. We need to restore  Americans' right to use the court system, and in doing so, reinvigorate  important civil rights, employment, and consumer protections in this  country.                            ____________________
