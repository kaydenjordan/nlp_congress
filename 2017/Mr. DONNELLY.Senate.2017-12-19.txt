 Mr. President, I rise to discuss the tax bill.   I am disappointed. You see, I am one of the many Americans who  believe that we need to reform our Tax Code to benefit middle-class  families. I also believe that we need to make those reforms in a  commonsense, responsible way. Sadly, that is not the approach that was  taken with this legislation.   From the very beginning of this effort, I have been willing to  partner with Republicans or Democrats and with President Trump and his  team. In fact, when President Trump unveiled his tax priorities in my  home State of Indiana, I traveled with him on Air Force One. I wanted  him to know that I was listening to his priorities and that I agreed  with his stated goals of supporting the middle class and keeping jobs  right here in America. I also wanted Hoosiers to know that I was  committed to working with the President to reform our Tax Code in a way  that helped Hoosier families and businesses.   After that trip with the President and in every meeting with the  administration, including two meetings at the White House, my attending  Vice President Pence's speech in Anderson, IN, and in multiple  discussions with top administration officials, I left feeling  optimistic that we could work together to reform our Tax Code to  achieve those goals we had agreed upon. I expected a proposal that was  focused on cutting taxes for middle-class families. I expected a  proposal that would help keep jobs in America and take away tax  incentives from corporations that flagrantly outsource jobs to foreign  competitors in foreign countries. Unfortunately, that is not the bill  that the majority leader pushed through the Senate, nor is it the final  bill that he and the Speaker of the House agreed upon.   The reasons I oppose this bill are plain and simple, clear, and make  common sense. Instead of providing a tax cut that overwhelmingly  benefits the middle class, this bill cuts taxes for the wealthiest  Americans while it raises taxes on a majority of families who will be  making less than $75,000 in the coming years. Instead of closing tax  loopholes like the shameful one that allows Wall Street hedge fund  managers to pay a lower tax rate than a Hoosier firefighter, than a  Hoosier teacher, than a Hoosier policeman, or a Hoosier steel worker-- imagine a hedge fund manager's tax rate being lower than that man's or  woman's who is fighting a fire in Evansville this year. This bill  preserves these giveaways. Think of that. It is outrageous.   Instead of protecting American jobs by adopting provisions from my  End Outsourcing Act--an effort that President Trump has told me on  numerous occasions that he is all-in on and supports--this tax bill  does zero to claw back tax breaks and incentives awarded to  corporations that later decide to outsource American jobs. It also  retains loopholes that allow corporations like Rexnord and Carrier to  continue deducting the moving expenses when they ship those American  jobs to other countries. Imagine that. There is a tax deduction for  moving expenses to ship American jobs to other countries. They left it  alone.   Perhaps, there is no better example of an issue on which the  President and I agree than preventing the outsourcing of American jobs.  Right now in my home State of Indiana, nine companies have outsourced  or will outsource the jobs of 2,200 Hoosiers. This is impacting moms  and dads, sisters and brothers, wives and husbands, our neighbors, and  our friends. This is our opportunity to stand up for American workers  and make it clear that if corporations want a lower tax rate or special  tax deductions, if they want the American taxpayer to invest in them,  then, they must invest in American workers. That is the conversation I  had with the President when we talked about our shared goals for tax  reform, and these are the issues where I know there is common ground.   Gene Sperling, formerly the chief economic adviser to two different  Presidents recently, wrote:         If there is one thing the Republican international tax bill       was advertised to accomplish, it was that it would favor       locating jobs and profits in the United States. It does just       the opposite--expanding the degree our tax system tilts the       playing field against American taxpayers and American       workers.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  this article by Gene Sperling, recently published in The Atlantic,  titled ``How the Tax Plan Will Send Jobs Overseas.''   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From the Atlantic, Dec. 8, 2017]                  How the Tax Plan Will Send Jobs Overseas      companies are going to be able to save a ton of money by locating                              factories abroad                           (By Gene B. Sperling)         Despite Donald Trump's ``America first'' rhetoric, many       suspected that the tax plan he would support would actually       increase the incentives for U.S. multinationals to move both       profits and operations overseas. I wrote about this       inevitability a few weeks ago, before the details of the       Trump-GOP tax plan emerged.        Now that the bill is advancing, it's clear that things       aren't as bad as many feared. They're worse.        As discussed in the previous piece, Trump administration       economic officials argue that by lowering the corporate tax       rate from 35 percent to 20 percent and moving to what is       called a territorial system--mainly, companies pay taxes on       foreign earnings only to the foreign nation where those       profits are booked and never owe anything to the U.S. no       matter how low the foreign nation's tax rate is--would lead       to more jobs and profits staying in or coming back to the       United States.        Yet, it is clear that a territorial system could have just       the opposite impact: It could give a permanent preference to       foreign income and lead companies to shift more profits to       tax havens knowing that they could permanently avoid       virtually all taxation on such profits. One crucial safeguard       against that perverse impact is to apply a strong minimum tax       on the profits of U.S. multinationals in each country (a       ``country-by-country'' minimum tax). If a U.S. company had to       pay a minimum tax of, let's say, 19 percent (as President       Obama had proposed), even if they engaged in complex tax       planning to book $100 million in profits in zero-tax Bermuda,       they would have to pay $19 million in U.S. taxes to ensure       the 19 percent minimum tax was enforced. Under such a       country-by-country minimum tax, you can run, you can shift       profits to tax havens, but you cannot hide from paying a 19       percent minimum no matter where you are. Under this type of       true minimum tax on foreign earnings, U.S. multinationals       would have little incentive to engage in the ongoing race to       the bottom.        As discussed in my previous Atlantic piece, the GOP plan       was rumored to use only a 10 percent minimum tax, and to make       it worse, would make the minimum tax determination based on       the average of a company's total global profits. What was       problematic about this design was that it not only encouraged       companies to move profits to tax havens, but it actually       encouraged them to simultaneously move jobs and operations       such as manufacturing to industrialized countries that had       typical tax rates and to shift more profits to tax havens.       Why? Because if you had $100 million of profits in Bermuda       facing no tax, you might have still had to pay $10 million in       U.S. taxes to meet the new global minimum tax. But if you       moved a factory to Germany that made $100 million and paid 20       percent in taxes there, you could still pay zero on your       profits in Bermuda because the average taxes paid on your       global profits (from both Bermuda and Germany) would be the       global minimum rate of 10 percent. This perverse design means       the more a U.S. multinational shifts jobs and operations to       industrialized nations with similar tax rates to the U.S.,       the more it can get away with shifting more and more profits       to tax havens.        So how did it look in the fine print? As several tax       experts including the Tax Policy Center's Steve Rosenthal,       Brooklyn Law School's Rebecca Kysar, and Reed College's       Kimberly Clausing have written, it is even worse than       anticipated on at least two additional grounds. First, it       turns out that the Republican idea of a minimum tax is that       it only taxes what you make over what they think is a       ``routine'' profit, deemed to be 10 percent in the Senate       bill, on ``tangible'' investments (think factories and       equipment, including for manufacturing). As Rosenthal notes,       ``because `routine' returns are not subject to U.S. tax, this       definition of `routine' returns could give U.S. firms a       perverse incentive to shift more tangible assets to lower-      taxed overseas locations.'' That means, under the GOP bills,       if you shift less profitable operations to a tax haven you       would pay zero taxes on those operations as long as you are       only making 10 percent a year--whether that is $10 million or       $100 million--while you would pay 20 percent if the       operations were located in the United States. So, the       ``minimum'' tax is really a much lower rate than 10 percent,       and would essentially be an invisible, non-existent tax       except on highly profitable operations and income from       intangibles.        Second, this limitation to only excess profits encourages       even more shifting of operations and jobs overseas through       complex efforts to blend different income streams.  [[Page S8106]]       How? Profits from ``intangibles'' like patents do not receive       the 10 percent exemption for ``routine'' returns, so the       minimum tax is seemingly designed to at least capture those       well-known cases where major technology companies shift       intangibles to low-tax nations and book their profits there.       If a company does that and earns extraordinary profits, a       global minimum tax would capture some piece of that. But       again, here is where the GOP bill's global ``averaging''       actually creates the incentives to move jobs and operations       overseas.        Let's say a U.S. multinational has highly profitable       intangibles located in a tax haven that earn $50 million in       income without any tangible investment. If the company has no       other foreign profits or operations, then that income would       face a mere $5 million in U.S. taxes from the 10 percent       minimum tax under the GOP plan. But if the company decides to       build a new $1 billion factory overseas that earns profits of       only 5 percent ($50 million) from the factory, the company       will not pay a penny in U.S. taxes on its income from the       factory or the intangibles. Why? Because when you add the       income together, the $50 million from the intangibles plus       the $50 million from the new factory, it equals the       ``routine'' profit of 10 percent on the $1 billion of new       tangible investment, which will allow it to completely avoid       paying taxes on any of the above mentioned profits.        This shows how deeply the tax plan fails when it comes to       incentives to shift profits and operations overseas and to       curtail the obsession of major multinational companies with       international tax arbitrage that has nothing to do with       innovation, productivity or job creation. Indeed, the ability       to blend income from intangibles and routine profits, and       from investment in higher tax nations with tax havens with       zero taxes, leads to a worst of all worlds scenario: an even       greater corporate focus on international tax minimization       through a careful mixture of shifting profits and operations       overseas.        If there was one thing the GOP international tax bill was       advertised to accomplish, it was that it would favor locating       jobs and profits in the United States. It does just the       opposite--expanding the degree our tax system tilts the       playing field against American taxpayers and American       workers.    Mr. President, the majority leader's bill before us  today continues the same broken tax system that incentivizes companies  to move jobs to foreign countries, hurting more American communities  and undercutting thousands of working American families.   In Indiana, we know there is no such thing as a free lunch. In the  Hoosier State, we work hard and we expect everyone else to pay their  fair share. The tax bill we are considering cuts taxes for corporations  and the wealthy by asking some middle-class families to pay more and by  making healthcare more expensive for millions and millions of  Americans.   According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal  Budget, if we account for budget gimmicks, the cost of this bill could  reach $2.2 trillion--not billion but trillion dollars.   Here is what that means. This means our kids' and our grandkids'  paychecks, the hard-earned money they make in the years ahead, will be  sent to China to pay for tax cuts that will be given today to the  wealthiest people in America. Our kids and our grandkids will be paying  the bill for this tax cut that puts money in the pockets of the very,  very wealthy. That is almost beyond belief.   We need tax reform that actually benefits Hoosiers who go to work in  the dark and come home in the dark. These are the folks that I run into  at church or who stop by my office or I see at the gas station or at  the diner. They look me in the eye, and they tell me they are working  hard to make a decent living, to pay the bills, to raise their  families, and to have a shot at retiring with dignity. They are not  looking for any handouts. They simply want a good-paying job and a fair  shake. Unfortunately, this bill is a significant missed opportunity to  provide relief to middle-class families and to protect American jobs.   From the very, very beginning of this debate, I have engaged in a  good faith effort to exchange ideas and priorities for what we would  like this tax bill to look like and to work together in a bipartisan  manner. I worked to improve the bill that my colleagues have rushed  through in a largely closed and partisan process. That includes my  support for Senator Rubio's effort to expand the child tax credit for  hard-working families, for which I give him much credit.   Our country is stronger when we work together and when we pass  legislation that focuses on the middle class and on regular families  and that leaves a better future for all our children. Sadly, that is  not what this bill would do. This bill raises taxes on many middle- class families, makes healthcare more expensive, does not address  outsourcing, and significantly increases our national debt.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.
