 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Smith for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I would just quickly note that I am highly offended by  the use of the foul language by my Democrat colleague. That is  completely unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the Democrats'  inflation expansion act. This wasteful bill is full of liberal  priorities that will continue to fuel inflation, raise taxes on  hardworking families, and create an army of 87,000 IRS agents that will  go after our families and small businesses.   Democrats claim that only large corporations will be the target of  these IRS agents. That is factually false. Families and small  businesses, who don't have the time or the resources, will undergo  these invasive audits and will bear the brunt of these IRS agents. This  radical bill will also supercharge the Democrats' Green New Deal agenda  without making our country energy independent again.   In fact, they would rather import dirty foreign oil from Venezuela  than unleash America's energy independence. Sadly, that is the state of  today's Democratic Party and their failed liberal agenda.   Mr. Speaker, as a strong fiscal conservative, I urge my colleagues to  oppose this bill.
