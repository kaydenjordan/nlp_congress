 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today I rise to oppose the nomination of  Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. This is an issue I will return to  in the coming weeks and months at greater length, but I did want to say  a few words about why I am in opposition to Mr. Kavanaugh.   I think many Americans have a pretty good sense of what the function  of Congress is and what the President of the United States does, but,  in fact, I think many Americans do not fully appreciate the role that  the Supreme Court plays in our lives. In the past decade alone, the  Supreme Court has issued some incredibly controversial and, to my mind,  disastrous decisions that have had a profound impact on the lives of  the American people.   Let me review for a moment why this nomination is so very important  by looking at what the Supreme Court, often by a 5-to-4 vote--a one- vote majority--has done in recent years. If you go out onto the streets  of any community in the United States of America--whether it is a  conservative area or a progressive area--what most people will tell you  is that we have a corrupt campaign finance system--a system that today,  as we speak, allows billionaires to spend hundreds of millions of  dollars to buy elections. Most Americans, whether they are Democrats or  Republicans or Independents, do not think that is what American  democracy is supposed to be about. What most people think is that the  majority should rule. Sometimes you win, and sometimes you lose, but  everybody gets a vote--not a situation in which billionaires can spend  unlimited sums of money to support candidates who represent their  interests. That is, in fact, what goes on right now.   Many Americans may think that was a decision made by Congress, made  by the President. That is not so. That disastrous decision that is  undermining American democracy came about by a 5-to-4 vote of the U.S.  Supreme Court in the Citizens United case.   That is what a Supreme Court decision can do. It can undermine  American democracy and create a situation where the very wealthiest  people in this country can buy politicians and influence legislation.   Several years ago, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of  the Affordable Care Act, but the Court also ruled that the Medicaid  expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act had to be optional for  States.   I am on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which  helped to write that bill. I can tell you that there was almost no  discussion--I don't recall any discussion--about whether or not that  legislation would apply and all elements of the legislation would apply  to every State in the country.   The Supreme Court ruled that this was not the case. They said that  the decision of expanding Medicaid was up to the States. Today, we have  17 States in our country that still have not expanded Medicaid. What  that means in English--in real terms--is that today there are millions  and millions of people, in 17 States in this country, who are ill,  people who can't afford healthcare, people who are literally dying  because they don't go to the doctor when they should, and that is all  because of a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court.   It is not only the issue of campaign finance or the issue of Medicaid  and healthcare where the Supreme Court has acted in a disastrous way. I  think everybody knows that our country has a very, very shameful  history in terms of civil rights. It has been a very long and hard  struggle for us to finally say that in America, regardless of the color  of your skin, regardless of your economic position, you have the right  to vote. It is not a radical idea, but it is a struggle for which very  brave people fought for many decades.   In 1965 the Congress finally passed the Voting Rights Act, which had  the impact of eliminating racial discrimination in voting. That Act,  passed by Congress, has been reauthorized multiple times since. In  other words, what Congress said is that everybody in this country has  the right to vote, regardless of the color of your skin.   In 2013 the Supreme Court--again, by a 5-to-4 vote--ruled that parts  of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were outdated, and they struck down a  major part of that law that guaranteed that all Americans had the right  to vote. Literally days after that decision was rendered by the Supreme  Court, officials in State after State responded by enacting voting  restrictions targeted at African Americans, poor people, young people,  and other groups of citizens who don't traditionally vote Republican.   Literally days after that Supreme Court decision, State officials  said: Wow, we now have the opportunity to make it harder for our  political opponents to vote.   They moved very, very quickly with restrictive voting rights laws.  That situation was created by, once again, a 5-to-4 vote by a  conservative Supreme Court.   Just this year, we saw the Supreme Court rule against unions in a  really outrageous decision in the Janus case, designed to weaken the  ability of workers and public employees to negotiate fair contracts.  Just this year, we saw the Supreme Court uphold President Trump's  Muslim ban and other important pieces of legislation.   This is already a Supreme Court that, given the option, will rule, as  they have time and again, often by a 5-to-4 vote, in favor of  corporations and the wealthy and against working people; that will  continue to undermine civil rights, voting rights, and access to  healthcare; that are edging closer and closer to ruling that a person's  religious beliefs should exempt them from following civil rights laws.   Having said that, let me say very briefly why I oppose the nomination  of  [[Page S4894]]  Judge Kavanaugh. As it happens, I do not usually believe anything that  President Trump says because I think, sadly, that he is a pathological  liar, but I do think this is a moment where we should believe one thing  that he said during the campaign. I think, in this instance, he was  actually telling the truth. During the campaign, he was asked if he  wanted to see the Court overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision  that protects a woman's right in this country to control her own body.  He responded to that question:         Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on,       that's really what's going to be--that will happen. And       that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am       putting pro-life justices on the court.    That is Donald Trump during the campaign.   On a separate occasion, as many recall, Trump suggested that women  who have abortions should be punished. I have very little doubt that  while he may evade the question of whether or not he wants to overturn  Roe v. Wade--I have zero doubt--he would not have been appointed by  Donald Trump unless that is exactly what he will do.   As I think we all know, President Trump put forth a list of 25  potential justices, all of whom were handpicked by the Heritage  Foundation and the Federalist Society. These two extreme rightwing  groups claim they have ``no idea'' how any of the people on that list  would rule on Roe v. Wade, but overruling Roe has been a Republican  dream for 40 years. Please do not insult our intelligence by suggesting  it is possible that any of these candidates could secretly support a  woman's right to control her own body. That will not be the case.   That brings us to Judge Kavanaugh. You may remember that last year  the Federal Government was sued by an undocumented teenage girl they  were keeping in detention in Texas. She discovered that she was  pregnant while in detention and tried to obtain an abortion. Judge  Kavanaugh wanted to force her to delay the proceeding, presumably until  it was no longer legal under Texas law for her to obtain an abortion in  that State. When he was overruled by the full DC Circuit, he complained  in a dissent that his colleagues were creating a right to ``abortion on  demand.'' Does that sound like someone who is going to strike down  State laws that create undue barriers to abortion access, or does it  sound like somebody who had no problem with forcing a teenage girl to  carry a pregnancy to term?   There is also another case percolating out of Texas that could have  even graver consequences for tens of millions of Americans. The State  of Texas and 17 other Republican States have sued the Federal  Government, claiming that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional,  and the Department of Justice under Donald Trump agrees with them.  While I do not know how Judge Kavanaugh would rule on this case--nobody  could, of course, know that--I will note that in another case about the  ACA, he suggested that the President could simply refuse to enforce  laws that he deems unconstitutional, regardless of what the Courts say.   What we are dealing with here is, literally, a life-and-death  decision regarding preexisting conditions, regarding the issue of  whether today you have cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or some other  life-threatening illness. Before the Affordable Care Act, an insurance  company could say to you: Oh, you have a history of cancer, we are not  going to insure you because we can't make money out of you because that  cancer might recur. It might be: You are too sick and we are going to  lose money on your case and we are not going to insure you or, if we do  insure you, your rates are going to be five times higher than somebody  else's of your age.    One of the major achievements of the Affordable Care Act, which was  supported by 90 percent of the American people, is that we must not end  the protections the American people have today against insurance  companies that would bring back preexisting conditions--that would  discriminate against people who were ill. It is very likely that case  will come before the U.S. Supreme Court. Yet 90 percent of the American  people say we should not discriminate against people who have cancer or  heart disease and that insurance companies should not be allowed to  deny them coverage or raise their rates to levels that people cannot  afford.   The Trump administration has supported the argument of the Republican  Governors and will not defend the ACA in court, which will come to the  Supreme Court. Unless I am very mistaken, Judge Kavanaugh will vote  with the rightwing majority and allow discrimination against people who  have serious illnesses to, once again, be the law of the land.   Time and again, Judge Kavanaugh has sided with the interests of  corporations and the wealthy instead of the interests of ordinary  Americans. He has sided with electric power utilities and chemical  companies over protecting clean air and fighting climate change.   He has argued, if you can believe it, that the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, which has saved consumers billions and billions of  dollars from the greed and illegal behavior of Wall Street and  financial institutions, is unconstitutional because its structure does  not give enough power to the President. He has also argued against net  neutrality.   He dissented in an OSHA case and argued that SeaWorld should not be  fined for the death of one of its whale trainers because the trainer  should have accepted the risk of death as a routine part of the job.   While nobody can predict the future, we can take a hard look at Judge  Kavanaugh's record and extrapolate from his decisions what kind of  Supreme Court Justice he will be. I think the evidence is overwhelming  that he will be part of the 5-to-4 majority, which has cast decision  after decision against the needs of working people, against the needs  of the poor, and against the rights of the American people to vote  freely, without restrictions.   This is an issue to which I will return. I just want the American  people to understand, when they hear this debate taking place here and  think, well, it is the same ol' same ol'--with people yelling at each  other--that this is an enormously important decision which will impact  the lives of tens and tens of millions of people. I hope very much that  the American people become engaged on this issue, learn about Judge  Kavanaugh's record, and join with those of us who are in opposition to  his nomination.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor BG Michael  T. Heston of Richmond, VT. This Sunday, July 15, 2018, Brigadier  General Heston will relinquish command of the Vermont Army National  Guard and celebrate his military retirement. We are truly fortunate to  have such a dedicated leader as Brigadier General Heston serving in our  Armed Forces, and I sincerely thank him for his 32 years of  extraordinary service to Vermont and our country.   Brigadier General Heston began his military career as an enlisted  member of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. He received his commission  from Vermont's officer candidate school in 1990 as a second lieutenant  and then swiftly rose through the ranks, reaching his current rank of  brigadier general in 2014.   Throughout his career, Brigadier General Heston has commanded at all  levels, from platoon leader of an armor platoon to commanding the  entire Vermont Army National Guard, leading the women and men of the  Green Mountain Boys in critical missions within our State of Vermont,  as well as overseas, including three deployments to Afghanistan in  support of Operation Enduring Freedom. His unwavering leadership and  dedication has been recognized with numerous awards and decorations,  including the Bronze Star Medal with bronze oakleaf cluster, the  Meritorious Service Medal with three oakleaf clusters, the Army  Commendation Medal with three oakleaf clusters, the Army Reserve  Components Achievement Medal with silver oakleaf cluster and two  oakleaf clusters, the Vermont Career Service Award, and many others.   In addition to his military service, Brigadier General Heston served  as a member of the Vermont State police from 1983 until his retirement  in 2009. He has also served as the deputy adjutant general of the  Vermont National Guard since 2014, a position he will continue to fill  as he enters civilian life. We are fortunate to continue benefiting  from Brigadier General Heston's many years of experience as he mentors  leaders and members of Vermont's National Guard and provides invaluable  advice and support to the adjutant general.   There is no doubt that Brigadier General Heston's decades of  dedication, leadership, and service will be long remembered by a  grateful State and Nation. I know his wife, June, their children Kelsey  and Keegan, and his fellow members of the Vermont National Guard join  me in congratulating him on his many accomplishments so far and wishing  him well in the next phase of his career. The State of Vermont is lucky  to count him as one of our own, and we look forward to his continued  presence with the Vermont National Guard.                            ____________________
