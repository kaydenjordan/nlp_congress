 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the chairman is correct: the protection of our  neighborhoods, the protection of our young people, the securing of our  schools, the stopping of gun violence, the safeguarding of this Nation,  are important responsibilities of this Congress, and certainly of the  Nation itself. So I join with that commitment of safeguarding our  neighbors and friends and families and our children.   So I would certainly like to say of the Senate amendment dealing with  the Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2018, it  does provide additional resources to help local jurisdictions prevent  and fight crime in their communities. It would authorize the Attorney  General to establish and implement a program to be known as the Project  Safe Neighborhoods Block Grant Program within the Office of Justice  Programs at the Department of Justice, thereby providing a formal  authorization for the Project Safe Neighborhoods program, which is  currently implemented by DOJ. That is an absolutely positive step to  protect our neighborhoods.   Thirty percent of the funding awards under this program would be,  however, allocated to fighting gang-related crime.   While I support authorizing this program, I would like to highlight  two major concerns with this Senate amendment.   First, a substantial portion of the funding under this bill would be  dedicated to anti-gang task forces. I support preventing and fighting  crime no matter who the perpetrator may be, but I must caution against  targeting groups of young people who are not engaged in crime, or who  are standing around, or who may be, in essence, said to be engaged in  crime, or may be from particular neighborhoods or ethnicities or  backgrounds.   I think all of our children deserve a chance to grow and become  contributing citizens. I would want to make sure that we get the gangs  and that we get those who are the deadly ones that are killing and  maiming, and those names, we know, have been cited, but I also want to  make sure that we give our children a chance.  [[Page H4795]]    However, under the current framework, focus is placed on identified  subsets of individuals or organizations responsible for increasing  violence. This creates a danger where innocent young people will likely  become targets, whether by virtue of clothes color or mere acquaintance  of someone in light of the various talk, if you will, about gangs like  MS-13, which I will acknowledge are in all of our communities from east  to west and north to south.   Let's get the bad guys. Let's make sure we help our children not be  destined to be the bad guys.   We must not use law enforcement as a means to target individuals  based solely on their ethnicity or national origin. Far too often, the  rhetoric that we are fighting gangs may be laced with bias toward  difference.   That is why I wanted to offer an amendment at the Rules Committee to  the Senate amendment, which would reflect the original provision  offered by Representative Comstock related to targeting groups. That  was one that we were able to work with here in the House. That specific  provision in H.R. 3249 was a much better provision.   If accepted, my amendment would have ensured that funding be  allocated justly based on sincere need and not on abuse that may occur  to demonstrate a significant or increased presence of criminal  organizations; and, number two, prevent funding being used towards a  wide range of people that might need help, but labeled as criminal  groups, rather than the smaller number of people in communities  responsible, as you will hear law enforcement say, for the majority of  violent crimes, like concentrated transnational organized crime groups  as defined by the statute.   This eliminates the sweeping effect this bill will have in  application, where groups of people not defined by statute as  transnational organized crime groups will become targets based on  possible biases or rhetoric launched at particular classes of people.   We cannot ignore that unfortunately, in the reality of our times,  things may go awry. Therefore, in addition to introducing legislation,  we must be vigilant in conducting oversight of the use of program funds  and in protecting against such possible abuse.   Second, I have concerns about the provision of the bill that focuses  on data-driven intervention. I advocate instead for a robust focus on  prevention-driven initiatives that will save us an enormous amount of  money when done effectively.   That is why I wanted to offer a second amendment which would amend  the Crime Control Safe Streets Act of 1968 to allow for strong emphasis  on gang prevention programs, which is key to curtailing much of these  problems. It is imperative to provide front-end mechanisms that would  prevent the problems that are often costly, resulting in both human  costs and tax dollars for our prisons.                                time  1415    This amendment was practical and inexpensive.   Now, let me clarify something. Data is very important because it  helps us move toward best practices. But in addition to data, we need  to be able to use our good sense to talk about intervention,  prevention, and working with youngsters again, who may be categorized  as being violent but, instead, may be the right kind of targets for  intervention and prevention programs.   This Senate amendment authorizes $50 million for each of the fiscal  years 2019 to 2021, $150 million. The Senate amendment does not comply  with House Republican CutGo requirements so that $50 million may be  authorized for the program for this time.   I certainly believe where we are trying to help children, we should  also take that into consideration, particularly with prevention and  intervention or gang violence and antibullying initiatives. They are  equally worthy goals.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to look further into how we continue  to work together and to work to monitor this legislation to ensure that  there is not an adverse impact on individuals clearly because of  neighborhoods and backgrounds, because that is what America is all  about: an equal opportunity for particularly our young people, to get  out of where they are and to be able to surge to be a good and  contributing citizen.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the Senate amendment to H.R. 3249,  the ``Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Act of 2017''.   This Senate amendment would provide additional resources to help  local jurisdictions prevent and fight crime in their communities.   It would authorize the Attorney General to establish and' implement a  program, to be known as the ``Project Safe Neighborhoods Block Grant  Program'' (Program), within the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) at the  Department of Justice (DOJ), thereby providing a formal authorization  for the Project Safe Neighborhoods Program, which is currently  implemented by DOJ.   Thirty percent of the funding awards under this Program would be  allocated to fighting gang-related crime. While I support authorizing  this Program, I would like to highlight two major concerns of this  Senate amendment.   First, a substantial portion of the funding under this bill would be  dedicated to anti-gang task forces. I support preventing and fighting  crime no matter who the perpetrator may be, but I must caution against  targeting groups of young people who are not engaged in crime.   However, under the current framework, focus is placed on ``identified  subsets of individuals or organizations'' responsible for increasing  violence. This creates a danger, where innocent young people will  likely become targets, whether by virtue of clothes color or mere  acquaintance of someone, in light of the administrations' rhetoric  around MS-13s. We must not use law enforcement as a means to target  individuals based solely on their ethnicity or national origin. Far too  often, the rhetoric of fighting gangs has been laced with racial bias.   This is why I offered an amendment at Rules to this Senate amendment,  which would reflect the original provision offered by Rep. Comstock  relating to targeted groups. That specific provision in H.R. 3249 was a  much better provision.   If accepted, my amendment would have:   1) ensured that funding be allocated justly based on sincere need and  not on abuse that may occur to demonstrate a ``significant or increased  presence'' of criminal organizations; and 2) prevented funding being  used towards a wide range of people that need help but labeled as  criminal gangs, rather than the small number of people in communities  responsible for majority of violent crimes, like concentrated  ``transnational organized crime groups'', as defined by statute.   This eliminates the sweeping effect this bill will have in  application, where groups of people not defined by statute as  ``transnational organized crime groups'' will become targets based on  biases and/or rhetoric launched at a particular class of people.   We cannot ignore that unfortunate reality of current times.  Therefore, in addition to introducing legislation, we must be vigilant  in conducting oversight of the use of Program funds and in protecting  against such possible abuse.   Second, I have concerns about the provisions of the bill that focus  on data-driven intervention and I advocate instead, for a robust focus  on prevention-driven initiatives that will save us enormous amount of  money when done effectively.   This is why I offered a 2nd amendment, which would amend the Crime  Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, to allow for strong emphasis on  gang prevention programs, which is key to curtailing much of these  problems. It is imperative to provide front-end mechanisms that would  prevent the problems that are often costly, resulting in both human  cost and tax dollars for our prisons. This amendment was practical and  inexpensive.   This Senate amendment authorizes $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years  2019 through 2021, totaling $150,000,000.   This Senate amendment does not comply with House Republican ``cut- go'' requirements so that $50 million may be authorized for the Program  for this time period. I believe prevention and intervention of gang  violence and anti-bullying are equally worthy goals.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to pursue avenues that will not  adversely impact individuals based solely on their ethnic backgrounds.   Mr. Speaker, I do not argue against the merit of this Program. It  would be but one facet of DOJ's efforts to address gun and gang  violence at the local, state, and tribal levels. We should view it from  that holistic perspective, and as an effort to supplement but not  supplant alternatives that may employ different, yet, still-effective  approaches.   During the Committee's consideration of the H.R. 3249, we expressed  these funding concerns, and urged that these funding prohibitions be  eliminated.   Today, we also address the concerns in the Senate amendment to H.R.  3249, which states as a purpose:   Developing and executing comprehensive strategic plans to reduce  violent crimes ``including the enforcement of gun laws, and  prioritizing efforts focused on `identified subsets of individuals or  organizations' responsible for increasing violence in a particular  geographic area.''  [[Page H4796]]    For these reasons, I respectfully request serious consideration of  these concerns and caution against possible abuse that may occur, which  will prove counterproductive.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Virginia is absolutely right on our  commitment to working to protect the children that we don't want to be  the victims. Certainly, gangs like MS-13 are in many places, and that  is what my focus is. Those bad guys, those who would do harm, clearly,  we stand united on.   At the same time, I want to make sure that those who stumble in have  alternatives, particularly in this country, to get out of that web. As  we protect against them and give law enforcement their tools, I want to  make sure that we give to others to find other ways to move away from  this so that the bad intent, the murderous intent of those gangs can be  separated and handled by law enforcement, while other young people have  other opportunities.   I might also say that I would hope that the Department of Justice  will fund this program and, when I say that, Congress will work with us  to fund other programs of intervention.   So I might, if I could, engage the chairman in a colloquy. I would be  eager to hear the gentleman's thoughts on this thought.   I am concerned that all of the talk of fighting gang violence may be,  beyond this august Hall, laced with bias, racial bias, ethnicity, et  cetera. The Senate amendment includes a reference to focusing on  identified subsets of individuals and organizations responsible for  increasing violence in a particular geographic area. I might indicate  that that may be some bad behavior kids.   Will the gentleman assure me that the intent of this provision  referring to subsets of individuals is not to encourage or condone the  targeting of anyone because of their race or national origin and that  they happen to be in groups?    I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I just wanted to  make a concluding comment. We worked together on this. Would the  gentleman also say that intervention and prevention programs are a  positive contribution to helping our young people stay away from  violence?    Mr. Speaker, I certainly look forward to working  further with the gentleman on these matters, and I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Again, let me just say, we have a solid and unified commitment to  protect our children, our neighborhoods, our families, and to isolate  violent gangs, some of whom carry the name MS-13, but also to work with  law enforcement as they work to isolate those violent persons, but help  find a way to steer other juveniles into a way of redemption, if I  might utilize that term.   Mr. Speaker, I want to continue working with the Judiciary Committee  and my colleagues on that very point. So, Mr. Speaker, I do not argue  the merit of this program. It would be but one facet of DOJ's efforts  to address gun and gang violence at the local, State, and Tribal  levels. We would view it from the holistic perspective and as an effort  to supplement, but not supplant, alternatives that may employ different  yet still effective approaches. And that is antibullying, bullying  intervention, intervention in gang activity, cyberbullying, and  prevention of gang activities from the perspective that we understand  in our neighborhoods.   During the committee's consideration of H.R. 3249, we expressed these  funding concerns and urged that these fund prohibitions be eliminated.  What I want to see is other programs continue to be funded that can  help law enforcement and others on the question of prevention.   Today, we also address concerns in the Senate amendment to H.R. 3249  which states as a purpose, developing and executing comprehensive  strategic plans to reduce violent crimes, including the enforcement of  gun laws and prioritizing efforts focused on identifying subsets of  individuals and organizations responsible for increasing violence and  in a particular geographic area.   I want to thank the chairman for what I believe is a clarification on  the record, and we will continue to monitor as we work with our law  enforcement across the Nation. For these reasons, I am respectfully  asking that we continue to express our concerns, that we review it,  that we ensure that the DOJ, as it works through these grants,  continues to keep our legislative thoughts in mind so that this bill is  productive and certainly not counterproductive of what we intend to do.   Mr. Speaker, I again indicate a commitment that all of us have to get  rid of those who terrorize our neighborhoods through the violence of  gangs, like MS-13, and save our children who can be saved--which I know  they can be--in our neighborhoods and throughout the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
