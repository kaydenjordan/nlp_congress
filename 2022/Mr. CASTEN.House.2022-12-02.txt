 Mr. Speaker, last year, a record 14.5 million Americans  registered for healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act,  including 5.8 million previously uninsured people who have been able to  gain coverage.   Thanks to the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act,  we have reduced monthly healthcare premiums for millions of Americans  by an average of $800 per person per year.   When you sign up for a healthcare plan through the Affordable Care  Act, you gain low-cost access to doctors, lifesaving preventative care,  mental health care, and more.   It is open enrollment season. That means if you currently have or  want to obtain healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act,  please log on to the exchange at HealthCare.Gov and choose a plan by  December 15 to ensure that you have coverage starting at the beginning  of next year.                            ____________________
