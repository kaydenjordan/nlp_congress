 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my amendment No. 132  to the INVEST in America Act which would ensure that wastewater  infrastructure funding using the Clean Water State Revolving Fund or  other Clean Water Act grant programs undergo a climate resiliency  assessment.   Today, 88 percent of the West is under some form of drought. Back in  my home district, Nevada's Third, the water in Lake Mead sits at the  lowest level since the Hoover Dam was built. Almost half of my home  State of Nevada is experiencing exceptional drought--the highest  classification there is.   As I stand here today, the unfortunate truth is that this is not just  a Nevada problem. From coast to coast, climate change is here--it is  not some distant threat--and it demands that we take action for all of  our constituents.   Investments in infrastructure are desperately needed, and we need to  ensure that these projects can withstand the impact of climate change.  We cannot talk about infrastructure without talking about climate  change, because what good is it for us to invest millions or billions  in infrastructure if it can't hold up to the devastating impact of  climate change?   For example, we should be looking at how a water treatment facility  would withstand extreme heat, because the reality is, as we have  experienced, temperatures are rising. Just look at the West right now.  So as we are making investments in water treatment facilities, we must  ensure that these facilities will not fail under extreme heat,  straining already limited water resources.   A climate resiliency assessment might look at what happens when it is  120 degrees and the wastewater facility loses power during a blackout.  We need to ensure that our facilities are prepared for the realities  that we are facing. That is true whether we are talking about drought  and extreme heat or worsening hurricanes or even rising sea levels  along the coast.   My amendment will ensure that future wastewater infrastructure is  designed and constructed to withstand potential impacts of climate  change. Importantly, my amendment also is in line with a January 2020  report on water infrastructure from the nonpartisan Government  Accountability Office. This nonpartisan report recommended that  Congress require that climate resilience be considered in planning for  federally funded water infrastructure projects.   So I am implore all of you to join me in voting ``yes'' on my  amendment. We must ensure that our investments in infrastructure are  longlasting and resilient to the threat of climate change.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2250     Mr. Speaker, I would like to address a couple of  points that were raised.   First of all, if these requirements were already being met, I don't  understand why the GAO, in 2020, recommended that any investment in  federally funded infrastructure should undergo such an assessment.   Secondly, in terms of the burden, we have added language to this  amendment to make it not a one-size-fits-all. In fact, it will only  require assessment when appropriate for the project.   It will consider varying levels of assessments that reflect the  scale, or the type of the project, or activity for which the  infrastructure funds are sought; and it will identify entities to  provide technical assistance to applicants for wastewater  infrastructure funds to assist them. This is particularly geared toward  smaller investments.   Finally, with respect to this amendment being unnecessary, I say just  look around this country at what is happening. I mean, we want to be  fiscally responsible, and I don't think we want to make investments to  know that in 3 or 5 years, or even 1 year, they are rendered unusable  because of climate change.   So this, in fact, is a most necessary amendment, and we are feeling  the impacts of climate change right now, and the time is now to provide  these assessments.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I will just, again, reiterate that  most importantly about this amendment is it does address local needs.  Specifically, we included language in this to allow for local entities.  But most importantly, they are accessing Federal dollars. So with  Federal dollars, I think we need to put some safeguards to make sure  that that investment will withstand the impact of climate change that  we are seeing all across this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H3576]]         Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
