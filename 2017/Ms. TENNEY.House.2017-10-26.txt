 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Robert Miller,  superintendent of the Herkimer Central School District.   When Robert Miller became superintendent of the Herkimer Central  School District in 2013, he was facing a problem that many  superintendents across this country are facing: a low and decreasing  graduation rate.   However, in the 4 years since Mr. Miller began in his new role,  Herkimer has seen a drastic turnaround. The graduation rate has  increased 11 percent, from 69 to 80 percent.   However, in 2006, Herkimer's graduation rates were at 87 percent. Mr.  Miller has made it his mission to ensure that Herkimer Central School  District reaches that number again.   Mr. Miller noted that it was the dedication of both teachers and  administrators that led to the significant increase. Their ability and  willingness to intervene with students at risk has helped these  students successfully move to the next stage of their lives with the  skills they need to contribute positively to our community.   Thank you to Superintendent Miller and the dedicated staff at  Herkimer Central School District for your tremendous work and  commitment to our next generation of leaders. I know your effort will  continue inspiring our students for years to come.                            ____________________
