 Mr. Speaker, this resolution would overturn a Securities  and Exchange Commission rule that, according to the agency, is supposed  to ``help combat global corruption and empower citizens of resource- rich countries to hold their governments accountable. . . .''   Well, that is a grand idea, but we have a financial regulator to  protect the American investor, not to combat global corruption or  empower citizens for other countries. I am sure we could send the SEC  off to fight any number of other international problems--religious  oppression, authoritarian regimes, malaria, maybe even leprosy.   The question is if a financial regulator mandated to combat all these  things can fulfill its core mission to provide financial transparency  and prevent fraud. Given that we had a financial crisis that the SEC  didn't foresee and did nothing to prevent, that would suggest that it  needs even less on its plate, not more. What this joint resolution does  is put the American investor first and help us to stop sending the SEC  off on global rabbit trails.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.
