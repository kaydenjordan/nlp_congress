 Mr. Speaker, for nearly half a century, legendary news  anchor Jim Gardner has informed and guided Philadelphia, southeastern  Pennsylvania, and south Jersey. Next week, he will retire, and I thank  him for his incredible service.   Jim joined Action News in 1976 as a reporter before setting into his  iconic role as the 6 and 11 p.m. anchor, becoming the longest-serving  on-air personality in our region's history.   As the years changed and trust in our institutions eroded, one  journalistic institution stood strong: Jim Gardner.  [[Page H9744]]    Philadelphia is a city of neighborhoods, and Jim works with  character, generosity, and a deep love of all of his neighbors. He did  not hesitate when asked to moderate a free library discussion about our  family's book on addiction and recovery.   Jim Gardner has provided stability through uncertainty, from things  electoral to environmental, and lift through our joys, like the current  Eagles season.   For 45 years, Jim has been our Walter Cronkite with his signature  mustache.   We will miss you in our living rooms, Jim, delivering the news with  honesty, integrity, and respect. We wish you, America's anchor, a happy  retirement. Thank you, Jim.                            ____________________
