 Mr. President.    Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Dilawar  Syed's nomination to serve as Deputy Administrator of the Small  Business Administration.   I have a letter of support from the Congressional Asian Pacific  American Caucus that I would ask unanimous consent to have printed into  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                 September 14, 2021.      Hon. Ben Cardin,      Hon. Rand Paul,      U.S. Senate, Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Cardin and Ranking Member Paul: As members of       the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC),       which is comprised of 76 members of Congress, we write to       strongly endorse the swift confirmation of Dilawar Syed, who       has been nominated to serve as Deputy Administrator of the       U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). He has decades of       experience in business, entrepreneurship, and public service,       making him extremely well-qualified for this position.        AAPI small businesses have been especially hard hit during       the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, according to a report by the       New York Federal Reserve, the Asian American community not       only experienced the largest drop in entrepreneurship during       the pandemic, but while other communities of color saw a       rebound in entrepreneurship as the pandemic continued, that       rebound had yet to happen for AAPIs. Mr. Syed has a long       history working with all communities, but has particularly       strong ties to the AAPI community, having served as a       Commissioner on the White House Commission on AAPIs. At this       pivotal moment for AAPI small businesses, having Mr. Syed's       background represented at SBA is critical.        Mr. Syed, an immigrant who has embodied the values of hard       work and ingenuity, has built and scaled businesses with       major impacts in technology, healthcare, and business       services. He has shown incredible prowess as an entrepreneur       in business growth and development. For example, as President       of Freshworks, a customer service software company, Mr. Syed       grew the company from a few dozen customers to thousands of       small and medium businesses across the U.S. During his tenure       as Commissioner on the White House Commission on AAPIs, Mr.       Syed actively worked to connect entrepreneurs in underserved       regions to the SBA and Department of Commerce. From serving       as the founding chair of the California Entrepreneurship Task       Force to spearheading rapid response engagement during the       COVID-19  [[Page S6754]]       pandemic with the state's most vulnerable small businesses to       increase awareness of critical programs like the SBA's       Paycheck Protection Program, Mr. Syed has consistently helped       empower and uplift our nation's small businesses.        Mr. Syed's nomination has the support of more than 150       civic, government, higher education and business leaders and       organizations, including endorsements from the U.S. Chamber       of Commerce, U.S. Black Chambers, National Asian/Pacific       Islander American Chamber of Commerce & Entrepreneurship,       Small Business Roundtable, Anti-Defamation League, American       Jewish Congress, and many others. Upon confirmation, Mr. Syed       would become the highest-ranking Muslim American in the Biden       administration to date, as well as one of the highest-ranking       AAPIs.        However, we are disappointed to see the treatment Mr. Syed       has received from those on the Committee that have held up       his confirmation vote, based on false accusations, anti-      Muslim sentiment, and efforts to hamstring Committee business       unless specific conditions on unrelated matters are met.       Since June 16, the Committee has made three different       attempts to consider Mr. Syed's nomination, but each time       certain members have challenged the proceedings or blocked       them from moving forward. On two separate occasions, these       members even boycotted the proceedings--denying Mr. Syed fair       consideration. Targeting nominees like Mr. Syed for their       faith, ethnicity, or place of birth, furthers the perpetual       foreigner stereotype to which AAPIs are constantly subjected.       We stand firmly against the use of these typecasting       misconceptions. These tactics have been rejected by leading       civil rights and faith-based organizations and have no place       in our government or our nation. There is no question that       Mr. Syed is uniquely well suited and highly qualified for       this role, and small business owners and entrepreneurs across       the country deserve this standard of leadership at SBA.       Continuing to block his nomination is a disservice to these       business owners and entrepreneurs.        The Deputy Administrator role has traditionally been       focused on managing execution of SBA's programmatic mission       and day-to-day operations, which includes bringing       desperately needed relief to struggling small businesses and       entrepreneurs across the nation. This position has been left       vacant for over three years and continuing to do so prevents       the agency from having a fully staffed senior leadership team       at a time when the SBA's importance in our nation's economic       recovery is at an all-time high.        Mr. Syed's impressive background both in public service and       the private sector in business and entrepreneurship along       with his leadership in the AAPI community will undoubtedly be       assets in his role as SBA's Deputy Administrator. We are       confident that Dilawar Syed is the perfect fit for this role       and we urge the Committee to promptly move forward with his       confirmation.            Sincerely,        Judy Chu, Member of Congress, CAPAC Chair; Grace Meng,       Member of Congress, CAPAC First Vice-Chair; Kaiali`i Kahele,       Member of Congress, CAPAC Freshman Representative; Mazie K.       Hirono, U.S. Senator; Mark Takano, Member of Congress, CAPAC       Second Vice-Chair; Ami Bera, M.D., Member of Congress; Tammy       Duckworth, U.S. Senator; Ted W. Lieu, Member of Congress,       CAPAC Whip; Al Green, Member of Congress; Pramila Jayapal,       Member of Congress; Jan Schakowsky, Member of Congress; Ro       Khanna, Member of Congress; Dina Titus, Member of Congress;       Barbara Lee, Member of Congress; Norma Torres, Member of       Congress.     In the midst of the pandemic, what is normally a very  bipartisan small business committee, Republicans are blocking Mr.  Syed's nomination. This is particularly egregious behavior by  Republicans on the committee because Mr. Syed is exceptionally  qualified to hold this position and is widely supported by business  groups and communities across the country.   In fact, let me read a paragraph from the Congressional Asian Pacific  American Caucus letter that I just mentioned.   I am reading from the letter:         Mr. Syed's nomination has the support of more than 150       civic, government, higher education and business leaders and       organizations, including endorsements from the U.S. Chamber       of Commerce, U.S. Black Chambers, National Asian/Pacific       Islander American Chamber of Commerce & Entrepreneurship,       Small Business Roundtable, Anti-Defamation League, American       Jewish Congress, and many others. Upon confirmation, Mr. Syed       would become the highest ranking Muslim American in the Biden       administration to date, as well as one of the highest ranking       AAPIs.    Republicans have continued to block this nomination for months.  Earlier this summer, they disputed the results of a meeting the  committee had to advance the nomination. Since then, they have refused  to show up for three other meetings, including one we held last week,  denying the necessary quorum for a vote to be taken.   The reasons for blocking Mr. Syed's nomination have changed over  time. First, they were concerned about SBA loans his company received  during the pandemic, even though these loans were lawful and fully  repaid before he was nominated. Then they insinuated he was somehow  anti-Jewish and anti-Israel--note the groups that I read that have  supported him--despite his widespread support in these communities. And  now, they are concerned about lawful SBA loans to Planned Parenthood  Health Centers, something that Mr. Syed certainly had no control over.   Throughout the last several months, Mr. Syed has repeatedly made  himself available to address any concerns my colleagues might have  about his background or qualifications, things that clearly matter in  his ability to do the job.   It boggles the mind that Republicans are blocking someone who is the  very picture of the American dream: an entrepreneur, a job creator who  was born in Pakistan and educated in America, who understands firsthand  the challenges businesses have faced during this pandemic. Mr. Syed  would be an asset to SBA and the businesses they serve, our own  constituents.   Every day that Republicans continue their obstruction, they are doing  a disservice to these businesses who can least afford this uncertainty  and turmoil in this moment.   Mr. Syed deserves fair consideration.   Republican efforts to block not just this nomination but so many  others for the simple reason that they want to slow the process so that  this administration can have people in place who can actually do the  job to help the American people--enough is enough.   I just say to the Republicans: You know, put your votes where your  mouths are. You say you support small businesses; you say you support  this, that, and the other thing; and yet you will not let this  administration get on with their job to do what is necessary to help  small businesses, to help our communities, in the midst of an ongoing  pandemic. It boggles the mind. I say: Act like the Senators you are,  who were sent here to do your job, and let's get on with this  nomination.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Coffee Plant  Health Initiative Amendments Act, a bill that allows the Secretary of  Agriculture to provide research and extension grants for the purposes  of protecting coffee plants from outside threats such as invasive pests  and weeds.   Coffee serves as a cornerstone of Hawaii's agricultural industry,  both in terms of culture and economics. Coffee has been grown in Hawaii  for almost 200 years and is revered all over the world for exceptional  quality and taste. Coffee is grown on every main island in Hawaii, with  half of the acreage on Hawaii Island and the other half spread across  Kauai, Oahu, Maui, Molokai, and Lanai. Hawaii remains the largest  grower of coffee in the United States, with over 27 million pounds  produced and yielding just over $54 million during the 2019-2020  season.   Like all natural ecosystems in Hawaii, coffee production has  experienced numerous threats from pests and weeds. These include the  black twig borer, root-knot nematode, green scale, crab spider, coffee  berry borer, and coffee leaf rust, to name a few. In response to the  2010 arrival of the coffee berry borer in Hawaii, I successfully  included the coffee plant health initiative provision in the 2014 farm  bill. This provision allowed the Secretary of Agriculture to provide  research and extension grants to help the coffee community combat the  coffee berry borer. The resulting Federal assistance provided has been  instrumental in providing coffee producers the tools they need to  protect their coffee crops from the coffee berry borer.   Within the past year another coffee pest has emerged in Hawaii, a  fungus known as Coffee Leaf Rust. Like the coffee berry borer, Federal  funds are needed to research and develop pest management strategies to  equip coffee producers with the knowledge and tools necessary to  safeguard their coffee yields.   This bill builds upon the 2014 farm bill coffee plant health  initiative provision by expanding the scope of research and extension  grants to all invasive pests and noxious weeds threatening the coffee  industry, not just the coffee berry borer. While our researchers and  coffee growers are currently battling coffee leaf rust, future pest and  weeds not currently in Hawaii, like the Coffee Leaf Miner and Coffee  Wilt Disease, are likely to emerge. This expansion of the coffee plant  health initiative will provide much needed Federal resources to help  our coffee community quickly respond to the myriad pests waiting in the  wings.   This bill is supported by the University of Hawaii at Manoa College  of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources, the Hawaii Coffee  Association, the Kau Coffee Growers Cooperative, Kauai Coffee Company,  LLC, Puerto Rico Coffee Roasters, LLC, and the Puerto Rico Farm Bureau.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Schumer, Mr.          Booker, Mr. Hickenlooper, Ms. Rosen, Ms. Smith, Mr. King, Mrs.          Feinstein, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Murray,          Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Ossoff, Mrs. Gillibrand, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms.          Baldwin, Mr. Markey, Mr. Peters, Ms. Warren, and Ms.          Duckworth):   S. 2887.
