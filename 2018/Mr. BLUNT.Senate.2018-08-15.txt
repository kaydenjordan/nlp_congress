 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the  disposition of the Richardson nomination, the Senate proceed to  legislative session and the consideration of H.R. 6157; further, that  for the purpose of rule XVI, in relation to substitute amendment No.  3695, the text of H.R. 6157 serve as the basis for defense of  germaneness for division A of the amendment and the text of H.R. 6470,  as reported by the House Appropriations Committee, serve as the basis  for defense of germaneness for division B of the amendment.    Mr. President, I wish to talk for a few minutes about the  principal work that we will be starting this week and, I would hope, be  completing next week--certainly completing before we move on to other  work. I want to highlight the critical work of the National Defense  Appropriations Act and the decision just made by the body that will  allow us to go to that bill and to the Labor, Health and Human Services  bill this week.   On Monday, the President signed the authorizing bill for fiscal year  2019, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act. This bill  provides important authorizations for a number of programs. By the way,  in its title, it also recognizes the extraordinary courage and service  of our friend and colleague John McCain. On more than one occasion, I  know Senator McCain has said that chairing that committee has been the  most important public service he has ever been allowed to do. So to  have this bill named for him is something that I appreciate and that I  know the Presiding Officer does too.   I commend my colleagues for the work they have done and for  completing that work, the defense authorization bill, in the fastest  time in 20 years. This bill has been signed into law by the President.  Now we get to take a step further and do the second thing that Congress  is responsible for, not just for authorizing and setting out a  blueprint for how we defend the country but for providing the funding  with which to do that.   Over the years, I have seen that many of our colleagues have forever  been prepared to debate with regard to how we need to spend more money  on  [[Page S5609]]  defense until it comes time to vote on a bill that includes more money  for defense. This bill does that. Frankly, I think it is the most  important of our responsibilities--the defense of the country. The  Federal Government's principal role is only ensured when we provide the  money to do that. We need to be sure that we provide for those who  serve in uniform--those who serve us--and for what they need to carry  out their missions. I believe the bill we will debate in the later part  of this week and all of next week--and as long as it takes to get it  done--does that. As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on  Defense, I was pleased to vote for this bill. I was pleased to vote for  it as a member of the full Appropriations Committee, and I look forward  to voting for it as the debate ends. I also look forward to the full  debate.   One of the things we have done this year that has not been done in  recent years is to bring these appropriations bills to the floor in a  way that not just the two dozen or so Senators who serve on  Appropriations get to amend and debate and argue in public about what  should be in the bill but to do this in a way that every Senator can  come to the floor and offer an amendment and that every Senator can  debate that amendment if it is germane to the bill and if it meets the  standards of the bill. Everybody who is willing to find the money  somewhere in that bill to pay for what one would rather do rather than  what the bill does gets a chance to do that, and that is a good  process.   This defense funding bill provides a $20 billion increase for  defense, and it supports the largest pay increase in over a decade for  those who serve and defend us. This bill prioritizes resources for  equipment and training to ensure that our troops have every possible  advantage on the battlefield.   I have said before on this floor and at this podium that we never  want our troops to be involved in a fair fight. We want them to be  involved in a fight where they have every possible advantage over their  adversary, and this bill takes steps to do that.   Missouri has a number of military installations. Those installations  and people who work at those installations, civilian and military,  really provide a great part of our Nation's defense--Whiteman Air Force  Base, Rosecrans Air National Guard facility, Fort Leonard Wood,  Missouri National Guard units, the AVCRAD--the repair center in  Springfield, MO, my hometown. People who work there have a big stake in  our country, and we have a big stake in them, as we do in bases all  over the United States.   The chairman, Senator Shelby, and Senator Durbin, the ranking member  of the Defense Subcommittee, have crafted a bill that really makes  crucial investments across the board, from Army end-strength increases  to important investments in the B-2, the A-10, the B-21, the C-130  programs, and others that are essential to the infrastructure of the  military and the very infrastructure itself. The defense facilities and  the Army ammunition plants that haven't been changed very much since  World War II have some update potential in this bill.   This bill is good news for those who serve at Missouri military  bases. It is good news for those who work as civilians at those bases.  It is also good news for the many Missourians who are part of the  defense industry. We have people who work at businesses, large and  small, who are contractors and subcontractors to those contractors,  facilities I have visited in our State where the initial facility was a  converted dairy barn but then added on as they got better and better  and got more subcontracts. Those people are all part of this system.   This bill includes multiyear procurement authority for the F/A-18  Super Hornets. These are manufactured in St. Louis. Year after year,  the Navy has had the Super Hornets included at the top of the unfunded  requirement list, I assume hoping that we in Congress would first look  at that list once we decide what else we could do. On the committee,  this is something that Senator Durbin from Illinois, who is right  across the river from the Boeing facility, and I have worked on to  ensure that this unfunded request was usually met. Because the Navy has  asked for it as part of their long-term structure, what this bill does,  for the first time in some time, is make multiyear commitments to this  plane, which is an important part of many flying packages that we have.   Additionally, the bill provides research funding that is badly needed  to counter threats from China and Russia--huge investments on their  part, using at least some of the things they have taken from us. They  have taken intellectual property we have designed in our aircraft and  other things, and then they have taken their money to see how far they  can get ahead of us, using our technology, in some cases, as the  foundation for what they are trying to do and making major efforts to  try to get ahead of us in things like hypersonics, directed energy,  artificial intelligence, and cyber infiltration, and cyber warfare.  This bill looks at all of those and says that we are not going to let  other countries that are adversaries of ours in the fight for freedom  around the world have the advantage. We are going to continue to do  everything we can to maintain the advantage.   We have to have technological superiority. It has been one of the  great things we have been able to do for those willing to serve, but we  have to be sure that our servicemembers have the training, the  equipment, and the support they need to carry out their mission. That  is my top priority. I think it is the top priority of the Federal  Government.   Over the next few days, we will have a chance to debate that top  priority. There are different ways to do this. There is nothing wrong  with people having different opinions, particularly if they can get a  majority of the Senate to agree with that opinion. I think this is a  bill that is going to stand the test of that debate. We will find a few  ways to improve it as we move forward.   This is a bill in which we demonstrate our gratitude to those who  serve. We demonstrate our commitment to the defense of freedom and  democracy, both in the debate and in the bill. If we don't fund the  decisions we have made in the Defense Authorization Act, we really  haven't made those decisions; we will have talked about what we might  like to do rather than what we are determined to do. This Defense  appropriations bill decides what we are determined to do, willing to do  and to establish as a priority.   I look forward to the entire Senate being able to debate that bill  and hopefully send that bill to a conference with the House and to the  President's desk.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                        Subcommittee on National Parks    The Subcommittee on National Parks of the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources is authorized to meet during the session of the  Senate on Wednesday, August 15, 2018, at 4 p.m. to hold a hearing.                            ____________________
