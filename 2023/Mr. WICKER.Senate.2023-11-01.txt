 Madam President, let me say that I associate myself with  the remarks that were just made by the previous two speakers--the  senior Senator from the State of North Dakota and the distinguished  Senator from Alaska.   I rise today to follow on with the importance of national defense  and, in that regard, to speak specifically about the historic  Australia, United Kingdom, United States agreement known as AUKUS.   This pact, AUKUS, builds upon a bond forged during the First World  War between the United States and Australia and made unshakable in the  second. That bond remains strong today as we face the greatest  challenge of our lifetime--the Chinese Communist Party.   The Senator from Alaska just spoke about the importance of building  our defenses in the Indo-Pacific, and that is exactly what the AUKUS  agreement is designed to address.   Our military leadership has made the stakes clear. The Secretary of  the Air Force, Frank Kendall, recently said:         The intelligence couldn't be clearer. . . . China is       preparing for a war and specifically for a war with the       United States.    Now is the time for free nations across the Pacific to prepare for  this sobering possibility. The AUKUS deal will help prevent that war  from happening. Indeed, the AUKUS agreement is vital, but there is more  work to do beyond that. We have yet to take the actions necessary to  ensure that our industrial base can support both the United States and  Australia.   The basic fact is this: Our defense industrial base is not where it  needs to be. Workforce shortages, a shrinking base of contractors, and  insufficient resources have damaged our military readiness. Year after  year, we have deferred maintenance on our surface ships, even as these  ships are spending more days deployed and the fleet continues to  shrink. Our capabilities are stalling as we hurtle toward a window of  maximum danger with the Chinese Communist Party.   The story for our submarines is no better. We are not prepared to  fulfill our Navy's submarine construction and maintenance needs, let  alone fulfill the prospective commitments in the critical AUKUS  agreement.   Our Navy's requirement is to have 66 attack submarines at 80 percent  readiness. We currently have 49 attack submarines at 67 percent  readiness. Let me say that again. We need 66 attack submarines. We have  only 49. They need to be at 80 percent readiness. They are only at 67  percent.   We should be building two attack submarines per year, but we are  really building 1.2 attack submarines per year. The demands of the  AUKUS agreement would push this requirement higher to above 2.3 attack  submarines per year. We should do that, but we can't meet that  challenge right now. To meet this challenge, our defense industry will  need to handle more demand than ever before.   To handle this demand, our defense industry will need to reverse its  current trajectory. Since the so-called peace dividend of the 1990s, we  have closed two nuclear submarine repair yards and one construction  yard. COVID-19 took a sledgehammer to an already declining workforce,  and our government is expecting that same inexperienced workforce to  meet deadlines not just on our Virginia-class submarines but also the  critically important, nuclear-armed Columbia-class.   Our submarine fleet, just like our surface fleet, is still living off  the Reagan-era defense buildup. Many vessels are in a deteriorating  state and will soon need to be retired, but replacements are not  waiting in the wings. The remaining ships will face longer deployments  and fewer opportunities for maintenance. This is not a blueprint for  American command of the seas, nor does it put us in a position to  provide our Australian friends the submarines which they need.   These cascading problems create what some have called a debt spiral  of submarine construction and readiness. This spiral keeps us from  hitting our shipbuilding targets. Moreover, today's threats mean the  current targets are actually too small. China's navy is now the world's  largest navy. Russia is increasing its nuclear submarine activity in  the Atlantic. Keeping up with these challenges means raising our  shipbuilding goals in the first place, then expanding our industrial  capacity to meet them.   According to our Acting Chief of Naval Operations, Virginia-class  construction needs to nearly double. This is the man whom we have put  in charge and confirmed to let us know about the readiness of our Navy.   I am grateful for past congressional and executive branch efforts to  fund this work; otherwise, we would construct fewer than one Virginia- class submarine each year. But even those funding increases have not  matched our need. At the current rate, we will be at least nine  submarines short by 2030.   Our defense policy cannot continue to hinge upon a hope and a prayer.  To make good on AUKUS and stand by our friends in Australia, the  administration and Congress need to make the investments necessary to  improve submarine construction.   Our first step is clear. We must enact into law the nearly $3.4  billion in submarine funding, including in the defense supplemental  Congress is considering. We need every bit of this funding increased  and more.   These funds will be spread throughout our industrial base in the  United States--inside the United States, employing American workers. It  will modernize our shipyards, accelerate maintenance on our existing  submarine fleet, and put capital investments in place for future  submarine components to be built in our country. They will put  Americans to work, showing that economic development and national  security go hand in hand.   This additional funding is a welcome first step, but we must do more  to show our allies and the U.S. industry and our adversaries that we  can meet the obligations of the AUKUS agreement without putting our own  submarine fleet in jeopardy. We should sustain investments in our  shipbuilders, public shipyards, and the nearly 16,000 suppliers across  the Nation, many of them--most of them--small businesses around the  Nation. This industry network supports American undersea supremacy and  prevents conflicts on the seas, but it needs more long-term investment  to stay afloat.   We already have some sense of what this investment should look like.  I want to emphasize this. The Biden administration commissioned the  ``Submarine Industrial Base 2025'' study to examine the best way to  execute  [[Page S5280]]  AUKUS. From what I understand, the study will document what we already  know: We need significant additional funding to fulfill Australia's  needs alongside those of our fleet. But here is the problem: We  commissioned the study. Inexplicably, the Biden administration has yet  to let Congress actually see the specifics of the study--not Members of  the Democratic leadership, not Members of the Republican leadership.  Until the elected Members of the U.S. Senate and the House see this  study, Congress cannot make its strongest argument for submarine  investment.    I led a letter, signed by a bipartisan group of defense leaders,  asking the administration to send us the study without delay. This was  a bipartisan letter. Friends from both sides of the aisle joined me on  that. We are an equal part of the government. We have authorized this  study, and, for heaven's sake, the elected Senators and Representatives  of the people need to see this.   If the President desires the same success for the AUKUS deal that  many of us in Congress desire--and I believe he does, given the funding  request included in the supplemental--then the administration ought to  release the study promptly. They ought to release the study to us  today.   This study is just one element of strengthening AUKUS. Of course, the  most crucial element is increasing overall American sea power. For  years, I have cast a vision for restoring American maritime supremacy,  following President Reagan's own defense buildup. Again, this is not  something that sprung from the brow of Senator Wicker. These are  requirements given to us by the top military Navy and Marine  leadership, in particular, across the Nation. AUKUS ought to be part of  that buildup.   This vision will require historic investment to ensure we have the  necessary shipbuilding capacity. It is not an easy task, but history  suggests it would underwrite and protect American security for decades.   It will also include strengthening the U.S.-Australian alliance  throughout the 21st century. This alliance is symbolized by Australian  Prime Minister Albanese's travel to Washington last week. I was honored  to meet with him and his team several times during that visit.   The bond between our two nations is deep and abiding. It stood the  test of World War II, and it will continue to stand as we confront the  challenge of Xi Jinping's communist Chinese fleet.   I can think of no action more emblematic of our bond than the AUKUS  agreement, which, again, I fully support. I know the Australians do.  They told me last week. They show this also by committing $3 billion to  our industrial base. The best way to honor our special relationship  would be to back AUKUS with funds of our own. Australia's economy is a  tenth the size of ours, and the United States should commit a  proportional investment. The current plan doesn't get us there.   We have never pursued a defense technology partnership at this scale  and level of sophistication, but we have moments in our history to draw  upon that inform our path forward. Since its invention in the American  midcentury, our nuclear Navy has been second to none because we have  never accepted anything less.   Our adversaries knew this. When Admiral Rickover, the founding father  of our nuclear Navy, traveled to discuss nuclear submarines with Soviet  Premier Nikita Khrushchev and his aides, Admiral Rickover boasted:         Although the United States is a democracy, it can act fast.       . . . Can't Russia act as fast as the United States?    The answer was that Russia could not act as fast as we could. The  strength of our free enterprise system, the clarity of our mission set  by our Federal leaders, and our collective appreciation of the Soviet  threat gave us a focus, a singular focus, and it allowed the American  system to unleash our arsenal of democracy, and we prevented war with  the Soviet Union by maintaining our naval supremacy. We need to unleash  that arsenal again.   In the words of Admiral Rickover, ``We shall let nothing deter us  from building a nuclear Navy in the shortest possible time.''   Once more, we cannot let anything deter our skilled shipbuilders from  cutting the steel and constructing the fleet that will safeguard  America for a generation to come.   We have submarines to build. Let's get to work.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Caroline  Newsom, a valued intern from my office, be granted floor privileges  until November 17 of this year.
