 Mr. Speaker, congratulations to the  citizens of Bulgaria for formally approving their new government  yesterday.   After negotiations following five elections in 2 years, the National  Assembly agreed to form a government where the Prime Minister will  change hands halfway through.   Lawmakers elected Nikolay Denkov, a chemistry professor and former  Education Minister, as Prime Minister. In separate votes, legislators  agreed that Mariya Gabriel, a former European Commissioner, will serve  as deputy head of government and Foreign Minister. After 9 months,  Denkov and Gabriel will switch positions for the rest of the term.   Bulgaria is a valued American ally and is appreciated for, 80 years  ago, saving the Jewish population from Nazi extermination.   Yesterday, Ambassador Georgi Panayotov was the special guest of the  Bulgarian Caucus.   The new coalition government has pledged to keep Bulgaria, an  important NATO and EU member, on a firm pro-Western track and supports  Ukraine against the Putin war crimes.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from Afghanistan to the safe haven of America with open Biden borders.                            ____________________
