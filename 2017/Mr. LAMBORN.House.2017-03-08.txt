 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for H.R.  1301, which will fund our national defense for fiscal year 2017. This  bill is a vital first step as we begin to work on rebuilding our  military. The best way to look at defense spending over time is as a  percentage of U.S. gross domestic product.   Since World War II, we have spent an average of 5 percent of our GDP  on defense during peacetime. Despite a world that has gotten more  dangerous, the defense drawdown in recent years cut defense spending  from 5 percent of GDP to 3 percent of GDP. And in a $17 trillion  economy, that is real money.   Meanwhile, since Vietnam, we have spent an average of 21 percent of  the Federal budget on defense. Today, we spend well below that, about  15 percent of the overall budget.   Things are so bad today--and I don't have time in 2 minutes to go  into all the details--that we are actually at risk of losing more  American lives than we should in the event of another war.   The next step is to pass a robust defense supplemental and then to  fund defense for fiscal year 2018 at a minimum level of $640 billion.  Anything less will not keep Americans safe and will not allow us to  rebuild our military as we desperately must do.   Congress must deal with sequestration. Trying to fund defense at BCA  levels is like trying to put a size 10 foot into a size 7 shoe. It  simply doesn't work and it is dangerous for our own security and it is  dangerous for the world.
