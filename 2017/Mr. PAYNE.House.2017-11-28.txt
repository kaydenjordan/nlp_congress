 Mr. Speaker, recently, I met with a group of engineering  and nursing students from Rutgers University. These young people have  worked hard to get an education so they can help communities in need,  but they came to the Nation's Capital asking for help that only  Congress can provide.   These bright young minds are not U.S. citizens; they are what we call  DREAMers. Each day that passes without Congress voting on the Dream Act  darkens their futures. Like the 20,000 other DREAMers in my district,  these are young people who fear that they will be detained and deported  to places they have never seen or known before.   Mr. Speaker, the holiday season is supposed to be a time of joy and  celebration, not fear and uncertainty. I implore my colleagues to honor  the wishes of the American people and do the right thing by history.  Let us finally pass the Dream Act.                            ____________________
