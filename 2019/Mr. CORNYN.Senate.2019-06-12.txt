 Mr. President, I confess that my fascination--or maybe  ``obsession'' is another word to describe it--with what some people  proclaim to be their newfound belief in socialism is really a mystery  to me. It is something  [[Page S3338]]  I have thought and read quite a bit about just so I could try to  understand what they could possibly be thinking.   A recent poll found that 4 in 10 Americans say they prefer living in  a socialist country to a capitalist country--40 percent. For those of  us who have witnessed the rise and fall of socialism over the course of  our lives or who have even read about it in the history books, that is  a major cause for concern. Yet today's socialists try to distinguish  themselves from those countries that have actually implemented  socialism--Venezuela, the Soviet Union, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania,  and other failed socialist nations. They are saying that they are  democratic socialists.   As a matter of fact, one of our Senate colleagues who is running for  President--the junior Senator from Vermont, not the distinguished  Senator on the floor--is speaking today at an event in defense of  democratic socialism. I have to say, if you ask me, that is an  oxymoron. You can't support democracy and socialism at the same time.  Those two ideals are completely at odds with one another. Yet what we  see happening is people who use labels to confuse the American people  and who claim to be what they are not--literally being Trojan horses  for ideas that have been demonstrated to have failed throughout the  world's history.   Many of these so-called democratic socialists have gotten into the  habit of suggesting that Scandinavian countries are successful models  for their ideology. They will point to the economic successes of these  countries, combined with their expansive government-run programs--free  higher education, universal healthcare, subsidized childcare. They will  say: ``Look, it works.'' Robust welfare programs are not the  cornerstones of socialism, although many seem to think that this is the  case.   The poll I mentioned earlier found that there is a broad disagreement  about what exactly constitutes socialism. To me, one of the most  interesting findings of some of the polling is when you ask some people  what ``socialism'' is, they say, ``Well, that is being social.'' They  also say, ``Well, it is universal healthcare, tuition-free education,  and a living wage.'' Only two-thirds of the people say it involves a  state-controlled economy, and fewer still believe socialism involves  the state control and the regulation of private property, the media,  and communications.   Let me be clear. The most fundamental aspect of socialism isn't the  social benefits it provides; it is having the government in control. It  is the surrendering of your individual freedom and choices to  government coercion and brute force. That is the only way people can be  forced into limiting their freedom, their activity, and their incomes  is by brute government force. That is the single most important,  distinguishing feature of socialism.    So those who claim that these Scandinavian countries with social  security programs are shining examples of socialism could not be more  wrong. These countries largely operate free markets, and they are the  first to correct us and say they are not socialists. Nevertheless, so- called democratic socialists continue to name these countries as  successful examples because the only true examples of socialism don't  poll quite nearly as high. The prime example is Venezuela.   Venezuela's troubled story began in the late nineties when then- Presidential candidate Hugo Chavez delivered an impassioned speech that  promised to lead Venezuela into a socialist paradise. He talked about  the country's wealth being stolen by evil capitalists and greedy  corporations, and he promised hope and change if he were elected. That  sounds pretty similar to what we hear from the so-called democratic  socialists today.   For any Americans who wonder if that hope and change being promised  by these candidates might actually work, let me reassure you that there  would be a lot of change but that it would not be the type of change  you would want. Again, look at Venezuela. The government took over  businesses, shut down free markets, and suppressed free speech. As a  result, one of the richest countries in the world is now among the  poorest. Basic commodities like food, medicine, and water are in short  supply. About 6 months ago, I myself was at the border between Colombia  and Venezuela, and I witnessed Venezuelans going across the border into  Colombia in order to pick up some of the basics of life--medicine,  food, and the like.   Of course, with regard to freedom of the press, well, you can throw  that out the window in Venezuela, and, of course, crime rates have  skyrocketed. That is why you don't see caravans of people attempting to  immigrate to countries like Venezuela--it is just the opposite. The  United Nations announced last week that more than 4 million people have  escaped Venezuela--4 million refugees from Venezuela--and that a  quarter of those have left in the last 7 months. The UN Refugee Agency  referred to this mass exodus as the ``largest in the recent history of  Latin America and the Caribbean.''   That is what happens under socialism. Citizens flee poverty,  government control, and corruption in search of opportunities to build  better lives for themselves. The trouble is, no matter what word you  put in front of the word ``socialism,'' it doesn't really matter  because it is still socialism.   I think Winston Churchill summed it up best, as he frequently did,  when he said:         The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of       blessings. The inherent virtue of Socialism is the equal       sharing of miseries.    I can assure you that if these democratic socialists get their way,  there will be no shortage of miseries to share.   I urge all of our colleagues and all Americans to learn, to share the  lessons of history, and to remind our fellow citizens that so-called  democratic socialism is nothing more than a Trojan horse that would  destroy our country and destroy our way of life. Most fundamentally of  all, it would destroy the American dream.   We can look around America and find good examples, but, of course, I  am partial to the example of the State of Texas as to how free market  ideals and less government can produce more prosperity, more freedom,  and a better quality of life. Yet, if our Democratic friends-- particularly those who are running for President--get their way with  Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and a host of other disastrous  policies, the sort of prosperity and opportunity and freedom of choice  that you see now in places like Texas will be out the window.   When our friend the minority leader, the Senator from New York, calls  the Senate a legislative graveyard, in one respect, he is entirely  right, because we are going to do everything we can to make sure the  U.S. Senate is a firewall against these disastrous socialist policies.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
