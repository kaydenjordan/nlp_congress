 Madam Speaker, this Saturday was a big day for  basketball in Indiana. Let's be honest: Every day is a big day for  basketball in Indiana.   Nonetheless, this weekend, the girls' basketball teams throughout the  State went head-to-head to compete for the Indiana High School Athletic  Association State championship.   I am proud to share that not just one but two southern Indiana high  schools brought home State titles for the Ninth District.   First to play was the Lanesville Eagles girls' basketball team. They  walked away from the game with the school's first-ever IHSAA Class 1A  State championship title.   The Eagles continued their firsts as senior Linzie Wernert was named  the first athlete in Lanesville history to win the 2023 Patricia L. Roy  Mental Attitude Award.   Next up on the basketball court was the Bedford North Lawrence Lady  Stars basketball team. They won the game with the IHSAA class 4A State  championship title for the fifth time.    Again, only adding to their success, senior Karsyn Norman was named  the 2023 recipient of the Patricia L. Roy Mental Attitude Award.   Both teams left their hearts on the basketball court and represented  their hometowns well. I join all Hoosiers across the district in saying  congratulations. Their dedication to the sport helps make Indiana the  best basketball State in the country.                            ____________________
