 Madam Speaker, unfortunately and sadly enough, this is  a repeat of the political ruse where you wrap a flag and give a great  name to legislation. The reality is it has very little to do with the  threats China poses to the United States and the world.   There is plenty of common ground we could find to work on that big  challenge, a huge threat. Instead, this is a misleading piece of  legislation.   It is another legislative wagonloaded with the same tired, old,  progressive policies: union giveaways; green energy subsidies; and  unhinged--in my opinion--social policies and experimentation, like  training our Armed Forces not to fight and win wars but to combat  climate change and naming a chief diversity officer. That should make  us safer and all sleep better at night with respect to China.   The Democratic Party, Madam Speaker, has been hijacked by the left,  and they are willing to sacrifice America's prosperity, our security,  and our global leadership on climate apocalypse now. I don't get it.
