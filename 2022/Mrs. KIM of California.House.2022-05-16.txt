 Mr. Speaker, during this National Police  Week, I am delighted to rise today to honor Buena Park Police Chief  Corey Sianez and his more than four decades of selfless service to our  community, including 11 years as police chief.   Throughout his many roles, Chief Sianez set an example of excellence  in our police department and created the first 5-year strategic plan in  the department's history.   While he is a well-known, active member of our Buena Park community,  his impact can also be seen across neighboring cities. He helped create  the North Orange County Public Task Force, which is a partnership  between cities that works to address pressing public safety issues such  as homelessness, incarceration, and gang and youth violence.   Chief Sianez, thank you for your unrelenting dedication to safety and  the well-being of our community. I wish you a wonderful retirement.                            ____________________
