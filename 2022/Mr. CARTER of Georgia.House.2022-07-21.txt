 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  incredible service of a member of our community, Pastor Rosemary Woods.   Pastor Woods has selflessly led members of her community for 30 years  now and is set to achieve the lifetime achievement award in Brunswick,  Georgia. This will not be her first award, as Pastor Woods has also  received the key to the city of Brunswick.   She is the mother of former Philadelphia Phillies player Dominic  Brown, and in 2014, she was named Mother of the Year by the  organization.   Pastor Woods serves her community through many food drives, Christmas  toy drives, and Easter festivals, and she is hoping to start a turkey  giveaway this coming Thanksgiving.   Her service to our community is remarkable and commendable. Her work  feeding those in need came at an essential time and has continued to  inspire others to join in and offer a helping hand.   Pastor Woods is steering our community in the right direction, and I  look forward to hearing about what else she is able to accomplish.   Madam Speaker, I thank Pastor Woods for what she has done for the  people of Georgia's First Congressional District and congratulate her  on her achievements.                            ____________________
