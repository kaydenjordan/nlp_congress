 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week, I came to the floor and  brought forward the proof that the Biden administration allowed an  Iranian influence operation to infiltrate our government, and they  compromised one of the most sensitive weapons negotiations in our  Nation's history. It was only after the media and Senate Republicans  exposed this ongoing threat to our national security that the Biden  administration agreed to investigate it.   So, as I said, last week, I sent a letter to the Pentagon, demanding  to know why Biden administration officials granted these operatives  top-secret security clearances and sent them to negotiate with the very  adversaries that they once worked for.   But, today, I want to remind my colleagues of another influence  operation that we have known of for a long time which requires no  security clearance and no special access to government documents.   For years, TikTok has been under scrutiny for its ties to the Chinese  Communist Party. We know that this company openly violates basic  privacy  [[Page S4908]]  standards, puts user data in the hands of the CCP, and subjects U.S.  users to Chinese influence operations. Almost 100 million Americans  have this app on their phones.   And the Biden administration? They have very little to say about  this. In fact, the President himself has embraced it as a tool to  rehabilitate his failed policies with young voters. He has invited  TikTok influencers to the White House.   Still, my colleagues and I have made it impossible for the Biden  administration to totally ignore the threat. TikTok has been in  negotiations with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United  States. It is known as CFIUS. They are in negotiations on a potential  framework called Project Texas that will supposedly keep Americans'  data secure and make it impossible for Beijing to manipulate the flow  of information in the app.   A core component of these discussions involves measures to separate  TikTok from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. But, of course, we  are already seeing the CCP find creative ways to get around that  firewall.   As you know, they have a habit of doing this with their propaganda  schemes, whether it is Confucius classrooms, Confucius Institutes,  Sister Cities programs, or a social media app, TikTok.   The Wall Street Journal reported last week that this year, TikTok has  transferred many high-level executives from ByteDance to TikTok in the  United States. These executives are leading major divisions at TikTok,  which provides the CCP with a significant degree of influence over the  way they do business.   The personnel changes undermine TikTok's independence from ByteDance,  and there is no chance that this happened by accident.   It is clear what TikTok is doing. They are repurposing ByteDance  employees to masquerade as TikTok employees, undercutting the  guardrails against Chinese espionage.   We know that with the Confucius Institute, many of these professors  who came our way were indeed connected and sent there by the Chinese  Communist Party.   Over the past 3 years, it has become clear that we cannot rely on the  Biden administration to follow through on its promises to protect and  defend this country and the citizens of this country. They fall behind  repeatedly, especially when it is politically inconvenient to do so.   So, today, Senator Blumenthal and I sent a letter to the CEO of  TikTok demanding to know how many of his employees are former ByteDance  employees? What are their jobs? What are the security protocols and  other rules that are going to be imposed on these transfers? These are  questions that we need the answers to.   We also want to know if these personnel changes were disclosed to  CFIUS before the Wall Street Journal published its article.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, October 3, 2023.      Mr. Shou Zi Chew,      Chief Executive Officer, TikTok,      Culver City, CA.        Dear Mr. Chew: We write regarding reports that TikTok has       recently hired several high-level executives from its Chinese       parent company ByteDance, further calling into question the       independence of TikTok's operations and the security of its       U.S. users' information.        The Wall Street Journal recently reported that ``[slince       the start of the year, a string of high-level executives have       transferred from ByteDance to TikTok,'' moving from China to       the U.S., including after the departure of U.S. executives.       The former ByteDance executives have reportedly assumed       influential roles overseeing TikTok's ``advertising business,       human resources, monetization, business marketing and       products related to advertising and e-commerce initiatives''       and have brought their own staff from Beijing.'' These       changes were alarming enough that employees raised concerns       about the lack of a true separation from ByteDance--      reportedly joking that TikTok is solving its ByteDance       problem by moving ByteDance to the U.S.        The relationship between ByteDance and TikTok poses a       unique risk to the security and privacy of TikTok's users in       the United States. TikTok executives, including personnel       based in China, have been found spying on American       journalists, and, in leaked recordings, its staff       acknowledged that ``everything is seen in China.'' As the       intelligence community has repeatedly warned, Chinese       national security laws provide the Chinese government       significant legal control over any data within the reach of       Chinese companies, thereby putting any data held by ByteDance       in the reach of the Chinese government.        In response to these widespread concerns, TikTok has       repeatedly made commitments and representations to the       American public about the independent management of TikTok's       operations, the limited role of ByteDance, and the security       of U.S. users' information. You have attempted to distance       TikTok from ByteDance and promised a separation that       ''amounts to a firewall that seals off protected US user data       from unauthorized foreign access,'' with ``American data       stored on American soil by an American company, overseen by       American personnel.''        However, the recent move of many ByteDance executives to       the U.S. seemingly undermines this assertion to Congress and       the public. The personnel changes give the impression that       TikTok is attempting to preserve ByteDance's influence over       TikTok while avoiding suspicion. Once again, TikTok's actions       appear to align with a pattern of misleading actions and       broken commitments regarding serious matters related to       users' safety and national security, which we noted in a       previous letter to you.        We are concerned these personnel changes undermine the       security of U.S. data and the representations TikTok has made       about its independence from ByteDance. As such, please fully       answer the following questions by October 13:        1. Prior to December 31, 2022, how many employees were       hired by TikTok who had previously worked at ByteDance?        2. Since January 1, 2023, how many employees have been       hired by TikTok who previously worked at ByteDance?        3. Please identify the roles of all current TikTok       employees who previously worked at ByteDance?        4. Were these personnel changes disclosed to the Committee       on Foreign Investment in the United States prior to the       report in the Wall Street Journal?        5. What security protocols are you imposing on ByteDance       employees that transfer from China to the U.S.?        6. Are there any rules, restrictions, or controls on       communications between TikTok employees who were previously       employed at ByteDance and personnel based in China?        7. How does TikTok supervise or oversee communications       between its employees who were previously employed at       ByteDance and personnel based in China?            Sincerely,      Marsha Blackburn,        U.S. Senator.      Richard Blumenthal,        U.S. Senator.     Mr. President, we know that popular opinion would  have each and every one of us believe that the threat posed by TikTok  just isn't that serious. And we know from experience that the White  House dislikes challenging popular opinion. After all, we hear: This is  just an app the kids like to use. This is just a silly app with videos.  This is an app that is putting up challenges. There is nothing wrong  here.   But what we do know is that TikTok gathers all of this information.  They have insight into the virtual ``you.'' Once they are on your  phone, they are following where you go, what you do, gathering  keystrokes, and building that profile. We know this information leaves  the United States, and we know this information makes its way to  Beijing.   Why do they think they need this information on U.S. citizens? Why do  they think they need to follow U.S. citizens? All of this is a reason  that CFIUS is reviewing TikTok.   This country can no longer afford to take the word of our adversaries  at face value. Self-propaganda--that is what the Chinese Communist  Party is all about. They see that as a way to infiltrate our society,  to infiltrate public opinion, to infiltrate and to influence elections.   This is not the first letter Senator Blumenthal and I have sent to  TikTok demanding transparency, and I would imagine this is not going to  be the last.   I know it is very difficult to accept that a silly video app that is  liked by 100 million Americans could possibly pose a threat to our  national security, but we believe that it does.   I would remind my colleagues--indeed, anyone who has not deleted this  spy app from their phones--to, please, recognize the threat that is  there and do not provide your information to one of our greatest  adversaries.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
