 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 22) providing  for the use of the catafalque situated in the Exhibition Hall of the  Capitol Visitor Center in connection with memorial services to be  conducted in the rotunda of the Capitol for the Honorable Robert Joseph  Dole, a Senator from the State of Kansas, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 23) authorizing  the use of the rotunda of the Capitol for the lying in state of the  remains of the Honorable Robert Joseph Dole, a Senator from the State  of Kansas, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, today, I rise with my colleague from the  Sunflower State to remember the life and legacy of a great American  icon--a son of Kansas, World War II hero, and public servant, Senator  Robert J. Dole.   Most of us in this Chamber have memories of Senator Dole or have been  inspired by his public service. His life is one that epitomizes the  American spirit and is a guide for public servants and leaders  regardless of party.   Bob was born in rural America, a star athlete and on track to be a  doctor when our Nation was thrust into war. He chose his country over  himself, like so many young men did in the Greatest Generation, and it  forever changed him. Upon his return, his body had been greatly damaged  by the effects of war, but his resolve and love of country were only  made stronger.   Our Nation is better because of the contributions of Senator Bob  Dole.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that all Members rise for a moment of silence in  remembrance of the life and legacy of Senator Bob Dole.                            ____________________
