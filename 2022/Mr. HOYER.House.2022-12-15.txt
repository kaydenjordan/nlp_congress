 Madam Speaker, I have been working on this issue almost  all of my career in the Congress of the United States.   The previous gentleman said: Let's do it right.   This does it right. This does it after years and years and years and  years and years of consideration.   I hesitate because I agree, I think, almost in whole with the remarks  that Mr. Westerman has made. Mr. Westerman is a Member of the Congress  that I respect. He and I work on things that we think are very  important to mankind, here in this country and around the world, in  terms of our global environment.   America is a great nation. It is a generous nation. I have said  throughout the world that America is the least acquisitive great power  that has existed in the world.   What do I mean by acquisitive?   We did not fight wars to take property and to acquire countries, to  do what Putin criminally does today. In fact, what we did in those wars  in which we have participated in was to build up countries, and they  are now democracies: Germany, Japan, Italy, and other nations which we  have occupied for a temporary period of time to make sure they were  free and help them be free. This bill is about the Puerto Rican people  and their island.                                time  1130    And to redeem a premise that we have argued to all the world ought to  be central to their policies. That is the right of peoples to self- determination. The right of peoples to say: This is who I am, and this  is the political environment in which I want to live--by free votes,  not arms, not force, but by the choice of the people. That is what this  legislation does.   Puerto Ricans and people of Puerto Rican descent have had an  important place in the American family for over a century. They  contribute to American culture. They help protect America's national  security. They support the American economy and our shared prosperity.   They are American citizens. We made that decision because that was  our decision to make whether we were going to allow them to be American  citizens or not. Frankly, whether they have any relationship with us or  not is our American Congress' decision. They are today American  citizens like all of us.   For far too long, however, the people of Puerto Rico have been  excluded from the full promise of American democracy and self- determination that our Nation has always championed. We owe it to our  own values, and we owe it to the Puerto Rican people to bring an end to  their island's 124-year-old status as a U.S. territory.   Less than us. Less than Maryland. Less than Virginia or Oregon or  Texas or Maine or Washington State. Yes, they are citizens but less-- 3\1/2\ million people are less. We hold these truths to be self-evident  that all are created equal. Now, not all people ought to be U.S.  citizens because of that comment, but all citizens ought to be equal.  That  [[Page H9876]]  is why I am for D.C. statehood--700,000-plus people. Citizens. Our  people.   They are franchised if they move to Maryland and disenfranchised if  they move from Maryland to D.C. That is not right. We passed a bill to  say that was not right. This is another opportunity to give the people  of Puerto Rico the ability to set it right, and we make that decision.   The gentleman is correct. We don't have to give that right to Puerto  Ricans, we make that decision, and we ought to make it. That is what  this bill is about--making that decision to give our fellow citizens a  choice--their choice, not our choice.   The gentlewoman from New York, a wonderful, dear, close friend of  mine, she and I have disagreed through the years as to what that choice  ought to be. But what we agree on is it is not our choice; it is Puerto  Rico's choice. That is why I am proud to bring the Puerto Rico Status  Act to the floor today.   This bipartisan legislation would organize and fund a binding,  island-wide plebiscite that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to  vote among these three options:   Statehood. That would be my option. If I were a Puerto Rican and I  were living in Port-au-Prince or wherever I was living, I would vote to  be a State. That is not my choice, I don't live there, I am not in  Puerto Rico. San Juan--I said Port-au-Prince. San Juan. It ought to be  their choice, and that is what this bill does--statehood.   Independence. They have a right to do that. They are either going to  be a State or they will have a right to determine their own destiny,  their own status, or as the bill also gives them an option to do, be a  sovereign State with an association with our country.   Now, that has to be done through agreement because we have to make  that decision as well as the Puerto Ricans. That would have to be an  agreement between us, and both sides would have to be willing partners  to that agreement.   Additionally, it would implement comprehensive, nonpartisan public- education campaigns to help voters understand the implications of each  option long before any ballots are cast.   The gentlewoman from New York has made it an essential part of her  argument that the people of Puerto Rico have to know what they are  voting on and what the consequences of that vote will be. Ms. Ocasio- Cortez has made that same point correctly.   This bipartisan bill also includes a variety of oversight measures to  ensure that the election is secure, transparent, and fair.   I have long-believed that Puerto Ricans deserve the right to  determine their political destiny. This is not a new concept for me. I  don't think it is a new concept for any of us in this Congress. We  believe in self-determination of peoples. We believe that dictators  cannot impose upon people a government they do not choose. That is  bedrock belief for us. That is what this bill is about.   A group of House Members and senior Puerto Rican officials--I am  honored that my former colleague and my dear friend is on the floor  with us today, Pedro Pierluisi. The Governor has been selected by the  people of Puerto Rico.   I am honored to be the friend of and ally of the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico who is the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, who has  worked tirelessly with Nydia Velazquez, with the rest of us, in  ensuring that the people of Puerto Rico have an honest, fair choice  available to them to affect their status, and to reach the long-sought  consensus on a path forward for self-determination.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Grijalva. This has been a long and  torturous path because the disagreements about how we get to where we  want to get are so difficult. Chairman Grijalva deserves great praise  from all of us for his patience, for his knowledge, for his wisdom, for  his role that he played in trying to bring this to a head. He has done  it, it is here on this floor, and he is responsible for that.   Madam Speaker, I thank the members of the Natural Resources Committee  on both sides of the aisle, and I thank the staff for the work that  they have done--tireless hours and difficult discussions, debates, and  so much disharmony from all those, both the diaspora and those in  Puerto Rico--strong feelings that had to be brought to bear to reach  this consensus.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez; Representative  Darren Soto, who is on the floor and perhaps is going to speak after  me; Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; the Puerto Rican Resident  Commissioner that I have spoken of, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon; and you,  Governor.    Madam Speaker, the Governor and I have had the opportunity to work  together when you were a Member of this House. We passed a bill that  this House passed saying that the Puerto Rican people ought to have a  choice, so this is not new. The previous gentleman wasn't here in  Congress then--I don't know that, but I don't think he was. This is not  new. This has not been done haphazardly. This has been done carefully  with difficult efforts made by all parties.   All of the people that I mentioned, I thank for their efforts to  reach this historic consensus and action on behalf of the people of  Puerto Rico. We are all in agreement that the decision must belong to  the people of Puerto Rico alone. Their destiny ought to be up to them.   The Puerto Rican Status Act, of which we will consider in just a few  minutes, will give them that choice. They will have that choice only if  we vote ``yes.'' If we do not vote ``yes'' today, I fear we may not  vote ``yes'' for a very long time. The people of Puerto Rico would be  held in a status that I believe the majority of them do not want to be  in.   Madam Speaker, I, therefore, ask all of my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to represent the values of America in this vote. The  values that say to us that people have the inherent right to self- determination, not to have it imposed upon them by force or by dictate  of the Congress of the United States, but to choose a status of their  choosing, of their desire, of their vision. Vote for this status bill,  it represents the best of American values. We have a moral  responsibility to do so.    Madam Speaker, to my colleagues, based upon the present  information on the Senate timeline for passing the omnibus, the  earliest the House is expected to meet is Wednesday with votes at 6:30  p.m.--that is the earliest--with the votes of the week postponed until  6:30 p.m.   The House is also expected to meet on Thursday, December 22, and will  stay in session until the omnibus is completed.   If the Senate acts on the omnibus earlier in the week, Members will  be given 24 hours--not the normal 72 hours--24 hours' notice to return  to D.C. Members should expect the House to be in session for at least 2  legislative days next week.   The House will consider bills under suspension of the rules, and  additional legislative items are possible. We all understand Christmas  is Sunday and none of us want to be here, but all of us have a  responsibility, obviously, to complete the business of funding the  government of the United States of America, so we will be here.   We will not be here unless the Senate acts more quickly than we  anticipate before Wednesday at 6:30 p.m., which will be the first  votes. If it is later than that, you will also get notice. If it is  earlier than that, you will get notice.                            ____________________
