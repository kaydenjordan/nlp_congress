 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr.  Neal, for yielding.   I rise with a heavy heart to join him in opposing this mean-spirited,  reckless bill.   Mr. Speaker, 30 years ago, I was elected to fight for and to serve  the people of my district. Today, they are calling and begging for us  to slow down and to do this the right way. In their heart of hearts,  the public knows that the safety net will be used to pay for this  reckless corporate tax cut.   Taxpayers know that this shameful deal destroys the hopes and dreams  of  [[Page H9383]]  too many as it robs poor Peter to pay wealthy Paul. That is not right.  That is not fair. That is not just.   Mr. Speaker, you cannot hide the truth from the sick, the elderly,  the disabled for whom this bill may mean life or death. You cannot hide  the truth from the middle class, working, and immigrant families who  need every penny to make ends meet. You cannot hide the truth from  teachers who try to lend a helping hand to students who struggle to get  an education.   I, for one, refuse to hide the truth about this bill's attack on the  separation of church and State.   Mr. Speaker, as we abandon our constitutional duty and sacrifice our  moral authority, I fear that history will not be kind to any of us.   In another time, in another period, Members of Congress came together  in a bipartisan fashion. They met, debated, and passed a tax bill that  served the best interest of all people--not just a select few. They  took their time. They did it right, and we should be doing it right.   Today, the Record must reflect the sad truth of this missed  opportunity. H.R. 1 steals from our veterans, our seniors, our  children, and from generations yet unborn All taxpayers expect, demand,  and deserve better--much better--than legislation which would put  politics before the good of the people.    This bill is a shame, a disgrace, and honestly, Mr. Speaker, it  breaks my heart. I urge each and every one of my colleagues to vote  ``no.''    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article  about this bill's impact on graduate students in my district.           [From the Atlanta Journal Constitution, Nov. 16, 2017]   Opinion: Only Wealthy Can Afford Grad School Under House Tax Plan Up                               for Vote Today                            (By Maureen Downey)         Jenny C. Bledsoe is a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in English       at Emory University, specializing in medieval literature. She       was featured in a New York Times story last week that       examined how the GOP House tax plan would impact a range of       American students. In this essay, Bledsoe focuses on the       change that makes graduate tuition waivers taxable income.        The tax plan is expected to come to the House floor today       where passage is predicted. The Senate, however, is not       expected to take up its own tax bill until after       Thanksgiving. And then House and Senate conferees will have       to hammer out their differences and come up with a compromise       plan.        Under the House plan, Bledsoe and other doctoral students       would be hurt by a new provision that would tax graduate       students on tuition wavers granted them in exchange for       working as teaching assistants or researchers. The tax       accountants hired by The New York Times estimated Bledsoe and       her husband would pay an additional $7,194 in taxes under the       House tax bill.        When I about this last week, some readers contended the       increase in the standard deduction will offset the       eliminations of these education deductions. However, some       reviews found that not to be true for graduate students.                                   ____                      Impact of GOP Tax Plan on Students                           (By Jenny C. Bledsoe)         The House GOP tax bill makes graduate school inaccessible       for anyone who is not independently wealthy, and it will       likely cause current graduate students to drop out of       doctoral programs and/or declare bankruptcy.        A single line in the 429-page bill effects this change: 26       U.S. tax code Sec. 117(d) allows students conducting research       or teaching for a university (usually Ph.D. students on       fellowship) to receive tuition waivers tax free. Any stipends       are taxed.        The House ``Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,'' however, will repeal       this provision, meaning that a Ph.D. student making a stipend       of $24,000 will be taxed as if they are making $85,200. This       would have been my situation two years ago. During the first       three years of Emory's Ph.D. program, a student currently       receives a tuition waiver amounting to $61,200. Once you       reach ``tuition-paid'' status after your third year, the       annual tuition is $30,600.        Tax experts hired by The New York Times estimated that my       husband's and my tax bill would increase by $7,194--despite       the increase in the standard deduction--because of the newly       taxable tuition waiver.        Tuition amounts vary widely depending on the institution,       and the situation may be worse (or better) for some       individuals, depending on tuition rates and stipend amounts.       At Georgia Tech, full-time graduate student tuition for one       semester is $6,894 in-state and $14,284 out-of-state. Georgia       State's tuition is $4,680 in-state and $15,012 out-of-state       for one semester.        Graduate students will clearly owe much larger federal       income tax bills, and in some states, including Georgia, they       will also have to pay more due to the proposed changes to the       federal tax credit for state and local income taxes. Those at       private colleges and universities will be responsible for       larger taxable amounts (given the higher tuition at private       institutions).        Those at public universities will pay the taxes on their       relatively lower tuition waiver amounts, but they will have       to do so with already significantly smaller stipends than       Ph.D. students receive at private universities.        This is an issue across the disciplines. It will affect any       graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. on a research or teaching       fellowship, which common for those pursuing doctorates in       STEM, the social sciences, and the humanities. In addition to       graduate students suffering personally, universities will       experience the effects of their graduate students' tax       burdens in multiple ways (in addition to the bill's other       deleterious effects on higher education).        Graduate students will have less time for research because       they will have to work additional jobs. Humanities Ph.D.       students, who provide essential labor as instructors, will       have less time to devote to the classes they teach to       undergraduates.        Long-term effects are difficult to measure, but surely many       lower-income students will no longer attend. It's unlikely       that international students will be able to maintain a decent       standard of living since they are often forbidden from taking       on additional work.        The House GOP tax bill will lead to a ``brain drain,'' with       international students and Americans alike seeking graduate       study elsewhere or not all. In terms of personal finance, it       will be extremely challenging (if not impossible) to meet       one's basic needs--food, shelter--while pursuing a higher       degree.        Unless . . . you're independently wealthy. This single line       in a massive tax bill destroys lower- and middle-class young       Americans' ability to pursue a professional career in       academia, industry, or government. The bill reduces other       education tax credits, which will adversely affect access to       undergraduate as well as graduate education. The GOP will       effectively end class mobility, return the academy fully to       the so-called one percent, and reduce charitable donations to       universities by de-incentivizing itemized deductions.        Even if you don't believe in the value of academic study,       eliminating section 117(d) of the U.S. tax code would be bad       for the economy. Those who were not independently wealthy and       who chose to pursue graduate studies anyway would have to do       so with the help of student loans. Student loans are with you       forever; student loan debt is not forgiven even when       bankruptcy is declared. Young Americans are already saddled       with too much debt, causing many opinion pieces to complain       about the latest store or product that ``millennials have       killed'' by not spending enough money.        Eliminating this line of tax code effectively condemns       those who pursue higher education to a life of debt       servitude. How is our economy, our country, our world to       progress with these barriers against access to education, an       essential asset in our dynamic world?     Mr. Speaker, also, I include in the Record  letters of opposition from the ACLU, Baptist Joint Committee, and  Americans United for Separation of Church and State.                                                           ACLU,                                   Washington, DC, November 3, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Neal, and Members of       the Committee on Ways and Means:    ACLU Strongly Opposes Unconstitutional Religious Favoritism Provision                                 in H.R. 1         The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is strongly       opposed to Sec. 5201 in H.R. 1, the so-called Tax Cuts and       Jobs Act. This provision is designed--in violation of the       Constitution--to give religious organizations special tax       benefits and privileges that are unavailable to all other,       non-religious 501(c)(3) organizations. Accordingly, we urge       that this unconstitutional provision be removed from the       bill.        Sec. 5201 would allow a house of worship to endorse one or       more candidates in all of its statements, presentations, and       teachings made during ``religious services or gatherings.''       While current law applies to all tax-exempt nonprofit       organizations, this provision would apply only to churches.       The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S.       Constitution was designed to prevent exactly this kind of       religious favoritism. See, e.g. Texas Monthly v. Bullock, 489       U.S. 1 (1989) (striking down tax exemption that applied only       to religious periodicals). Moreover, the Free Speech Clause       of the First Amendment prohibits laws that engage in this       type of viewpoint discrimination. See Rosenberger v. Rector &       Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819 (1995)       (invalidating a subsidy program that distinguished between       religious and nonreligious viewpoints)  [[Page H9397]]         Sec. 5201 includes a vague and undefined test that would       open up houses of worship to extensive government       entanglement. To determine whether a house of worship is       complying with the law, the IRS would have to determine       whether an endorsement (1) occurred during the ``ordinary       course'' of the organization's ``regular and customary       activities'' in carrying out its ``tax-exempt purpose;'' (2)       whether it amounted to a ``de minimis incremental expense,''       and (3) whether it took place during ``religious services or       gatherings.'' To determine whether a house of worship meets       this test, the IRS would have to investigate the house of       worship's books, activities, sermons, and correspondence. The       IRS would also have to judge whether an event is       ``religious'' and part of a house of worship's ``exempt       purpose.'' By inviting this type of invasive government       scrutiny of church documents and judgment about religion,       this provision actually threatens, rather than upholds, the       autonomy and independence of houses of worship.        Churches and religious leaders are already able to exercise       their free speech--free from fear of sanction by the IRS--by       speaking out on political and social issues. Church leaders       are also completely free to support or endorse political       candidates as private citizens. As an organization deeply       committed since our founding nearly 100 years ago to       protecting the free speech rights of all people, the ACLU       would vigorously oppose any effort to chill the ability of       houses of worship and religious leaders to speak out on what       they see as the important issues of the day.        That does not mean, however, that religious organizations       are entitled to receive special tax benefits and privileges       that are unavailable to all other 501(c)(3) organizations.       The ACLU strongly opposes Sec. 5201 and urges the removal of       this unconstitutional provision from the so-called Tax Cuts       and Jobs Act (H.R. 1).        Please feel free to contact Ian Thompson, legislative       representative, with any questions.            Sincerely,      Faiz Shakir,        National Political Director.      Ian Thompson,        Legislative Representative.                                   ____                                             Baptist Joint Committee                                           for Religious Liberty,                                   Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, House Ways and Means Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, House Ways and Means Committee, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Neal: On behalf of       the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty (BJC), an       81-year-old agency serving 15 Baptist bodies on legal and       policy matters relating to religious liberty and the       separation of church and state, I write to express strong       opposition to Section 5201 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This       provision seriously undermines the independence and integrity       of our houses of worship and denominations by creating an       exemption to the partisan campaign prohibition that applies       equally to all 501(c)(3) organizations. This attempt to       encourage certain religious organizations to engage in       partisan campaigning is constitutionally problematic       following the Supreme Court's application of the       Establishment Clause in Texas Monthly v. Bullock.        We are committed to ensuring that the free speech rights       for houses of worship and members of the clergy are       respected. We do not share the view that current law       prohibiting 501(c)(3) organizations from participating and       intervening in partisan candidate campaigns infringes on       those free speech rights. We joined with more than 100 other       religious and denominational organizations in a letter to       Congress, originally sent in April, saying we ``strongly       oppose any effort to weaken or eliminate protections in the       law that prohibit 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses       of worship, from endorsing or opposing political       candidates.'' The full letter is attached to my testimony.        In 2002, the House voted down legislation offered by Rep.       Walter Jones, called the Houses of Worship Political Speech       Protection Act (H.R. 2357). The BJC co-led the coalition of       religious groups opposing that legislation, which failed by a       House vote of 178-239. We continue to think there is no       reason to change the way the law works now, and we are very       concerned about the consequences of weakening the protection       for houses of worship. For more than 60 years, all 501(c)(3)       organizations have been required to refrain from partisan       campaign involvement in exchange for receiving that most-      favored tax status. The prohibition has allowed charitable       organizations, including our houses of worship, to       concentrate on their exempt purposes and not be distracted or       co-opted by partisan campaigns.        Current law strikes the right balance in protecting the       integrity and independence of our religious sector. The tax       law prohibition is not a divorcement of politics from houses       of worship. Many churches feel that they are called to be       ``political'' and to ``speak truth to power'' on a variety of       social issues, and nothing in the tax law prevents pastors       from speaking out from the pulpit on the issues, no matter       how controversial.        Houses of worship can encourage voting, engage in voter       registration drives, host candidate forums, distribute       nonpartisan education materials, and invite all candidates       for an office to speak during a worship service.        Pastors and other leaders can endorse and oppose candidates       in their personal capacities and without using the resources       of the church. Whether and how openly they want to do this is       a personal decision. Pastors know that their reputations will       rise and fall with individuals they endorse and therefore may       be reluctant to publicly endorse and oppose candidates. They       also consider the impact that their endorsements will have in       their spiritual communities, particularly with those who may       support another candidate.        But what is not permitted--and what most clergy and       churchgoers don't want in any event--is for the tax-exempt       501(c)(3) entity to endorse or oppose candidates. Polling       consistently shows that large majorities--70 or 80 percent       depending on the survey--oppose candidate endorsements in       church. And when just clergy are asked, the numbers are more       like 90 percent, including among evangelical pastors.        These numbers are not surprising given the negative effects       endorsements would have on houses of worship. Pastors and       churchgoers I talk with think this would be a terrible idea       for their congregations, dividing what are otherwise rather       politically diverse communities and distracting them from       their religious mission. Congregants also choose to worship       in faith communities for reasons other than hearing a       political ad. There are plenty of places in our culture today       to engage in partisan electoral campaigns. Most people I know       don't want church to be one of those places.        We also recognize the powerful prophetic voice with which       the church speaks to power. That voice is threatened whenever       the church associates itself too closely with the government       or its officials.        Creating an exemption for houses of worship would expose       churches to political pressure to endorse candidates during       primaries and elections at all political levels, as the       campaign intervention prohibition applies not only to       presidential and congressional elections but to every state       and local race, too. Many candidates and donors supporting       candidates would have a strong incentive to put pressure on       churches to become involved in their campaigns, particularly       given the highly-valued tax status churches enjoy. Donors to       churches, like all other 501(c)(3) organizations, receive a       tax deduction for their contributions. Churches also receive       automatic 501(c)(3) tax status and are not required to file       the Form 990 information return. Combining tax deductibility       with these permissible accommodations for churches would make       houses of worship particularly vulnerable targets for       partisan campaign activity by political donors and others       seeking to influence local, state, and national elections.        The legislative ``solution'' that has been put forward       would threaten great harm to houses of worship. This bill       injects a new subjective standard for the IRS to enforce,       allowing political campaign involvement if it is ``in the       ordinary course of the organization's regular and customary       activities in carrying out its exempt purpose, and results in       the organization incurring not more than de minimis       incremental expenses.'' What does ``ordinary course'' mean?       What is the organization's ``regular and customary activities       in carrying out its exempt purpose''? What is ``de minimis''       compared to the organization's total budget? What is       ``incremental''? These are all line-drawing questions that       would fall on the IRS, which would have a mandate to enforce       this new standard with limited resources and with likely much       more activity in this area, given the new permissible       standard and political pressure to be involved. We would       either see lack of enforcement, rendering the statutory       limitations meaningless, or we would see troubling       entanglement of the IRS in a church's affairs. Neither       outcome would be an improvement on our current system.        Jesus taught us to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and       to God what is God's. Permitting tax-exempt churches to       endorse candidates in a ``sermon . . . or other       presentation'' during their ``services or gatherings''       threatens to fundamentally alter the very nature of and       esteem for our religious sector. This approach does not bode       well for religion or religious liberty.            Respectfully,                                                   Amanda Tyler,                                                 Executive Director,                     Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty.  [[Page H9398]]                                          ____      Updated, November 1, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker,      Washington, DC.      Hon.

Orrin Hatch,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, House Ways and Means Committee, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Ron Wyden,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McConnell, Leader       Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Chairman Brady, Chairman Hatch,       Ranking Member Neal, and Ranking Member Wyden: We, the 103       undersigned religious and denominational organizations       strongly oppose any effort to weaken or eliminate protections       that prohibit 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses of       worship, from endorsing or opposing political candidates.       Current law serves as a valuable safeguard for the integrity       of our charitable sector and campaign finance system.        Religious leaders often use their pulpits to address the       moral and political issues of the day. They also can, in       their personal capacities and without the resources of their       houses of worship, endorse and oppose political candidates.       Houses of worship can engage in public debate on any issue,       host candidate forums, engage in voter registration drives,       encourage people to vote, help transport people to the polls       and even, with a few boundaries, lobby on specific       legislation and invite candidates to speak. Tax-exempt houses       of worship may not, however, endorse or oppose candidates or       use their tax-exempt donations to contribute to candidates'       campaigns. Current law simply limits groups from being both a       tax-exempt ministry and a partisan political entity.        As religious organizations, we oppose any attempt to weaken       the current protections offered by the 501(c)(3) campaign       intervention prohibition because:        People of faith do not want partisan political fights       infiltrating their houses of worship. Houses of worship are       spaces for members of religious communities to come together,       not be divided along political lines; faith ought to be a       source of connection and community, not division and discord.       Indeed, the vast majority of Americans do not want houses of       worship to issue political endorsements. Particularly in       today's political climate, such endorsements would be highly       divisive and would have a detrimental impact on civil       discourse.        Current law protects the integrity of houses of worship. If       houses of worship endorse candidates, their prophetic voice,       their ability to speak truth to power as political outsiders,       is threatened. The credibility and integrity of congregations       would suffer with bad decisions of candidates they endorsed.       Tying America's houses of worship to partisan activity       demeans the institutions from which so many believers expect       unimpeachable decency.        Current law protects the independence of houses of worship.       Houses of worship often speak out on issues of justice and       morality and do good works within the community but may also       labor to adequately fund their ministries. Permitting       electioneering in churches would give partisan groups       incentive to use congregations as a conduit for political       activity and expenditures. Changing the law would also make       them vulnerable to individuals and corporations who could       offer large donations or a politician promising social       service contracts in exchange for taking a position on a       candidate. Even proposals that would permit an       ``insubstantial'' standard or allow limited electioneering       only if it is in furtherance of an organization's mission       would actually invite increased government intrusion,       scrutiny, and oversight.        The charitable sector, particularly houses of worship,       should not become another cog in a political machine or       another loophole in campaign finance laws. We strongly urge       you to oppose any efforts to repeal or weaken protections in       the law for 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses of       worship.

Re Oppose Section 5201 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which           Exempts Houses of Worship from the Johnson Amendment.       Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, House Ways and Means Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, House Ways and Means Committee, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Neal: On behalf of       Americans United for Separation of Church and State, we urge       you to strip Section 5201 from H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs       Act. This provision would exempt houses of worship from the       Johnson Amendment, which is the six-decades-old law that       ensures tax-exempt organizations--including houses of       worship, charitable nonprofits, and foundations--do not       endorse or oppose political candidates. We join 103 religious       and denomination organizations, more than 4,200 faith       leaders, and 5,500 nonprofits organizations, in urging       Members of Congress to reject efforts, like the one in       Section 5201, to weaken or repeal the Johnson Amendment.        Tax-exempt charities and houses of worship are granted       special 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status because they work for the       common good, not so they can support political candidates.       Current law protects their right to speak out about political       and social issues while, at the same time, ensuring they are       not pressured by political candidates and campaigns seeking       their own political gain. Indeed, under current law, tax-      exempt houses of worship and the faith leaders who represent       them can speak to any issue or piece of legislation they       choose. And faith leaders can endorse candidates in their       personal capacity.        Exempting houses of worship from the law would threaten       their independence and integrity and open them up to pressure       from political candidates, donors, and congregants who want       to use them for their own political gain. Furthermore,       Section 5201 singles out houses of worship for special       treatment, violating the Constitution.      SECTION 5201 EXEMPTS HOUSES OF WORSHIP FROM THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT         Section 5201 allows houses of worship to endorse candidates       so long the endorsement  [[Page H9399]]       is made during a religious service or gathering, is made in       the ordinary course of their tax-exempt purpose, and does not       incur more than a de minimis incremental expense. This would,       in effect, exempt houses of worship from the Johnson       Amendment.        The impact of even just one endorsement from a house of       worship would be powerful and could have a significant impact       on an election, but this provision permits far more than       merely a lone statement of support. Section 5201, for       example, would allow:        A pastor to preach a sermon endorsing one or more       candidates. His church could then post a video of that sermon       on its website, email it to parishioners, and distribute it       publicly on social media.        A Rabbi to endorse a candidate during the welcoming message       provided to those attending her synagogue's community service       event.        A church that is motivated by faith to provide social       services to the public to tell each and every person who       attends its meetings to vote for a particular candidate.        If such activities were allowed, the Johnson Amendment       would be rendered meaningless as applied to houses of       worship. The very purpose of the Johnson Amendment--to       prevent government subsidized partisan campaign activity--      would be allowed in every church and house of worship across       the country.    SECTION 5201 WOULD REQUIRE THE IRS TO LOOK INTO THE INTERNAL WORKINGS             OF HOUSES OF WORSHIP AND MAKE POLITICAL JUDGMENTS         The Johnson Amendment includes a clear rule: tax-exempt       organizations, including houses of worship, cannot endorse       candidates. This bill includes a vague and undefined test       that is subject to IRS discretion. Enforcing the law would       entangle the IRS in internal church governance and require it       to make judgments about religion.        Section 5201 calls on the IRS to determine whether an       endorsement (1) occurred during the ``ordinary course'' of       the organization's ``regular and customary activities'' in       carrying out its ``tax-exempt purpose;'' (2) whether it       amounted to a ``de minimis incremental expense,'' and (3)       whether it took place during ``religious services or       gatherings.'' To determine whether the cost of any       endorsement was a ``de minimis incremental expense,'' the IRS       would, not only have to define de minimis, but also have to       investigate the house of worship's books. And to determine       whether the endorsement was part of the ``regular and       customary activities,'' the IRS would have to examine the       institution's history of activities. The IRS would also have       to judge whether an event is ``religious'' or not and whether       the activity serves the organization's ``exempt purpose.'' By       inviting that type of scrutiny of church documents and       activities, and judgments about religion, this bill actually       threatens, rather than upholds, the autonomy and independence       of houses of worship.      EXEMPTING ONLY HOUSES OF WORSHIP FROM THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT WOULD                          VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION         Under the religious freedom protections provided by the       First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the government       cannot prefer or favor religion or non-religion. The Johnson       Amendment applies to all 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations,       yet Section 5201 exempts only houses of worship from the       restrictions of the Johnson Amendment. This special treatment       raises serious concerns under the Establishment Clause of the       First Amendment and undermines religious freedom.                                  CONCLUSION         For all the above reasons, we urge you to oppose the       language effectively repealing the Johnson Amendment for       houses of worship.            Sincerely,      Maggie Garrett,        Legislative Director, Americans United for Separation of       Church and State.
