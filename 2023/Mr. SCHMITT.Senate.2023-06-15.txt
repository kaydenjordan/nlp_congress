 Mr. President, Father's Day is coming up. Father's Day  is this Sunday.   As a dad--and, actually, my two daughters are coming into the  Galleries right now--it is a time for reflection and for gratitude,  quite frankly.   I delivered my maiden speech earlier this week, on Tuesday, and a big  part of that was of the influence that my father had on my life.  Growing up in a working-class neighborhood and seeing him work 7 days a  week on the 12 midnight shift and going to events and being a great  role model for me is something that I am eternally grateful for.   I have had a lot of different positions or jobs or titles, but the  most important one that I will ever have is being a father to my son  Stephen and to my two daughters, Sophia and Olivia.   I also mentioned in that maiden speech the inspiration that my son  gave me to run for office. Stephen was born with a rare genetic  condition and suffers from epilepsy. He is nonverbal. He gave me and  has given me, every day, a perspective on what is really important and  what my focus is.   I know, for a lot of dads out there, being a father keeps them  grounded. It is the most important thing that they will ever do. We all  have important business to do even in this place, but being a dad is  paramount.   And I have got my two daughters. I talk about Stephen a lot because  Stephen, again, was my inspiration. He has profound medical challenges  that my wife and I--and Jaime is here as well--deal with every day. If  Stephen were here, he would be giving us big hugs. He is a great kid.  My two daughters, in their own rights, are incredible people. Sophia is  on her journey and is a great kid, a great swimmer. I am just blessed  to be her dad. Then Olivia was asking thoughtful questions on the way  here. So we know the statistics are just simply undeniable, and that is  certainly my story.   But I know that, across the board, in a larger sense, the litany of  research related to the positive outcomes that fathers have when they  are involved with their children are those of better school readiness  and performance, higher self-esteem, greater social awareness.  Increased father engagement can play an important role in improving  maternal healthcare, in addressing maternal mortality and morbidity in  the United States, and in bettering the development of the child and  the long-term growth of the child.   It was an honor to sponsor this resolution with the Senator from  Georgia, my friend, as we shared what we thought was really important  to come before this Chamber in advance of Father's Day.   This resolution recognizes what we already know--that the presence of  a strong father contributes to a child's life in insurmountable ways.  It is hard to calculate what those are. We have some statistics, but we  all know that intuitively, and it strengthens our society as a whole.  It is important that we recognize that and celebrate that on this  Father's Day.   So, to all of the dads out there, have a great Father's Day. I don't  know what is on your wish list, but I hope you enjoy it and that we all  have a greater sense of gratitude for the most important job we will  ever have in our lives.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
