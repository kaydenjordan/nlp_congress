 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the women of  the Brides March, who for 24 years since Gladys Ricart's tragic death  on her wedding day, have held the annual Brides March in her memory to  speak out against domestic violence.   Each year, I host the brides in Washington to honor Gladys' life and  legacy. During this past National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, I  reintroduced my Gladys Ricart Resolution, which fights back against  domestic violence.   I will not rest until Gladys Ricart's story is told across America  and is a thing of the past. We will continue to fight to prevent  domestic violence. Every State in the Union must have a code of laws  against domestic violence.   We will always remember Gladys Ricart.                            ____________________
