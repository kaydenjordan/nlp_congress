 Mr. President, I come to the floor today in defense of  what in essence is the very essence of our democracy and the voting  rights of all Americans.   Our dear friend, someone whom I had the privilege of serving with in  the House of Representatives, the late John Lewis, took a beating on a  bridge in Selma for the right to vote. Surely we in the Senate can  muster a shred of his courage to protect that right.   There are no other rights without the right to vote. It is through  the right to vote that freedom rings, that justice reigns and  opportunity arises.   As we all know, this Monday was Dr. Martin Luther King Day, and we  have to remember his words: He said:         The vote is the most powerful instrument ever--    Ever--       devised by human beings for breaking down injustice and       destroying the terrible walls which imprison people because       they are different from others.    That is what he called the right to vote--humanity's greatest  instrument for advancing progress. Well, the time has come for us to  defend it.   Now, my colleagues who oppose our voting rights legislation have had  ample time to make their opinions heard. Soon, it will be time to end  debate and hold a simple up-or-down vote on the Freedom to Vote Act and  the John Lewis Advancement Act. After all, the State legislatures  passing voter suppression laws across the country are doing so with  simple majorities, conservative majorities that in many cases were born  out of decades of partisan gerrymandering.   How about the Supreme Court? It was a simple majority vote of 5 to 4  that gutted the Voting Rights Act. That was the law that John Lewis and  others risked their lives for on Bloody Sunday.   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 ended discriminatory tactics that not  only blocked Black voters from their ballots but other minorities, too,  including Latinos.   Shortly after the Civil War, Latinos held greater political power in  States like California, Texas, and Arizona, but as Jim Crow spread  throughout the South, they were pushed out of elected positions and  threatened with violence for their continued participation.   The Voting Rights Act transformed our country for the better. It  created the diverse, multiracial democracy we live in today. I know  that my story--the son of first-generation refugees  [[Page S312]]  who came from nothing and rose to become one of 100 U.S. Senators in a  nation of 350 million people--is only possible because of the civil  right giants who came before me.   The Voting Rights Act ended Jim Crow-era voting laws, and its  preclearance provision stopped States from resurrecting them in the  future. States and localities with ugly histories of discrimination had  to get preclearance from the Justice Department before tampering with  their voting laws. Yet, in 2013, the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 ruling in  Shelby County essentially said that racial progress rendered the need  for this oversight obsolete--obsolete--as if racism no longer exists in  this country.    The late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said it best. She  said that ending preclearance when it is continuing to ``stop  discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a  rainstorm because you are not getting wet.'' Indeed, that rule opened  the floodgates for new voter suppression laws.   My colleague from New Jersey often cited Texas. Texas, home to  millions of Black and Latino voters, resurrected a strict photo ID law  that had been struck down just the year before.   Then North Carolina slashed early voting and ended same-day  registration with a law that the Fourth Circuit found was  ``intentionally''--intentionally--written to disenfranchise Black  voters.   Other States, like Alabama, started reducing polling locations in  minority communities.   These measures may not look like poll taxes or literacy tests, but  they are the tools of oppression just the same. Their intent is the  same--to depress turnout among minority voters--and they threaten the  promise of our vibrant, multiracial democracy.   Now, throughout this debate--I have tried to sit here several hours-- I have heard our Republican colleagues question, well, why, after  record turnouts in the last Presidential election, would we feel the  need to revisit voting rights legislation. Well, the answer is pretty  simple: If Republicans systematically were not tearing down the laws  that gave rise to the record turnouts, then maybe this wouldn't be  necessary. But that is exactly what they have done in State after  State.   Voting rights used to enjoy broad bipartisan support here in the  Senate. Indeed, Republicans and Democrats stood together for decades to  reauthorize the Voting Rights Act, most recently in 2006. In fact, I  want to quote one of my colleagues on the day of the last  reauthorization. He said:         America's history is a story of ever-increasing freedom,       hope, and opportunity for all. The Voting Rights Act of 1965       represents one of this country's greatest steps forward in       that story. . . . Every American must have freedom of       political expression--including the free, unfettered right to       vote.    Those words were from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who  spoke those words on that day. He was 1 of 16 Republicans who proudly  voted for the 2006 reauthorization but stand in the way today, 16  Republicans who still are present in the U.S. Senate, including not  only him but Senators Grassley, Shelby, Crapo, Collins, Burr, Inhofe,  Graham, Thune, Cornyn, Blackburn, Blunt, Boozman, Capito, Moran, and  Wicker.   That is right--16 Republicans who supported the reauthorization of  the Voting Rights Act still serve in this body today. So to them, I  say: Join us. Join us. What has changed? What was right then is clearly  right now. Join us, and we could pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act  with a bipartisan supermajority--no change to the rules necessary. Just  join us, as you did in 2006.   Well, we know that won't happen, not today, not since our democracy  has been flooded by a torrential downpour of lies.   Earlier this month, we observed the 1-year anniversary of the January  6 insurrection. A defeated President's violent mob nearly overturned a  free and verifiably fair election and tried to overthrow the U.S.  Constitution. Shots rang out in the Capitol. The Confederate flag waved  through its hallowed halls. That never even happened during the Civil  War.   A New Jerseyan and Capitol Police officer named Brian Sicknick was  drenched in bear spray and later died. Imagine using a toxic substance  intended to fend off bear attacks on fellow human beings, beating  officers within inches of death, and inflicting such painful trauma  that multiple officers have since ended their own lives, all because  one man could not accept defeat--a man with an ego so big, he could not  fathom losing by 7 million votes; an ego so big, he manufactured a lie  to match it--a lie so big, it inspired violence and nearly brought down  the Constitution.   That lie should have died within minutes of the former President  speaking it. Instead, it lived. The Big Lie lived to grow even bigger  thanks to a Republican Party that is no longer a party, I believe, of  principle but a party of fealty to a wannabe despot.   Since the insurrection, the most anti-democratic laws since Jim Crow  have taken the Nation by storm. Last year, 19 States passed nearly  three dozen laws undermining access to the ballot box. It is as if they  are trying to codify the Big Lie into law.   In Arizona, Georgia, and other States, they made it harder to vote by  mail, something that my colleagues have talked about that Americans  have been doing for decades and that Republican GOTV efforts one time  long embraced it as a way to succeed.   They are also removing drop boxes in minority communities under the  bogus claim that they invite fraud. So when it is in Reverend Warnock's  community or Senator Padilla's community or Cory Booker's community or  my community, somehow that drop box invites fraud just simply because  it is in our community? Another lie straight from the mouth of a  defeated President.   And many States are reducing early voting days.   When you add up all of these restrictions, what do you get? Longer  lines at the polls, people giving up, folks who have to get home to  their kids, workers who can't afford to take a day off. To the partisan  architects of these laws, their sigh of resignation is music to their  ears. They want to make voting so inconvenient for working people and  communities of color that they don't even bother.   The Georgia State legislature gave itself the power to remove  election officials that were elected by the people if they don't like  what they see. Simply put, these laws gave State legislatures new tools  to disregard--disregard--the will of the voters.   So I have come to the conclusion that since Republicans cannot win  elections with the power of their ideas, they are doing everything they  can to change the rules of the game so they can win anyway. In doing  so, they are taking us back to a time and place where injustice  prevailed, a time and a place that I certainly don't want to go back to  nor do I want my children or grandchildren to go back to or those whom  I represent to go back to.   Finally, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I  would note that when we see an attempted coup or creeping  authoritarianism abroad, we call it democratic backsliding. Now other  countries are wondering: Is that happening to the United States?  Dictators around the world are jumping for joy. This is what they want  to see, democracy in disarray. In fact, last November, the Institute  for Democracy and Electoral Assistance added the United States to a  list of ``backsliding democracies'' for the first time ever--ever.   Look, democratic self-government only works when all parties consent  to be governed by whoever wins the most votes. That is how elections  work. We can debate corporate tax rate. We can disagree about financial  aid funding. We can differ over healthcare policy. But the outcome of a  fair and free election, the sanctity of the right to vote--these are  not up for debate.   Voting rights are the foundation of this entire democratic  enterprise, this great American experiment. It is time every Senator  looks into their souls and decides how they want to be remembered when  future generations remember this perilous moment in our history.   This legislation will protect the rights of all of our voters--young  and old; rich and poor; Black and White; Latino and Asian; indigenous;  immigrant; Republican; Democrat; Independent; the single mom, exhausted  but relieved her neighbor could watch the kids so she could make it to  the  [[Page S313]]  polls; the warehouse worker who can't afford a day off but winds up  taking one anyway; the elderly African-American woman, her hand shaking  with determination as she signs her name on a mail-in ballot--she  remembers life before the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and she will never  forget the sacrifices of those who marched for it, who bled for it, and  even died for the right to vote.   Now, I will just say one final thing. We all take an oath to the  Constitution. It is required under the Constitution to be sworn in as a  Member of Congress. And in that Constitution, an amendment that is seen  only as it relates to a different time in history, but it is very clear  and very powerful:         The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall       not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any       State on account of race, color, or previous condition of       servitude.        [And] the Congress shall have power to enforce this article       by appropriate legislation.    These rights enshrined in the Constitution under the 15th amendment,  they are certainly being abridged. They are certainly being affected in  a way that we could not fathom in the year 2022. How shameful it would  be if we let it slip through our fingers and be buried under an  avalanche of one sore loser's life. How shameful it would be to violate  our oath to the Constitution, to that 15th amendment, in order to  preserve some rule that is not in the Constitution and certainly is not  as enshrined as that right to vote.   I hope that those who joined us in 2006 will be there today to vote  with us on the Republican side, and if that fails, then I hope we will  change the filibuster into a talking filibuster so the Nation can see  who stands on the side of ensuring the franchise of that right to vote  for every American.   I yield the floor.
