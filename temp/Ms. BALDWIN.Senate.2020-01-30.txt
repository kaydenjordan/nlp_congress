 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Baldwin is addressed to the House managers:         Given that the White House Counsel couldn't answer Senator       Romney's question that asked for the exact date the President       first ordered the hold on security assistance to Ukraine,       what witness or witnesses could answer Senator Romney's       question?    Mr. Manager CROW. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, Senator,  for the question.   You are right. They were not able to directly answer that question,  and we believe that there is a tremendous amount of material out there  in the form of emails, text messages, conversation, and witness  testimony that can shed additional light on that, including an email  from last summer between Mr. Bolton and Mr. Blair, where we know from  witness testimony this issue was discussed.   What we do know is from multiple witnesses. Ukrainian officials knew  that President Trump had placed a hold on security assistance soon  after it was ordered in July of 2019. So we know that not only did U.S.  officials know about it and OMB communicated about it, Ukrainians knew  about it as well.   We know from former Deputy Foreign Minister of Ukraine, Olena  Zerkal--she stated publicly, in fact, that the Ukrainian officials knew  about it and had found out about it in July. We also know from the  testimony of Laura Cooper that her staff received two emails from the  State Department on July 25 revealing that the Ukrainian Embassy was  ``asking about security assistance'' and that ``the Hill knows about  the FMS situation to an extent and so does the Ukrainian embassy.''  That was on July 25, the same day as President Trump's call with  President Zelensky.   What we also know is that career diplomat, Catherine Croft, stated  that she was ``very surprised at the effectiveness of my Ukrainian  counterparts' diplomatic tradecraft, as in to say they found out very  early on or much earlier than I expected them to.''   We also know that LTC Alexander Vindman testified that by mid-August  he was getting questions from Ukrainians about the status of security  assistance. So there is a lot of evidence surrounding it.   The administration continues to obstruct wholly our efforts to get  the emails and correspondence that we have asked for. That obviously  can be remedied by this body with the appropriate subpoenas; namely, a  subpoena to Ambassador Bolton to testify and a subpoena to the State  Department--the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and  others to actually provide that material.   The last thing I would like to say is, last evening, counsel for the  President was asked the question about why did the hold for Ukraine  differ from holds in the Northern Triangle and other holds like  Afghanistan. He provided an explanation that I am still trying to wrap  my brain around because he seems to be the only person in the  administration that actually has an explanation. As far as I could  tell, the explanation was somewhere along the lines of one was public,  trying to put public pressure on the countries in question, and one was  not. It was a private conversation, a private effort to put pressure.   If that were true, then, of course, there would be plenty of  evidence, plenty of emails, text messages, and other correspondence  within the entire interagency process that we know is robust that would  illustrate that to be the case, but they have failed to provide any  evidence to corroborate that.   Let me finish with this. I happen to know that a lot of people in  this Chamber, a lot of people in the Chamber on the other side of the  Capitol, including me, have often described much consternation about  redtape and bureaucracy and layers of government that run too slow. And  I sometimes share that concern, right, that sometimes it takes a long  time. There are memos for everything, emails for everything. There are  paper trails for everything in this town. I think that is true with  respect to this issue, and it is time that we actually see that  information so we can get to the bottom of what actually happened. This  body could get that information.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for  both President's counsel and House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Baldwin is for both parties, and counsel  for the President will answer first:         Can you assure us that the Jennifer Williams document       submitted to the House was not classified SECRET for any       reasons prohibited by Executive Order 13526, such as       preventing embarrassment to a person? If yes, please describe       or identify the serious damage to national security that       would be caused by declassifying this document, pursuant to       the same Executive Order.    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice and Senator, in response to  your question, the Trump administration's policy is always to abide by  the requirements for classification of material, and the  classification--my understanding is that that document is derivatively  classified because it refers to another document, a transcript that was  originally classified. I can't represent to you a specific reason that  the classification officer classified that document, but I can tell you  that it was originally classified according to proper procedures. It is  a properly classified document, and that is the policy of the  administration, to follow the classification procedures.    The memorandum that she submitted is derivatively classified because  of that transcript. Now, that transcript relates to a conversation with  a foreign head of state. Almost all conversations with foreign heads of  state are classified. They are classified because the confidentiality  relates to those communications. It is important for ensuring that  there can be candid conversations with foreign heads of state.   The President took an extraordinary action in declassifying two of  his conversations with foreign heads of state--unprecedented--because  he carefully weighed the balance of what was at stake in this case and  the need for transparency to the American public in those two  conversations. But that was an exception to the usual rule that such  conversations are properly classified.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, I would encourage you, if you haven't  already had the opportunity, to read that document for yourself and ask  whether you think there is any legitimate basis to classify that  supplemental testimony.   Now, the Vice President has said that he had no knowledge of this  scheme. He has denied any knowledge, involvement in any way, shape, or  form.   We heard the testimony of Ambassador Sondland that Ambassador  Sondland raised to the Vice President that the aid was being held up  and was tied to these investigations, and the Vice President didn't  say: What are you talking about? That could never be. The President  would never allow such a thing.   There was nothing but a silent nod of acknowledgment of what he was  being told. But, nonetheless, the Vice President says that he knew  nothing, and the Vice President points to the open testimony of  Jennifer Williams to support that contention. But the classified  submission goes to that phone call between the Vice President and  President Zelensky. You should read that and ask yourself whether that  submission is being classified because it would either embarrass or  undermine what the President and the Vice President are saying or there  is some legitimate reason.   Now, the Vice President at one point said that he wanted to release  the record of his call. He certainly talked all about this issue, as  has the President. If it was so classified, then why are they all  talking about it? But we are to be assured that this classification  decision was made absolutely above board. I am sure that John Bolton's  manuscript will be treated with the same rigid, objective scrutiny.   You read that. Don't take my word for it. You read that, and you ask  yourselves, is there anything that--other than avoiding evidence that  the administration doesn't want you to see--that the public shouldn't  see in Jennifer Williams' supplemental testimony? I don't think you can  conclude that it is, except that it would be inconsistent with what you  are being told and what the American people are being told. Well, they  deserve the whole truth, and that is part of the truth. So let the  public see it.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Tennessee.
