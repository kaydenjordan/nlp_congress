 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I respect and support Tribal sovereignty. I also support workers'  rights to unionize and collective bargaining to improve their workplace  and the lives of their families. Those rights must be balanced, but  they are not in this bill.   Union members have a collective voice to fight for higher wages,  better benefits, safer workplaces, fewer injuries, fewer deaths, lower  rates of gender-based violence.   After Unite Here, a union, found that 58 percent of hotel workers and  77 percent of casino workers in the Chicagoland, where I am from, had  been sexually harassed, they won a contract that includes panic buttons  to protect workers.   Labor rights are fundamental, but under this bill, workers at  Tribally-owned businesses, casinos and hotels, construction, and other  industries would lose those rights.   Remember, three out of four workers employed in Tribal casinos are  not Tribal members. Those workers could end up with no way to bargain  for fair wages, appeal unfair disciplinary action, or act against  sexual harassment.   Looking at a similar bill in the last Congress, the International  Labour Organization stated: ``It would appear likely that an exclusion  of certain workers from the National Labor Relations Act and its  mechanisms would give rise to a failure to ensure to these workers  their fundamental freedom of association rights absent any assurances  that there were Tribal labor laws that provide the same rights to all  workers.''   Mr. Speaker, there is no such requirement in this bill. Protect  workers. Reject this unfair and unbalanced bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the opinion from the  International Labour Office.                                    International Labour Office,                                                          Geneve 22.
