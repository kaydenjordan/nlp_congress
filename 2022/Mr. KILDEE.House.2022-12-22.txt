 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, the  Presidential Tax Filings and Audit Transparency Act, legislation that  ensures that we protect our tax system and ensures that it is fair and  transparent for all Americans.   As we have heard, the purpose of the Ways and Means Committee  investigation and the purpose of this legislation is to ensure that no  American is above the law, even the President of the United States.   But shockingly, under the former President, the IRS was not examining  the President's tax returns as required by their own policy as it had  for other Presidents before and since. It did not follow its own rules.  Because of this, there are still glaring questions about whether the  former President was abiding by our tax laws.   That is why we needed the information, and that is why we need this  legislation to require the IRS to examine Presidential returns in a  timely and complete manner. The American people must have confidence  that our tax laws apply evenly and justly to everyone.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal for his leadership on this. In  passing this, we will ensure integrity in our tax system.
