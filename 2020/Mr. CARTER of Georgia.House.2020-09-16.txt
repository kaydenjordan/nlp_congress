 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our valiant  frontline workers and healthcare heroes who have taken care of their  neighbors and saved countless lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. This  includes nurses, doctors, pharmacists, grocery store workers, truck  drivers, and anyone who has risen to the occasion to help others during  these unprecedented times.   In particular, Jane Spence, Larisa Barnes, Bobbie Sumner, Amanda  King, and Lynn Reynolds have exemplified remarkable selflessness and  courage as they work to save lives in the Southeast Georgia Health  System.   Throughout my time in Georgia's First Congressional District, I have  visited and met countless heroes serving at Saint Joseph's Candler  Hospital, Liberty Regional Medical Center, Clinch Memorial Hospital,  Memorial Health Center in Savannah, Wayne Memorial Center, and Winn  Army Medical Hospital. This has allowed me to gain insight into the  daily sacrifices they make and their commitment to serving their  communities.   Doctors and nurses who serve at our Veterans Affairs Health Systems  are deserving of recognition for their outstanding work, as well.   In addition to our healthcare heroes, I also want to honor leaders  and local businesses in our communities.   Individuals like Tom and Rita Boland converted their Island Drapes  and Upholstery business to manufacture thousands of face masks a week.   I was also encouraged to see the local nonprofits in Georgia's First  Congressional District rise up to address the many challenges from the  COVID-19 pandemic.   Specifically, the Computers for a Cause movement was formed thanks to  the beautiful work of United Way of Coastal Georgia, Keep Golden Isles  Beautiful, Communities in Schools, and Coastal Outreach partnering with  Coastal Computer Consulting to gather and donate computers for children  who don't have access to one.   This allowed countless children to continue their education when  schools were closed. These folks were working day in and day out  risking their own health and safety and spending time away from their  families and friends to serve us.   I want to express my deep gratitude for the work that they do to make  America great, and I am honored to call them my friends and neighbors.                          Honoring Preston G. Exley     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of Mr. Preston Exley of Springfield, Georgia, who passed  away at the age of 81 on September 10.   Mr. Exley was a selfless leader in every area of his life who was  loved by many.   Mr. Exley worked for the Savannah Sugar Refinery for 40 years and  retired in 1997.   Preston loved the Lord, and his life was a testament to that. Preston  was an active member of Holy Trinity Lutheran Church and served in a  variety of roles, including Sunday school superintendent, president of  the Men's Group, and a member of the Church Council.   Preston was committed to serving his country through his service with  the Georgia Army National Guard for 23 years, and he retired as a  captain.   Preston was also dedicated to improving education in his community  during his time serving on the Effingham County School Board from 1980  until 1994, and he later went on to serve as Effingham County Chief  Magistrate Judge for 12 years.   Included in his long list of pursuits, Preston was a farmer for many  years in his home place in Clyo.   Impressively, Preston was past president of the Effingham County  Young Farmers, a member of the County Board of Directors, and served as  the Springfield Chapter President.   Preston was also a loyal family man, who prioritized his family above  all else.   I am thankful for the selfless life Preston lived, and I know his  legacy will continue in Springfield for years to come. My thoughts and  prayers go out to his family, friends, and all who knew him during  these challenging times.                            ____________________
