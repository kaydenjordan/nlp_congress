 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize the  Kristallnacht Remembrance Service that has taken place in the community  I represent for more than 60 years.   In 1938, during Kristallnacht, the night of broken glass, more than  90 Jews were killed, murdered, and 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and  sent to concentration camps. Hundreds of synagogues were burned, and  thousands of Jewish homes and businesses were ransacked. It was a  prelude to the horrors to come.   Every year, central Virginians come together on the anniversary of  Kristallnacht at the Emek Sholom Holocaust Memorial Cemetery in Henrico  County, a cemetery that serves as the final resting place for so many  Virginians with ties to the Holocaust.   At the service, our community joins to remember what took place,  honor loved ones, and remind us that we can never forget.   I am immensely grateful to the local leaders in central Virginia's  Jewish community who bring people together for this remembrance  service.   This community is committed to education and celebrating Jewish  culture, and the Kristallnacht Remembrance Service is indicative of  that spirit and that commitment.                            ____________________
