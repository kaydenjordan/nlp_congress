 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 2, line 2, strike ``the five clinical'' and insert       ``at a minimum, the five clinical''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Meng) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chair, I thank Representative Wenstrup for his  thoughtful amendment, and I thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz  for bringing it to the floor today.   Clearly, there are staffing shortages within the Department of  Veterans Affairs, and, clearly, something must be done. Personally, I  think this legislation is a good first step toward improving the VA's  ability to identify staffing shortages, recruit and retain high-quality  employees, and onboard new hires.   The amendment I am offering today speaks to the identification of  staffing shortages portion of this bill. Under current law, 38 U.S.C.  7412 to be exact, the inspector general of the VA is required to submit  a report to the VA Secretary annually highlighting the five personnel  occupations with the largest staffing shortages throughout the  Department. After receiving this report, the Secretary is then  permitted to recruit and directly appoint qualified individuals to fill  those vacancies.   Section 2 of the bill before us does something important to current  law. It will require the IG to report on not just the five occupations  with the largest staffing shortages, it will require the IG to report  on the five clinical and five nonclinical occupations with the largest  shortages in the VA. Additionally, it will require this reporting to be  done for each medical center. Mr. Chair, I think this is a wonderful  change, one that is sorely needed.   What my amendment would do is add to this expanded reporting  requirement a simple clarification: the IG must report on, at minimum,  the five clinical and nonclinical occupations with the largest staffing  shortages at each facility. It would allow the IG to report on more  than the five occupations with the largest shortages, should his  findings require it.   This amendment is not an additional reporting requirement. It simply  makes clear that should the IG find additional staffing shortages, he  may highlight those so that the Secretary may fill them more quickly.  It is a simple attempt to avoid the necessity of passing similar  legislation 2, 3, or even 4 years from now.   Our veterans need the care that they have earned and that they  deserve. They need it now. The first step in that endeavor is making  sure that the VA staffing levels are adequate.   Again, Mr. Chair, I am pleased to see this amendment on the floor  today and to do my small part in ensuring that veterans get the care  they need. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which would  allow the VA inspector general to highlight additional staffing  shortages within the Department.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge support for this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge support for this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge support for this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of the bill insert the following:       SEC. 14. ENCOURAGING TRANSITION OF MILITARY MEDICAL                     PROFESSIONALS INTO EMPLOYMENT WITH VETERANS                     HEALTH ADMINISTRATION.         The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall establish a program       to encourage an individual who serves in the Armed Forces       with a military occupational specialty relating to the       provision of health care to seek employment with the Veterans       Health Administration when the individual has been discharged       or released from service in the Armed Forces or is       contemplating separating from such service.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Meng) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would require the VA Secretary  to establish a program encouraging members of our Armed Forces serving  as health professionals to pursue jobs with the Veterans Health  Administration upon discharge or separation from the military.   As we all know, the VHA has existing shortages of health  professionals. We also know that our servicemen and -women sometimes  have difficulty transitioning back to civilian life after serving.   What would be better than having a servicemember with healthcare  training and experience transition into employment with the VHA serving  their brothers and sisters?   Mr. Chair, I believe that everyone wins with this amendment. This  program would be completely optional to participate in, would help  reduce staffing shortages at the VHA, and would provide job  opportunities to recently discharged servicemembers.   I urge support for this commonsense amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
