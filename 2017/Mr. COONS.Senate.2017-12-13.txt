 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about the  vital importance of the connection between the arts, education, and  progress.   I am from a little town in Delaware named Hockessin. Hockessin was  not much when I grew up there. We had about 1,500 people, some dairy  farms and mushroom farms. Over the last 40 years, it has gradually  developed.   A not much widely noted big day happened back in 1994 in Hockessin,  DE, when one of America's greatest jazz performers, Cab Calloway,  passed away in the little town of Hockessin, DE. Cab Calloway gave his  name to a remarkable performing arts school. This is a school that 25  years ago was created dedicated to the idea that if you want to elevate  learning, if you want to strengthen education, you should make sure you  have a robust range of opportunities to engage with the arts.   I thought I would use that as an example today to talk for a few  minutes about why what we do here can be important across our whole  country and why a connection between the arts and education can make a  lasting difference for families all across our country.   Back in 1965, when I was just 2 years old, a group of Senators,  Republican and Democratic, came together to create two things--the  National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for  the Arts. These two federally funded national programs are absolutely  critical educational, economic, and cultural drivers that have impacted  thousands of communities across the United States.   Why is this a subject of any contention or discussion here? Well,  because unfortunately our President's budget this year proposed to  eliminate funding for both of these organizations--both the National  Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities-- proposed to be removed, zeroed out, cancelled, despite their almost  more than 50-year record of successful impact and service across the  country.   In my little State of Delaware, the National Endowment for the Arts  and the National Endowment for the Humanities funded all sorts of  valuable programs with significant impacts. Last year, I invited the  head of the National Endowment for the Arts to come and visit us in  Delaware and to pull together the whole range of folks who received  some grants from them--$681,000 last year. It is about 17 percent of  all the funding for arts in my State. It helped support 100 grants to  nonprofits all up and down our State.   I will give a few examples. The Grand Opera House has a summer in the  park series because of the National Endowment for the Arts. The  University of Delaware Community Music School holds a musical theater  camp every summer, serving dozens of kids--about 80 kids. The  Christiana Cultural Arts Center in downtown Wilmington brings vibrant,  cutting-edge arts programming to a neighborhood that might not  otherwise enjoy it. The Creative Vision Factory provides individuals  with behavioral health disorders an opportunity for self-expression,  empowerment, and recovery through the arts. I  [[Page S7995]]  can give many more examples, but these are four of the hundreds.   The National Endowment for the Humanities gives a comparable number  of grants and supports programs up and down our State. I will mention  one--art conservation at Winterthur. Winterthur, which is a magnificent  museum and collection of the American arts, has a partnership with  museums in places around the world--from Haiti, to Iraq, to Syria-- where, because of conflict, critical pieces of cultural history have  been at risk of being lost. Because of these NEH grants to Winterthur,  those partnerships have been strengthened.   We have been blessed to have in my friend Governor Jack Markell and  his wife Carla, over the last 8 years, strong, longstanding support for  the arts in our State. We have lots of leading individuals in our  State. Tatiana Copeland, for example, helped build the Queen Theater  and helped support the Delaware Symphony Orchestra. They work in  partnership with the Delaware Division of the Arts. A gentleman named  Paul Weagraff is now the executive director of the Delaware Division of  the Arts under the new administration of Governor Carney.   I am hopeful that we here in the Senate can sustain bipartisan  support for arts and humanities funding and that the young people of  Delaware, our communities, and our families will continue to enjoy the  blessings that these investments in creativity bring. How much are we  talking about? It is about $150 million--$149.8 million, to be  specific--this fiscal year for each of these two endowments. That is a  tiny percentage of the total Federal budget. Now, $150 million may  sound like a lot, and $680,000 of grants for my whole State of Delaware  may sound like a lot, but across these two endowments for the arts and  humanities, $300 million in Federal money has a dramatic impact. It  leverages private funding 9 to 1. In recent studies looking at the  impact of the National Endowment for the Arts, they concluded that they  were particularly focused and particularly effective and that where  there is a leadership grant given by the NEA, it leverages $9 more for  every Federal dollar used.   I think Federal funding for the arts and humanities has to remain a  priority. I think it is important that we embrace the model that the  Cab Calloway School has championed in Delaware and across the country  where educational excellence is shown by working together with the  expressive and creative arts.   It was William Butler Yeats--a famous Irish poet--who once said that  education is not the mere filling up of a pail, it is the lighting of a  fire. If you want to ignite the aspirations, hopes, and dreams of young  people, don't just engage them in trigonometry, biology, chemistry, and  physics--although those subjects can be interesting, engaging, or  challenging--light the fire of their spirit with art, give their spirit  room to soar, give them an opportunity to paint on the canvas of their  lives, and give them the gift of artistic training and skills, and  there is no limit to where they can go. That has been our experience in  Delaware. That has been our experience across the country.   It is my hope that we will find a way on a bipartisan basis to  continue to sustain investment in the humanities and the arts.   In 1960, President Kennedy said:         There is a connection, hard to explain logically but easy       to feel, between achievement in public life and progress in       the arts.    Citing three important periods in history, he said:         The age of Pericles was also the age of Phidias. The age of       Lorenzo de Medici was also the age of Leonardo da Vinci. The       age of Elizabeth was also the age of Shakespeare, and the new       frontier for which I campaign in public life can also be a       new frontier for American art.    It is important that we remember here that the modest amounts of  Federal money we invest in the arts bear enormous positive, multiplied  benefits to the people of our country and to our place in the world.   I am grateful for all who work in arts education, and I am grateful  for the opportunity to work on a bipartisan basis to sustain our  Federal investment in the arts and humanities.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
