 Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful to the exceptional  leadership of the House Foreign Affairs Committee for shepherding this  resolution to the floor and calling on the Russian Federation to  immediately release Paul Whelan.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Meeks, our  subcommittee leadership, Chairman Kean, and Ranking Member Keating for  their steady bipartisan urgency in the consideration of H. Res. 272.   Paul Whelan has been wrongfully detained by the Kremlin since I was  first elected to Congress in the winter of 2018.   The first time I introduced this legislation demanding that Russia  release my constituent, I was eager to assure Paul and his family that  his government was behind him.   The second time, I was heartbroken that he was still waiting for  justice.   Now, during the third Congress of Paul's detention, I am furious.   Throughout Paul's detention, the Russian Government has repeatedly  violated his rights, denied him proper medical care, and refused to  provide any evidence to substantiate the charges against him.   Paul was held in pretrial detention for over 18 months in the  notorious Lefortovo Prison. Then his trial was held behind closed  doors, and his defense was prohibited from calling witnesses--a sham  trial.   Paul now serves a 16-year sentence of hard labor in a prison camp  where he has been since August of 2020, facing unbelievably harsh  conditions, injury, and illness. Here in the United States, we can't  even fathom the conditions that he faces on a daily basis.   Today, we have the opportunity as a Congress to denounce Paul's  wrongful imprisonment and to stand up to Vladimir Putin and his Kremlin  cronies.   We will continue to come together as a Congress to make it clear that  American citizens will not be used as political pawns by Mr. Putin,  period. End of story.   I have said before that Paul's detention was the canary in the coal  mine for the lawlessness that we now see on a global scale from Mr.  Putin.   Since Paul's detention, Mr. Putin has seized marine veteran Trevor  Reed, basketball star Brittney Griner, and most recently, The Wall  Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, the first reporter to be  unlawfully detained by Russia since the Cold War.                                time  1630    Today, I am also proud to recognize the citizens who have taken up  the fight to return their loved ones hand in hand with the United  States Government. As co-chair of the Hostage Task Force alongside Mr.  French Hill, we are standing up to these attacks on Americans for  simply being Americans. I thank Mr. Hill for helping to fight for Paul.   I have spoken several times on this House floor about my deep  admiration for Paul's sister, Elizabeth Whelan, who has become a true  partner to my office and the people of Michigan's 11th District.   In late April of just this year, Elizabeth joined America's U.N.  Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield in a session of the U.N. Security  Council that was being chaired by Russia's Foreign Minister.   In stunning testimony, she called on him directly to release her  brother. Looking him straight in the eye, Elizabeth stressed that she  didn't even know what her brother looked like anymore. Coverage of this  event made it all the way to Paul's prison in Russia, strengthening his  resolve and reflecting the bravery of his sister.   That is the incredible family that Paul comes from. The fortitude of  the Whelan family should be an inspiration to all Americans. Every  single day I see them stand up for freedom, democracy, and justice.  They are fearless, and they are the reason Paul will come home.   This is deeply personal to me, and it should be to all Americans. Not  a single day goes by that I do not think about Paul and his family.  Their pain is unimaginable, and no family should endure what the  Whelans have.   It has been my mission to see Paul returned to Michigan and be  reunited with his family and his beloved dog, Flora, a golden retriever  who has outlived her breed by many years and is now 15. She is waiting  for her owner to come home.   I thank my fellow Members of Congress for their continued advocacy on  behalf of Paul, as well as all the families of hostages and wrongful  detainees who are facing the unthinkable every single day.   If Paul is watching, he knows we are praying for him, we are rooting  for him, and we will not stop fighting for him.   If Vladimir Putin is watching, he knows that the world's strongest  democracy and the seat of the world's power is united against him  today.    Mr. Speaker, if Vladimir Putin is watching, he should  know that the United States will not stand by and watch as his lawless  regime continues its reign of terror.   Release Paul Whelan now. Release Evan Gershkovich. Mr. Putin should  end his years of human rights abuses and his illegal war against  Ukraine. Enough is enough.
