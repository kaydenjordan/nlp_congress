 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 831) calling on the United States Government to  uphold the founding democratic principles of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization and establish a Center for Democratic Resilience within  the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 831         Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is       the world's preeminent political and military alliance       committed to democracy and the collective defense of its       members;        Whereas the preamble of NATO's founding North Atlantic       Treaty, signed in Washington, DC, on April 4, 1949, declares       the alliance is ``founded on the principles of democracy,       individual liberty, and the rule of law'';        Whereas democracies across the alliance face external       threats from authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China       and internal threats from proponents of illiberalism;        Whereas Russia launched a full-scale invasion of sovereign       and democratic Ukraine on February 24, 2022, placing it on       the frontlines in the contest between democratic values and       autocracy;        Whereas in his address to Congress, President Zelensky       remarked ``Right now, the destiny of our country is being       decided. The destiny of our people, whether Ukrainians will       be free, whether they will be able to preserve their       democracy.'';        Whereas Vladimir Putin's unprovoked full-scale invasion of       Ukraine has united the NATO alliance;        Whereas there is a broad agreement within the alliance of       the need to strengthen the democracies of NATO members,       partners, and aspirant countries;        Whereas, in April 2020, NATO Secretary General Jens       Stoltenberg appointed an independent Reflection Group tasked       with supporting a forward-looking reflection process meant to       strengthen the political dimension of the alliance;        Whereas the Reflection Group's report, ``NATO 2030: United       for a New Era'', included analyses and recommendations for       the alliance to address `` `democratic recession,' the global       erosion of democratic norms, and the rise of       authoritarianism'', including--        (1) ``A shared democratic identity is what distinguishes       the Alliance from the principal threats and challenges it       faces.'';        (2) ``NATO should reassert its core identity as an Alliance       rooted in the principles of democracy.'';        (3) ``Any commitment to strengthening NATO's political       cohesion therefore has to be orientated toward those shared       values and ideals, grounded in democracy, rule of law and       individual liberty.''; and        (4) recommending the establishment of a Center of       Excellence for Democratic Resilience in order to strengthen       NATO democracies against external threats;        Whereas the Brussels Summit Communique issued by the Heads       of State and Government participating in the meeting of the       North Atlantic Council in Brussels on June 14, 2021, stated--        (1) ``NATO is the strongest and most successful Alliance in       history. It guarantees the security of our territory and our       one billion citizens, our freedom, and the values we share,       including individual liberty, human rights, democracy, and       the rule of law.'';        (2) ``State and non-state actors challenge the rules-based       international order and seek to undermine democracy across       the globe.''; and        (3) ``We reaffirm the Alliance's shared democratic       principles as well as our commitment to the spirit and the       letter of the North Atlantic Treaty.'';        Whereas in Brussels the Allies also committed to updating       NATO's Strategic Concept;        Whereas NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has       reiterated that one of the primary purposes of updating the       Strategic Concept must be a recommitment to the founding       values of the alliance;        Whereas the NATO Parliamentary Assembly supports a new       Strategic Concept that reaffirms that the support and       strengthening of democratic institutions is foundational to       the collective security of Allies;        Whereas Russia's full-scale invasion of sovereign and       democratic Ukraine underscores the importance of placing       shared democratic values at the heart of NATO's Strategic       Concept; and        Whereas the NATO Parliamentary Assembly has endorsed and       advanced a proposal to establish a NATO Center for Democratic       Resilience within NATO headquarters for the purposes of       monitoring and identifying challenges to democracy, human       rights, and the rule of law and facilitating democracy and       governance assistance to member, partner, and aspirant       states, when requested: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms its unequivocal support for the North       Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as an alliance founded on       democratic principles;        (2) urges NATO to continue to provide unwavering support to       the people of Ukraine as they fight for their sovereignty,       territorial integrity, and a democratic future;        (3) calls on the President to use the voice and vote of the       United States to adopt a new Strategic Concept for NATO that       is clear about its support for shared democratic values and       committed to enhancing NATO's capacity to strengthen       democratic institutions within NATO member, partner, and       aspirant countries; and        (4) calls on the President to use the voice and vote of the       United States to establish a Center for Democratic Resilience       within NATO headquarters.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Res. 831, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman  Greg Meeks and Ranking Member  Mike  McCaul for helping bring this bipartisan resolution to the floor today.   I also want to thank my partner in so much of this enterprise with  respect to NATO and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Turner).   H. Res. 831, which we introduced together, Mr. Turner and I, calls on  the  [[Page H4178]]  United States Government to uphold the founding democratic principles  of NATO and establish a Center for Democratic Resilience within NATO  itself.   NATO's founding document, signed here in Washington, D.C., on April  4, 1949, this very week, is clear: NATO is an alliance of democracies.   The preamble to the treaty notes the determination of allies ``to  safeguard the freedom, common heritage, and civilization of their  peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty,  and the rule of law.''   The alliance's commitment to shared democratic values is what  distinguishes NATO from any other military alliance. Without it, NATO  is just another military bloc that does not like Russia.   This commitment cannot remain purely aspirational or rhetorical. It  must be operationalized. That is why we believe we need formal  architecture within NATO dedicated to the promotion and advocacy of  democracy.   There are divisions and units within NATO dedicated to collective  defense, terrorism, interoperability, hybrid warfare, cyber, climate  change, and a number of other security challenges. But after 72 years,  there is not even a broom closet at NATO headquarters dedicated to the  promotion of democratic institution-building within the alliance itself  or with respect to the members.                                time  1400    The effort to establish a NATO Center for Democratic Resilience is an  idea first proposed in 2019 as part of a white paper this Member of  Congress wrote on ``NATO at 70.''   As the current president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I have  taken that recommendation and made the strengthening of NATO's founding  democratic values our number one priority.   The assembly has, in turn, endorsed this idea, the establishment of a  Center for Democratic Resilience and made it a central component of the  assembly's pro-democracy agenda within NATO.   And we were pleased to see the proposal included in the Group of  Experts' report commissioned by the NATO Secretary General as we  prepare for updating the strategic concept.   The U.S. delegation to the NATO PA, which includes Chairman Meeks and  Representatives  Mike Turner of Ohio, Linda Sanchez, Brett Guthrie,  Rick Larsen, Neal Dunn, Brendan Boyle, Jack Bergman, Dina Titus, Austin  Scott, and Filemon Vela, has jointly written to the Secretary of State,  Antony Blinken, and our Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, encouraging  the Biden administration to work with our NATO allies to operationalize  support for our shared democratic principles and to establish this  Center for Democratic Resilience.   And to the credit of the Biden administration and the U.S. Ambassador  to NATO, Julie Smith, they have followed up on our recommendation.   When we met with the North Atlantic Council in February in Brussels,  Ambassador Smith made a forceful case for the establishment of the  center, and we were encouraged to see several NATO Ambassadors join her  in taking up the mantle and arguing in favor of the proposal.   Today, the values upon which the alliance have been founded are being  challenged by external enemies of democracy, all too tragically being  witnessed in the Ukraine.   These forces aim to undermine the faith in and political support for  our common democracies and the alliance itself.   The strongest weapon we possess to counter effectively Putin or Xi's  authoritarianism is a vibrant, robust, and immutable expression of the  liberal democratic values that bind us.   Putin's renewed, full-scale aggression against Ukraine is a blatant  attack on the most basic principles underlying the international order  since the end of World War II, principles which Moscow has freely  signed on to but ignored. President Putin seeks to crush Ukraine's  democracy, intimidate other countries where the embers of democratic  ambition burn, and, by implication, undermine all democracies  everywhere.   We must respond by uniting around and strengthening our commitment to  our shared democratic values and the rules-based order. The NATO treaty  is clear: We are an alliance of democracies.   As NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said during the recent  ministerial in Riga, Latvia: ``NATO was created to defend democracy,  freedom, and the rule of law. These values define who we are. They are  not optional.''   And as President Zelenskyy of Ukraine said during his recent address  to this body, to the Congress: ``Right now, the destiny of our  country''--Ukraine--``is being decided. The destiny of our people,  whether Ukrainians will be free, whether they will be able to preserve  their democracy.''   NATO stands for the preservation of that democracy. And we believe  the center called for in this resolution must be part of NATO's work to  build a bulwark against authoritarianism and democratic backsliding as  we proceed.   I thank the bipartisan group of members of the U.S. delegation to  NATO PA for their support as they joined us in this effort, and I urge  my colleagues to vote in favor of this strong bipartisan resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Ohio for his  leadership. He is the former President of the NATO Parliamentary  Assembly, as well, and he has provided unwavering support for America's  leadership in this alliance and for the alliance itself. And he is a  highly respected figure on both sides of the Atlantic, and I thank him  for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).    Mr. Speaker, all I can say is having authored this  language, I don't know what the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris) is  referring to.   When we talk about illiberal forces within the NATO alliance, it is  all-inclusive. The New York Times did an extensive podcast series on  illiberal, rightwing groups within Germany's police and military; not  Hungary, not Poland: Germany.   Many of our colleagues, when we meet in NATO Parliamentary Assembly  meetings, express concern about their own internal challenges to their  own democratic institutions.                                time  1415    And it is simply false that we are somehow selecting any particular  country. This is a concern expressed by virtually all; and we recognize  that we have got work to do in showing up and building democratic  institutions, even within the alliance; that we can't take it for  granted.   What we say is democracy is resilient, but it can also be fragile;  and that is what this reference is about, and would be recognized by  virtually every NATO member as such.   So while I certainly can understand Mr. Harris wanting to express a  concern, I would hope we have debunked it because it is nowhere even  close to being what he has characterized.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I think this is a really important resolution. It is also timely  because, as Mr. Boyle indicated, we have our next NATO Parliamentary  Assembly meeting in Athens this weekend; and if we are going to have  input to the strategic concept of NATO, which is being revised and will  be adopted next month, in May, we have got to have this in hand as an  expression, a bipartisan expression of the collective concern and  commitment of this body.   I am honored by the fact that this is bipartisan. It passed the House  Foreign Affairs Committee overwhelmingly, and I would hope that later  today we have a strong bipartisan vote on this resolution so we can  bring it to our deliberations in Athens and in Madrid in the next 2  months.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
