 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Jericho High  School for being granted an exclusive performance of ``Frozen.''   Jericho is one of 52 schools in the world, and the only one in New  York, to be selected by Disney to produce the musical. This impressive  performance by talented students is expected to include a snow machine,  a projector, puppetry, and even robotics. It will also feature songs  made famous by New York Third's very own Idina Menzel, who is the voice  of Elsa in the motion picture.   I wish the entire cast and crew of Jericho High School the best of  luck. As for Lauren Marchand, who is playing Elsa, it must be such an  honor to play her role model and mentor in this role. Break a leg.                            ____________________
