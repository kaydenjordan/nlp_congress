 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Frank  LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018.   Protecting the maritime jobs of the hardworking Washingtonians in the  second district of my State, including at Dakota Creek Industries in  Anacortes, is a priority of mine. The passage of this legislation  supports U.S. maritime defense policy and sustains a strong domestic  shipbuilding industry. It is a win as well for the hundreds of men and  women at Dakota Creek Industries, which is a key contributor to our  regional economy.   I appreciate the coordination with Senator Cantwell, Senator  Sullivan, and Representative  Don Young as we have worked for a year  and a half to find a path to save the hundreds of jobs at DCI.   I also want to thank my friend, Frank LoBiondo. It is fitting that  this bill is named for him, as he is a champion of all things  transportation. He has worked tirelessly for the people of New Jersey,  the people of his district, and for the people of this country to  ensure that we have an infrastructure system in this country that works  for all of them.   It has been an honor to serve with him for nearly two decades, and I  will miss the work of Representative Frank LoBiondo.
