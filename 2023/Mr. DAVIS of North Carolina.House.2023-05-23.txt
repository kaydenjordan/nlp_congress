 Mr. Speaker, defaulting on our debt is  not an option and would only cause economic uncertainty for eastern  North Carolina and rural America at a time when most are just trying to  break even.   According to recent reports, a default would kick nearly 96,000  families across the First District off of food and health programs at a  time when they can least afford it. It would also jeopardize benefits  that support nearly 50,000 veterans in my district, causing delays in  the delivery of care and poor health outcomes for our Nation's heroes.   A default that lasts as little as 6 weeks would result in nearly 7  million jobs lost, doubling the unemployment rate to 8 percent.   Mr. Speaker, we must focus on keeping America's full faith and credit  intact.                            ____________________
