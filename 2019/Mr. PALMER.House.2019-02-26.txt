 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, if this unanimous consent request, which  would prevent the killing of a living child, cannot be entertained, I  wonder what might be.
