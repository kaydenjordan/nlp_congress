 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and  honor the life of Reverend Marlene Faye Whiterabbit Helgemo.   Marlene was a powerful Ho-Chunk woman and strong leader recognized  nationally for her commitment to her faith and family and her  mentorship for so many.   When I was elected as one of the first two Native American women to  serve in Congress, she was standing right beside me.   I was proud to call her an inspiration and mentor. I am positive so  many others would say the same.   Her impact on our world and our lands goes far beyond her  recognitions, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention a few of them.   Marlene was the first Native American woman to be ordained in the  Lutheran Church. She was cofounder of the National Native American  Boarding Schools Healing Coalition, which is working to understand and  address the trauma created by the U.S. Indian boarding school policy.   Marlene leaves behind a legacy filled with love, compassion, and  service to our community. Our hearts are with her family: her husband,  Harvey; two daughters; and her grandchildren.   I am just one of many Ho-Chunks who will miss her sincerely, miss her  wisdom, and we say thank you to Marlene.                            ____________________
