 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3192) to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to  ensure access to mental health services for children  [[Page H5232]]  under the Children's Health Insurance Program, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3192         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(a) In General.--Section 2103(c)(1) of the Social Security       Act (42 U.S.C. 1397cc(c)(1)) is amended by adding at the end       the following new subparagraph:        ``(E) Mental health and substance use disorder services (as       defined in paragraph (5)).''.        (b) Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Services.--        (1) In general.--Section 2103(c) of the Social Security Act       (42 U.S.C. 1397cc(c)) is amended--        (A) by redesignating paragraphs (5), (6), (7), and (8) as       paragraphs (6), (7), (8), and (9), respectively; and        (B) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following new       paragraph:        ``(5) Mental health and substance use disorder services.--      Regardless of the type of coverage elected by a State under       subsection (a), child health assistance provided under such       coverage for targeted low-income children and, in the case       that the State elects to provide pregnancy-related assistance       under such coverage pursuant to section 2112, such pregnancy-      related assistance for targeted low-income women (as defined       in section 2112(d)) shall--        ``(A) include coverage of mental health services (including       behavioral health treatment) necessary to prevent, diagnose,       and treat a broad range of mental health symptoms and       disorders, including substance use disorders; and        ``(B) be delivered in a culturally and linguistically       appropriate manner.''.        (2) Conforming amendments.--        (A) Section 2103(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       1397cc(a)) is amended, in the matter before paragraph (1), by       striking ``paragraphs (5), (6), and (7)'' and inserting       ``paragraphs (5), (6), (7), and (8)''.        (B) Section 2110(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       1397jj(a)) is amended--        (i) in paragraph (18), by striking ``substance abuse'' each       place it appears and inserting ``substance use''; and        (ii) in paragraph (19), by striking ``substance abuse'' and       inserting ``substance use''.

(e) Effective Date.--        (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the amendments       made by this section shall take effect with respect to child       health assistance provided on or after the date that is one       year after the date of the enactment of this Act.        (2) Exception for state legislation.--In the case of a       State child health plan under title XXI of the Social       Security Act (or a waiver of such plan), which the Secretary       of Health and Human Services determines requires State       legislation in order for the respective plan (or waiver) to       meet any requirement imposed by the amendments made by this       section, the respective plan (or waiver) shall not be       regarded as failing to comply with the requirements of such       title solely on the basis of its failure to meet such an       additional requirement before the first day of the first       calendar quarter beginning after the close of the first       regular session of the State legislature that begins after       the date of enactment of this section. For purposes of the       previous sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year       legislative session, each year of the session shall be       considered to be a separate regular session of the State       legislature.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, last week the House advanced dozens of bills to help  save lives and stem the tide of the opioid crisis that has struck at  the health of our people wherever they live. We are back here again  this week to consider additional legislation that can help our  communities fight back against this epidemic.   We have all read the headlines about this tragedy, and we have heard  the stories firsthand across our respective districts. We are  confronting an addiction that mercilessly seizes control and then  destroys. This killer does not discriminate--not by age, not by race,  not by where you live or by what you believe.   Opioid addiction continues to take the lives of more than 100  Americans every single day. But it is what is behind the numbers that  really matters. These are real people. Their stories are real. They  tragically have lost their bright futures and left loved ones sadly  behind. So we have come together to advance legislation that will help  put a stop to this unprecedented crisis that has left a mark on just  about every family across America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation before  the House today--we have various bills--and throughout the course of  this week. We have an opportunity to save lives, and we have a  responsibility to our families, our friends, our communities, and our  Nation to lift people out of addiction and get America on a better  path.   The first bill up this afternoon, Mr. Speaker, is sponsored by our  colleague from Massachusetts, Representative Kennedy. It requires the  Children's Health Insurance Programs to cover comprehensive mental  health and substance use disorder services for pregnant women and  children.   State CHIP programs may be offered by expanding Medicaid, separate  programs that stand alone from Medicaid, or CHIP may be offered through  a combination of both approaches. Each of these types of Children's  Health Insurance Programs covers some mental health services, but not  all cover substance use disorder services. So there is a gap.   This bill requires the Children's Health Insurance Programs,  regardless of type, to cover mental health services, including  substance use disorder services. The bill requires States with separate  CHIP programs to monitor access to mental health and substance use  disorder services.   Finally, the bill requires States with separate CHIP programs to  ensure that mental health parity with group health plans is met.   Most CHIP programs already meet the standards in the bill. This is  simply a codification of current practices and does so without  additional costs. So it is important.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to be able to bring this bill to the  floor, and I congratulate my colleague from Massachusetts who brought  this issue to our attention.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on this matter. I  know the gentleman has yielded back. I will do the same after calling  on our colleagues to support this important and meaningful legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4005) to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to allow  for medical assistance under Medicaid for inmates during the 30-day  period preceding release from a public institution, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4005         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Medicaid Reentry Act''.       SEC. 2. PROMOTING STATE INNOVATIONS TO EASE TRANSITIONS                     INTEGRATION TO THE COMMUNITY FOR CERTAIN                     INDIVIDUALS.         (a) Stakeholder Group Development of Best Practices;       Medicaid Innovation Accelerator Program.--        (1) Stakeholder group best practices.--Not later than 6       months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Secretary of Health and Human Services shall convene a       stakeholder group of representatives of managed care       organizations, Medicaid beneficiaries, health care providers,       the National Association of Medicaid Directors, and other       relevant representatives from local, State, and Federal jail       and prison systems to develop best practices (and submit to       the Secretary and Congress a report on such best practices)       for States--        (A) to ease the health care-related transition of an       individual who is an inmate of a public institution from the       public institution to the community, including best practices       for ensuring continuity of health insurance coverage or       coverage under the State Medicaid plan under title XIX of the       Social Security Act, as applicable, and relevant social       services; and        (B) to carry out, with respect to such an individual, such       health care-related transition not later than 30 days after       such individual is released from the public institution.        (2) State medicaid program innovation.--The Secretary of       Health and Human Services shall work with States on       innovative strategies to help individuals who are inmates of       public institutions and otherwise eligible for medical       assistance under the Medicaid program under title XIX of the       Social Security Act transition, with respect to enrollment       for medical assistance under such program, seamlessly to the       community.        (b) Guidance on Innovative Service Delivery Systems       Demonstration Project Opportunities.--Not later than one year       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of       Health and Human Services, through the Administrator of the       Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, shall issue a State       Medicaid Director letter, based on best practices developed       under subsection (a)(1), regarding opportunities to design       demonstration projects under section 1115 of the Social       Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1315) to improve care transitions for       certain individuals who are soon-to-be former inmates of a       public institution and who are otherwise eligible to receive       medical assistance under title XIX of such Act, including       systems for, with respect to a period (not to exceed 30 days)       immediately prior to the day on which such individuals are       expected to be released from such institution--        (1) providing assistance and education for enrollment under       a State plan under the Medicaid program under title XIX of       such Act for such individuals during such period; and        (2) providing health care services for such individuals       during such period.        (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing under title XIX of the       Social Security Act or any other provision of law precludes a       State from reclassifying or suspending (rather than       terminating) eligibility of an individual for medical       assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act while       such individual is an inmate of a public institution.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, sponsored by Representative Tonko of New  York, Representative Turner of Ohio, and myself, requires the Secretary  of Health and Human Services to convene a stakeholder group that will  publish a report on best practices for how States can address the  health considerations of incarcerated individuals as they transition  back in our communities.   Mr. Speaker, the Kaiser Family Foundation reports that, in States  such as Connecticut and Massachusetts, 60 to 70 percent of inmates are  eligible for enrollment in Medicaid upon release.   According to 2002 data from the Department of Justice, about 68  percent of incarcerated individuals met the criteria for substance  dependence or abuse.   This bill requires CMS to issue best practices for improving  transitions back to the community, including systems for enrollment  support, substance use treatment, and related services for individuals  who are inmates of a public institution and who are eligible for  Medicaid, and CMS has to do that within a year after this bill is  enacted.   These best practices should help both Congress and the States get a  handle on how to help these incarcerated individuals get back on their  feet. That is our goal.   Mr. Speaker, my thanks to Mr. Tonko for his leadership on this issue,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on this bill. I  support it and encourage our colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5687) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to  require improved packaging and disposal methods with respect to certain  drugs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5687         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Opioids and Unused       Narcotics with Deliberate Disposal and Packaging Act of       2018'' or the ``SOUND Disposal and Packaging Act''.       SEC. 2.

(f) GAO Report.--Not later than 12 months after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United       States shall prepare and submit to the Congress a report       containing--        (1) a description of available evidence, if any, on the       effectiveness of site-of-use, in-home controlled substance       disposal products and packaging technologies;        (2) identification of ways in which such disposal products       intended for use by patients, consumers, and other end users       that are not registrants under the Controlled Substances Act,       are made available to the public and barriers to the use of       such disposal products;        (3) identification of ways in which packaging technologies       are made available to the public and barriers to the use of       such technologies;        (4) a description of Federal oversight, if any, of site-of-      use, in-home controlled substance disposal products,       including--        (A) identification of the Federal agencies that oversee       such products;        (B) identification of the methods of disposal of controlled       substances recommended by these agencies for site-of-use, in-      home disposal; and        (C) a description of the effectiveness of such       recommendations at preventing the diversion of legally       prescribed controlled substances;        (5) a description of Federal oversight, if any, of       controlled substance packaging technologies, including--        (A) identification of the Federal agencies that oversee       such technologies;        (B) identification of the technologies recommended by these       agencies, including unit dose packaging, packaging that       provides a set duration, or other packaging systems that may       mitigate abuse or misuse; and        (C) a description of the effectiveness of such       recommendations at preventing the diversion of legally       prescribed controlled substances; and        (6) recommendations on--        (A) whether site-of-use, in-home controlled substance       disposal products and packaging technologies require Federal       oversight and, if so, which agencies should be responsible       for such oversight and, as applicable, approval of such       products or technologies; and        (B) the potential role of the Federal Government in       evaluating such products to ensure product efficacy.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan legislation,  and I want to thank Representatives Hudson and Butterfield, both of  North Carolina, for their hard work on it.   Opioids are often prescribed in higher volumes than necessary and not  properly disposed of after patients no  [[Page H5236]]  longer need them. That leads to an oversupply of unneeded drugs that  can be subject to abuse by family members and others.   In order to reduce the volume of unused opioids in the market, this  bill will direct the Food and Drug Administration to work with  manufacturers to establish programs for the efficient return or  destruction of unused schedule II or III opioid analgesics.   In addition, this bill will facilitate utilization of packaging that  may reduce overprescribing, diversion, or abuse of opioids.   Finally, the bill will require the GAO to study new and innovative  technologies that claim to be able to dispose of opioids and other  unused medications safely.   This bill takes several targeted steps to minimize the amount of  unused opioids on the market, and I encourage my colleagues to support  its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Hudson), one of the authors of this important  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers on this  legislation. I encourage my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5796) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to provide grants for eligible entities to provide technical assistance  to outlier prescribers of opioids, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5796         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(c) Application.--Each eligible entity seeking to receive a       grant, contract, or cooperative agreement under subsection       (a) shall submit to the Secretary an application, at such       time, in such manner, and containing such information as the       Secretary may require.        (d) Geographic Distribution.--In awarding grants,       contracts, and cooperative agreements under this section, the       Secretary shall prioritize establishing technical assistance       resources in each State.        (e) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Eligible entity.--The term ``eligible entity'' means--        (A) an organization--        (i) that has demonstrated experience providing technical       assistance to health care professionals on a State or       regional basis; and        (ii) that has at least--         (I) one individual who is a representative of consumers on       its governing body; and        (II) one individual who is a representative of health care       providers on its governing body; or         (B) an entity that is a quality improvement entity with a       contract under part B of title XI of the Social Security Act       (42 U.S.C. 1320c et seq.).

SEC. 3. PROMOTING VALUE IN MEDICAID MANAGED CARE.         Section 1903(m) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       1396b(m)) is amended by adding at the end the following new       paragraph:        ``(7)(A) With respect to expenditures described in       subparagraph (B) that are incurred by a State for any fiscal       year after fiscal year 2025 (and before fiscal year 2029), in       determining the pro rata share to which the United States is       equitably entitled under subsection (d)(3), the Secretary       shall substitute the Federal medical assistance percentage       that applies for such fiscal year to the State under section       1905(b) (without regard to any adjustments to such percentage       applicable under such section or any other provision of law)       for the percentage that applies to such expenditures under       section 1905(y).        ``(B) Expenditures described in this subparagraph, with       respect to a fiscal year to which subparagraph (A) applies,       are expenditures incurred by a State for payment for medical       assistance provided to individuals described in subclause       (VIII) of section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i) by a managed care entity,       or other specified entity (as defined in subparagraph       (D)(iii)), that are treated as remittances because the       State--        ``(i) has satisfied the requirement of section 438.8 of       title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor       regulation), by electing--        ``(I) in the case of a State described in subparagraph (C),       to apply a minimum medical loss ratio (as defined in       subparagraph (D)(ii)) that is at least 85 percent but not       greater than the minimum medical loss ratio (as so defined)       that such State applied as of May 31, 2018; or        ``(II) in the case of a State not described in subparagraph       (C), to apply a minimum medical loss ratio that is equal to       85 percent; and        ``(ii) recovered all or a portion of the expenditures as a       result of the entity's failure to meet such ratio.        ``(C) For purposes of subparagraph (B), a State described       in this subparagraph is a State that as of May 31, 2018,       applied a minimum medical loss ratio (as calculated under       subsection (d) of section 438.8 of title 42, Code of Federal       Regulations (as in effect on June 1, 2018)) for payment for       services provided by entities described in such subparagraph       under the State plan under this title (or a waiver of the       plan) that is equal to or greater than 85 percent.        ``(D) For purposes of this paragraph:        ``(i) The term `managed care entity' means a medicaid       managed care organization described in section       1932(a)(1)(B)(i).        ``(ii) The term `minimum medical loss ratio' means, with       respect to a State, a minimum medical loss ratio (as       calculated under subsection (d) of section 438.8 of title 42,       Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on June 1, 2018))       for payment for services provided by entities described in       subparagraph (B) under the State plan under this title (or a       waiver of the plan).        ``(iii) The term `other specified entity' means--        ``(I) a prepaid inpatient health plan, as defined in       section 438.2 of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (or       any successor regulation); and        ``(II) a prepaid ambulatory health plan, as defined in such       section (or any successor regulation).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleague Representative  Fitzpatrick, who is here on the floor with us today, as well as  Representative Curbelo and Representative Thompson. They all worked  very hard to make this bipartisan legislation a success.   H.R. 5796 would establish technical assistance grants to make best  practices available to those providers who are identified as opioid- prescribing outliers. This bill would establish a means of identifying  statistical outliers and then notifying providers if they are an  outlier.   In addition, the bill authorizes quality improvement organizations  and other grant recipients to review prescribing patterns and to share  educational materials and best practices. This legislation will ensure  that best prescribing practices are clinically appropriate for patients  and are implemented throughout the Medicare program.                                          House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                       Washington, DC, June 7, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: On May 9 and 17, 2018, the Committee       on Energy and Commerce ordered favorably reported over 50  [[Page H5238]]       bills to address the opioid epidemic facing communities       across our nation. Several of the bills were also referred to       the Committee on Ways and Means.        I ask that the Committee on Ways and Means not insist on       its referral of the following bills so that they may be       scheduled for consideration by the Majority Leader:        H.R. 1925, At-Risk Youth Medicaid Protection Act of 2017;        H.R. 3331, To amend title XI of the Social Security Act to       promote testing of incentive payments for behavioral health       providers for adoption and use of certified electronic health       record technology;        H.R. 3528, Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act;        H.R. 4841, Standardizing Electronic Prior Authorization for       Safe Prescribing Act of 2018;        H.R. 5582, Abuse Deterrent Access Act of 2018;        H.R. 5590, Opioid Addiction Action Plan Act;        H.R. 5603, Access to Telehealth Services for Opioid Use       Disorder;        H.R. 5605, Advancing High Quality Treatment for Opioid Use       Disorders in Medicare Act;        H.R. 5675, To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act       to require prescription drug plan sponsors under the Medicare       program to establish drug management programs for at-risk       beneficiaries;        H.R. 5684, Protecting Seniors from Opioid Abuse Act;        H.R. 5685, Medicare Opioid Safety Education Act;        H.R. 5686, Medicare Clear Health Options in Care for       Enrollees (CHOICE) Act;        H.R. 5715, Strengthening Partnerships to Prevent Opioid       Abuse Act;        H.R. 5716, Commit to Opioid Medical Prescriber       Accountability and Safety for Seniors (COMPASS) Act;        H.R. 5796, Responsible Education Achieves Care and Healthy       Outcomes for Users' Treatment (REACH OUT) Act of 2018;        H.R. 5798, Opioid Screening and Chronic Pain Management       Alternatives for Seniors Act;        H.R. 5804, Post-Surgical Injections as an Opioid       Alternative Act; and        H.R. 5809, Postoperative Opioid Prevention Act of 2018.        This concession in no way affects your jurisdiction over       the subject matter of these bills, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bills be necessary, I would support your       request to have the Committee on Ways and Means on the       conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include       this letter and your response in the bill reports and the       Congressional Record.        Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the       extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over       matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further       opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: Thank you for your letter concerning       several bills favorably reported out of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce to address the opioid epidemic and which       the Committee on Ways and Means was granted an additional       referral.        As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       within these bills that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction       of the Committee on Ways and Means, I agree to waive formal       consideration of the following bills so that they may move       expeditiously to the floor:        H.R. 1925, At-Risk Youth Medicaid Protection Act of 2017;        H.R. 3331, To amend title XI of the Social Security Act to       promote testing of incentive payments for behavioral health       providers for adoption and use of certified electronic health       record technology;        H.R. 3528, Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act;        H.R. 4841, Standardizing Electronic Prior Authorization for       Safe Prescribing Act of 2018;        H.R. 5582, Abuse Deterrent Access Act of 2018;        H.R. 5590, Opioid Addiction Action Plan Act;        H.R. 5603, Access to Telehealth Services for Opioid Use       Disorder;        H.R. 5605, Advancing High Quality Treatment for Opioid Use       Disorders in Medicare Act;        H.R. 5675, To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act       to require prescription drug plan sponsors under the Medicare       program to establish drug management programs for at-risk       beneficiaries;        H.R. 5684, Protecting Seniors from Opioid Abuse Act;        H.R. 5685, Medicare Opioid Safety Education Act;        H.R. 5686, Medicare Clear Health Options in Care for       Enrollees (CHOICE) Act;        H.R. 5715, Strengthening Partnerships to Prevent Opioid       Abuse Act;        H.R. 5716, Commit to Opioid Medical Prescriber       Accountability and Safety for Seniors (COMPASS) Act;        H.R. 5796, Responsible Education Achieves Care and Healthy       Outcomes for Users' Treatment (REACH OUT) Act of 2018;        H.R. 5798, Opioid Screening and Chronic Pain Management       Alternatives for Seniors Act;        H.R. 5804, Post-Surgical Injections as an Opioid       Alternative Act; and        H.R. 5809, Postoperative Opioid Prevention Act of 2018.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation and requests your support for       such a request.        Finally, I would appreciate your commitment to include this       exchange of letters in the bill reports and the Congressional       Record.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), one of the authors of  this important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their bipartisan  support of this legislation.   We also were just notified not long ago about the appropriations  flag, and we are working out those matters at a higher pay level. So,  we appreciate and understand.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5605) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to  provide for an opioid use disorder treatment demonstration program, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5605         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing High Quality       Treatment for Opioid Use Disorders in Medicare Act''.       SEC. 2. OPIOID USE DISORDER TREATMENT DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.         Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et       seq.) is amended by inserting after section 1866E (42 U.S.C.       1395cc-5) the following new section:       ``SEC. 1866F. OPIOID USE DISORDER TREATMENT DEMONSTRATION                     PROGRAM.         ``(a) Implementation of 4-year Demonstration Program.--        ``(1) In general.--Not later than January 1, 2021, the       Secretary shall implement a 4-year demonstration program       under this title (in this section referred to as the       `Program') to increase access of applicable beneficiaries to       opioid use disorder treatment services, improve physical and       mental health outcomes for such beneficiaries, and to the       extent possible, reduce expenditures under this title.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Representative Ruiz, Representative  Clark, and Representative Mullin; they all worked together to make this  bipartisan bill a success.   This bill would authorize a 4-year demonstration project to test new  ways to treat opioid use disorder among the Medicare population.   In addition, this bill will help secure the prescribing of controlled  substances in Medicare by requiring the use of e-prescribing. Pretty  important work.   We have heard from providers that have not only cut down on the abuse  of fraudulent prescriptions by switching to e-prescribing but also have  saved time for themselves and their nurses, all while saving millions  of dollars in the process. So these are really important, substantive  steps forward, another piece of the puzzle in addressing the opioid  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                       Washington, DC, June 7, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: On May 9 and 17, 2018, the Committee       on Energy and Commerce ordered favorably reported over 50       bills to address the opioid epidemic facing communities       across our nation. Several of the bills were also referred to       the Committee on Ways and Means.        I ask that the Committee on Ways and Means not insist on       its referral of the following bills so that they may be       scheduled for consideration by the Majority Leader:        H.R. 1925, At-Risk Youth Medicaid Protection Act of 2017;        H.R. 3331, To amend title XI of the Social Security Act to       promote testing of incentive payments for behavioral health       providers for adoption and use of certified electronic health       record technology;        H.R. 3528, Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act;        H.R. 4841, Standardizing Electronic Prior Authorization for       Safe Prescribing Act of 2018;        H.R. 5582, Abuse Deterrent Access Act of 2018;        H.R. 5590, Opioid Addiction Action Plan Act;        H.R. 5603, Access to Telehealth Services for Opioid Use       Disorder;        H.R. 5605, Advancing High Quality Treatment for Opioid Use       Disorders in Medicare Act;        H.R. 5675, To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act       to require prescription drug plan sponsors under the Medicare       program to establish drug management programs for at-risk       beneficiaries;        H.R. 5684, Protecting Seniors from Opioid Abuse Act;        H.R. 5685, Medicare Opioid Safety Education Act;        H.R. 5686, Medicare Clear Health Options in Care for       Enrollees (CHOICE) Act;        H.R. 5715, Strengthening Partnerships to Prevent Opioid       Abuse Act;        H.R. 5716, Commit to Opioid Medical Prescriber       Accountability and Safety for Seniors (COMPASS) Act;        H.R. 5796, Responsible Education Achieves Care and Healthy       Outcomes for Users' Treatment (REACH OUT) Act of 2018;        H.R. 5798, Opioid Screening and Chronic Pain Management       Alternatives for Seniors Act;        H.R. 5804, Post-Surgical Injections as an Opioid       Alternative Act; and        H.R. 5809, Postoperative Opioid Prevention Act of 2018.        This concession in no way affects your jurisdiction over       the subject matter of these bills, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bills be necessary, I would support your       request to have the Committee on Ways and Means on the       conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include       this letter and your response in the bill reports and the       Congressional Record.        Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the       extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over       matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further       opportunities to work with you this Congress.

Finally, I would appreciate your commitment to include this       exchange of letters in the bill reports and the Congressional       Record.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5811) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with  respect to postapproval study requirements for certain controlled  substances, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5811         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. POSTAPPROVAL STUDY REQUIREMENTS.         (a) Purposes of Study.--Section 505(o)(3)(B) of the Federal       Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(o)(3)(B)) is       amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(iv) To assess a potential reduction in effectiveness of       the drug for the conditions of use prescribed, recommended,       or suggested in the labeling thereof if--         ``(I) the drug involved--         ``(aa) is or contains a substance for which a listing in       any schedule is in effect (on a temporary or permanent basis)       under section 201 of the Controlled Substances Act; or        ``(bb) is a drug that has not been approved under this       section or licensed under section 351 of the Public Health       Service Act, for which an application for such approval or       licensure is pending or anticipated, and for which the       Secretary provides notice to the sponsor that the Secretary       intends to issue a scientific and medical evaluation and       recommend controls under the Controlled Substances Act; and         ``(II) the potential reduction in effectiveness could       result in the benefits of the drug no longer outweighing the       risks.''.         (b) Establishment of Requirement.--Section 505(o)(3)(C) of       the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.       355(o)(3)(C)) is amended by striking ``such requirement'' and       all that follows through ``safety information.'' and       inserting the following: ``such requirement--        ``(i) in the case of a purpose described in clause (i),       (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (B), only if the Secretary       becomes aware of new safety information; and        ``(ii) in the case of a purpose described in clause (iv) of       such subparagraph, if the Secretary determines that new       effectiveness information exists.''.

(d) New Effectiveness Information Defined.--Section       505(o)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21       U.S.C. 355(o)(2)) is amended by adding at the end the       following new subparagraph:        ``(D) New effectiveness information.--The term `new       effectiveness information', with respect to a drug that is or       contains a controlled substance for which a listing in any       schedule is in effect (on a temporary or permanent basis)       under section 201 of the Controlled Substances Act, means new       information about the effectiveness of the drug, including a       new analysis of existing information, derived from--        ``(i) a clinical trial; an adverse event report; a       postapproval study or clinical trial (including a study or       clinical trial under paragraph (3));        ``(ii) peer-reviewed biomedical literature;        ``(iii) data derived from the postmarket risk       identification and analysis system under subsection (k); or        ``(iv) other scientific data determined to be appropriate       by the Secretary.''.        (e) Conforming Amendments With Respect to Labeling       Changes.--Section 505(o)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and       Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(o)(4)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (A)--        (A) in the heading, by inserting ``or new effectiveness''       after ``safety'';        (B) by striking ``safety information'' and inserting ``new       safety information or new effectiveness information such'';       and        (C) by striking ``believes should be'' and inserting       ``believes changes should be made to'';        (2) in subparagraph (B)(i)--        (A) by striking ``new safety information'' and by inserting       ``new safety information or new effectiveness information'';       and        (B) by inserting ``indications,'' after ``boxed       warnings,'';        (3) in subparagraph (C), by inserting ``or new       effectiveness information'' after ``safety information''; and        (4) in subparagraph (E), by inserting ``or new       effectiveness information'' after ``safety information''.        (f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in the amendments made       by this section shall be construed to alter, in any manner,       the meaning or application of the provisions of paragraph (3)       of section 505(o) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act       (21 U.S.C. 355(o)) with respect to the authority of the       Secretary of Health and Human Services to require a       postapproval study or clinical trial for a purpose specified       in clauses (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (B) of such       paragraph (3) or paragraph (4) of such section 505(o) with       respect to the Secretary's authority to require safety       labeling changes.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to speak in favor of this bipartisan bill and  thank Representative McNerney and Representative Griffith for working  so hard to advance this important policy.   Currently, there are limited data on the long-term efficacy of  opioids, their increased addictive tendencies over time, and their  overall place in the treatment of pain. This legislation will enhance  the Food and Drug Administration's authorities and enforcement tools to  ensure timely post-marketing studies for chronically administered  opioids.   Collecting and analyzing data is the best way to ensure that patients  and physicians have access to evidence-based treatments. This bill will  advance our understanding of the science underlying long-term use of  opioids, and I encourage my colleagues to support its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I especially appreciate the work of the sponsors of this  bill, including Representative Griffith, who would be here with us to  speak in favor of this legislation but for traffic congestion on his  way back from his district that has detained him from getting here as  he had previously scheduled.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.
