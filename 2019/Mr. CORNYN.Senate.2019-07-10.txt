 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the previously scheduled vote at 11 o'clock, I be  allowed to complete my remarks before that vote occurs.    Mr. President, throughout my career, dating back to my  days as Texas attorney general, I have long been a proud advocate for  crime victims' rights. I believe we all have a responsibility to  provide men and women impacted by such traumatic events the resources  and care they need when they need it.   Right now the Congress has an opportunity to pass two separate pieces  of legislation to support victims of sexual assault and domestic  violence. Sadly, both bills have been caught in the crosshairs of  political jockeying in the House, with Democrats using a tit-for-tat  strategy that has frozen both bills.   One of those bills is called the Debbie Smith Act. The namesake of  this legislation is a woman whom I have had the honor of working with  many times over the years. She is a fierce advocate for victims of  sexual assault.   Like so many victims, her advocacy was born from a personal  experience. In 1989, she was abducted from her home and raped in a  wooded area. She reported the crime to police and went to the emergency  room for a forensic examination, but there were no immediate answers.  Though exact numbers are difficult to estimate, some experts believe  that there are hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits that remain  across the United States.   For 6\1/2\ years the DNA evidence of Debbie's attacker sat on a shelf  in an evidence locker while she constantly wondered who her attacker  was and when he would appear again. Channeling that fear and  frustration, Debbie made it her mission in life to eliminate the rape  kit backlog. I have no doubt that because of her and the important  legislation this Congress has passed for the past 15 years, we were  making some pretty incredible progress toward her goal.   In 2004, the Debbie Smith Act was signed into law to provide State  and local crime labs with the resources to end the backlog of unsolved  crimes. More than $1 billion has been provided to these forensic labs  because of this law, and the legislation passed by the Senate in May  will provide even greater resources for the program.   While the original purpose of the legislation was to reduce the rape  kit backlog, this DNA evidence serves multiple purposes. It enables law  enforcement to identify and convict people who commit other violent  crimes and takes more criminals off the street. It also has a  corresponding benefit for the wrongfully accused. It can actually  exclude people based on the DNA test results in the forensic rape kit.   Because of the Debbie Smith Act, more than 860,000 DNA cases have  been  [[Page S4748]]  processed, and 360,000 DNA profiles have been uploaded into the FBI's  database. This accounts for 43 percent of all forensic profiles in the  FBI's DNA database. The benefits of this law cannot be overstated. That  is why the Debbie Smith Act was easily reauthorized in both 2008 and  2014.   Now it is time once again to reauthorize this important legislation.  Earlier this year, Senator Feinstein and I introduced the Debbie Smith  Act of 2019, which reauthorizes the important funding that supports the  testing of this DNA evidence. Things like training for law enforcement,  correctional officers, training for forensic nurses and other  professionals who assist victims of sexual assault are also included in  this bill. When the Senate voted in May, not a single Senator voted  against it--not one. It was unanimous. But here we are nearly 2 months  later and the House of Representatives hasn't lifted a finger.   The bill isn't partisan. It is not divisive. It is not controversial.  So why do they refuse to bring the bill up for a vote? Well, they are  not holding this bill up because they are working on a different  version or because they disagree with any of the provisions or because  they simply don't like it. No, they are actually holding it hostage to  try to force a vote on their ultrapartisan version of the Violence  Against Women Act, or VAWA, the second piece of legislation they are  stopping. Actually, Democrats allowed the current Violence Against  Women Act to expire over Republican objections so that they could  maintain this leverage to pass their ultrapartisan version of VAWA  sometime later.   Folks on both sides of the aisle can agree it is time to make some  important improvements in VAWA, and our colleague Senator Ernst from  Iowa has been working very hard to try to come up with a good  bipartisan bill. It deserves to be reauthorized and strengthened to  ensure victims have access to the services and protections they need.   Going through the regular order is something I support, and it is an  effort that has been led by, as I said, Senator Ernst from Iowa. But  the version of the bill that has passed in the House is a far cry from  any kind of consensus legislation. It includes provisions that would  never pass in the Senate, and that is why it passed the House, in order  to create that conflict and that obstacle.    It is not fair to Debbie Smith and other victims of sexual assault  for House Democrats to hold them hostage over a separate bill that is  still being negotiated in good faith by Members on both sides of the  aisle.   Despite repeated requests from advocates and victims' rights groups  to pass the Debbie Smith Act freestanding, the House has, once again,  chosen to play politics.   I understand Debbie has requested to meet with leadership in the  House, and I strongly encourage them to take the time to talk to Debbie  and hear her perspective on why this legislation is so critical and why  it must be passed now. House Democrats refuse to pass the Debbie Smith  Act and help crime labs eliminate the rape kit backlog. They refuse to  negotiate in good faith on VAWA, Violence Against Women Act,  reauthorization and what that might look like. Unfortunately, they have  succumbed to the temptation of playing partisan politics with pretty  important legislation and hurting a lot of innocent people in the  meantime. I find that absolutely unacceptable.   I would urge our colleague Speaker Pelosi to bring the Debbie Smith  Act up for a vote and quit using sexual assault victims as a bargaining  chip.   I yield the floor.                      nomination of t. kent wetherell ii     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, today I ask unanimous consent that a  resolution passed by the senate of the State of Texas be printed into  the Congressional Record. Senate Resolution No. 816 was adopted by the  Texas Senate on May 24, 2019, by a vote of 31-0 and urges the U.S.  Congress to consolidate disaster recovery housing funding for Hurricane  Harvey.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             Senate Resolution         Whereas, Hurricane Harvey struck the Texas coast on August       25, 2017, causing an estimated $125 billion in damage; and        Whereas, The second most destructive storm in American       history, the hurricane impacted approximately 30 percent of       the population of Texas, destroying homes, damaging       infrastructure, and displacing thousands of families along       the coast; and        Whereas, The Federal Emergency Management Agency received       nearly 800,000 applications from affected Texans for some       form of assistance; as many as 83 percent of the people whose       homes flooded did not have flood insurance, creating       unprecedented demand for state and federal disaster recovery       assistance; and        Whereas, The FEMA application process is so duplicative and       confusing, and the United States Department of Housing and       Urban Development regulations are so complex, that many       survivors give up trying to navigate the system and,       therefore, receive no assistance; and        Whereas, Consolidating funding for recovery housing       programs into a single Disaster Housing Response and Recovery       Block Grant would increase efficiency, save taxpayer dollars,       and speed the recovery process by combining FEMA's short-term       programs and HUD's long-term programs; Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the Senate of the State of Texas, 86th       Legislature, hereby respectfully urge the United States       Congress to enact legislation to consolidate disaster       recovery housing funding into a single Disaster Housing       Response and Recovery Block Grant; and be it further        Resolved, That the secretary of the senate forward official       copies of this resolution to the president of the United       States, to the president of the Senate and the speaker of the       House of Representatives of the United States Congress, and       to all the members of the Texas delegation to Congress with       the request that this resolution be entered in the       Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the       United States of America.        I hereby certify that the above Resolution was adopted by       the Senate on May 24, 2019, by the following vote: Yeas 31,       Nays 0.                                                       Dan Patrick,                                           President of the Senate.                                                        Patsy Spaw,                                           Secretary of the Senate.      [State Seal Affixed]                            ____________________
