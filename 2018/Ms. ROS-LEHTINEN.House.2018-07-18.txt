 Mr. Speaker, following the Castro playbook, Evo  Morales has taken systematic steps to curtail the basic rights of the  people of Bolivia and solidify his legacy to maintain his evil grip on  power.   Evo Morales has ruled Bolivia for over 12 years and expects to do so  indefinitely. Two years ago, he imposed a constitutional referendum to  eliminate presidential term limits so that he could run for yet another  term, his fourth term, in 2019.   After a resounding ``no'' vote from the people of Bolivia, this thug  turned to the courts, which he totally controls, to stomp on the will  of the people. The courts sided with him--what a surprise--and went as  far as declaring that Morales' indefinite reelection is a human right.  What an insult that is to the Bolivian people and to all of us who  cherish true democratic ideals.   Just like Castro, Evo Morales also continues to clamp down on the  opposition, sending his national police to deploy repressive tactics  and silence dissent brutally. Just last month, his henchmen killed a  young student from the Public University in the city of El Alto, where  students peacefully protested, calling for additional resources for  their university.   The latest State Department human rights report states that Morales'  power over the judicial system, the denial of a fair and timely public  trial, and prosecutions of political opponents are at the top of his  human rights abuses, his greatest hits.   It is no wonder that over 1,200 Bolivian political exiles are now  living in Brazil, Peru, Paraguay, Spain, and here in our wonderful  country, including my lovely south Florida community.   Mr. Speaker, Evo Morales' anti-imperialist rhetoric, expelling all of  our agencies--DEA, USAID, and the U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia--and his  coziness with rogue regimes are just further proof of the threat his  regime poses for the stability and security of our allies in our  hemisphere and beyond.   Using Bolivia's status as a nonpermanent member of the United Nations  Security Council, Morales has sided with Syria and its abysmal human  rights record; undermined our ally, the democratic Jewish State of  Israel; and consistently attacked the United States and our efforts to  uphold and promote the values of freedom and democracy in the region  and around the world.   Simply put, Morales is no friend of democratic values, and just like  the dictatorships in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, his regime has  solidified control at the expense of the people and our own national  security interests.   The Bolivian people need our help, Mr. Speaker, and we must start  paying attention to what is happening right here in our own hemisphere.                     Honoring the Life of Robert Traurig     Mr. Speaker, I was saddened to hear of the passing  of Robert Traurig, a revered leader who helped build south Florida and  someone who Dexter and I proudly called a dear friend. Bob passed away  recently, but he left an incredible legacy of legal brilliance and  leadership in our community.   Founder of Greenberg Traurig in 1967, which is now one of the world's  top and largest law firms, Bob was an expert zoning lawyer who helped  develop Miami-Dade County into the metropolitan area that it is today.  [[Page H6469]]    Bob was influential in expanding Brickell Avenue and Coconut Grove,  areas which I proudly represent and are central residential communities  that also attract thousands of visitors every year. He also led efforts  for the development of the Florida Grand Opera and Performing Arts  Center Foundation, among many other enterprises.   Bob constantly fought for the best interests of his clients and our  communities, and the mark he left on south Florida is evidence of his  remarkable passion. Bob Traurig's work to develop Miami-Dade County, in  addition to his charitable and philanthropic spirit, will become the  lasting legacy of this dedicated leader.   Farewell, my friend.                            ____________________
