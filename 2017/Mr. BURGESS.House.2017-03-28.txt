 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 230 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 230         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (S.J.       Res. 34) providing for congressional disapproval under       chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule       submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating       to ``Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and       Other Telecommunications Services''. All points of order       against consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The       joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the joint resolution are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce; and (2) one motion to commit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 230 provides for a rule to  consider a Congressional Review Act resolution which will undo a  duplicative regulation put into place by the previous administration in  the final hours of that Presidency.   The rule brings before the House this resolution so that Congress may  remove through the proper legislative process rules promulgated by  bureaucrats who remain unaccountable to the American people. This  process allows those who are accountable--the elected Representatives  in Congress--to fight for our constituents' rights and liberties.   House Resolution 230 provides for a closed rule for the Congressional  Review Act resolution, S.J. Res. 34, the standard procedure for such  resolutions, since the sole purpose of the resolution is to remove a  regulation from the Federal Register.  [[Page H2479]]                                     time  1315    The rule allows for 1 hour of debate, equally divided between the  chair and ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.  Further, the minority is afforded the customary motion to commit.   The Federal Communications Commission issued its Open Internet Order,  reclassifying broadband providers as common carriers, which brought  them under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission.  The Federal Trade Commission is the primary regulator of companies'  privacy and data security practices; however, the Federal Trade  Commission's regulatory authority under section 5 of the Federal Trade  Commission Act does not extend to common carriers. Therefore, the  reclassification of broadband internet service providers as common  carriers created a legal enforcement gap.   The Federal Communications Commission determined that the privacy  provisions of the Communications Act would now apply to broadband  internet service providers and that new and expanded privacy rules were  necessary. Therefore, the Federal Communications Commission promulgated  new privacy rules for common carriers on October 27, 2016. These rules  were adopted a mere 10 days before the 2016 Presidential election. They  were adopted on a party-line vote and over serious objections by the  minority Commission members and the internet service providers. The  Federal Communications Commission's rules are a departure from the  privacy protections that have been applied by the Federal Trade  Commission for years.   The Federal Trade Commission employs an opt-out model that requires  companies to provide consumers notice of the data that is collected and  how it will be used. Consumers are then given the option to opt out of  this data collection if they so choose. Instead of implementing well- established collection practices that are accepted industrywide, the  Federal Communications Commission chose to promulgate an opt-in model  for its new internet service providers. This model prohibits broadband  internet service providers from using, disclosing, or providing access  to customer proprietary information without the customer's affirmative  opt-in consent. Such data includes browsing history, application usage,  and location data, among other types of information.   While this may sound like a good thing to opt in to, in reality, it  unfairly skews the market in favor of providers that already have  access to consumer information. For example, search engines, social  media sites, and internet content providers like Netflix, Google,  Facebook, Amazon, and Apple, these providers, known as edge providers,  are free to collect consumer data that broadband internet service  providers, under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications  Commission, are not. The ability to provide consumer data drives the  digital advertising market.   The Federal Communications Commission's privacy rules arbitrarily  treat internet service providers differently from the rest of the  internet, amounting to government intervention in the free market. The  Federal Communications Commission stated that the rules would provide  more transparency, the rules would provide more choice, the rules would  provide more protection; however, these expanded provisions may also  result in more frequent breach notifications, leading to a weaker focus  on security by consumers who do suffer from notification fatigue.   While the Federal Communications Commission's privacy rules were  meant to protect consumers, they actually can inhibit security and  market competition while creating confusion by subjecting parts of the  internet ecosystem to different rules and different jurisdictions. To  correct this policy, on March 23, 2017, the Senate passed S.J. Res. 34,  a Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval to nullify the  privacy rulemaking promulgated by the Federal Communications  Commission.   Prior to the reclassification of broadband internet service providers  as common carriers under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications  Commission, the Federal Trade Commission regulated companies' privacy  practices while preserving the Federal Communications Commission's  authority to enforce privacy obligations of broadband service providers  on a case-by-case basis.   This Congressional Review Act will restore the status quo that  existed prior to the Federal Communications Commission's Open Internet  Order and bring the privacy practices of all parts of the internet back  into balance. Not only will this level the playing field for an  increasingly anticompetitive market, but it will ensure parity in the  protection of consumer data.   The new Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Ajit Pai,  has called to halt the Federal Communications Commission's privacy  rules. He stated: ``All actors in the online space should be subject to  the same rules. . . . The Federal Government shouldn't favor one set of  companies over another.'' This is precisely the type of limited  government that we should be striving for after years of overreaching  by the previous administration and its regulations. The Congressional  Review Act protects consumers, and it restores the free market  competitiveness that actually allows our economy to thrive.   The Congressional Review Act is an important tool in maintaining  accountability at the Federal level. Its necessity has never been more  apparent than over the past 2 months, where this Congress has needed to  step in and remove burdensome, unbalanced regulations put in place by  the prior administration and their team just as they were walking out  the door.   House Republicans today will stand up for the rights of our  constituents against the out-of-control Federal bureaucracy. I urge my  colleagues to support today's rule and the underlying Congressional  Review Act resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, to bring us back to the business at hand, which is the  rule allowing the vote on the Congressional Review Act later today, I  want to quote now from the web page of the Federal Trade Commission,  under the title of Protecting Consumer Privacy. Reading from their  website:         The Federal Trade Commission has been the chief Federal       agency on privacy policy and enforcement since the 1970s when       it began enforcing one of the first Federal privacy laws--the       Fair Credit Reporting Act. Since then, rapid changes in       technology have raised new privacy challenges, but the       Federal Trade Commission's overall approach has been       consistent. The agency uses law enforcement, policy       initiatives, and consumer and business education to protect       consumers' personal information and ensure that they have the       confidence to take advantage of the many benefits of an ever-      changing marketplace.    This is from the ftc.gov website.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the web page of the Federal  Trade Commission.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the men and women of the Federal  Trade Commission for all the work they have done over the years in  protecting our privacy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  [[Page H2482]]    Mr. Speaker, just to put some things in context, I wanted to share  some information from a blog called redstate.com, posted by Seton  Motley, on March 27, 2017, talking about the difference between the  size and scope of edge providers versus the ISPs, the internet service  providers. The parent company of one of the largest edge providers is  valued at over $500 billion. He points out in his blog post, by way of  comparison, the nation of Singapore's gross domestic product, the  entire output for every man, woman, and child in a very productive  country is $508 billion. Basically, the same. So the edge provider  stands on equal financial footing of the world's 40th richest country.   By way of contrast, the Nation's largest internet service provider  has a net worth of $148 billion. So the edge provider is more than  three and a half times larger than the Nation's largest ISP.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.   I think we can begin to see the scope of the problem and why  unbalancing this playing field is inherently a bad idea.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I apparently do not have any additional  speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   I include in the Record an op-ed from The Wall Street Journal from  March 1, 2017, by Jeff Flake, a member of the other body. The title of  the op-ed is ``Settling a Bureaucratic Turf War in Online Privacy  Rules.''                [From The Wall Street Journal, Mar. 1, 2017]          Settling a Bureaucratic Turf War in Online Privacy Rules                              (By Jeff Flake)         When you shop online from your tablet or browse the       internet on your smartphones, you expect your personal data       to be secure. Technology companies invest billions of dollars       on data security to protect consumer privacy.        Privacy is also a cornerstone of consumer protection, with       federal enforcement agencies striking an appropriate balance       between innovation and security in their regulations. But       just as a flawed line of code can render a new firewall       program useless, the new privacy rules that were rushed       through in the waning days of the Obama administration risk       crashing our longstanding privacy-protection regime.        For two decades, the Federal Trade Commission has been       America's sole online privacy regulator. Under the FTC's       watch, our internet and data economy has been the envy of the       world. The agency's evidence-based approach calibrates       privacy and data-security requirements to the sensitivity of       information collected, used or shared online, and applies       protections in a consistent and evenhanded way across       business sectors. Consumer behavior demonstrates the success       of the FTC's regulatory approach: Each day people spend more       time engaging in online activities.        But in 2015, in a bid to expand its own power, the Federal       Communications Commission short-circuited the effectiveness       of the FTC's approach by reclassifying internet service       providers as common carriers, subject to Title II of the       Communications Act.        In taking that unprecedented action, the FCC unilaterally       stripped the FTC of its traditional jurisdiction over ISPs.       The FTC can no longer police the privacy practices of       providers, leaving us with a two-track system under which the       FCC applies its own set of rules for ISPs while the FTC       monitors the rest of the internet ecosystem.        Even after the 2015 power grab, the FCC could have simply       adopted as its own the FTC's successful sensitivity-based       model of privacy regulation. Instead--after last year's       election--the FCC finalized privacy regulations that deviate       extensively from the FTC framework in several key respects.        The FCC rules subject all web browsing and app usage data       to the same restrictive requirements as sensitive personal       information. That means that information generated from       looking up the latest Cardinals score or checking the weather       in Scottsdale is treated the same as personal health and       financial data.        The new rules also restrict an ISP's ability to inform       customers about innovative and cost-saving product offerings.       So much for consumer choice.        The FCC's overreach is a dangerous deviation from       successful regulation and common-sense industry practices.       But don't just take my word for it. The FTC concluded that       the FCC's decision to treat ISPs differently from the rest of       the internet ecosystem was ``not optimal--agency-speak for       ``a really bad idea.''        Outside of the FTC's well-founded concerns, the new rules       are also a departure from bipartisan agreement on the need       for consistent online privacy rules. President Obama noted in       2012 that ``companies should present choices about data       sharing, collection, use, and disclosure that are appropriate       for the scale, scope, and sensitivity of personal data in       question at the time of collection.'' In other words, privacy       rules should be based on the data itself.        But that's not how the FCC sees it. The commission's rules       suffocate industry and harm consumers by creating two       completely different sets of requirements for different parts       of the internet.        To protect consumers from these harmful new regulations, I       will soon introduce a resolution under the Congressional       Review Act to repeal the FCC's flawed privacy rules. While       the resolution would eliminate those rules, it would not       change the current statutory classification of broadband       service or bring ISPs back under FTC jurisdiction. Instead,       the resolution would scrap the FCC's newly imposed privacy       rules in the hope that it would follow the FTC's successful       sensitivity-based framework.        This CRA resolution does nothing to change the privacy       protections consumers currently enjoy. I hope Congress and       the FCC will continue working together to address issues of       concern down the road. However, it is imperative for rule-      making entities to stay in their jurisdictional lanes. We       need to reject these harmful midnight privacy regulations       that serve only to empower bureaucrats and hurt consumers.     I want to read from a couple of the lines from this op- ed. The Senator states here: ``Privacy is also a cornerstone of  consumer protection, with Federal enforcement agencies striking an  appropriate balance between innovation and security in their  regulations. But just as a flawed line of code can render a new  firewall program useless, the new privacy rules that were rushed  through in the waning days of the Obama administration risk crashing  our longstanding privacy-protection regime.''   Continuing to quote here: ``For two decades, the Federal Trade  Commission has been America's sole online privacy regulator. Under the  FTC's watch, our internet and data economy has been the envy of the  world. The agency's evidence-based approach calibrates privacy and  data-security requirements to the sensitivity of information collected,  used or shared online, and applies protections in a consistent and  evenhanded way across business sectors. Consumer behavior demonstrates  the success of the FTC's regulatory approach: Each day people spend  more time engaging in online activities.''   Now, continuing to quote here: ``The FCC's overreach is a dangerous  deviation from successful regulation and commonsense industry  practices. But don't take my word for it. The FTC concluded that the  FCC's decision to treat ISPs differently from the rest of the internet  ecosystem was `not optimal'--agencyspeak for `a really bad idea.' ''   One final quote from Senator Flake's op-ed: ``This CRA resolution  does nothing to change the privacy protections consumers currently  enjoy. I hope Congress and the FCC will continue working together to  address issues of concern down the road. However, it is imperative for  rulemaking entities to stay in their jurisdictional lanes. We need to  reject these harmful midnight privacy regulations that serve only to  empower bureaucrats and hurt consumers.''   Mr. Speaker, today's rule provides for the consideration of a  critical Congressional Review Act resolution to repeal a duplicative  Federal regulation dropped on the doorstep of the American people in  the last hours of the previous administration. The rule the House will  be voting on today to repeal would create uncertainty and chaos  surrounding the protection of people's privacy online.   I want to thank Mrs. Blackburn of Tennessee, the chairwoman of the  Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communication and Technology, for  her work on this critical issue.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and vote ``yes'' on  the underlying resolution.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 230 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       305) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require       the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presidents and       certain candidates for the office of the President, and for       other purposes. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Oversight and       Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be  [[Page H2486]]       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 305.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
