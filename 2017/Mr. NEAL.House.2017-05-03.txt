 Mr. Speaker, I thank Judge Hastings for yielding.   The previous question I offer with Congresswoman Slaughter would  prevent any legislation from being considered if the legislation would  deny coverage or require higher premiums for preexisting conditions,  increase costs for seniors for prescription drugs, or reduce Medicare  solvency.   I have listened to the previous three speakers on the Republican side  talk about national defense. That is understandable, but might we, for  the purpose of this discussion, also acknowledge the following: real  national defense also means providing health security for members of  American families. That is part of the balance that we should be  recognizing.   The priorities on the other side are the following: they are going to  turn the issue of preexisting condition back to a voluntary nature at  the State level.   As one who comes from local government, we should recognize the  following: every time there is an economic downturn, you can be certain  that Governors are going to use the money that was intended for health  care to balance the budgets, and they are going to call it good  management.   They are undermining the health security of the American people with  their proposal on TrumpCare.                                time  1315    They have been threatening to eliminate coverage for millions of  Americans for years, and now they are telling us they are on the eve of  accomplishing just that.   But what does it mean for the American family? They want to go back  to the days when you could be denied routine health insurance because  you might have been born with diabetes, you might have had a liver  transplant in midlife, you might have had a diagnosis of cancer in  midlife, and you can no longer be insured despite the fact that you  have spent a lifetime paying those premiums? And we are going to make  this an option of the States to decide? This is going backwards on the  issue of health security.   But that is not enough, as we know. They also are going to ask you to  pay more for hospital care, more for prescription drugs, more for  mental health and substance abuse treatment, more for pediatric care,  and certainly more for cancer care. And they are going to call this an  improvement in health care delivery?   Well, their recent improvements have made it clear. Let's not forget  the previous bill had an underlying $1 trillion tax giveaway that would  drain $75 billion from the Medicare trust fund and cut $840 billion  from Medicaid, all for the purpose of providing a $1 trillion tax cut  to the people at the very top.    Fewer covered, higher costs, and fewer protections for the  American family. The previous question that Louise Slaughter and I are  going to offer is the following:   We would prevent any of this legislation that is proposed that would  be considered harmful to the consumers, as the Republican bill is.  Americans need assurance about health care and, by the way, some  predictability.   During my time of service here, I have seen how difficult it is to do  health insurance. I think there is only one person in Washington, by  the way, who said: Who knew health insurance could be this complicated?   Well, for those of us who have served here for any extended period of  time, I can assure you, we all knew that health care was complicated in  terms of delivery and economic consequence. But that is not enough for  our friends today. They want to change the basic tenet of the guarantee  of ending preexisting conditions.   I had a Republican friend I talked to yesterday. He said: I wish I  was still back in the House because I would vote against that bill. He  said: My daughter had a liver transplant, and now they are saying, with  preexisting conditions, it is going to be up to the Governor of a State  to decide whether or not she can continue to get care? We need the  guarantee of Medicare coupled with the expansion of Medicaid, which has  now offered insurance to 24 million Americans that didn't have  insurance prior to the Affordable Care Act.   I would say this as well. And remember, half of that number, that is  private insurance. We kept the private sector alive for the purpose of  offering discipline to price. It has accomplished that. Healthcare  spending in America has plateaued.   But, again, on this occasion, we won't let the facts get in the way  of a rigid ideology that says we need to change the Affordable Care Act  because Barack Obama offered it. That is what the test is now for the  American people: Who sponsored legislation?    We have debated health care since Harry Truman was  President. We have debated health care since Lyndon Johnson offered  Medicare and Medicaid. Bob Dole and Mitt Romney and Richard Nixon all  understood you needed the mandate to provide health care to all members  of the American family. They are going to shun that today and tomorrow  by turning their backs on preexisting conditions. Remember, real  national defense also means providing health care for members of the  American family.
