 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 717, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $1,064,000)''.        Page 718, line 15, after the first dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $1,064,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Meng) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chair, this amendment seeks to increase funding for the  Women's Bureau within the Department of Labor by slightly more than $1  million and would decrease funding for the Bureau of Labor Statistics'  Prices and Cost of Living Division by the same amount.   This increase would restore the proposed cut the underlying bill  would make to DOL's Women's Bureau while still allowing the BLS Prices  and Cost of Living Division to be funded at almost $3.5 million above  the current enacted funding level and more than half a million dollars  over the President's request for the coming fiscal year.   For those who might be unaware, the Women's Bureau within the  Department of Labor conducts research to help departmental agencies  develop policies that advance the interests of working women. It plans  and executes research and advises other agencies on the structure and  implementation of a wide range of worker programs.   Unfortunately, the President's budget request for next fiscal year  sought to cut more than three-quarters of the existing staff within the  Bureau as well as almost $9 million. Thankfully, this bill does better  than the request. My simple hope is that we can go one small step  further and fund this program next year at the level it is currently  funded at. That is all my amendment seeks to do.   I urge my colleagues to support funding for the Women's Bureau within  the Department of Labor at existing funding levels while offsetting  this change with funds in a manner that still permits the BLS Prices  and Cost of Living Division to be funded almost $3.5 million above the  current enacted level and almost half a million above the President's  request.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support for this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I want to reiterate the importance of the  Department of Labor Women's Bureau. I believe that our government,  especially, should have whatever advice, suggestions, and research that  is needed to help all departmental agencies develop policies that  further advance the interests of working women. Women currently in our  country make, on average, 77 cents to every dollar that a man makes,  and that amount is even lower for women of color. This Bureau would  work on issues surrounding equal pay, employment rights of pregnant  women and women who are breastfeeding in the workplace, paid family  leave, and apprenticeships for women and women of color.   These are important issues, and our government needs to do better,  and I believe Members of both parties should care about this issue.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Lowey).    Mr. Chairman, again, I urge support for this amendment. My  amendment simply seeks to fund this program next year at the level it  is currently funded at.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 139 Offered by Mr. Foster    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 139  printed in House Report 115-297.  [[Page H7282]]         Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman  from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham), and I have an amendment  at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 734, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.        Page 770, line 18, after the first dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $5,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Meng) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to encourage my colleagues to support  my amendment, which simply increases funding for the Behavioral Health  Workforce and Training program by $5 million. This is a reasonable show  of support for this important program, which saw its funding cut in  half in this bill.   The Behavioral Health Workforce and Training program supports  education and training for careers in behavioral health at institutions  of higher education and through professional and paraprofessional  training programs, with a focus on rural and medically underserved  communities. This program was created as part of the 21st Century Cures  Act in response to the significant nationwide shortage of behavioral  health providers.   According to SAMHSA, 55 percent of U.S. counties do not have a  practicing behavioral health provider, and 77 percent of counties  reported unmet behavioral health needs. These statistics would be  alarming at any time, but they are particularly concerning in the midst  of a national opioid epidemic.   A 2016 Surgeon General's Report found that only 10 percent of people  with a substance abuse disorder receive any type of specialty  treatment. Additionally, 60 percent of adults with a mental illness  didn't receive mental health services in the previous year.   This lack of access to services has severe consequences for the  individuals seeking treatment, their families, and  [[Page H7283]]  our communities. When they don't have access to treatment, individuals  with behavioral health needs receive a whole different set of services.  Jails and sometimes emergency rooms become the de facto behavioral  health system.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to make this important investment in  the behavioral health workforce, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 734, line 10, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $4,000,000)''.        Page 770, line 18, after the first dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $4,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Meng) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chair, this amendment seeks to increase funding for  HRSA's Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program by $4 million,  restoring program funding to the current enacted level.   I am thankful to the chairman for the funding amount already provided  for in this bill, but I am hopeful that we can go one step further and  fully fund this program again in the coming fiscal year.   The Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program improves healthcare for  older Americans by providing clinical training opportunities to  students, medical faculty and providers, direct service workers,  patients, families, and caregivers that integrate geriatric and primary  care delivery systems.   In the 2015-2016 academic year, grantees provided training to 18,451  students and fellows participating in a variety of geriatrics-focused  degree programs, field placements, and fellowships. Of these trainees,  11,824 graduated or completed their training during the most recent  academic year, and grantees partnered with 365 hospitals, long-term  care facilities, and academic institutions to provide clinical training  experiences to trainees.   America's population is aging, and it is imperative that new  generations of healthcare professionals and providers have the skills  needed to care for older Americans. Every person in this Chamber at  some point in their life will wish their healthcare provider had this  training. I hope we will all recognize that fact today and do what is  prudent.   I hope we will unanimously support this amendment, plan for the  future healthcare of our Nation, and restore funding to the HRSA  Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program account.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, this amendment requires that the program  be fully funded. I do look forward to working with the chairman, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
