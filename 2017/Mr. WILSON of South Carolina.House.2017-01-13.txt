 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Mac  Thornberry for yielding. I appreciate the gentleman's positive  leadership as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.   I am grateful to endorse this selection of General Jim Mattis for  Secretary of Defense and, based on his extraordinary background,  believe a waiver is appropriate. General Mattis' recent experience in  the Middle East makes him uniquely qualified to address the threats to  servicemembers overseas and American families at home. I am confident  that, through his position, General Mattis will continue the great  traditions of civilian control of the military, delivering peace  through strength.   My personal perspective of appreciation of General Mattis is as the  grateful son of a World War II Flying Tiger who served in India and  China, as the son-in-law of a Marine who received the Navy Cross for  Okinawa service, as a 31-year veteran myself of the Army Reserve and  Army National Guard, with four sons who have served in the military, as  Army Field Artillery in Iraq, as a Navy doctor in Iraq and Italy, as a  signal officer in Egypt, as an engineer in Afghanistan, and with an Air  Force nephew serving in Iraq.   In his testimony before the Senate yesterday reaffirming the European  Reassurance Initiative from the Baltics to Bulgaria, General Mattis  spoke bluntly about the readiness crisis facing our military, and we  are eager to work with him on the critical task of rebuilding our  national defense to promote peace through strength.   Simultaneously, bipartisan endorsements, to me personally, from his  fellow Marines confirm he is the right person at the right time.   General Mattis' swift confirmation is crucial to continuity for our  ongoing military operations and protecting American families. I urge my  colleagues to support the waiver for General Mattis.
