 Mr. President, I am going to strongly urge opposition to  this amendment.  [[Page S10068]]    To be honest, this amendment uses terms that are not traditionally  used in the immigration code, so it is really pretty hard to understand  what the impact is going to be.   If the intent is for these transportation restrictions to apply to  asylum seekers, then the amendment effectively ends the asylum program  for everyone. I am, frankly, not sure there is even Republican  consensus to do that.   If it is not meant to apply to asylum seekers, then the strange  drafting has really bad--probably unintended--consequences.   For instance, if an individual were here on a student visa and they  committed a serious crime, this amendment doesn't seem to allow for  that individual to be transported for the purposes of removal because  they aren't here unlawfully. That is all to say that this amendment  really isn't ready for prime time, and I would urge its rejection.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6559    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the  amendment.
