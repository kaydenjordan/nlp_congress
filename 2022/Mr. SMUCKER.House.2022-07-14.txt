 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an exceptional  student athlete from my congressional district.   Darren Cammauf, a recent graduate of Manheim Township School  District, distinguished himself in track and field this past season,  ultimately winning the 400-meter dash held at the Pennsylvania Track  and Field Coaches Association Indoor State Championship earlier this  year.   A leading member of the Blue Streak Track and Field team, Cammauf had  a successful senior season as well.   He set a new school record for the best time in the 400-meter race.  At the Lancaster-Lebanon League Championships, Darren won the 400- and  200-meter dashes as well as led the 1,600-meter relay team to victory.  He capped his senior season off with a third-place victory in the 400- meter dash at the PIAA Class 3A competition.   Darren will be attending St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia to  continue  [[Page H6514]]  his competition in track and field and to pursue a degree in business.   Mr. Speaker, I would also be remiss if I did not recognize Darren's  two biggest cheerleaders: his mother, Erica, and his father, Nicholas,  who serves as a senior constituent advocate assisting residents of  Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District.    I congratulate Darren on his success this year. We are all very proud  of his accomplishments and look forward to seeing what he accomplishes  next.                            ____________________
