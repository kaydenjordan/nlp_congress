 Madam Speaker, from Oxford, Michigan, to Uvalde, Texas,  [[Page H5433]]  Americans have seen more than 240 mass shootings in just 158 days. In  the past week, a pregnant woman was shot at a picnic in Saginaw,  Michigan, and a young boy was shot in Flint.   It does not have to be this way.   America is the only developed country in the world where this type of  gun violence happens every single day.   And that is why I support these commonsense efforts to expand red  flag laws; to raise the purchasing age for some semiautomatic weapons  to 21 years of age; to crack down on gun trafficking and straw  purchases; to address ghost guns, untraceable guns without serial  numbers that can be bought and assembled at home; to restrict high- capacity magazines; and to ban bump stocks, devices that turn  semiautomatic rifles into automatic weapons, into a machine gun.   I wrote this legislation back in 2017 after a mass shooter in Las  Vegas was able to fire over 1,000 rounds in just mere minutes, killing  60 people.   While no single law will stop every tragedy, we can do what we can,  and that is why I support this important legislation. I am glad the  House passed it. The Senate should take it up now.                            ____________________
