 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this morning, I am going to announce my  decision on Judge Jackson's nomination to the Supreme Court. I will  oppose her, and I will vote no.   My decision is based upon her record of judicial activism, flawed  sentencing methodology regarding child pornography cases, and a belief  Judge Jackson will not be deterred by the plain meaning of the law when  it comes to liberal causes.   I find Judge Jackson to be a person of exceptionally good character,  respected by her peers, and someone who has worked hard to achieve her  current position. However, her record is overwhelming in its lack of a  steady judicial philosophy and a tendency to achieve outcomes in spite  of what the law requires or commonsense would dictate.   After a thorough review of Judge Jackson's record and information  gained at the hearing from an evasive witness, I now know why Judge  Jackson was the favorite of the radical left, and I will vote no.   In the area of child pornography, there has been an explosion in this  country of child pornography on the internet. In 2021, groups that  follow sexual abuse of children on the internet reported 29.3 million  reports of individuals accessing information regarding child  pornography on the internet. It has gone from 100,000 in 2003 to 29.3  million in 2021.   It is estimated that there is 85 million images and videos and other  files involving sexually exploited children on the internet.   Now, why is this important?   This is the venue of choice for the child pornographer. It is not the  mail. As you can see, the internet is where these people go. In a  matter of minutes, they can download hundreds, if not thousands, of  images and videos of the most disgusting abuse of children; and my goal  is to deter that, not discount it.   Judge Jackson's sentencing methodology, in my view, misses the mark.  I don't doubt that, personally, she is offended by the behavior that we  are all  [[Page S1878]]  talking about, but as a judge, she has an opportunity to deter the  behavior of going on the internet and downloading images of exploited  children. Every time she has that opportunity, she refuses to exercise  it.   Now, why is Judge Jackson's sentencing so different?   In possession cases, she gives 29.2 months, and the average  nationally is 68 months. In the distribution of child pornography, her  sentence is 71.9 months, and the minimum is 60 months. That is what you  have to give. The average nationally, they tell me, is 135 months. The  length of sentence for the possession of child pornography imposed by  Judge Jackson is 57 percent less than the national average. In the area  of distribution, it is 40 percent less than the national average.   Why?   Under the sentencing guidelines, judges, if they choose, can enhance  the sentence based on the fact that the perpetrator used the internet.   Now, why do we want that as a sentencing enhancement?   We want to deter the use of the internet when it comes to child  pornography because there are already 85 million images and videos of  children being abused, and that is the venue of choice. So, instead of  deterring that behavior, Judge Jackson routinely says that she will not  hold that against a perpetrator.   I think that is a mistake. She basically said: It is so easy, in a  matter of minutes, to push a button and download a bunch of files. That  seems, to me, to be an unfair way to sentence somebody.   She also takes off the table a sentence enhancement for the number or  the volume of child pornography being possessed or distributed.   I think that is absolutely backward. I think what we should be doing  is that every time you mash the button and download an image of a child  being exploited, your time in jail should go up. That should be held  against you. Accessing the internet should be deterred, not ignored.   What I have to say is that the National Center for Missing and  Exploited Children released a report on the 2020 data. There has been a  35-percent increase in child sex abuse material in a single year, 29.3  million reports last year of people accessing child pornography on the  internet, and at least 85 million images and files on the internet.   When it comes time to sentence these people, Judge Jackson will not  impose additional punishment on the fact of the volume involved and the  fact they are using the internet, the venue of choice.   The more you download, the more you go to jail, is my view. I am  going to work with Senator Hawley to correct these practices. I think  she is making a terrible mistake by not enhancing sentences based on  the volume because every click of the computer is destroying a life. We  should be deterring the use of the internet when it comes to child  pornography. Judge Jackson chooses not to. When it comes to the volume,  that should be held against you. The more you abuse children, the more  in your possession, the more you distribute, the longer you go to jail.   The reason her numbers are so low is due to that sentencing  methodology. I think, if we don't fix this, we are making the problem  worse. I think her approach to this issue is absolutely wrong; it loses  all deterrence. I will be watching like a hawk future nominees who are  in the sentencing business to see if they follow this model.   The model Judge Jackson has created is one wherein the more you do,  it doesn't matter. The fact that you use the internet where all the  child pornography lies is not held against you, and I believe it should  be. Every click, every download means you go to jail longer in the  world that I want to create.   The other area of concern is Guantanamo Bay. Remember this? This is  9/11.   Guantanamo Bay has been a place to house enemy combatants captured in  the war on terror. Judge Jackson was a public defender, I think, for  four or five GTMO detainees, and that is a noble thing. I have no  problem with somebody--a public defender anywhere in the country-- defending very unpopular people, and people at GTMO deserve  representation.   What I found during this representation is that her amicus briefs in  the defense of GTMO detainees accused President Bush and his team of  being war criminals. That is not defending somebody charged or held as  an enemy combatant as being part of the enemy force. That is an  accusation against your own government that, I think, buys into the  language of the left.   You can vigorously defend anyone captured as an enemy combatant or  who is potentially charged with a crime against terrorism. That is a  noble thing. Yet, when you use the language that was in her brief--and  she said: ``Well, I really don't remember that''--I have a hard time  believing that you put your name on a brief that calls the President of  the United States and his team war criminals. That is not about  defending somebody; that is an activist approach to the war on terror.   It goes further. In her legal briefs, she wanted to deny the United  States the ability to hold GTMO detainees under the law of war  indefinitely. There are about 37 or 38 GTMO detainees still being held  who have never been charged. We know, through the intel and the  evidence, that they are hardened killers committed to the jihadist  cause. Under the law of war, once their habeas petition has been  reviewed by the Federal courts--where the courts agree with the  government that the person is, in fact, an enemy combatant--under the  law of war, there is no requirement to release him, but Judge Jackson  took the position as an advocate that we could not hold them  indefinitely, creating a dilemma whereby you have to charge them with a  crime or let them go.   I don't consider these people criminals as much as warriors in the  cause to destroy our way of life. If you choose to charge them with a  crime, fine; but you don't have to make that choice. The reason that  there are 30-plus still in detention is we have chosen--Republicans and  Democrats--to hold these people off the battlefield. If we had accepted  Judge Jackson's legal reasoning, that tool would not have been  available to us as a nation, and it would have compromised our ability  to defend ourselves.   I think that approach was the most extreme view of representation in  this area, and I think it shows a lack of understanding of the war in  which we are in. We are not fighting criminals. These are not wayward  goat herders. These are people committed to the jihadist cause and  would kill us all if they could.   Before I leave GTMO, 31 percent of the people who have been detained  since the beginning of the war have gone back to the fight--I will  introduce that at the hearing next week--and some of the senior  leadership of the current Taliban government were GTMO detainees who  have now not only gone back to the fight but have actually gone back to  serve in the Taliban government that is reining oppression on the  Taliban people.   So, to those who think this is a crime we are fighting, you are  wrong. It is a war for the survival of good against evil.   Immigration--in case you haven't noticed, this country is being  invaded by illegal immigrants. Right after taking office, President  Biden rolled back virtually every policy of President Trump's regarding  asylum and deportation. He basically destroyed the regime created by  President Trump that gave us the lowest number of illegal crossings in  this country in 30 or 40 years at the end of 2020. Now, every week, we  are setting new records.   Why?   The policies that existed during the Trump administration worked.  They are being reversed by President Biden, and we are being  overwhelmed, and the worst is yet to come. If the Biden  administration--the CDC--does away with the ability to deport illegal  immigrants under title 42 of the public health law, presenting a threat  to COVID, then you will see the numbers go up even further. There will  be thousands--18,000 to 20,000 people a day--coming across our border  from countries with low vaccination rates. So, when it comes to illegal  immigration, policy matters.    When Judge Jackson was a district court judge, there was a case  brought by Make the Road New York, et al., v. McAleenan, who was the  Acting DHS  [[Page S1879]]  Secretary under President Trump. The group Make the Road New York was  an Arabella activist group. This is kind of a holding company, for lack  of a better word--an umbrella group--funded by George Soros and a bunch  of other liberal billionaires. This group in that chain, in receiving  money from these folks, filed a lawsuit, arguing against the Trump  decision to deport, under expedited immigration authority, people who  have been here 2 years or less. In changing the Obama policy and  actually fully implementing the authority given to the DHS Secretary,  they decided to go the full 2 years. Anybody here 2 years and under in  the category in question could be deported with expedited procedure-- meaning, it was a quick turnaround.   This was the authority given by the Congress to the DHS Director.  Obama didn't use that authority fully. Trump decided to do it. Make the  Road New York, et al.--a bunch of liberal groups--sued the Trump policy  change. Judge Jackson was the judge, and she overruled the Trump  decision. The statute in question says that the Secretary has the  ``sole and unreviewable discretion'' to use expedited deportation for  people here 2 years or less. The statute could not have been written  any clearer.   If you are looking for what an activist judge is all about, this is  the case, exhibit A.   The law was written in the most clear terms, saying the decision of  the Secretary's is unreviewable and solely in their hands when it comes  to using expedited removal procedures for people here 2 years or less.  She ruled against the Trump administration. She basically said this was  arbitrary and capricious; it reeked of bad faith; and it ``[showed]  contempt for the authority that the Constitution's Framers have vested  in the judicial branch.''   That contempt she is talking about was a congressional act. The  congressional act was designed to tell judges that the DHS Secretary  has discretion in this area, solely and unreviewable. She found that  concept offensive. Instead of following the plain letter of the law,  she did legal gymnastics to find against the Trump administration.   When she says the statute ``[created] contempt for the authority that  the Constitution's Framers have vested in the judicial branch,'' what  she is saying is, I will be damned if I am going to be limited by a  congressional act that tells me I can't do what I want to do.   The plaintiff in that case was from the radical left. She ruled for  them in spite of the plain meaning of the statute, and she was  overturned by the DC Circuit court.   The court said--and this is a fairly liberal court:         There could hardly be a more definitive expression of       Congressional intent to leave the decision about the scope of       expedited removal, within statutory bounds, to the       Secretary's independent judgment. The ``forceful phrase `sole       and unreviewable discretion' '' by its exceptional terms,       heralds Congress's judgment to commit the decision       exclusively to agency discretion.    She ignored the plain meaning of the statute, the language of the  statute, to get a result she wanted, and the DC District Court of  Appeals said that there could hardly be a more defended expression of  congressional intent.   That is judicial activism on steroids, and it makes managing our  immigration problem even worse when you have activist judges who ignore  the law and take discretion away, given by Congress to the executive  branch, because they don't like the outcome. That is, in fact, the  premier definition of judicial activism. I find, in her judging a  desire to get an outcome and no matter what she has to do to get that  outcome, she will pursue it. This is a case where you couldn't have  written a statute more clearly, and she did. She just went around it,  got the results she wanted, and got slapped down on appeal.   Now, she is the first African-American female slated to go to the  Supreme Court. She, however, is not the first African-American female  who had potential to be on the Supreme Court.    Janice Rogers Brown was nominated by President Bush 43 to be on the  DC Circuit Court of Appeals--one of the premier appellate courts--like  Judge Jackson was nominated to. She is from Alabama. She was the  daughter and granddaughter of sharecroppers, growing up in Alabama  during the Jim Crow era. She moved to California as a teenager, and she  wound up serving on the California Supreme Court. She was a single  mother raising children.   In June 2005, she was confirmed to the DC court in a 56-to-43 vote.  That was after the Gang of 14 broke a filibuster by my Democratic  colleagues against her and others. She was nominated in 2003, and her  nomination was stalled for 2 years.   Here is what Senator Schumer said:         Judge Brown was the least worthy pick this president has       made for the appellate court, and that's based on her record.    Senator Durbin in 2005:         One of the [President's] most ideological and extreme       judicial nominees.    In 2005:         If the President sends us a nominee who, like Janice Rogers       Brown, believes that the New Deal was the triumph of a       ``socialist revolution,'' there will be a fight.    Here is what then-Senator Biden said about Janice Rogers Brown. Not  only did he filibuster her, he said: ``I can assure you that would be a  very, very difficult fight, and she probably would be filibustered'' if  she were nominated to the Supreme Court.   So, to my Democratic colleagues, as you celebrate Judge Jackson's  potential ascension to the Court, as those of us on the committee who  asked penetrating, relevant questions of Judge Jackson's judicial  philosophy, how she sentenced people and why--you know, the liberal  media that is completely in the tank on issues like this sat on the  sidelines and watched you, my Democratic colleagues, stop the ascension  of an African-American conservative nominee by President Bush. When it  came to her potential of being on the Supreme Court, you threatened to  filibuster her. You considered her ideology unacceptable and too  conservative.   So if you are a conservative nominee of color, a woman, it is OK to  use your ideology against you. If you question the ideology and the  judging ability of a liberal African-American nominee, you are a  racist. Those days are over for me. So I have very little respect for  what is going on in modern America when it comes to judging.   Miguel Estrada was nominated by President Bush 43--a highly qualified  man, Hispanic--to be on the Court, and he fell victim to the wholesale  filibuster of Bush nominees in the 2003 era. He didn't make it through  the Gang of 8. Judge Janice Rogers Brown got on the Court--2 years  delayed, and when she was being considered to go on the Court, Joe  Biden, Senator Joe Biden, said she will be filibustered very, very  likely.   So we live in a world where, if you are a person of color, a woman,  and you are conservative, everything is fair game. If you are a person  of color and liberal, how dare anybody question or use the same  standard against you that was used against the other nominees? I don't  accept that.   Finally, about the hearing itself, to the liberal media, comparing  this hearing to Judge Kavanaugh's is an absolute offense. Nobody on the  Republican side held information back, accusing Judge Brown of doing  something that was either made up, not credible. Nobody questioned her  high school annual. Nobody took a bunch of garbage and made it seem  like the nominee had been Bill Cosby in his teenage years. Crazy stuff.  Offensive stuff.   What we did ask Judge Jackson is, Why do you sentence the people the  way you do? Explain the reasoning in the cases involving child  pornography. We went after her judicial philosophy, and it had to be  contentious because the judge seldom would answer a question. But to  me, if you are going to be nominated to the Supreme Court for a  lifetime appointment, you should expect to be asked hard questions. You  should not expect to have your life destroyed. And if you don't see a  difference between the two hearings, then you are blinded by your  desire to get an outcome.    Here is where we are in 2022: The only person qualified to go to the  Supreme Court as an African-American woman is a liberal. You can be  equally qualified as a conservative, but you need not apply because  your ideology disqualifies you. That is not exactly the advancement I  was hoping we would have in America in 2022.   So, Judge Jackson, I will vote no.   I find her sentencing methodology to reinforce and take deterrence of  the most heinous offenses off the table.  [[Page S1880]]  The statements she made during the sentencing hearings showed a tilted  sense of compassion. I am sure she doesn't like the behavior and feels  sorry for the kids, but every time she had a chance to increase  punishment for the volume of material in the hands of the perpetrators,  she chose not to do that, and I think she should. Going to the  internet, to her, and downloading a bunch of files was too easy to  enhance punishment? Well, it is just too easy to destroy lives.   So when it comes to immigration, it is the most egregious case I have  ever seen, quite frankly, of a judge ignoring the plain meaning of the  law to get a result they wanted. When it comes to the War on Terror, I  think the position she wanted our country to take would make us less  safe. The language of the left in her briefs of calling Bush a war  criminal says more about the politics than it does the merit of the  argument.   So now, I know why Judge Jackson was the preferred pick of the  radical left. Now, I know why they went after Michelle Childs, somebody  I could have supported--even though she had been liberal--a highly  qualified, sensible, commonsense person. Now, I know. Now, I understand  better. And that is why I am voting no.   To my Democratic colleagues, I will work with you when I can, but  this is a bridge too far.   Thank you.
