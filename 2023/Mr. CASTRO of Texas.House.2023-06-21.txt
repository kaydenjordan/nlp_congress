 Mr. Speaker, Adam Schiff did his job. That is  why they are trying to censure him today.   Mr. Speaker, he held a mirror up to today's Republican Party, and  they can't stand the ugliness. Instead, they want to protect the most  corrupt, indicted, and perhaps soon-to-be-convicted President of the  United States.   We should vote ``no'' on this censure resolution.
