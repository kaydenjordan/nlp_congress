 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut.  Certainly I am happy he is bringing to the attention of the Senate this  critical issue of the future of the Supreme Court and the impact it  will have on families across America. Certainly, when it comes to  something as basic as our health insurance, we understand this.   There are forces at work in Washington in the Trump administration  that are trying to put an end to the Affordable Care Act, and in  Congress, many Members of Congress--the House and the Senate--have  voted 60 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We barely saw it  survive just a few months ago when Senator John McCain, in the middle  of the night, came and stood in that well and voted no, along with two  other Republican Senators. They saved the Affordable Care Act.   Most Americans had their own questions about the Affordable Care Act  and how important it was, but they couldn't understand how the  Republicans would come to us and say ``Get rid of it'' and have no  replacement.   We realize, as the Senator from Connecticut just explained, that  under the old rules with insurance companies, under the old rules, many  of us were victims. If you had someone with a preexisting condition in  your family--perhaps you had diabetes, perhaps your child was a cancer  survivor, had asthma, or so many different things--health insurance was  very expensive, if you could get it. We changed the law. We said: You  can't discriminate against an American because someone in their family  has had a preexisting condition. Everybody is in the same pool in  America. We are going to join together.   Well, now the Trump administration has said they are going to fight  that in court. They are going to try to declare it unconstitutional to  protect people with preexisting conditions, so they filed a brief in a  lawsuit--a lawsuit that is wending its way to the Supreme Court. When  the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Murphy, came before us and talked  about the new nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, it is  important that he focused on the impact it could have on ordinary  people.   Most Americans, put to the test, couldn't name the Justices on the  U.S. Supreme Court. Well, they know it is a big Court, an important  Court, the highest Court in the land, but they don't know who is there  until we get into this kind of debate. As we do, people tend to learn a  lot more about the Justices and what their core beliefs are.   When it comes to Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who now sits on the DC  Circuit Court of Appeals, he has a lengthy record--12 years of opinions  as a judge, not to mention all the years before that when he was active  politically in Washington, DC. Senator Murphy of Connecticut is correct  to note that his approach to the law and his approach to the  Constitution do not give us great hope in preserving the protections on  health insurance that are part of the Affordable Care Act. One decision  by that Supreme Court could undo years of legislative work and  literally remove protections from families. We are talking about that  today. We should be talking about that today. But it isn't what we are  voting on today, and that is why I have come to the floor.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island, as  well as those who were on the floor earlier. The remarks we are  delivering today address the future of our relationship with the NATO  alliance, particularly in light of the visit that President Trump is  now making to meet with Vladimir Putin of Russia.   I am glad many of my colleagues came here today to speak on the  threats posed by President Trump to America's core national security  alliance--something that would have once  [[Page S4865]]  been unimaginable. In fact, there was a time when a Republican  President named Ronald Reagan really inspired the United States and the  world by noting how important the NATO alliance is to the world and to  the United States. In a speech that he gave to the Parliament of Great  Britain in 1982, Ronald Reagan said:         We're approaching the end of a bloody century plagued by a       terrible political invention: totalitarianism. Optimism comes       less easily today, not because democracy is less vigorous,       but because democracy's enemies have refined their       instruments of repression. Yet optimism is in order, because       day by day democracy is proving itself to be a not-at-all       fragile flower.    Reagan went on to say:         Our military strength is a prerequisite to peace, but let       it be clear we maintain this strength in the hope it will       never be used, for the ultimate determinant in the struggle       that's now going on in the world will not be bombs and       rockets, but a test of wills and ideas, a trial of spiritual       resolve, the values we hold, the beliefs we cherish, the       ideals to which we are dedicated.    President Reagan then went on to say to the British Parliament:         I've often wondered about the shyness of some of us in the       West about standing for these ideals that have done so much       to ease the plight of man and the hardships of our imperfect       world.    Contrast what President Reagan said about the partnership of the  Atlantic alliance nations in NATO with what has happened with this  current White House and President regarding some of these same key  Western allies at the G7 summit last month.   First, President Trump stunned the Western world by saying even  before arriving at the summit that Russia should be welcomed back into  the group of G7 nations, even though Russia was expelled after invading  and seizing sovereign Ukrainian territory, which it still holds.  President Trump made this plea to try to win over this effort of  support for Putin to a Western world that is skeptical of Putin and his  tactics.   Putin launched an aggressive cyber act of war right here in the  United States in an attempt to void and change a national election and  to favor his candidate over another. That, in many respects, is a cyber  act of war, which President Trump refuses to acknowledge.   At the summit itself, President Trump arrived late and left early  after letting it be known that he didn't even want to attend the G7  summit with our traditional allies. The President, sad to say, was  utterly disrespectful to our Nation's oldest and most reliable allies.   In fact, a White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said that  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ``stabbed us in the back,'' and  then Mr. Navarro went on to say, ``There's a special place in hell for  any foreign leader that engages in bad-faith diplomacy with President  Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out  the door.'' Navarro's comments echoed a series of tweets from the  President withdrawing from a joint G7 statement after initially  agreeing to it.   Then the President went on in this tweet, personally attacking Prime  Minister Trudeau in the coarsest terms and criticizing and disparaging  America's oldest Western allies simply for imploring him not to end  decades of shared Western-led international order and cooperation.   One senses that President Trump's sense of history extends to the day  before yesterday. Has he forgotten that since the attack on the United  States of 9/11, the Canadians have stood by us, as so many other  countries have as well? One hundred fifty-nine Canadians have given  their lives standing by our troops in Afghanistan in a NATO effort  since operations began there in 2002. Could we ask anything more of a  trusted ally than to sacrifice the lives of its young soldiers? Canada  has, and continues to, despite this language from President Trump.   Then, to add insult to injury, President Trump showered one of the  world's most brutal nuclear-armed dictators with glowing warmth, pats  on the back, flattery, and even a White House-made propaganda video  showing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a great statesman.   Can anyone here imagine what would have happened if President Obama  had constructed a propaganda video before beginning his negotiations  with Iran or if the President had saluted an Iranian general? FOX TV,  the Republicans, and many other leaders would have had a field day with  that image.   I am all for talking to one's adversaries in the pursuit of  diplomacy. I have met with my share of autocrats around the world,  trying, in my small way, to advance America's interests and values, but  I don't check America's values or reality at the door at those  meetings. I do not know of any modern President who let normal  disagreements between key allies turn into a personal spat that  alienates our friends and undermines our security.   In fact, I am increasingly convinced that President Trump is so  enamored by validation-seeking autocrats and offended by our  traditional allies expressing disagreements that he is incapable of  distinguishing friends from enemies. This is truly problematic and  dangerous. Now, our allies have just cause to worry that President  Trump will give away concessions to Vladimir Putin, just as he did with  the North Korean dictator.   Against all reason and international norms, Trump is considering  recognizing Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea because, sadly,  President Trump has no sense of history and little knowledge of  Vladimir Putin's true agenda.   He is making threats and belittling NATO, the strongest alliance on  the face of the Earth, while at the same time craving time with  Vladimir Putin, whom he describes as a fine man. That is something  which I am sure the people in our NATO alliance find incredible.   Quite simply, the first and long overdue statement from Trump to  Putin ought to be: Do not interfere in America's elections ever again.  I don't want your help, which was an attack on our democracy, and I do  not believe your denials.   That ought to be the opening remark with Vladimir Putin. My guess is  that it will not even be close.   I can think of few times in history that the party of Ronald Reagan  has sat so quietly on its hands while an American President's actions  threatened our Western security alliance and our place in the world. I  don't understand why the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has not  held a full committee hearing on Russia in more than 1 year, not to  mention ever conducted an investigation into Russia's attack on our  last election--something clearly within the jurisdiction of this  committee and which it did in the past amid allegations of foreign  election interference.   What of the Republicans' stunning silence about President Trump's  undermining of NATO? There are some national needs and congressional  responsibilities that ought to call on all of us in both political  parties to rise to the occasion. Think about what Russia's President  Putin would most like to see happen in the West and compare it to what  is happening under President Trump. President Trump has called NATO  obsolete and questioned the centrality of the collective security  guarantee of article 5. He has questioned whether NATO should come to  the aid of NATO's Baltic States--NATO members. In fact, President Trump  reportedly asked NATO at the recent G7: Why do we need it?   Is that now the official position, not just of President Trump but of  his Republican Party? I would implore those Members of the Senate of  both parties who have visited the Baltic nations and understand the  vulnerability of those states and their bloody history over the last  century and a half to speak up on behalf of the need for NATO to stand  in concert and in alliance with those Baltic States.   This week the Canadians sent their forces and representatives to  Latvia, where they are providing special help on the ground. Similar  NATO forces are in Lithuania and Estonia. They are doing their best to  convince Putin not to engage in acts of aggression against these small  nations, while at the same time the President of the United States  questions the purpose of this effort.   President Trump has withdrawn the United States from key  international agreements on trade, climate, and even the expansion of  nuclear weapons in Iran. In doing so, the President has estranged the  United States from its allies. While I hope we do reach a diplomatic  agreement with North Korea, I  [[Page S4866]]  want to note that what little was agreed to in Singapore doesn't even  come close to the terms and inspections that were in the Iran nuclear  agreement from which President Trump simply walked away.   President Trump has insulted and strained relations with America's  closest European and Western allies, so much so that European Council  President Donald Tusk recently dismissed the United States by saying:  ``With friends like that, who needs enemies.''   It has reached the point that just ahead of the NATO summit, we lost  another senior career diplomat when James Melville, our Ambassador to  Estonia, resigned over frustration with the controversial comments  being made by President Trump. Ambassador Melville served under 6  different Presidents and 11 Secretaries of State, and he never thought  the day would come when he couldn't support a President's policies-- until now.   President Trump has tried to discredit key democratic institutions  and processes in the United States, sowing mistrust in our political  system and government. He has insulted poor nations, made immigrants a  manufactured enemy, separated children from parents forcibly, and  declared that America must come first in this world, isolating the  United States day by day and more and more from the nations and  countries that have been our traditional allies.   Why in the world is this President pursuing the agenda of one of our  adversaries, who attacked our election process, militarily seized  sovereign territory of our allies, murdered and attempted to murder  dissidents on our allies' soil, provided weapons to Ukrainian  separatists that shot down a Malaysian commercial airliner, killing  hundreds of innocent people, repeatedly buzzes and tests NATO defenses,  and jails and represses its own people when they advocate for basic  democratic rights?   Before departing this morning for Brussels, instead of setting a  positive tone for the NATO meeting to follow, President Trump,  incredibly, decided to take to Twitter to criticize our allies again.   My friend and American patriot, Senator John McCain, was one of the  few Republicans--one of the few--to recently speak up on behalf of our  alliance. Here is what he said:         To our allies: bipartisan majorities of Americans remain       pro-free trade, pro-globalization & supportive of alliances       based on 70 years of shared values. Americans stand with you,       even if our president doesn't.    I couldn't agree more. I wish John McCain were on the floor of the  Senate today to deliver those remarks in person, but his spirit is here  among those on both sides of the aisle who value our NATO alliance and  cannot understand the relationship between President Trump and Vladimir  Putin.   The cause of democracy and freedom in this world requires a strong  alliance that stands together for values the Americans believe in,  share, fight for, and die for in war after war. We need that spirit to  return again to the United States.   I yield the floor.
