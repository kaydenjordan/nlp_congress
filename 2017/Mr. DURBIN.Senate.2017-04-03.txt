Such regulations shall include the manner       in which prospective passengers are to be notified.        ``(d) In addition to other penalties permitted by law, the       Secretary is authorized to immediately withdraw a certificate       of inspection for a passenger vessel that does not comply       with any requirement under this section.''.                            ____________________
