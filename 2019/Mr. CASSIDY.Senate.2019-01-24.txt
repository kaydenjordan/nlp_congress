 Mr. President, If I were sitting at home or in the  Gallery right now, I would be incredibly frustrated. I am frustrated,  but if I were home, I would be particularly frustrated. Why?   Think about what we have agreed upon in this colloquy from both the  Democratic and Republican side of the aisle. We agree that border  security is important. We agree that it is one of the primary functions  of the Federal Government. We agree that there needs to be more money,  and although in legislation we have not agreed, we certainly have  statements from Democrats and, of course, as well as Republicans, that  barriers are also important.   Collin Peterson, a Democrat on the House side, put it well. On  January 22, 2019, he said:         Give Trump the money. I'd give him the whole thing . . .       and put strings on it so you make sure he puts the wall where       it needs to be. Why are we fighting over this? We're going to       build that wall anyway, at some time.    My Democratic Senate colleagues have said something along the same  line, maybe not as point-blank but they certainly have said it. We  agree there. We agree that the American worker who continues to show up  but is not getting paid needs to get paid.   As for those TSA agents and those air traffic controllers whom we use  as we go back and forth to our districts, God bless them. More than  51,000 TSA agents are working without pay. There are 10,000 air traffic  controller support staff who remain furloughed.   By the way, I and others have introduced legislation to pay those  while they are working. I think it is something we, the Senate, should  take up. We need a solution that fulfills our national security  responsibilities, ends the shutdown, and so that these workers can get  paid.   I say it is time to move forward, negotiate, and come to the table,  but you may ask: If Democratic and Republican Senators all agree to  this, then, why is it not happening?   In fairness to President Trump, whose rhetoric sometimes inflames and  sometimes pushes off and, as my colleague from Ohio said, who sometimes  describes things in a way that misrepresents his actual intent, it is  not a wall from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. It is a wall  in certain places that are high flow with pedestrian traffic. But,  nonetheless, clearly, we have come to a point where a personality  conflict between the President and the Speaker has put them at  loggerheads and, apparently, they are unable to negotiate.   It is clear from our colloquy that Senators on both sides of the  aisle would like to come to a solution that secures the southern  border, opens the government, and pays the workers.   In fairness to the President, he has put forward an opening offer. He  has said he wants that money for the barrier, but he has put other  issues on the table that are near and dear to Democrats' hearts that,  hopefully, would open the way to a compromise.   The way I can imagine it would work is that the Speaker would put  forward a counterproposal. I think that is where we need to be, to rise  above any personal dislike or any entrenched positions that people have  come to but, rather, to come to a point where we recognize that the  American people are better served if the folks serving them are getting  paid, that it is important to secure our southern border, and that some  sort of barrier will be part of that, as Members of both parties have  agreed to.   So it is time to move forward. It is time to negotiate. It is time  for the two principals to come to some sort of compromise. Clearly, we  in the Senate are willing to move forward.   With that, I yield the floor.
