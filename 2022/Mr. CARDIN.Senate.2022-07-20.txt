 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise today to draw the attention of the  Senate and the American people to a dark anniversary on the near  horizon.   On July 24, the world will have seen 5 full months of the brutal,  unjustified, and utterly senseless war Russia's dictator Vladimir Putin  has unleashed on Ukraine, a peace-loving democracy that has never  threatened Russia or any of its other neighbors.   It will be 150 days of Mr. Putin and his army's killing and raping  Ukrainian women and children; destroying homes, hospitals, museums,  schools, and churches; displacing almost 13 million people; and  unleashing chaos and havoc on the world. The blockage of the southern  ports of Ukraine has interrupted the vital supply of Ukrainian food  supplies to a hungry world, wreaking pain and havoc on societies across  the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. An existing global food  security crisis has now been severely worsened by Russia's violent  assault, as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee examined earlier  today in a hearing where USAID Administrator Samantha Power and our  permanent representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Linda  Thomas-Greenfield, testified. They spoke about the U.S. role in trying  to avert this additional global tragedy resulting from Russia's  aggression and the immensity of the task ahead.   Who could forget the horrors of Bucha and Irpin, the shell-shocked  look in the eyes of Ukrainian children who will forever carry the  burdens of unimaginable trauma or the Ukrainian women who had to be  carried from a maternity ward after the Russians struck their hospital  with a cruise missile.   This is an everyday reality now for Ukrainians--unspeakable, cruel  military assaults. Yet they demonstrate the indomitable will to fight  for their land and freedom; they do not give up; and they are truly an  inspiration for the rest of the world.   When Mr. Putin started this attack, he assumed Russia would conquer  Ukraine and seize its capital in 3 days. Yet it is now day almost 150,  and Russia has suffered heavy losses and retreated from Kyiv. While  several towns in the south of the country have been flattened and then  occupied, in most of the country, the Russian invaders have barely  advanced from their initial positions.   In the towns and cities the Russians occupy, they have met heavy  resistance from Ukrainian guerillas and regular citizens who do not  want to be part of Putin's evil empire. Despite efforts to indoctrinate  Ukrainian children in occupied areas with a counterfactual narrative of  the contemporary history, Russian speakers are learning Ukrainian, and  what have been generally positive relations with the people of Ukraine  and Russia before this invasion have now been completely destroyed.   Independent analysts have described the ongoing violence as a  genocide in  [[Page S3547]]  Ukraine, and there is a growing body of evidence that it is, sadly,  true. A May of 2022 study conducted by the New Lines Institute and the  Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights concluded that ``Russia bears  State responsibility for breaches of Article II and Article III of the  Genocide Convention.''   The report pointed to a pattern of Russian forces targeting the  Ukrainian civilians, with evidence of mass executions and torture of  civilians in Russian-occupied regions. The report included evidence of  deliberate attacks on shelters, evacuation routes, and humanitarian  corridors, as well as reports of sexual violence and forcible  deportation of Ukrainians to Russia.   On July 14, the United States and 44 other nations signed an  International Criminal Court declaration to investigate over 20,000  reports--20,000 reports--of war crimes committed by Russia in Ukraine  since the beginning of the war.   Make no mistake about it, Vladimir Putin has caused the suffering and  pain in pursuit of his ambition to rebuild the Russian Empire. He has  said it to himself on multiple occasions. He is hell-bent on destroying  the post-World War II world order that has brought prosperity and peace  to our allies in Europe--and to Russia to this point, too.   Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that the Ukrainians are  fighting not just for their land and freedom, which, as Americans, we  should cherish and appreciate, but also for the very core of the global  order that, if destroyed, will marginalize our allies and threaten the  United States.   With this in mind, we must remember that supporting Ukraine is not  charity. It is in our core national security interest to provide the  Ukrainians with the arms, financing, and moral support to defeat the  tyrant of Russia. If Ukraine falls, it will lead to the subjugation of  Ukrainian people, destruction of its culture and language, and bring a  hostile and expansionistic Russian Empire right to the borders of our  NATO allies that we are committed to protect with our troops and  weapons. Ukraine is the firewall that the world cannot afford to see  breached.   So, yes, it is a moral imperative for us to support Ukrainians in  this just war, but it is also a core national security necessity for us  to do this. Ukraine is fighting this war on multiple fronts: on land  and at sea and in the air. The security of the Black Sea region is a  critical aspect of this war that has not received enough attention. As  recent reporting suggests, the ability of the Ukrainians' vessels to  navigate the Black Sea is important for the country but also for  regional stability and global food security. That is where Ukraine  exports most of its agricultural products. Ukraine is a major grain  exporter, and the Russians have been blocking these vessels from  departing Ukrainian ports. This exposes some of the world's most  vulnerable people to food scarcity, malnutrition, and worsening  poverty--and in some cases leading to unnecessary and preventable  deaths. Truly, the ugliness and depravation of the Putin regime has no  limit.   It is in this context the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation  in Europe that I chair conducted a field hearing on Black Sea security  in Constanta, Romania, on July 1. I want to thank my friend Senator  Wicker for chairing that hearing. The Commission brought together key  decisionmakers from the Black Sea states to discuss how best to address  Russia's illegal naval blockade of Ukrainian ports.   Subsequently, Senator Wicker and I joined Senators Shaheen and Romney  in introducing the Black Sea Security Act, S. 4509. This bill would  declare that it is the policy of the United States ``to actively deter  the threat of further Russian escalation in the Black Sea region and  defend freedom of navigation in the Black Sea to prevent the spread of  further armed conflict in Europe.''   The bill further requires that the National Security Council shall  deliver to Congress an interagency report that outlines current policy  options toward Black Sea countries and the border region. The report  would include a breakdown of funding to support these efforts,  including military assistance; economic assistance, including support  for food security; countering Russia's disinformation and propaganda;  energy diversification; increasing access to global capital markets; a  plan for helping U.S. allies in the region to accelerate their  transitions from legacy Russian military equipment and promote NATO  interoperability; and strengthening the rule of law and anticorruption  efforts.   I call on my colleagues to support this important piece of  legislation.   Tragically, this war is turning into a marathon, and it is incumbent  upon us not to lose our focus and determination in supporting our  Ukrainian partners. I want to urge my colleagues in this Chamber and  all my fellow Americans to stay the course and continue to support  Ukraine for as long as it takes.   My final point today is that we should say the name of what Russia is  doing, the atrocities they are committing. Russia is committing  genocide in Ukraine. Russia is trying to eviscerate not just the people  and the buildings of Ukraine; they are trying to eliminate the  Ukrainian language, Ukrainian history, and Ukrainian culture. That is  genocide.   That is why I am joining Senator Risch, along with Senators Graham,  Blumenthal, Shaheen, and Portman in introducing a resolution that would  condemn the Russian Federation for committing acts of genocide against  the Ukrainian people; call on the United States, in cooperation with  allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European  Union, to undertake measures to support the Government of Ukraine to  prevent further acts of Russian genocide against the Ukrainian people;  and support tribunals and international criminal investigations to hold  Russian political leaders and military personnel to account for a war  of aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.   We must stand shoulder to shoulder with the Ukrainians to lighten  their load and hasten their victory. We must be prepared for the  reconstruction of Ukraine that will follow the conclusion of this war.  And, yes, we must pursue accountability for those responsible for the  genocide underway in Ukraine by the Russian Federation.                            ____________________
