 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of  amendment No. 73, requiring a report to relevant committees on the  missions, operations, and activities of the Department of Defense in  Niger and the broader region.   I believe that key components of the amendment are necessary to  obtain critical, tactical, operational, and strategic improvements in  U.S. Africa Command's efforts to achieve stability and security in the  region, and most importantly, keep our troops safer.   As evidenced by the tragic deaths of the four soldiers who were  ambushed by ISIS near Tongo Tongo, Niger, last October, improvements  throughout the chain of command and military services are necessary,  and DOD must provide greater transparency and communication with  Congress regarding legal, operational, and funding authorities for  military operations in Africa.   The amendment requires DOD to specify its objectives in Niger and  justify their relevance to U.S. national security. For the safety of  our troops, the amendment also requires DOD to identify measures to  mitigate operational risk and increase the preparedness of members of  the Armed Forces in Niger and the broader region.   It will also mandate that DOD assess the command and support  relationships of U.S. Africa Command with subordinate commands like  Special Operations Command. This will help to ensure improved command  and control throughout the chain of command, that the commander's  intent is clear, and that operational guidance is consistent and  concise.   Indeed, the tragic deaths of the four soldiers killed in action  affected me personally in an overwhelming way. One of the four soldiers  killed was a dear constituent of mine, Sergeant La David Johnson of  Miami Gardens.   Sergeant Johnson, who was killed while bravely defending our country,  was 25 years of age. He left behind a lovely extended family, a  beautiful wife, and three young children. He was a member of the 5000  Role Models of Excellence, and 50 members are visiting us here today.   Mr. Chair, I am hopeful that with actions currently being taken by  the DOD, along with the prescriptive elements of this amendment, our  Nation will not have to suffer another tragic loss like we did last  October.                                time  1700
