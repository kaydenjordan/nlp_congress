 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to because we made a promise  to the American people, and we are going to keep it.   ObamaCare is an unpopular and failed law collapsing under its own  weight. Polls have shown it; rising premiums have proven it; and, in  November, the voters said it loud and clear. It is time to repeal  ObamaCare and replace it with more choices, lower costs, and real  protections for patients. Already, we are working to end this damaging  law and take control away from Federal bureaucrats and give it back to  the people of this country.   One year ago, we sent an ObamaCare repeal bill to the President's  desk; but, not surprisingly, he vetoed it. In a few weeks, this  Congress will again send a repeal bill to the President's desk. This  time, we will have a President who will sign it.   Mr. Speaker, healthcare decisions should be made by patients and  their doctors. American families should have access to health insurance  they can actually afford. That is why we will repeal ObamaCare and  replace it with real reforms.                            ____________________
