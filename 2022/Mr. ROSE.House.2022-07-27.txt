 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the violence plaguing  so many American communities.   2021 was a historic year for crime in major cities like New York  City, Los Angeles, and even Washington, D.C. This year is on track to  be even worse. Homicides alone are up nearly 50 percent nationwide from  2020.   We have seen more than 80 inexcusable acts of violence against pro- life pregnancy centers and churches in recent months. 178 police  officers have  [[Page H7176]]  tragically been shot so far this year, with 33 of them losing their  lives. It is no wonder so many are retiring or resigning; 1,500 men and  women in blue have stepped down just from the New York City Police  Department this year.   Congressional Democrats need to take a stand against those in their  party who push radical soft-on-crime policies, such as defunding the  police, and, instead, leave wokeness behind to support our men and  women of law enforcement to the fullest extent possible.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the vice chairman for yielding time  in this Special Order tonight.   Madam Speaker, June was the fourth consecutive month, as we have  already heard, with more than 200,000 migrant encounters along our  southern border. The total number of illegal immigrant apprehensions  since this President took office now sits at more than 3.1 million.  That is on top of more than 800,000 known got-aways.   It is costing lives. More than 100,000 Americans--many of them young  Americans--died last year of drug overdoses. Those deaths were fueled  by fentanyl that illegally came across our border.   Since last October, Border Patrol has seized more than 8,400 pounds  of fentanyl. These are not just statistics. They are people, our fellow  Americans. Their families are forever shattered. Yet, this  administration continues to fight to end policies like title 42 and  remain in Mexico, sending a clear message that our borders are open.   This administration is putting our economic security at risk, our  national security at risk, and exacerbating a humanitarian crisis. A  large and growing number of children with limited resources are being  exploited by the cartels to dangerously run the streets or forced into  prostitution.   Additionally, over 1,000 people have died along our border since  President Biden took office--many while trying to enter our country  illegally--attracted by the policies of this administration. Instead of  taking bold action to combat this problem, the Department of Homeland  Security Secretary Mayorkas continues to claim our border is secure.   Texas Department of Public Safety Sergeant Marc Couch sees the  humanitarian crisis every day along the Rio Grande Valley. He recently  told Fox News that to say the border is secure is: ``a misnomer of a  statement that has no truth in it.''   I agree. But I would like to put it a different way. Secretary  Mayorkas' claim is grossly misleading. In fact, it is just flat wrong,  so much so that it is difficult to understand how he could in good  faith believe what he is saying to the American people.   Madam Speaker, I usually end these speeches by urging the President  to do better with regard to our border, but the reality is we know this  administration has little or no appetite for securing our border and  instead prefers to appeal to its far-left base.   It falls on Congress to hold the executive branch accountable when it  fails to uphold our laws. So, I will close today by urging  congressional Democrats to do their job, and as the House majority at  least until January, join Republicans to hold this administration  accountable.   Let's take a break from voting on messaging bills that have no chance  of passing in the Senate. Let's find ways to come together and finally  secure our border. This should be a top priority for both parties  because open borders make every State a border State and put America at  risk.
