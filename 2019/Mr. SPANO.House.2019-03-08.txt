 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate a tradition  that has come to define a small town in rural Florida.   Every winter, Plant City transforms for the Strawberry Festival, an  event to celebrate the annual strawberry harvest.   When the festival was founded in 1930, it was a way for the residents  of Plant City to not only mark a new crop of strawberries, but also was  one of the few times a year locals could eat strawberries, due to their  short shelf life.   Today, the 11-day event attracts guests far beyond Plant City, and  the strawberry growers in the community now supply virtually all winter  strawberries grown in the United States. This success comes at the hard  work of growers in Plant City.   These entrepreneurial men and women work tirelessly to bring us the  strawberries many of us enjoy, and I want to take this opportunity to  thank them for all that they do for us. Strawberries have become the  lifeblood of Plant City, and our community wouldn't be what it is today  without them.   I also want to take this time to congratulate Kendall Gaudens, who  was crowned this year's Strawberry Festival Queen. Kendall joins the  illustrious ranks of many great women before her, including Florida's  current attorney general, my friend Ashley Moody.   I also want to congratulate Madilyn Conrad, who was named first maid,  and Kennedy Cullins, Jada Brown, and Olivia Frazier, who were selected  for the court.                            ____________________
