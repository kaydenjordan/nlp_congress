 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Engel for yielding.   We can agree Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism  and must not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon, but let's also  agree that diplomacy is preferred, instead of armed conflict.   But the question today is not whether to go to war but who has the  power to make that decision.   Mr. Speaker, our family was blessed when my son, a United States  marine war veteran, came home safely from tours in Iraq and  Afghanistan, but too many loved ones were not that lucky. So when I  came to Congress, I made a promise never to send someone else's child  to a war that could be avoided.   The constitutional law gives Congress, not the President, the sole  power to declare and authorize war, and it is time that Congress owns  up to that grave responsibility.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to have the courage to repeal the  war authorization against Iraq and tell the President no war against  Iran without our consent.
