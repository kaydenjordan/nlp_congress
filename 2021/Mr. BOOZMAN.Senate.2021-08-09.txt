 Madam President, I rise today to recognize Cliff  Harris, one of the newest inductees into the NFL Hall of Fame for his  remarkable football career with the Dallas Cowboys.   Cliff is a proud Arkansan who has spent his life defying odds and  demonstrating that hard work and dedication pay off.   Cliff was born in Fayetteville, AR, and grew up in the Hot Springs  area where he began his football career as backup quarterback at Hot  Springs High School. He earned a scholarship to Ouachita Baptist  University--OBU--and followed in his father's footsteps joining the  Tiger football team. Cliff was extremely successful on the field where  he was an accomplished defensive back and a skilled kick returner.  During his time at OBU, he was named to two All-Arkansas  Intercollegiate Conference--AIC--teams and, during his freshman year,  helped his team win the 1966 AIC Football Championship.   Despite a stellar college football career, Cliff was not selected in  the 1970 NFL draft. That didn't prevent him from pursing his dream. He  participated in the Cowboys training camp and signed as a free agent.  Cliff's perseverance paid off as he earned the starting free safety  position his rookie year.   His NFL career was postponed when he was called to service in the  U.S. Army. Following his military service, Cliff jumped right back into  the game and helped the Cowboys earn Super Bowl victories in 1972 and  1978.   Nicknamed ``Captain Crash'' for his ruthless tackles and ferocious  pursuit of ball carriers, Cliff dominated the field and, even today, is  heralded as one of the best free safeties to ever play the sport. Hall  of Fame head coach George Allen described Cliff as a ``rolling ball of  butcher knives.''   In addition to playing in five Super Bowls, Cliff was named to the  Pro Bowl six times and was named a first team All-Pro player for four  consecutive seasons. He was named to the Dallas Cowboys' Silver Season  All-Time Team, was selected by ``Sports Illustrated'' as the free  safety on the magazine's All-Time Dream Team, was given the NFL Alumni  Legends Award, and was the free safety of the All-Decade Team for the  1970s. In 2004, Cliff was inducted into the Dallas Cowboys Ring of  Honor. The Cliff Harris Award was named after him and is presented to  the top defensive player in small college football each year. Back in  Arkansas, Harris's alma mater Ouachita Baptist University honored Cliff  by naming its new football stadium the Cliff Harris Stadium.   From backup high school quarterback to two-time Super Bowl champion,  Cliff has remained the same hard-working kid from Arkansas. Known for  his vast knowledge of the game and strong leadership among the team,  Cliff was an extremely well-liked and respected player. As a fellow  Arkansan, I looked up to him not only because of his football skills  but also his outstanding character both on and off the field.   I applaud Cliff for his outstanding accomplished career that has  culminated with a spot in Canton. He deserves this recognition for his  perseverance on the field and for the positive example he set for  children in Arkansas and all across the country. We honor and salute  one of my boyhood heroes who has never let us down.                            ____________________
