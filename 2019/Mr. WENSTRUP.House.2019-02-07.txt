 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor some of our local heroes.  This past weekend in Clermont County, Ohio, two police officers came  under fire when responding to a call that was believed to be an  attempted suicide. Instead, it turned out to be an ambush.   The gunman lured Detective Bill Brewer, who is remembered in this  photo, along with Lieutenant Nick DeRose, into his home, where he  proceeded to fire at both deputies through a wall.   Lieutenant Nick DeRose was injured, and Detective Bill Brewer gave  his life, in the line of duty. Detective Brewer died trying to help a  member of his community, as he always strived to do.   I pray that God will bring comfort to his family; his wife, Jamie;  his young son, Braxton; my friend Sheriff Leahy; the Clermont County  Sheriff's Department; and all those in our community grieving this  loss.   I pray for a speedy recovery for Lieutenant DeRose.   While God has called Bill Brewer away from us, the positive effects  of his works in this lifetime shall never perish.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Walker for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the security and the safety of all our  fellow Americans. The fact of the matter is that border security isn't  or shouldn't be a partisan issue. That is why many of my colleagues  from across the aisle have actually supported border security and  fencing in the past.   The fact is, this is an American issue that affects every part of our  Nation, sometimes in very visible ways, sometimes in ways less visible.   I represent southern and southwestern Ohio, not a border State, but  it is deeply and tragically impacted by the lack of border security.   In the last couple years, there was a woman from my district area who  was being deported. The archbishop called the Senator on her behalf,  and he has every right to do that. This is someone who was being  deported under the Obama administration. They set a date. When the date  came, she didn't adhere, and she was deported.   The archbishop had every right to engage in that act, if he felt like  he should reach out to the Representative. But I met with the  archbishop and I asked him: Where were you in the case--such as I am  about to tell you about--where were you when someone was in need  because of the actions of someone who was here illegally?   Last year, I met a mother of a 15-year-old girl. The mother told me  about their neighbor, the neighbor that they trusted, that they had  picnics with. They told him: You have nothing to worry about. You are  here legally.   It turns out, he was a 41-year-old illegal immigrant who had  previously been deported from this country but reentered the U.S.  illegally and gained employment by using the Social Security number of  a 69-year-old woman from Arkansas.   One day, he knocked on their door, and since their daughter knew him,  she opened the door, and he went in and beat and raped her.   Her innocence was taken forever. Her life changed forever. He got 8  years. She got a life sentence, and it didn't need to happen.   Tragically, one of my local prosecutors tells me there have been  multiple cases like this in our area over the last few years. These are  the families I think about when someone calls a border wall immoral.   As President Trump said in his address, we don't build walls because  we hate the people on the outside. It is because we love the people on  the inside. But, really, we also love the people on the outside who  want to come here legally to be part of our American family.   This isn't about keeping people out of our country. This is about  controlling access, so we know who and what is coming into our country.   Sitting idly by and making no effort to resolve these problems is  wrong. It is a disservice to those who have suffered violence at the  hands of criminals who have entered our Nation illegally. These victims  are real, and so is their pain. We owe it to them to enforce our laws.   To my colleagues, I say: Come to the table. Let's negotiate a  solution, smartly enhance our security, and drive on for the betterment  of all Americans, so that, rather than being a borderless and lawless  country, America will be the beacon of hope for those who desire to  come to this great country of ours legally.
