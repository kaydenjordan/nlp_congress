 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R.  3249, the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act of  2017.   I would like to thank Chairman Goodlatte and the entire Judiciary  Committee for their efforts on this legislation and working through the  process to bring this to the floor.   I wanted to set out some recent headlines from the in-depth reporting  by The Washington Post on the rise of the MS-13 gang problem in the  Washington metropolitan area, which includes Maryland, D.C., and  Virginia, and why this legislation is needed.   ``MS-13 is `taking over the school,' one teen warned before she was  killed.''   ``She told the girl she'd see her in hell before stabbing her. Now,  she's guilty of an MS-13 murder.''   ``'People here live in fear': MS-13 menaces a community 7 miles from  the White House.''   ``Police: MS-13 members in Maryland stab man more than 100 times and  decapitate him.''   This is from my local paper, the Loudoun-Times Mirror:   ``MS-13 gang members convicted in gruesome murder of a Leesburg  teenager.''   In this particular case in Leesburg, Virginia, the teenage boy,  Carlos Otero-Henriquez, was stabbed over 50 times and his body was  dumped in a quarry miles away in West Virginia.   The Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Tracy  Doherty-McCormick, had this to say after the murderers were convicted:  ``The hallmark of MS-13 is extreme violence. This brutal kidnapping and  murder is a tragic reminder of the impact MS-13 has on communities here  in northern Virginia. My hope is that our efforts to investigate and  prosecute this case will send a clear message: Violence will be  aggressively prosecuted.''   This, and many of these other cases, are why we need the Project Safe  Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act, which authorizes $50  million, but targets 30 percent being directed toward already- established regional gang task forces.   As we know, MS-13 is a transnational gang that has been found not  only here in the Washington metropolitan region, but in Los Angeles,  Long Island, Houston, and other cities throughout the country.   The Washington Post has highlighted how the 2014 border surge  contributed to the MS-13 gang problem writing: ``The violent street  gang is on the rise in the United States, fueled, in part, by the surge  in unaccompanied minors.''   The unaccompanied minors, who often fled their native country to get  away from the gangs, arrive here only to find themselves targeted by  those very same gang members they were fleeing.   MS-13 preys upon these youngsters in their own community--and let me  emphasize, it is their own community that they are victimizing--who may  not have much of a family structure, and, in effect, MS-13 tries to  become their family or threaten them with death if they don't.   Last summer, when I went on a ride-along with our Northern Virginia  Regional Task Force, I was able to see their good work right in front  of us. There was a young man on the sidewalk of Sterling Boulevard in  Sterling, Virginia, just miles from here. The gang task force noticed  him and turned around and decided to stop him and see what he was up  to. With years of experience, the officers knew the MS-13 indicators.   The boy looked about 16 years old, from what I could tell, but it  turned out he was actually a 22-year-old gang member. He was covered in  MS-13 gang tattoos. When he lifted up his shirt when they asked him to  do so, he showed all of the particular signs of MS-13, from his head to  all over his feet.   It turns out he had been jailed in El Salvador for murder when he was  16 and had been deported from the United States twice for engaging in  violent crime.   As it turns out now, when they come to the border, we don't have the  law to be able to stop them. Fortunately, this House did pass a law  back in the fall, on a bipartisan basis--it is over in the Senate now-- to be able to stop these gang members from getting in the country in  the first place and being able to deport them quicker. But in the  meantime, we need to increase the work and the support for these  regional gang task forces.                                time  1545    We also saw the technology they use. They can use something along the  lines of an iPad or an iPhone where they put this gang member's  fingerprint on there and immediately it comes to light, as shown in the  international records, that he was a murderer and that he had been in  jail. But they need more of those resources. They only had two of those  that they were able to use, and they said every one of their cars needs  that kind of resource.   That same night that we were on the ride-along, three other suspected  MS-13 gang members were also picked up. This isn't an aberration.   At a town festival in Herndon, Virginia, in my district, the Northern  Virginia Regional Gang Task Force told us that they had identified an  estimated 200 to 300 suspected gang members who were milling about  while our children were getting popcorn, getting on the rides, and  there were people coming together to have a hotdog or a hamburger in a  community festival.   According to the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force, an MS-13  gang member put a hit out on his own brother because he refused to join  the organization. Fortunately, because of the good, intensive work of  the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force, they spared this young  man from being killed by his own brother.   That is why we need to have these resources that we are voting on  today. We need to help on a Federal level.   The community policing involved with the Northern Virginia Regional  Gang Task Force includes officers who speak Spanish, understand the  gang culture, and help get the kids out of this. They get involved in  the education, getting them into the schools. They understand where  they are trying to target these young people, and they are familiar  with their communities and have developed very good relationships with  these communities.   ICE officials complement these efforts by removing the dangerous gang  members once identified and allowing the task force to work in our  highest risk schools and communities to prevent gang violence.   The Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act would  direct this additional Federal funding toward these gang task forces so  that our gang task forces--which are comprised in my area of 13 local,  State, and Federal law enforcement agencies--can really make the best  antigang efforts in this three-pronged approach that they engage in:  education, intervention and prevention, and enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I have seen firsthand the good work these gang task  forces can do to remove these gang threats from our community, so I  urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I thank you for the  opportunity to speak to this.
