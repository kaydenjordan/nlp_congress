 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Paul Tinkle, a Tennessee radio legend.   Paul is currently the president and general manager of Thunderbolt  Radio, a strong media presence in west Tennessee. Paul has almost 50  years in radio and is a past Distinguished Service Award recipient,  served as the National Association of Broadcasters director  representing both Tennessee and Arkansas, and was the 1982 Tennessee  Associated Press Broadcaster of the Year.   On August 6, Paul will be inducted into the Tennessee Journalism Hall  of Fame, an honor that is so well-deserved.   Keith Carver, chancellor of the University of Tennessee at Martin,  said:         Paul Tinkle is a tremendous asset to northwest Tennessee.       In an era of large networks and 24-hour continuous world news       coverage, Paul's primary focus is bringing the world to his       region. Paul is a master at his craft and a true public       servant.    Chancellor Carver summed up Paul's legacy perfectly.   I congratulate Paul on his induction into the Tennessee Journalism  Hall of Fame. I know I speak for everyone when I say west Tennessee is  lucky to have someone as dedicated and committed to good journalism as  Paul.                            ____________________
