 Mr. President, I rise today as both chair of the  Subcommittee on Aviation Safety but, more importantly, as a pilot who  is only alive because of the swift actions of an experienced flight  crew.   I have lived the experience of piloting a Blackhawk that was struck  by a rocket-propelled grenade in flight and entered into flight  conditions immediately that flight simulators taught me would be  catastrophic. But having the experience of flying in the toughest  conditions had shown me that that was not the case.   I have probably spent more hours in the most sophisticated flight  simulators than any other Senator of this body, short of, of course,  Senator Kelly, our astronaut. In my over a decade of training as a  military pilot, every time--every single time--that we simulated a  total loss of all aircraft avionics that would follow with a total loss  of hydraulic power, we died in that simulator. We did this every year,  and we simulated it over and over. It was not survivable.   We never simulated an RPG explosion in the lap of one of the pilots  wherein any of the crew could survive. Why did we never simulate that  condition? Nobody ever imagined that it would ever happen and have the  crew survive or that the aircraft would not break apart in flight.   Yet, on that day in Iraq--on that day when that rocket-propelled  grenade landed in my lap and exploded--we did. The aircraft held  together, and we survived it. We were 10 feet above the trees, and we  looked, and we had no avionics, and we could tell that the hydraulics  were next. If we had relied on that simulator training, we would have  done what dark pilot humor had always said, which was: You are going to  die anyway. Let's change spots and leave a mystery for the acting  investigators to figure out what the heck happened.   But we didn't. We fought to fly that aircraft because our training in  the cockpit, in real-world flight conditions, taught us that we could  do it. Led by the expertise of my pilot in command, we landed that  aircraft and saved our entire flight crew.   I would not be alive today but for the in-cockpit experience gained  through many hard-earned flight hours over a decade of training. It was  actual, real-world experience, not a flight simulation, that made us  prepared and ready to respond to a life-threatening emergency, with  level heads and swift action--with instinct.   Of course, my experience is not unique. When the hero of the Hudson,  Captain ``Sully'' Sullenberger, implores Congress to understand that  the combined 40,000-plus flight hours between him and his first officer  were critical in saving 155 lives on that January 15, 2009, day, we  should listen.   Do you think that, prior to that day, there were any flight  simulations of a dual-engine failure from a bird strike, followed by  ditching in the Hudson River, by any airline? by any flight school? No.  In fact, when that very simulation was done after the miracle on the  Hudson, even with the flight crews experiencing and expecting the  scenario, they still crashed time after time in that simulated  emergency. It was pilot in-cockpit flying experience that saved the  miracle on the Hudson.   My experience as both a pilot, who was responsible for the lives of  my crew and passengers in the most hazardous conditions, along with my  commitment to my leadership role on the Aviation Safety Subcommittee,  means that I cannot be complicit in efforts to compromise on safety for  the flying public. There has never been a worse time to consider  weakening pilot certification requirements to produce less experienced  pilots.   The year 2023 has already been chilling for our civil aviation  system. We have witnessed a disturbing rise of near deadly close calls  that has led the FAA to convene an unprecedented safety summit, where  the Acting Administrator has warned that the entire aviation industry  needs to not grow complacent because complacency kills.   The NTSB has treated a recent uptick in near misses as a national  crisis and has investigated these incidents to determine whether  systemic problems are a root cause. Some observers believe the surge in  hiring that was necessary to address the perfect storm of pre-pandemic  buyouts and the post-COVID travel boom has simply resulted in a less  experienced workforce that is more prone to mistakes.   We must treat these unnerving near misses as red flags and be  proactive in strengthening safety requirements to make sure that these  close calls do not become precursor events to a catastrophic incident.   The last thing we should be doing is weakening part 121 certification  standards. We have had seven close calls most recently, and the answer  is not ``let's reduce pilot training.'' It is the pilot who prevented  those close calls from becoming accidents in the first place.   As a pilot, I learned the value of real-world experience. Trust me.  Hours in that cockpit, in the sky, matter. Simulators are a valuable  training tool. I applaud them, and I have made use of them, but they  are no substitute for the real thing. Lifesaving instincts are earned  through hours of hard work and dedication through the craft of piloting  a real aircraft with real stakes.   Look, I know the experience of the perfect storm of major carriers  buying out thousands of their most experienced pilots, followed by a  post-pandemic surge in air travel demand, has created a temporary  shortage of pilots and first officers, especially for regional  airlines. The consequences for communities, especially with rural  airports, have been real and painful. I see them myself in my own home  State. I understand the temptation to cut corners or to chase the false  promise of a quick fix to a systemic challenge. But weakening a pillar  of our post-Colgan reforms won't magically solve the need for more  pilots.   Believe me. I have asked for the specifics. If we reduce the minimum  flight hours from 1,500 to 1,000, how many more pilots would be  available in the following calendar year? What about 800 hours? What if  we drop it to 500 or to 250? How many more pilots would you have then?  Yet, today, I have received no precise estimate, let alone any credible  projections.   At this point, I question whether the special interests pushing to  weaken the 1,500-hour rule even have a methodology or model to measure  the relationship between certain certification standards and the  availability of pilots.   I am not the only one who has stress-tested industry assertions and  come away with more questions than answers. Last year, the FAA rejected  a  [[Page S2117]]  petition for an exemption to the flight hours requirement and  explicitly stated:         The FAA has previously concluded the argument that an       exemption would serve to address a pilot shortage is overly       simplistic and does not present a persuasive argument.    Foreign carriers that are not subject to the 1,500-hour rule are also  experiencing workforce challenges post-pandemic. Yet they are not  reducing their requirements. This bolsters the FAA's conclusion.   Simply put, reducing hours, even just for restricted ATPs, represent  a serious risk with no reward. It represents an unacceptable  backsliding, a dangerous complacency, in an industry where complacency  kills. As chair of the Aviation Safety Subcommittee, as a professional  aviator, and as a private pilot, I am holding the line on safety.   I want to encourage my colleagues to focus on the long list of other,  more urgent aviation issues facing our country. Now is not the time to  go backward on a post-Colgan safety system, and there has not been a  single aviation fatality due to pilot error since the 1,500-hour rule  was put into effect.   Now is not the time to put corporate profits ahead of the lives of  our constituents who may want to board a commercial flight in the  future. A vote to reduce the 1,500-hour rule for pilot training will be  blood on your hands when the inevitable accident occurs as a result of  an inadequately trained flight crew.   I urge my colleagues to uphold the 1,500-hour rule.   I yield the floor.
