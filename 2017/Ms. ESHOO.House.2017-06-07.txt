 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Rule and  the underlying bill, and I urge my colleagues to defeat the Previous  Question so that the House can vote on my bipartisan legislation, the  Presidential Tax Transparency Act.   I first introduced the Presidential Tax Transparency Act exactly one  year ago today, along with my Senate counterpart Ron Wyden. This bill  would codify the longstanding tradition of presidents disclosing their  tax returns. The bill is simple, it is bipartisan, and it has the  support of the American people. A recent poll found that 80 percent of  Americans believe the President should disclose his tax returns.  Earlier today, a petition was delivered to Congress with over 4 million  signatures calling on the House to take up this bill.   Since I introduced the Presidential Tax Transparency Act a year ago,  candidate Trump and now President Trump has amassed serious ethical  lapses, troubling connections to Russian officials, and countless  potential conflicts of interest, all while hiding his full financial  information from the public.   Mr. Trump is the first president in decades to refuse to disclose his  tax returns as a candidate and as President. We know from his candidate  financial disclosure filed last year that the President has 564  financial positions in companies around the world, and owes at least  $300 million in debts to various banks. But there's no way for us to  verify these claims without his tax return information.   Disclosure of the President's tax returns would provide answers to  many of the troubling questions surrounding this Administration's  connections to Russia. In recent weeks, the President pressured the FBI  Director to stop investigating Michael Flynn's Russia connections and  then fired him. There are near-daily revelations of undisclosed  meetings with Russian officials, disclosures of classified information,  and more evidence that the Russians sought to directly interfere in our  election.   Only with full disclosure of his tax returns will we know the true  sources of the President's income, the holders of his debt, and the  extent of any business ties to Russia and other foreign countries.   I urge my colleagues to listen to the will of the American people and  join our bipartisan effort to exercise Congress's constitutional duty  to serve as a check on the Executive Branch. By defeating the Previous  Question and voting to approve the Presidential Tax Transparency Act  today, this body can start the process of obtaining the truth that the  American people want and are entitled to.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 375 Offered By Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       305) to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to require       the disclosure of certain tax returns by Presidents and       certain candidates for the office of the President, and for       other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and       controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority       members of the Committees on Ways and Means and Oversight and       Government Reform. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 305.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote on whether to order the previous question on a       special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. A vote against       ordering the previous question is a vote against the       Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow the Democratic       minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about       what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous  [[Page H4671]]       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.
