 Mr. President, I rise in support of our amendment to  prohibit funds in this legislation to be used to promulgate, fund, or  enforce President Biden's unconstitutional vaccine mandate on private  employers.   As a physician, I am confident the vaccine has saved lives. My wife  and I got the vaccine. My parents got the vaccine, and they are waiting  to get their boosters. But whether to receive it is a personal choice  between individuals and their doctor, not mandated  [[Page S6809]]  via unconstitutional Executive actions that the administration recently  acknowledged they didn't have authority to put in place.   No precedent exists in American history for punishing private  employers that don't enforce government vaccination edicts.  Astonishingly, House Democrats included fines of up to $700,000 on  businesses that have unvaccinated employees as a way to pay for their  out-of-control spending.   Make no mistake. This vaccine mandate is not about public health or  science. If it were, we would recognize natural immunity as a highly  effective way to combat the virus.
