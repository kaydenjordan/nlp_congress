 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, Representative  Kennedy, for adding an amendment to this bill that will tighten it even  further. I also thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Pallone, Chairman Neal,  and Chairman Scott for their leadership and efforts on this historic  legislation, which brings desperately needed relief to America's  patients and seniors from the high drug prices that are scaring too  many of them.   There is a reason that we pay nearly four times more for prescription  drugs than other industrialized nations. They use negotiation to lower  drug prices. We don't.   Negotiating lower drug prices is a promise that the President,  Democrats, and Republicans have made, and the Elijah E. Cummings Lower  Drug Costs Now Act makes good to this commitment.   Representative Kennedy's amendment further strengthens this provision  to ensure that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who is  responsible for these negotiations, is free from conflicts of interest.  A public office is a public trust, and America's seniors and patients  deserve to have confidence that the Secretary's interests are aligned  with theirs.   That is why this amendment is so important. It puts American people  first when negotiating drug prices so that they receive the best deal  possible.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which will ensure  that the American people, not special interests, are represented in  drug price negotiations.
