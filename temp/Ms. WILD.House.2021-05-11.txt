 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Ramon  Ramirez of Allentown, Pennsylvania, who tragically lost his life to a  senseless rampage of gun violence on April 21 while he was filling up  his work truck at a gas station in the wee hours of the morning.   He was 31 years old. He was a husband of 12 years and a father of  three children. People remember him as a loving family man and a hard  worker. He was someone who--as one of his neighbors put it--was always  looking to make things better for those around him. That same neighbor  remarked that lately she often heard Ramon and his son play basketball  in front of their house.   The horrific toll of gun violence across our country is puncturing  the American Dream. It has stolen the hopes and lives of so many  families.   Mr. Speaker, I am not up here to advocate for any particular bill. I  am up here to ask, beg, and plead that somebody on the other side of  the aisle come to me with their suggestions of what we can do to stop  these random acts of gun violence.    I want to work with my colleagues. We have to end this. I ask that  all of my colleagues join me in paying tribute to Ramon Ramirez and  standing in solidarity with his family.
