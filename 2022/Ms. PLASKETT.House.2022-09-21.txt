 Mr. Speaker, the right to vote is fundamental to our  democracy. While the path to full voting rights for all American  citizens has been and still is long and challenging, this week we honor  the heroes who fought to secure this right by encouraging and  supporting all eligible Americans to register to vote.   This call to action would be incomplete if I did not mention the  nearly 4 million Americans living in U.S. territories and those in the  District of Columbia who still do not have equal voting representation  in this Congress and in our country.   As such, Americans living in the territories and the District of  Columbia are accustomed to being last in line or given short shrift for  hurricane relief, Medicaid, and infrastructure funding.   We must remain committed to building an America where every vote  matters and where every citizen has the ability and the right to  participate freely in the democratic process.   That is why I stand with House Democrats to continue to work on  securing the vote for all Americans. Our Nation depends on it.                              Better-Paying Jobs     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to affirm my commitment to  expanding work opportunities to all corners of the country, including  the often excluded territory of the Virgin Islands. That means forming  better-paying jobs and economic opportunities so Americans can work and  live with dignity and security.   The Democratic Caucus has remained committed to people over politics  in this with safer communities, better-paying jobs, and opportunities  for all Americans.   That is why they have supported and I support the three significant  pieces of legislation that have been passed by House Democrats: the  CHIPS and Science Act which provides billions of dollars in new funding  to strengthen American research and development and rebuild our supply  chain; the Inflation Reduction Act which has stimulated job growth  through investments in clean, affordable, and secure American energy  while simultaneously cutting families' energy bills and fighting the  climate change; and, lastly, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act, let us not forget, which aims to rebuild our roads, bridges, and  transit systems while bringing broadband and clean drinking water to  more communities.                         Black Women's Equal Pay Day     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the disparities  that exist for Black women due to the double-pronged existence of  institutional racism and misogyny in our country. Black women bear the  unique burden of experiencing both gender and racial discrimination. We  have seen this in health, wealth, education, and work among all  socioeconomic, geographic, and age groups.   Black women earn 58 cents to the dollar of a White man--the same job,  the same position--58 cents to the dollar. Their earning gap is even  more severe for mothers, with Black mothers only earning 46 cents for  every dollar a White, non-Hispanic father earned nationally.   It is imperative that we demand pay equity for Black women. So today,  I stand with all of my sisters and demand and implore my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to support Black Women's Equal Pay Day.                            ____________________
