 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with UAW  members across the country fighting for a fair contract.   As we stand here today, over 12,000 autoworkers are striking in  Michigan, Missouri, and Ohio. Over 100,000 more UAW stand ready to do  what is necessary to secure better wages, benefits, and working  conditions. Their priorities are not extreme.   In the past decade, the Big Three automakers made an astronomical  $250 billion in profits. During that same time, CEO pay at these  companies has increased 40 percent while workers' wages have increased  only 6 percent. These record profits were built on the backs of  workers.   Today, UAW members are demanding that they receive their fair share  of this record windfall. This is not extreme. It is what these workers  are entitled to.   The Big Three automakers must recognize this and negotiate with UAW  in good faith to resolve the standoff with justice and fairness.
