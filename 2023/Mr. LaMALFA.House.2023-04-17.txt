 Madam Speaker, California has gotten a heck of a lot of  rain and snow this year. We are very grateful for that. After several  dry years, Mother Nature and God have been good to us. Billions of  gallons of water have flooded California in some areas, including the  newly created Tulare Lake, as in previous decades.   Our snowpack is indeed at near-record levels, but so much of this  water is being lost out to the ocean. California's water infrastructure  hasn't been really added to in over 40 years. Now, we have a 1.5  million acre-foot project called Sites Reservoir that has been talked  about for about 40 years. Endless environmental studies and other hang- ups have kept the permitting process from being completed.   All Californians--indeed all Americans--suffer because the food crops  that we are growing in our State feed 90 percent of our country in  certain types of crops.   In 2014, Californians voted in favor of a bond to increase our water  storage if the money gets spent on tearing down dams and taking away  hydroelectric power.   If Sites Reservoir was in place this year, it would be half full in  just one season with 750,000 acre-feet of water. That opportunity has  been lost.   Madam Speaker, we need to get these projects done.                            ____________________
