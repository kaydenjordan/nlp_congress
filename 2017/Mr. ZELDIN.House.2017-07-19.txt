 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the 103rd Rescue  Squadron, a unit of the 106th Rescue  [[Page H5986]]  Wing of the New York Air National Guard.   Commanded by Colonel Michael Bank, the 106th Rescue Wing is based out  of Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach, located in my home district,  and has a long and distinguished history of service.   In October 1991, during the storm that was depicted in the major  motion picture ``The Perfect Storm,'' an HH-60 and tanker from the  106th Rescue Wing flew to an endangered sailboat about 250 miles south  of its base.   After survival gear was dropped onto the vessel, they began their  return to base. However, braving incredibly severe weather conditions,  the HH-60 was forced to ditch 60 miles south of base in the Atlantic  Ocean. All but one member of the crew was rescued by the United States  Coast Guard cutter Tamaroa.   In addition, in 1998, the 106th Rescue Wing carried out the longest  overwater rescue mission in an HH-60. Members of their wing were also  on scene at Ground Zero during the 9/11 terror attacks.   Then, most recently, this past April, the heroic members of this  squadron saved several lives when an explosion occurred on a Slovenian  cargo ship. These brave airmen took immediate action when called upon  to offer desperately needed medical assistance.   On April 24, the cargo ship Tamar was rocked by an explosion in the  forward bulkhead, which resulted in the immediate death of one  individual and severe burns for three other crew members, one who,  sadly, perished prior to the team's arrival. 1,300 miles off the coast  of Cape Cod at the time of the explosion and holding a crew of over 20  men, the situation looked dire for the injured members of this crew.   Boston Rescue Coordination Center was initially contacted for help,  who reached out to two Canadian vessels in the area. However, these  ships were 12 to 24 hours away, at the very least, and did not possess  the necessary medical capability. It was then that the 106th Rescue  Wing was called into immediate action to save those lives aboard the  vessel.   Less than 2 hours after the request was made by the Coast Guard, this  seven-member crew, led by Major Sean Boughal, boarded a C-130 Hercules  aircraft from the 102nd Rescue Squadron, also a part of the 106th  Rescue Wing, to begin the search and rescue. Following a 5-hour flight  and superb airmanship by the C-130 crew, the seven-man PJ team executed  a complex night parachute insertion of equipment and personnel into the  water and then made their way to the stricken vessel.   After making it onboard, the 103rd Rescue Squadron PJ team provided  advanced medical care for the next 2 days until a Portuguese rescue  helicopter could hoist the team off and airlift the injured seamen to a  higher level of medical care. If not for the brave actions of this  rescue wing, there could very well have been a greater loss of life  upon that vessel.   Mr. Speaker, these pararescuemen risked life and limb to save these  crew members and have more than earned our respect and admiration.  Today I would like to honor Major Edward Boughal, Technical Sergeant  Jordan St. Clair, Major Marty Viera, Senior Master Sergeant Erik Blom,  Master Sergeant Jed Smith, Staff Sergeant Bryan Dalere, and Senior  Airman Michael Hartman for their lifesaving efforts on April 24.                                time  1045    Not only today, but every day, men and women, like those in the 106th  Rescue Wing, put themselves on the line to protect us, our families,  and our communities. It is so important that we continue to give our  support to our Nation's defenders and provide every needed resource for  these heroes. All Americans should be very proud of the 106th Rescue  Wing and their continued legacy of remarkably answering the call to  duty.                            ____________________
