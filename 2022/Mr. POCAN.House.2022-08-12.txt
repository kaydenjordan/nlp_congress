 Mr. Speaker, global inflation caused by our reopening due  to COVID-19 has caused increased prices in everything from gasoline to  groceries to healthcare.   Today, we put people over politics as we lessen the impact of global  inflation on the American people via the Inflation Reduction Act.   Among the many things it does, it addresses some of the drivers of  higher energy costs while also investing in U.S.-based renewable energy  that will make us more energy independent and less dirty.   It finally allows us to negotiate lower prescription drug prices  through volume purchasing via Medicare while capping out-of-pocket drug  expenses for seniors to no more than $2,000 per year.   We make these big investments by ensuring that corporations that have  often gamed the system pay a minimal share of taxes and go after  wealthy tax cheats who, all too often, have evaded their  responsibilities.   I will gladly vote for this bill today. It is time to stand up to Big  Pharma and those energy companies making record profits while making  our planet less safe, and it is important we make sure that  corporations pay their fair share of taxes to reduce the burden on  working families.
