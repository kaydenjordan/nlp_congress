 Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking my good  friend and Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congresswoman  Beatty, for hosting this Special Order Hour and to Congresswoman  Jackson Lee and Congressman Torres for anchoring it.   Mr. Speaker, this is a consequential moment in our nation's history.   On the tail end of a once-in-a-century pandemic--one that has  resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, record unemployment rates,  and that has left our economy counting the costs--we are in desperate  need of substantive relief in all aspects of our society. We need bold  action, from bold leadership, in order to deliver bold results--and  that's what we have in President Biden's Build Back Better agenda. This  agenda is a real opportunity to make historic, transformative  investments in projects and programs that are supported by an  overwhelming majority of the American people.   As a Senior Member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee, I fought to include several provisions in this agenda  through the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act that would greatly  benefit communities not only in my district, but across the country.  These include funding for a program that provides federal dollars to  reconnect and revitalize communities historically harmed and  marginalized by the construction of the Interstate Highway System;  language to ensure prompt payment and sufficient payments to minority  and disadvantaged subcontractors; and legislation to establish an  electric grid resilience program for states like Texas to weatherize  their power grids. Each of these measures--though different in nature  and purpose--will collectively contribute to the rebuilding of our  economy by creating more good-paying, equitable job opportunities.   And as Chairwoman of the House Science, Space, and Technology  Committee, I am steadfastly committed to strengthening our nation's  research and innovation capabilities through the Build Back Better  Act--both to ensure our continued international competitiveness and the  wellbeing of our citizens here at home. I believe that investments in  research and development now will pay untold dividends for the future  health and prosperity of our nation, which is why we put resources in  this bill that will help us address the climate crisis, rebuild after  this pandemic, promote innovation, and renew and repair our research  infrastructure. It also makes an unprecedented investment in the  National Science Foundation, tapping into the diverse talent and  institutions from across our nation. We need a STEM workforce that  represents the rich diversity of America--because we cannot continue to  lead in science and technology if we do not tap into all the brainpower  our nation has to offer. To make sure of this, we included a provision  that provides resources to support research capacity building at our  nation's minority-serving institutions and invests in research,  scholarships, and fellowships across all STEM disciplines.   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus has been and will  continue to be at the forefront of these negotiations. Fifty-seven  members--and six committee chairs--strong, our presence at the table,  on behalf of our diverse constituencies, remains steadfast and will  ultimately serve as the driving force behind our work For the People.                            ____________________
