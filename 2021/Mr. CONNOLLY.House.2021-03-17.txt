 Madam Speaker, my amendment would strengthen the Sexual  Assault Survivors' Bill of Rights by providing survivors the right to  be informed of the status and location of their sexual assault evidence  collection kit.   The Survivors' Bill of Rights was enacted in 2016 and provides  fundamental protections to survivors, including: the right to receive a  free medical forensic examination; the right to have a sexual assault  kit preserved and to be informed of any results related to the  examination including a DNA profile match or toxicology reports; the  right to be informed of any disposal of a kit; and the right to prevent  such disposal if desired.   These are important protections that can be funded through Federal  grants made available through the Victims of Crime Act.   This amendment would add one additional and critical protection to  that bill of rights.   It would entitle survivors to know the status and location of their  kits, providing greater transparency to how kits are handled and  tracked by hospitals, forensic professionals, and law enforcement.   My home state of Virginia launched just such a tracking program in  2019.   In Virginia, each kit has a unique bar code and each survivor is  provided with a PIN that allows them to track the status of their kit  online.   Privacy concerns are allayed by the fact that no personally  identifying information is included in the tracking system, and it is  entirely up to the survivor whether or not they want to report their  assault to law enforcement.   This is a transformative transparency regime for a process that has  far too long been kept in the shadows, which has given rise to backlogs  and anxiety among survivors about the status of their kits and whether  they are being used to hold their attackers accountable.   The amendment is about empowering survivors, and I urge its adoption.
