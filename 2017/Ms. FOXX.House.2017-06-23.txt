 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 2, line 2, before the period, insert the following:       ``in an in-demand industry sector or occupation identified by       the appropriate State or local workforce development board''.        Page 5, after line 13, insert the following:        ``(C) describes the State's policies in effect during the       fiscal year--        ``(i) to ensure nondisplacement as required under paragraph       (4)(A); and        ``(ii) to implement grievance procedures as required in       (4)(B), including information on the number of grievance       claims filed in the preceding fiscal year and the aggregate       results of those claims;''.        Page 5, line 14, redesignate subparagraph (C) as       subparagraph (D).        Page 5, line 18, redesignate subparagraph (D) as       subparagraph (E).        Page 5, line 22, redesignate subparagraph (E) as       subparagraph (F).    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 396, the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment to H.R. 2842, Accelerating  Individuals into the Workforce Act, would make two changes to the bill.  The first part of the amendment would encourage the demonstration  projects created under this bill to direct beneficiaries toward jobs in  an in-demand industry sector or occupation, as identified by workforce  boards in their States and local communities.   Today, in this country, there are approximately 6 million jobs that  remain unfilled because they require technical skills and knowledge  related specifically to an industry or occupation. If we want to help  participants move from government assistance and hold a job, then we  must set them on a path toward jobs and industries that are currently,  and will remain, competitive in the evolving 21st century economy.   The second part of my amendment would include in the reports from  States that establish these demonstration projects information about  their efforts to ensure nondisplacement of workers and to address  grievance claims. Congress' future decisions related to similar  programs will be enhanced by having access to this information and data  reported from the States.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5119]]        Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.   The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5  minutes.   There was no objection.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would  further strengthen the protections against displacement of current  employees. I think it is a goal that we all share to make sure that  this bill expands employment, rather than just changing who is  employed.   I plan to support the gentlewoman's amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as our economy continues to recover and  evolve, it is critical that job seekers have the resources needed to  gain the skills they need to compete for in-demand jobs. That was the  aim of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act that we passed in  2014, and my amendment encourages State agencies to coordinate with  their workforce boards to continue these efforts.   My amendment also would improve the information participating States  submit about their demonstration projects, providing important data for  decisionmakers in the future. I thank my colleagues for their  consideration and ask for their support of this amendment and the  underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).   The amendment was agreed to.                     Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Bost    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in  House Report 115-187.
