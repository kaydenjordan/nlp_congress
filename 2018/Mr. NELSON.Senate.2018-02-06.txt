 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I make an  announcement and then defer to Senator King and then that it come back  to me for my statement about offshore drilling.    Thank you, Mr. President.                             Falcon Heavy Rocket    Just a few minutes ago, the largest rocket since the Moon program,  the Saturn V, launched from the Kennedy Space Center. People across the  world saw it on TV, as well as over the internet. Thousands of people  lined the beaches at the Kennedy Space Center.   Perhaps even more impressive is that this rocket, with three Falcon  9s strapped together--27 engines--took a payload for its first test  flight. It was so successful that the two side Falcon 9s, with the  center core of the Falcon 9--we watched in amazement as they returned  to Earth, 100 yards apart on two landing zones at the Cape Canaveral  Air Force Station.   At liftoff, the Falcon Heavy generates 500 million pounds of thrust  and is twice as powerful as any other rocket currently flying.  Especially with the ability to land and reuse the boosters, it promises  to be a very affordable way to get to space.   The test launch of the Falcon Heavy is a spectacular demonstration of  the comeback of Florida's Space Coast and of the U.S. commercial launch  sector, which is succeeding in a big way. Last year, we tied the all- time record for the number of U.S. commercial launches. That is good  news for the civil space program; it is good news for national  security; it is good news for employment in the United States; and it  is great news for jobs and the economy.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I see my good friend the Senator from New  Jersey here, and I just want to make a few comments, since I have been  at the center of this firestorm.   I am here again to talk about the mess that has been created by the  5-year drilling plan. Some of the reasons I have talked about it so  much go beyond the fact that it is disastrous and dangerous, not only  for all the coastal States but for our State of Florida, which has more  beaches than any other State and is surrounded by test range. Indeed,  just today, the largest rocket since the Apollo program to the Moon has  brought back two of its boosters that didn't have to fall into the  ocean. But some may, and you simply cannot have oil rigs out there in  the Atlantic where we are testing our military rockets, such as today-- a commercial rocket, the Falcon Heavy, has dropped its initial stages.  The same is true with the military on the west coast.   The largest testing and training area for the U.S. military in the  world is the eastern Gulf of Mexico off of Florida. That is why it is  off limits in law for another 5 years, until the year 2022, and we need  to expand that.   Well, my colleagues have endured me so many times as I have talked  about how disastrous it would be, but now we have a different wrinkle  with the Department of the Interior. They first published a proposal  that would open up nearly every inch of coastline of the entire United  States. You are hearing all of these coastal Senators speak against it.   They pick up on the eastern gulf off of Florida; since it is off  limits in law until year 2022, they pick up there and start wanting to  drill out there. Can you imagine what that would do to the U.S. Air  Force, which runs the eastern gulf test range?   Well, look what happened. They published this, and then the very next  day--24 hours later--the Secretary of the Interior jetted off to  Tallahassee for a 20-minute press conference at the Tallahassee airport  and announced that Florida was off the table. It was an obvious,  transparent, political stunt, but it created enormous uncertainty about  what was truly under consideration for drilling.   What did ``off the table''--in order to try to satisfy Florida's  incumbent Governor--mean? Does it apply to the Atlantic coast of  Florida, as well, or just to the gulf coast? Is it the whole moratorium  area of the eastern gulf? Does it include the Straits of Florida off  the delicate Florida Keys, or will it be carved in half to appease the  oil industry in the eastern Gulf of Mexico?    The administration--specifically Secretary Zinke--is playing fast and  loose with a process that affects millions of people in the State of  Florida, and Floridians deserve to know what is going on. That is why I  sounded the alarm immediately, within 10 minutes after Secretary  Zinke's announcement.   I have been through this process before--ever since I was a young  Congressman representing the east coast of Florida--with a Secretary of  the Interior, James Watt, who wanted to drill off the east coast of  Florida. In fact, back then, in the mid-1980s, we were launching our  military rockets, just as we do today, and the space shuttle was  dropping its solid rocket boosters.   These 5-year plans are supposed to be developed over the course of 1  or 2 years with extensive input from the public, agency staff, the  industries involved, and the environmental community. Five-year plans  aren't supposed to be a goody bag of political favors, and they can't  be undone by the Secretary's press conference or a tweet. That was  confirmed by a career employee, Walter Cruickshank, the Acting Director  of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. He said that at a  House committee hearing. It is no wonder the attorneys general from 12  coastal States wrote to the Secretary to warn him that he should  terminate the draft proposal--terminate it entirely--or else they were  going to pursue their appropriate legal avenues.   The whole process has been fraught with confusion because it was a  political stunt, and as a result, we have a bunch of Senators out here  fighting to make known what is happening. At the same time, the  Interior Department is trying to open up America's entire coastline to  drilling. They are also working to undo all the commonsense safety  standards that were put in place after the Deepwater Horizon oilspill  that spilled 5 million barrels of oil into the gulf and killed 11  workers on the rig. Those safety standards include requirements like  making sure an independent third party, such as a professional  engineer, certifies the offshore drilling safety equipment, such as the  blowout preventer. That malfunctioned 5 miles below the surface of the  gulf when it did not cut off the oil at the wellhead on the floor of  the ocean, and it allowed those 5 million barrels to be spilled. Now  Secretary Zinke wants to go backward in time and reverse all of those  safety standards. The American people deserve better than this.  Floridians certainly deserve better than this.   I want to thank my fellow Senators for getting out here and raising  such a ruckus so that we can get the American people to focus on what  is happening and the political stunts that are being done by the  Secretary of the Interior.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have been involved in a number of  elections over the years. I love campaigns, and I love campaigning. I  have always campaigned in a situation in which you have your opponent,  and the people have a chance to make a judgment between you and your  opponent as to who can best serve the people. Little did I ever think  that I was going to have to fight against the Russians in a campaign.  Yet that is what I fully expect, and that is what I expect a number of  us who are up in November of this year will be having to do because, in  the midst of all of the disinformation that we have seen that the  Russians are very good at--all of the fake accounts on Twitter and  Facebook, the internet trolls, the botnets--it is critically important  that the American people understand this is a fundamental attempt by  Russia to influence our very democratic institutions and our critical  infrastructure; and our elections, indeed, are a part of that critical  infrastructure.   Last year, the intelligence community assessed that when Putin sees  his attempt to influence the last election as a success, he is going to  do it again. That is what the intelligence community's conclusion was.  Then, just last week, the Director of the CIA said that he had every  expectation that Russia will meddle in the 2018 midterm elections.   As the Senator from Maryland just said and as the Senator from Rhode  Island has already said, this is not a partisan issue. It could happen  to both sides. Attempts to influence our elections are attacks on the  very foundation of the democracy that we so cherish. That is really  what the Russians are trying to do. They are trying to divide us, and  they are trying to undermine faith in our democratic institutions.  Ultimately, they are trying to undermine American leadership in the  world community of nations. The bottom line is we have to do more to  protect ourselves, and we have to make Mr. Putin feel enough pain to  deter future attacks or else he is going to keep doing it.   Now, this Senator has the privilege of being the ranking member of  the Cybersecurity Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. I must  say that this Senator has sat through hearings with people who ought to  know, and I have been appalled at how little we have or will have the  capability of responding. It is going to take some resolve not only in  this Senate, in this Congress, but in this administration, as well, to  let Mr. Putin know that he is going to have pain if he continues the  attacks that he has already made.   Of course, there is another aspect to this threat, which is that  Russia didn't just attack our democracy in America, as has been stated  so effectively by previous speakers, but he is in Europe and in Latin  America too. Look at what the Russians have done with the Spanish  language propaganda television, RT. There is an RT en Espanol that has  already targeted upcoming elections in Mexico and Colombia--two of our  important partners in the hemisphere. The President's National Security  Adviser, General McMaster, said recently that there was already  evidence of Russian meddling in Mexico.   Of course, this points to the Russian effort to destabilize the  region. It has sought to gain influence through propaganda, arms sales,  trade, and other means to challenge the United States in the Western  Hemisphere and to undermine our partnerships, which are critical to our  national security. Look at Russia's friends Cuba and Nicaragua.   How about Venezuela?   The reality is that Russia is propping up the Maduro dictatorship in  Venezuela. For years, the Maduro crowd has stolen and used the state- owned oil company Pe De Vesa to launder money, and Russia has bailed  them out. Russian money has helped Maduro to avoid defaulting on debts  and payments to bondholders. Meanwhile, look what is happening to the  poor people of Venezuela. They are hungry, and they don't have basic  supplies. Their children are malnourished, and inflation is rampant.  Maduro has undermined any remnants of Venezuela's democracy. He jails  opponents and has a corrupt Congress and cracks down on protesters. It  is all part of the Russian influence campaign.   As you can see, countering Russian influence is critical for the  United States and for the world. It is also important to remember that  Putin can't beat us on the ground, that he can't beat us on the sea,  and that he can't beat us under the sea. He can't beat us in the air,  and he can't beat us in space, but he can beat us in cyber in his  propaganda campaign.   Yet Putin--that Russian bear--is not 10-feet tall. As a former  Secretary of State just testified last week to our Armed Services  Committee, Putin is playing a weak hand, but he is playing it very  aggressively. It is time for us, the USA, to push back.   I yield the floor.
