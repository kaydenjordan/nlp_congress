 Madam Speaker, this week is National Police Week, and we  recognize the bravery of our law enforcement officers and honor the  lives of those tragically lost in the line of duty.   Whether they are keeping deadly drugs off our streets, combating  crime in our communities, or acting as emergency responders, our local  police do lifesaving work each and every day. They have been asked to  do more with less, often taking on additional responsibilities without  additional resources.   In my district, I recently toured the local police department which  currently operates out of an attic because they lack the funds to  upgrade their facilities. Other departments struggle to recruit and  retain officers and upgrade aging equipment. This is unacceptable.  Congress must step in to invest in our local departments.   We have to deliver sufficient funding to our local law enforcement  that will ensure they can do their jobs keeping our communities safe.   I am grateful for the brave men and women of law enforcement who put  on the uniform to serve and protect, and I am thankful for their family  members who serve alongside them.                            ____________________
