 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  the U.S. relationship with Turkey and certain actions that the U.S.  must consider in order to protect our national security interests and  those of our true allies in the region.   Today, more than ever, we need strong allies and partners in Europe.  As the Trump administration does nearly everything in its power to  erode our alliances and denigrate our closest friends, we find  increasingly emboldened regimes in Russia and China. The U.S. cannot  stand up to them alone. Throughout the Cold War, our diplomats worked  assiduously to build strong bonds with allies, knowing that having  close partners was better than having enemies on the world stage.   Our strongest allies should be those in NATO, those that have made a  treaty commitment to mutual defense, those who share our values, those  who work in concert with us to face the threat from countries like  Russia and Iran with common cause. Unfortunately, Turkey under Erdogan  embodies none of those things. Today, I would like to lay out a fact  pattern that so many of my colleagues have come to see in recent weeks,  that Turkey under Erdogan should not, Turkey under Erdogan cannot be  seen as an ally.   How many more times do we need to see Turkey betray the values upon  which NATO was established? How many more times do we need to see  President Erdogan visit Moscow, Sochi, or any other Russian city to  kiss Putin's ring? How many more journalists need to be locked up by  Erdogan before we stop calling Turkey a democracy?   Enough is enough. Over my 27 years in the House and the Senate, I  have followed developments in the Eastern Mediterranean quite closely.  Turkey's  [[Page S6373]]  invasion of Cyprus in 1974 was a shocking attempt to redraw borders in  Europe in the wake of World War II. To this day, Turkey's invasion of  northern Cyprus must be see for what it is: an illegal occupation that  must end. Turkey's action over those days in 1974 were not the actions  of a democratic country. They were not the actions of a reliable ally.  They were not the actions of a responsible actor on the world stage.   But the events of 1974 would only presage Turkey's aggressive posture  in the eastern Mediterranean in the years to come. To this day, Turkey  under Erdogan continues to aggressively bully international energy  companies, including U.S. companies, and the Republic of Cyprus. Their  sin? Conducting completely legitimate exploration in the Cypriot  Exclusive Economic Zone. This is not territory under dispute or an  issue for debate. Turkey's hostility towards these companies is the  kind of gunboat diplomacy that belongs to eras past and has no place in  today's world.   Examples abound where Turkey continues to operate in bad faith when  it comes to Cyprus. It could abide by UN Security Council resolutions  to transfer the fenced area of Varosha, Farmagusta to the  administration of the United Nations.   These calls to return this area to its original inhabitants, whom  Turkey ejected during the 1974 invasion, have gone unheeded. Instead,  several Turkish Ministers have recently visited and threatened to move  forward with commercial development--a true affront to those forced  from their land more than 40 years ago, as well as to the U.N. Security  Council resolution.   In the eastern Mediterranean, for years Turkey has also aggressively  violated the airspace of neighboring Greece, also a NATO ally. These  dangerous maneuvers have threatened the lives and safety of Greek  pilots, as well as civilians living on the islands below. Greece wants  a good neighbor in Turkey and has sought to find common ground upon a  constructive relationship. But with these airspace violations, Turkey  has shown its true colors, and the international community must come to  terms with this.   We have seen Turkey's belligerence abroad manifest itself even here  in the United States. Who can forget when President Erdogan's  bodyguards attacked U.S. citizens in a Washington park peacefully  demonstrating, as is their constitutional right? And as momentum builds  following the passage of the Armenian genocide resolution in the House  of Representatives, Turkey and its lobbyists are working overtime to  block it in the Senate because they know that if this resolution, which  both I, Senator Cruz, and bipartisan Members on both sides have  sponsored, were to come to the floor for a vote, it would pass  resoundingly and send a clarion message that recognizes the truth. The  Armenian genocide happened, it was a monstrous act, and those who deny  it are complicit in a terrible lie. Genocide is genocide. The Senate  should not bow to this pressure. It cannot bow to this pressure. Let's  pass this resolution today.   Erdogan's behavior abroad has roots inside of Turkey, where the  democratic process has significantly eroded and religious freedom is  under sustained pressure. In particular, the Ecumenical Patriarch  Bartholomew of the Greek Orthodox Church--and its community--faces dire  consequences as the spiritual head of the world's second largest  Christian church. His church properties have been confiscated, and  President Erdogan restricts his religious freedom. This is wrong, and  his All Holiness deserves our attention and our ongoing support. For  those who speak about religious freedom in this Chamber--and I admire  the many who have--as well as on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, this is also an issue of religious freedom.   Of course, Erdogan's repression of his own citizens does not stop  with restricting religious freedom. Following its emergency decree  after a failed coup attempt, Turkish authorities engaged in a draconian  crackdown and roundup of citizens across the country. The U.N. reports  that close to 160,000 people were arrested in an 18-month period,  including over 100 women who were pregnant or had just given birth,  often on grounds of nothing more than that they were associated with  their husbands, many of whom were suspects on trumped-up charges.   As we examine Turkey's increasingly destructive role in the world, we  must never turn a blind eye from those Turkish citizens who want a more  democratic future for themselves and their families.   In July, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed my Eastern  Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act with a strong  bipartisan vote. We are working for full passage in the Senate, and I  understand the House Foreign Affairs Committee will mark up the  legislation soon.   I traveled to Greece and Cypress in the spring and told leaders in  both places that this was not--not--an anti-Turkey bill and that we all  wanted Turkey to be a constructive and democratic partner in the  region. At the time, this vision seemed a long ways off, but now, given  Erdogan's recent choices, it has become virtually impossible. Let's  review events since my visit to the region in the spring of this year.   First, Erdogan took delivery of the S-400 air defense system from  Russia. Let me repeat. Turkey, a supposed NATO ally, purchased an air  defense system from NATO's main adversary--the reason that NATO largely  came to be. This choice endangered the security of the United States  and other NATO partners. The United States made a good offer of the  Patriot missile system--an offer that would have maintained the  security equilibrium in the region and enabled Turkey to remain a NATO  member in good standing. That offer was rejected.   The Trump administration did the right thing in removing Turkey from  the F-35 program. It was clear to all involved that the S-400 could not  be parked next to an F-35. After all, it is meant and it is intended to  be able to shoot down an F-35--this from a NATO ally.   But the administration has fallen well short of its obligations under  the law. Under the CAATSA law, which I helped write, the administration  is required to sanction any entity that conducts a significant  transaction with the Russian military or intelligence sectors. This  provision of law is not permissive. It is not optional. Under no  credible definition would the purchase of an S-400 Russian system not  be considered significant. The administration is breaking the law by  ignoring this provision and kowtowing to Ankara. According to U.S. law,  Turkey must be sanctioned for the S-400 system, and it should happen  today. Otherwise, it will send a global message that we are not serious  about sanctioning significant transactions with the Russian military.   Some have said that such an approach is unwarranted and unwise lest  we push Erdogan into Putin's arms. He is already there. He clearly is  already there.   In a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in Syria, I held up  this poster, and I asked the Secretary of State: What is wrong with  this picture? This picture of President Erdogan, President Putin,  and President Rouhani of Iran says everything--says everything. They  are two of our biggest foreign policy challengers. And who is there  with them? Erdogan. I argued that we were ceding American leadership in  Syria and the region to leaders and countries whose policies were  intrinsically at odds with our own. Unfortunately, today we are seeing  the terrible consequences of this abdication of leadership.    Erdogan's warm relationship with Putin should ring alarm bells across  the NATO alliance, raising concerns about NATO's exposure at Incirlik  and intelligence vulnerabilities with respect to the alliance's  presence in Turkey. It raises concerns about how Erdogan and Putin may  be working together to counter U.S. interests across the Middle East,  in the Balkans, and around the world. NATO is an alliance of shared  values. None of those values are respected--none of them--by the  current occupant of the Kremlin or in Ankara.   Second, provided with a green light from the Trump administration,  President Erdogan's invasion of Syria to attack our Kurdish partners is  an unconscionable act of brutality that has caused death and untold  suffering among our Kurdish friends and partners. Tens of thousands  have fled the area, creating an even greater problem  [[Page S6374]]  of refugees in that war-torn region. The consequences of these actions  by Turkey and its proxies will persist for years to come.   Turkey's incursion poses a direct threat to U.S. national security  interests in the region, not the least of which is by facilitating  Russian foreign policy ambitions in the region and opening the door for  ISIS to reconstitute.   At its inception, Turkey did not take the threat of ISIS seriously  enough, and in the early days, ISIS's ability to easily traverse the  Turkish-Syrian border bolstered its ability to grow in strength and  numbers. Turkey did nothing--nothing--to stop them, did nothing to stop  foreign fighters going into Syria. While Turkey has legitimate security  concerns from the PKK, its singular focus on extending this feat to the  whole Kurdish population risks its ability to effectively confront  other terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qaida.   There must be a full accounting by Turkey of these atrocities. That  is why I am today introducing an expedited resolution of request for  the Secretary of State to inform the Senate in 30 days of the extent of  Turkey's human rights abuses in Syria. This resolution invokes  statutory authority under the Foreign Assistance Act to require the  Secretary of State to assess and report to Congress on Turkey's human  rights abuses in Syria. This resolution calls for the administration to  provide all available information concerning alleged violations of  internationally recognized human rights by Turkey, its armed forces,  and associated groups in Syria. It calls for a description of the steps  the United States has taken to promote Turkey's respect of human rights  in its Syria operations. The resolution also calls for a determination  of whether Turkey's actions have resulted in the release of ISIS or  other extremists inside of Syria.   I am also working closely with the chairman of the Foreign Relations  Committee, Senator Risch, on the Promoting American National Security  and Preventing the Resurgence of ISIS Act of 2019, which would impose  targeted sanctions on Turkey for its actions in Syria. A similar  bipartisan measure passed the House last week, and I urge the Senate to  deliberate on the measure. Based on changing circumstances on the  ground, we are updating the language to condition sanctions based on  Turkey's actions. I hope it will be marked up in the coming days.   For years, the world held out hope that Turkey could be the bridge  between east and west--a democratic, secular country that could be a  democracy in Europe and a responsible actor on the world stage. I, for  one, was always skeptical but certainly supported the sentiment. Today  we are the furthest from that dream we have ever been. The most  imprisoned journalists in the world--in the world--are not in North  Korea, Russia, or Iran; they languish in Turkish prisons. This doesn't  happen in a democracy.   As international pressure mounted following Turkey's invasion of  northern Syria, Erdogan threatened to unleash thousands of refugees  onto the European Union's shores, a wave like we saw in 2015. These  aren't the statements of a rational, responsible actor. Yet where is  U.S. policy? The Trump administration was its normal erratic self in  recent weeks as it flailed from sanctions on Turkey to claiming  victory. The Kurds are the ones who emerged as the clear loser. Erdogan  was eager to sign on to the Pence-Pompeo plan because it gave him all  he wanted--full control of the Kurdish areas of Syria and carte blanche  to wipe out swaths of the community.   In addition to claiming victory, President Trump now wants to invite  Erdogan to Washington with open arms. Stunning. The photo of Trump and  Erdogan in the Oval Office will not only be the nail in the coffin for  any Kurdish aspirations to live in peace and security, it will also be  the death knell for any credibility the United States hopes to maintain  with any combat partners in the future.   President Trump, I urge you to cancel this invitation and side with  the bipartisan consensus in the Senate and the House that Turkey, under  Erdogan, is no friend to the United States. Do not ruin our reputation  further by fawning over yet another authoritarian leader. You want to  repair the damage that has been done? Show our commitment to our allies  by inviting the Syrian Kurdish leadership to the Oval Office for a  meeting on how we prevent a resurgence of ISIS. That is how you protect  our interests. That is how you protect our national security.   It is time to challenge Erdogan to live up to NATO's values and to  respect the international order. It is time to stop enabling Turkey to  be a bad actor. It is time for the Senate to act.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I am honored to rise today in  recognition of the late John H. Adler on the occasion of the dedication  of the John H. Adler Memorial Park at Challenge Grove in Cherry Hill,  NJ.   The Honorable John H. Adler was a remarkable public servant who  worked tirelessly on behalf of New Jersey residents for decades.  Growing up in southern New Jersey, John worked hard in school and  overcame many personal challenges to earn his undergraduate and law  degrees from Harvard University before returning home to Camden County.  He began a selfless career in  [[Page S6390]]  public service in 1987 when he was elected to the Cherry Hill Township  Committee. In 1992, he went on to represent New Jersey's Sixth  Legislative District in the State's senate, where he served until 2008.  There, he rose to the chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee  and served on the Environmental Committee. One of John's signature  achievements, New Jersey's Smoke-Free Air Act, has greatly improved the  lives of New Jerseyans and will undoubtedly continue to positively  impact the health and well-being of our State's residents for  generations.   In 2008, John was elected to the House of Representatives, becoming  the first Democratic lawmaker to represent New Jersey's Third  Congressional District in more than a century. Upon his arrival on  Capitol Hill, John quickly established a reputation for hard work,  compromise, and compassion. He advocated forcefully for seniors,  members of the armed services and veterans, and the environment. He  recognized the strategic and military importance of Joint Base McGuire- Dix-Lakehurst and sought to attract new missions to help preserve the  installation's role in our national defense. He was well known for  working across the aisle and overcoming partisanship to accomplish  meaningful legislation to the benefit of our families and constituents.   I am honored to have served with John both in the New Jersey  Legislature and as members of New Jersey's Congressional Delegation.  John represented the very best of our lawmakers, and his sudden passing  in 2011 was an immense loss to the Garden State. Today, John's wife,  Shelley, and their sons, Jeffrey, Alex, Andrew, and Oliver, continue to  carry on his legacy of service and extraordinary dedication to our  friends, neighbors, and communities.   Mr. President, I acknowledge and commend the Camden County Board of  Freeholders on the dedication of the John H. Adler Memorial Park at  Challenge Grove as a fitting tribute to remember one of New Jersey's  most honorable sons. I would like to once again recognize, applaud, and  remember the Honorable John H. Adler's extraordinary life and his  service to the people of New Jersey.                            ____________________
