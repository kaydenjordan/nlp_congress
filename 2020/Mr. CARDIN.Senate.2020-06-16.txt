 Madam President, it was 2015, shortly after the death of  Freddie Gray in police custody in Baltimore, that I was in Sand Town,  the community in which Freddie Gray grew up, meeting with community  leaders, many of whom I had known for many, many years.   We had an honest discussion about how policing in Baltimore had  unfolded. I was surprised to hear that these community leaders who  wanted safety in their community felt that they could not confide with  the police because they did not want people from their communities  subjected to the discriminatory policing of the Baltimore City police  force.   I had another meeting during that time with a group of African- American families. Everyone told me the story about how they feared  particularly when their young African-American sons went into the  community because of the fear that they would be discriminated against  and hurt by the police. That fear was real.   As a result of the Freddie Gray tragedy, we requested a pattern-and- practice investigation by the Department of Justice, and what was  discovered during that investigation was that the policies of the  Baltimore City Police Department's zero tolerance to crack down on  crime were used to profile the African-American community. In many  cases, the police presence in the community provoked the violence and  added to the harm of the people in the community.   I wanted to take this opportunity to thank Senator Booker and Senator  Harris for putting together a bill that we need to take up on the floor  of the Senate as quickly as possible: the Justice in Policing Act. It  contains many provisions that, quite frankly, should have been enacted  well before now.   The tragic deaths of George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks just underscore  the importance for us to act now. We need to debate these issues, and  we need to pass legislation.   I am grateful for Senator Booker including two provisions that I had  filed as legislation in several Congresses. One is the End Racial and  Religious Profiling Act, a bill I filed a while ago.   I think many of us remember the Trayvon Martin tragic loss, profiled  because of the color of his skin. Racial or religious profiling targets  a class of Americans for discriminatory treatment. It is not when you  have individual information about a specific crime and indicators; it  is when you target a community for special treatment.   It is wrong. It is wrong because it is against the values of America  of equality and justice. It is wrong because it wastes resources which  are so valuable to keep our communities safe. It is wrong because it  turns communities against police. If we are going to have effective law  enforcement, the community and police need to work together, not at  odds. It is wrong because it becomes deadly. Too many innocent people  have lost their lives because of discriminatory profiling. It is time  for this practice to end in America.   I want to applaud the Obama administration because they took action  at the Federal law enforcement level to make racial profiling illegal,  but it still takes place in local law enforcement. The legislation  included in the Justice in Policing Act would make that illegal. It  would prohibit it, and it provides for ways to enforce, to make sure  that police departments comply with it.   It also provides for training so law enforcement understands what  racial profiling is all about. It also provides for us to get the data  so we know exactly what is happening at all levels of policing, whether  State, local, or auxiliary.   The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights testified on the  issue of discriminatory profiling last week, and I want to share some  of the testimony of Vanita Gupta. She testified:         The equal treatment of all people, regardless of       background, class, or characteristic, protects and preserves       public safety and builds legitimacy in police. Discriminatory       policing, which targets people of color more often than       others, has serious consequences not only for individuals and       communities but also for law enforcement and society, by       fostering distrust in law enforcement. . . . Through policy,       training, and practice, law enforcement agencies can work to       prevent and hold officers accountable for discriminatory       policing, and reduce and mitigate its disparate impact on       marginal communities.    I want to thank her for her testimony, and I want to thank Senator  Booker for including those provisions that would end this practice in  the Justice in Policing Act.   There is a second bill that I have introduced for several Congresses:  the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act. It provides for  performance-based standards for police officers. It embraces  accreditation standards based upon President Obama's Task Force on 21st  Century Policing. It does provide for training and oversight and proper  investigations for those police officers who have crossed the line. It  enhanced the pattern-and-practice discrimination cases so that consent  decrees can be effective in ending these wrong practices.   I am pleased that these two provisions are included in the Justice in  Policing Act, as well as so many other important changes for reform and  accountability in law enforcement: the no-knock warrants, the standard  that we hold officers accountable who have lost the trust of the  American people, the registry so that law enforcement can know by  background checks whether particular applicants have been involved in  instances in other jurisdictions.   All these are very, very important provisions that we need to act on  and we need to act on now. Let us work together to guarantee equal  justice under law and fulfill the promise of our Constitution in order  to form a more perfect union, establish justice, and ensure domestic  tranquility.   Let this Nation finally guarantee equal justice under the law.   I yield the floor
