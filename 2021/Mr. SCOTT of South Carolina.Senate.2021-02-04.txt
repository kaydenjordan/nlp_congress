 Madam President, I call up my amendment  No. 53 and ask that it be reported by number.    Colleagues, as of last month, two out of  every five COVID-related deaths in this country are either residents of  nursing homes or the staff of nursing homes.   Inaccurate information affects life-and-death decisions for  communities. Requiring States to provide accurate data is common sense  for anyone who believes, as I do, that we should have a science-based,  fact-driven response to this pandemic.   We should not offer more funding to States that have mismanaged and  then covered up their pandemic response until they fix it. It simply  makes no sense. That is why my colleagues should join me in supporting  this amendment.    Madam President, how much time do I have  left on my 60 seconds?    I look forward to working with Senator  Casey on the committee, and he is a person I have great respect for.   I would simply say that it is the responsibility of the Governors of  these States to report accurate information. This is not a political  debate.
