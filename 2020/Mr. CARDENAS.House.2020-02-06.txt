 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong  opposition to President Trump's constant efforts to gut Medicaid.   Let's be clear. This is another attempt by President Trump to take  healthcare away from millions of Americans. This block grant proposal  is the latest step in Trump's ongoing efforts to end the Affordable  Care Act. Trump is, tragically, trying to affect the most vulnerable in  our country: children, people with disabilities, low-income families,  and seniors.   According to a recent study, this proposal could lead to cuts of $37  billion, perhaps as much as $49 billion a year of healthcare benefits  to our American citizens.   Just 2 days ago, President Trump spoke right here in this Chamber,  saying that he is out to protect healthcare for the American people.  But once again, we see he is trying to hurt Americans when all he is  trying to do is talk one way and take actions like this against the  American people and their healthcare.   I know what it is like to not have healthcare, when I was a little  boy, when an aspirin, a prayer, and the emergency room were your only  options.   Americans should not have to suffer through that. There is no need  for it. But this President wants people to suffer.   Many of my constituents rely on Medicaid for their health coverage.  People shouldn't be forced to choose between buying medicine for their  children or putting food on their tables.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my colleagues in Congress, such as  Congressman Veasey, in supporting H. Res. 826. We will not stay silent  as this administration continues its efforts to gut and take healthcare  away from millions of Americans across our great Nation.
