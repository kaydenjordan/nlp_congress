 Mr. President, I know we are used to having a lot going  on here in Washington, DC, but this week seems like we have been hit by  a whirlwind of activity--a war in Europe, COVID-19 still lingering in  parts of the world, and then the Supreme Court found itself the victim  of an unauthorized leak of a draft opinion, which has created a lot of  furor and anxiety and misinformation.   One of the things that it has demonstrated is the need to protect the  independence of the Court.   Justice Antonin Scalia used to say that you can read the constitution  and bill of rights of a lot of countries around the world, and they  look great on paper. He mentioned that of the old Soviet Union, for  example. But he said they are just words on paper without an  independent judiciary to enforce them, and he was right.   Whoever leaked this draft document obviously intended to create a lot  of public pressure--indeed, coercion--on the sitting Justices to either  change their minds or to somehow garner a political issue that they  would be able to use to divert the American people's attention from  things like inflation, crime, the border, and the challenges to our  national security and world peace.   We have to get to the bottom of this, and I am confident that Chief  Justice Roberts will pursue that until the person who leaked it is  identified and held accountable.   But this spotlight on the Court, along with the reaction--the public  reaction that we have seen has raised another important issue, and that  is the physical safety and security of the Justices themselves and  their families.   In our increasingly polarized climate, the Justices have been  villainized and subjected to violent threats. People have even  published their home addresses so they can show up and protest on their  home, on their property, on their lawns.   This decision, which is actually a nondecision because the Supreme  Court hasn't handed down its decision--but the leaker has accomplished  his or her goal, I suppose, by creating this hostile environment for  the Justices and their families.   But, unfortunately, there are even people in this Chamber who have  contributed to that environment.   In 2019, the Democratic leader went to the Supreme Court steps and  threatened two Supreme Court Justices by name. He said:         You have released the whirlwind--    By the way, this was the day that the abortion case was argued in the  Supreme Court.   The senior Senator from New York, the majority leader, said:         You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the       price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with       these awful decisions.    And he named Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh by name.   Now, to have the senior Democrat and Senate majority leader from this  Chamber lobbing threats at sitting Justices on the Supreme Court if  they did not rule in a way he wished is dangerous.   We have wondered before about the impact of some of the irresponsible  rhetoric that occasionally occurs around here on vulnerable minds and  people who might be tempted to act based on that incitement, based on  that rhetoric. But to have this come from the majority leader himself  is just irresponsible.   This is the branch of government, which is supposed to be the adults  in the room, to operate in a way that is respectful, even with our  differences, and the Supreme Court is the branch  [[Page S2349]]  that is meant to operate free from public or political pressure.   As Chief Justice Roberts said at the time: ``Justices know that  criticism comes with the territory.'' It is a free country. People can  express themselves within limits. ``But threatening statements,'' he  said, ``of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only  inappropriate, they are dangerous,'' he said. Well, Chief Justice  Roberts is right, and subsequent events have shown that threats against  the Justices aren't going away and are becoming even more intense.    We need to take steps to improve the protection of the Justices and  their family against potential violence, and it can't wait until  something bad happens. Some political activists have already announced  their intentions to go to the private homes of the Justices. This is an  appalling violation of their personal privacy. It puts them and their  families at risk. We currently have two Justices with school-aged  children. Once Judge Jackson joins the Court when Justice Breyer steps  down, there will be three.   The Chief Justice has asked Congress to take appropriate action to  increase protection for the physical safety of the Justices and their  families, and we need to act and act with urgency.   Senator Coons, our friend from Delaware, a Democrat, and I are  introducing a bill, a bipartisan bill, obviously, called the Supreme  Court Police Parity Act to strengthen security protection for the  Justices and their families. This will ensure the Justices receive the  same protection and resources that article I and article II officers  and their families enjoy. For our present purposes, that means they  will be given the same authority that the Capitol Police already have  here on Capitol Hill.   I appreciate our friend Senator Coons working with me on this  important legislation, and I hope the entire Senate will vote on it  soon.   As far as the larger debate about the draft document that was  released, it is important to remember we don't actually know what the  Supreme Court is going to decide until it actually does decide. The  Justices are still working through the deliberative process, and our  respect for the independence of the Court requires that we let it  proceed without interference.   While tensions and emotions may be high, it is important to note that  overruling earlier Supreme Court decisions is nothing new. I looked  back and realized it was 1789 when the Supreme Court reversed its first  prior decision. Since that time, there have been 232 instances where an  earlier Supreme Court decision was overturned. And, I must say, thank  goodness the Court is willing, under some limited circumstances, to  revisit its earlier decisions.   The Court's decisions overruling earlier precedents in some cases has  fundamentally altered major aspects of our society. Without question  one of the most notable was Brown v. Board of Education. Now, Brown v.  Board of Education was a landmark ruling overruling a case called  Plessy v. Ferguson, which established a shameful ``separate but equal''  doctrine between Blacks and Whites in public transportation and public  schools. Brown said that is fundamentally discriminatory and will not  stand because it doesn't meet the constitutional standards. But it is  tough today to imagine what our country would look like had the Supreme  Court not reached its decision in Brown nearly 70 years ago.  Classrooms, restrooms, water fountains, and even healthcare facilities  would be designated by race. I am confident that I can speak for  everyone in this Chamber when I say thank goodness the Court overturned  Plessy v. Ferguson and reached the ruling that it did in Brown v. Board  of Education.   There are more modern examples where the Court overruled precedent,  like Lawrence v. Texas was overruled in 2003 by the precedent  established by Bowers v. Hardwick, which had made it a crime to be  engaged in same-sex conduct. So without a doubt, the Court's decision  to overturn its precedents has altered our society, and I suggest it  has changed our society for the better in many of those instances.   Now, I realize that given our political and ideological preferences,  we might like or dislike the decision that the Court ultimately makes,  but former Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson said years ago that the  Supreme Court is not final because it is right; it is right, he said,  because it is final.   But there is no such thing as an inviolable decision or permanent  decision by the Supreme Court, and again I say thank goodness. If prior  decisions were set in stone, we would still be subject to egregious,  shameful policies of the past like ``separate but equal.'' But the  Supreme Court should always try to correct previously decided erroneous  decisions, and they have criteria under the doctrine known as stare  decisis for the circumstances under which they will revisit that  precedent. The Court understands that they can't willy-nilly overrule  earlier decisions, and there is a very elaborate and exacting process  and evaluation of analysis by which they do so.   But I believe it is our responsibility here in the Senate not to be  part of the mob. Cooler heads must prevail. And that means us. It  starts with us. We have to stand for the independence of the Court even  when they render decisions we don't like. That is the only way to  preserve the crown jewels of our form of government, which is the  independent judiciary. The High Court cannot be subjected to pressure  campaigns by anyone--elected officials, political activists, or anyone  else.   I yield the floor.
