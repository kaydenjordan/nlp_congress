 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, Postmaster General DeJoy's attempts to push forward  operational changes that delay the mail are simply unacceptable. My  constituents depend on the U.S. Postal Service. In the past week alone,  I received over 1,000 constituent letters expressing confusion and  anger over these changes that he has planned and implemented.   A senior from Coventry wrote to me, expressing her alarm over what  might happen if her diabetic husband failed to receive his medications  on time.   A constituent from Wakefield, who has not missed an election since  1956, emailed me to ask if he should vote in person, despite being 85  years old with health concerns.   Madam Speaker, no one should have to wait for lifesaving medications  or risk their health to cast a vote. I urge my colleagues to support  this bill. Millions of Americans are counting on us, and we cannot let  them down.
