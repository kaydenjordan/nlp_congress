 Mr. Speaker, as a geriatric nurse  practitioner, I have had the privilege of taking care of our Greatest  Generation in various long-term care facilities, including many  patients with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.   Currently, more than 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's  disease. This disease denies millions of families the opportunity to  cherish memories and robs people of their ability to remember their  family members and loved ones.   Until 6 days ago, all FDA-approved Alzheimer's drugs merely targeted  the symptoms of the disease, never its progression. Thankfully, last  Wednesday,  [[Page H3184]]  the FDA issued a long-awaited approval of Leqembi, the first-of-its- kind drug that changes the underlying course of early Alzheimer's  disease.   This drug, which has shown promising results of slowing the  progression of Alzheimer's by more than 25 percent over 18 months, will  be fully available to Medicare patients, but providers will have to  enter patients into a registry to collect information, and many  families will still have to pay a significant out-of-pocket copay.   It is imperative that CMS continues to find ways to lift these  barriers to this life-changing treatment and that CMS also changes its  policy to allow for more than one PET scan, which has the ability to  detect the amyloid plaque that causes Alzheimer's disease.   By having more treatment options available, patients can maintain  their independence longer, get more precious time with their families,  and have renewed hope for the future.   I will continue to work across the aisle in Congress and with the FDA  and CMS to ensure all Alzheimer's patients have equitable and  affordable access to innovative drugs such as this.                            ____________________
