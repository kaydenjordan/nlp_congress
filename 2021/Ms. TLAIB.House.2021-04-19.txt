 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the Improving  FHA Support for Small-Dollar Mortgages Act.   Housing is one of the most vital ways families have a shot at  financial stability and freedom. However, affordable homeownership  opportunities are being denied to my residents because of the lack of  financing available for home purchases under $70,000.   In fact, small-dollar mortgage loan applications in 2017 were denied  by lenders at double the rate of denial for large mortgage loans. This  is largely because the banks have decided that small-dollar mortgages  are riskier because they rely on bogus credit score thresholds and the  loans don't give them enough profit.   This impacts majority Black and Brown communities, as well as low- income communities that are unbanked and underbanked.   Madam Speaker, in my district alone, 68,000--or nearly 50 percent--of  our owner-occupied homes are valued under $70,000. Think about that for  a second. Almost half of the homes in my district stand little chance  of getting financing from a bank.   My bill directs the Department of Housing to report on barriers to  making small-dollar mortgage insurance available for mortgages under  $70,000. It also requires HUD to report on policies, practices, and  actions that will be taken to remove such barriers, to making available  mortgage insurance for mortgages of $70,000 or less.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to please vote in support of my  bill to ensure that every family has access to homeownership.
