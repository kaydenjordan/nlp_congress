 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, Congressman Evans, for leading this Special Order and for  yielding to me, especially on a matter this important.   As I reflect on the last 200 or so days in this country, I am  saddened.                                time  1930    The truth of the matter is I always thought this country was better  than this. I thought that we had so many people, not just African  Americans, but we had people of like mind, like Goodman, Chaney, and  Schwerner, who gave their lives and who sacrificed blood, sweat, and  tears so that this country could be a more perfect Union, so that I  could go to some of the best schools in the country, so that I could  dream the impossible dream, so that I could stand on the floor of this  House and speak my mind, introduce legislation, but, more importantly,  fight for the ideals that make this country an exceptional country.   It is so easy for our President and our colleagues to say America's  exceptional. Well, it is, but you have to understand how it got to be  exceptional, because it didn't start off that way. In fact, we came  here on boats. We survived middle passage. We built this Capitol as  free labor. We have given as much blood, sweat, and tears as any people  in this country.   To see the President of the United States call people who would walk  with neo-Nazis and the KKK and white supremacists, some of them are  fine people--but young African-American males are taking a knee not to  disrespect our country, but they are taking a knee because they want a  better future for their sons. They want better community police  interaction. What they want is that people who are with the color of  law with misconduct against African-American men and women, sons and  daughters, parents, grandparents, what they want is a better country  for them.   They didn't choose violence. They chose peaceful protests just like  Martin Luther King. When Dr. King chose peaceful protests, what the  President doesn't realize is that the country wasn't accepting of his  ways either.   ``Letter from Birmingham Jail'' was all about Dr. King responding to  people of like mind who shared the cause of freedom and equality and  justice. They just didn't like his tactics. And the question was: We  should wait. His letter was addressing people of like mind.   The problem here is I just can't address someone of like mind because  I don't think that this administration has the maturity, the  sensitivity, or the understanding, whether it is willful or unwillful,  to understand what is going on in this country. Instead of doing the  Presidential thing, instead of doing the right thing and bringing this  country together, I am afraid that this country is being torn apart at  its very core, and for that I know that we are a better country.   Let me just say in closing that, in order for us to move forward in a  more responsible and more perfect fashion, it is going to take ordinary  citizens like you out there watching us at home, it is going to take  you all standing up and speaking out. It doesn't matter if you are  African American or if you are Hispanic or if you are Black, injustice  is injustice. The words ``no justice, no peace'' are not a threat. It  is that it is hard to accomplish peace when there is no justice in the  land.   I would just ask that we all come together and that we not only look  at words, but we look at policies, so when we now look at the opioid  addiction through a loving mental health medical crisis standpoint, we  don't forget the young people who were addicted to crack and who got  involved in drugs back then that we have now decided that, with  opioids, we are going to take a nurturing approach and with crack we  locked everyone up. We should come in, take the approach that we are  doing with opioids, which is the exact correct approach, and we should  apply it to crack, and we should apply it to all of those millions of  people who are incarcerated for drug crimes.   When you start talking about root out racism, it has to be in policy,  it has to be in our rhetoric, but it has to be in our daily lives.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Congressman  Evans, for yielding to me.  [[Page H7478]]
