 Madam Speaker, I rise to voice my opposition to  legislation brought before this body today.   Our focus in this Congress should be to guarantee the American people  have access to accurate health information, including their  reproductive health. As we talk about crisis pregnancy centers today,  we need to be clear and transparent about what these centers are  actually able to do and, most importantly, not do.   Too often, people go to these centers expecting a certain level of  care due to their misleading name, but they cannot actually get the  medical attention they deserve and need. They target low-income and  minority communities and shamefully insinuate that they are healthcare  providers when they are not.   As such, these centers are inherently contributing to misinformation  that fuels the high infant and maternal mortality across our country,  which disproportionately impacts Black women and babies.   If we are serious about protecting life, we need to be honest and  these centers need to be honest and provide transparent information  about the services they provide to pregnant women and their families.   I hope this Chamber will work together to find real solutions to  improve maternal and infant health outcomes for the American people.  Lives are certainly dependent upon it.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the legislation before  us today.                            ____________________
