 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize three incredible young  ladies from my district who recently received the Girl Scouts Silver  Award.   Saylor Purks, Presley Lomel, and Amanda Whittlesey are freshmen at  high schools in Hillsborough County. To earn their Girl Scouts Silver  Award, these young ladies were tasked with creating a project that  would make a change for the better in their school or neighborhood.   After witnessing their classmates engaging in vaping, the students  chose to present an antivaping presentation about the growing issue and  the dangers of tobacco use.   This message couldn't be more timely. Saylor, Presley, and Amanda  shared their presentation during the 2019-2020 back-to-school  orientation, and they hope their message can be shared at all middle  schools and high schools nationwide.   I would like to personally thank these brilliant young leaders for  taking the time and initiative to educate their peers. I am sure we  will see more outstanding things from these very special young ladies  in the future.  [[Page H52]]                                ____________________
