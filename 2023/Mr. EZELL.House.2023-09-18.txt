 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the East Central High  School Hornets baseball team for their outstanding showing in the 2023  Mississippi High School Athletic Association Class 5A tournament.   After winning a State title last year, the Hornets were determined to  repeat. In the playoffs, the Hornets found themselves in elimination  games multiple times, but these athletes were unified by fortitude, not  anxiety. To paraphrase senior all-state catcher Logan Terry: They just  didn't lose.   This mentality brought the Hornets their first repeat championship in  school history. Their success over the last two seasons is a testament  to the leadership of Coach Bo Long and a large class of senior players.   Congratulations to the East Central Hornets baseball team on their  outstanding season.                            ____________________
