 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Mr.  Blumenauer, for his leadership and his cosponsor from Nebraska for his  leadership.   Ninety percent of the stores in Houston are without baby formula.  Texas was one of the hardest hit States. One of the most potent,  powerful, and sad days was when I was able to find baby formula from a  disaster organization, and in my district, in those early days, had a  baby formula giveaway. Volunteers were looking to make sure that we  were not giving out expired-date formula. All I can say is the lines of  cars and the women who stopped to get out of the car to simply hug us,  the strollers that came up--baby formula is a lifeline.                                time  0930    Baby formula is a lifeline. This legislation breaks the crisis of the  supply chain and provides a regulatory scheme that ensures we can have  production.   The disappointing aspect of all of this is the shutdown of the center  point of manufacturing, if you will, and many were not notified. This  legislation says that we are committed as Members of the United States  Congress to modify safety requirements to the extent that no formula is  jeopardized but that the lifeline for babies is our first priority.   I am grateful for this legislation because the shelves in Houston,  Texas, are gradually coming back. They are not there yet. Just a few  weeks ago, we had one of the largest cargo planes land at Bush  Intercontinental Airport. The gratification of families was  unspeakable, could not be mentioned.   This cannot ever happen again. It is important for Congress to be  advanced and prepared to ensure that babies, who are innocent and  without the ability to speak, are taken care of.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Blumenauer for this kind of leadership.  Thank God relief is on the way.    Madam Speaker, I thank all of the leaders who  recognize that reproductive freedom is a constitutional right.   I rise today, and I stand in the name of a 10-year-old rape victim  who was denied an abortion and had to run to another State.  [[Page H6645]]    I stand in the name of the young woman who induced an abortion and  became criminalized.   I stand in the name of rape victims.   I stand in the name of incest victims.   I stand for reproductive freedom.   And I stand in the name of the Constitution and the Ninth Amendment  and the right of women with their faith leaders, their families, their  extended knowledge, to be able to make their own decision about  reproductive freedom.   I stand for the Women's Health Protection Act because it prohibits a  State, local, or Tribal Government from telling abortion providers that  they should perform medically unnecessary procedures like ultrasounds  and provide patients with medically inaccurate information. This would  be prohibited by this particular legislation and, as well, to ensure  that they would comply with credentialing or other conditions that do  not apply to providers who offer medically comparable services.   I stand in order for the Women's Health Protection Act to cover this  United States and to ensure that the Constitution and Ninth Amendment  prevails.   I stand because the Supreme Court Justices who swore that they  believe in precedent for 50 years of Roe v. Wade did, under oath,  misrepresent to those who they were speaking to that they would adhere  to stare decisis and the precedent.   I stand because in Texas, the bounty hunters are seeking to  criminalize and arrest persons. I stand for H.R. 5710 that will  criminalize that activity.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in strong support of H.R. 8296, the  Women's Health Protection Act of 2022.   H.R. 8296, the ``Women's Health Protection Act of 2022'' of which I  have been a long-time supporter, would prohibit certain government  restrictions on access to abortion.   The bill would ensure physicians' ability to prescribe certain drugs,  offer abortion services via telemedicine, and provide immediate  abortion services when the mother's health is at risk.   Furthermore, the ``Women's Health Protection Act of 2022'' would put  an end to the hurdles some states have placed in the way of women  accessing abortion care.   This bill would prohibit state, local, or tribal governments from  requiring abortion providers to:   Perform medically unnecessary procedures like ultrasounds;   Provide patients with medically inaccurate information or;   Comply with credentialing or other conditions that do not apply to  providers who offer medically comparable services.   It would also safeguard all abortions before fetal viability, and  after fetal viability when a physician determines the continuation of  pregnancy puts the mother's life at risk.   Under this bill, patients would not be required to disclose the  reasoning behind their decision to receive an abortion, nor would they  be forced to attend medically unnecessary health visits before their  procedure appointment.   In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to revoke the  reproductive rights that women have enjoyed for half a century,  Congress must act now to enshrine what is left of women's liberties  into law.   I stand in proud support of both H.R. 8296, the ``Women's Health  Protection Act of 2022.''   I urge my colleagues to stand up for women and girls and the  providers who meet their medical needs every day.   We cannot let those who wish to relegate women to second-class  citizens turn back the clock any further.    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friends, Lizzie  Fletcher and Marilyn Strickland and Jamie Raskin, for understanding the  Constitution.   Patricia Hughes and Jeremy Donahue threw a Molotov cocktail in a  clinic, an abortion clinic, in Shreveport, Louisiana. David McMenemy of  Rochester crashed his car into the Edgerton Women's Care Center. A  package left at a woman's health center in Austin, Texas, contained an  explosive device. It goes on and on and on.   A Texas woman has been charged with murder after a so-called, self- induced abortion. It is clear that our friends are trying to  criminalize the right to reproductive freedom.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article from NPR and a  document entitled ``Violence Against Abortion Providers.''        Violence Against Abortion Providers, Clinics, and Activists         December 12, 2005: Patricia Hughes and Jeremy Dunahoe threw       a Molotov cocktail at a clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana. The       device missed the building and no damage was caused. In       August 2006, Hughes was sentenced to six years in prison, and       Dunahoe to one year. Hughes claimed the bomb was a ``memorial       lamp'' for an abortion she had had there.        September 11, 2006: David McMenemy of Rochester Hills,       Michigan, crashed his car into the Edgerton Women's Care       Center in Davenport, Iowa. He then doused the lobby in       gasoline and started a fire. McMenemy committed these acts in       the belief that the center was performing abortions; however,       Edgerton is not an abortion clinic. Time magazine listed the       incident in a ``Top 10 Inept Terrorist Plots'' list.        April 25, 2007: A package left at a women's health clinic       in Austin, Texas, contained an explosive device capable of       inflicting serious injury or death. A bomb squad detonated       the device after evacuating the building. Paul Ross Evans       (who had a criminal record for armed robbery and theft) was       found guilty of the crime.        May 9, 2007: An unidentified person deliberately set fire       to a Planned Parenthood clinic in Virginia Beach, Virginia.        December 6, 2007: Chad Altman and Sergio Baca were arrested       for the arson of Curtis Boyd's clinic in Albuquerque. Baca's       girlfriend had scheduled an appointment for an abortion at       the clinic.        January 22, 2009: Matthew L. Derosia, 32, who was reported       to have had a history of mental illness, rammed an SUV into       the front entrance of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Saint       Paul, Minnesota, causing between $2,500 and $5,000 in damage.       Derosia, who told police that Jesus told him to ``stop the       murderers,'' was ruled competent to stand trial. He pleaded       guilty in March 2009 to one count of criminal damage to       property.        August 29, 2009: Two days after a nearby anti-abortion       protest, an unknown arsonist threw a molotov cocktail at a       Planned Parenthood in Lincoln, Nebraska. The bomb fell short       of the building, leaving no property damage or casualties.        January 1, 2012: Bobby Joe Rogers, 41, firebombed the       American Family Planning Clinic in Pensacola, Florida, with a       Molotov cocktail; the fire gutted the building. Rogers told       investigators that he was motivated to commit the crime by       his opposition to abortion, and that what more directly       prompted the act was seeing a patient enter the clinic during       one of the frequent antiabortion protests there. The clinic       had previously been bombed at Christmas in 1984 and was the       site of the murder of John Britton and James Barrett in 1994.        April 1, 2012: A bomb exploded on the windowsill of a       Planned Parenthood clinic in Grand Chute, Wisconsin,       resulting in a fire that caused minimal damage.        April 11, 2013: Benjamin David Curell, 27, caused extensive       damage to a Planned Parenthood clinic in Bloomington,       Indiana, vandalizing it with an axe: Curell was convicted in       state court of felony burglary, and pleaded guilty in federal       court to one count of violating the Freedom of Access to       Clinic Entrances Act. In the federal case, he was sentenced       to three years of probation and ordered to pay restitution.        October 3-4, 2013: 32-year-old Jebediah Stout attempted to       set a Planned Parenthood clinic in Joplin, Missouri on fire       two days in a row. Stout previously set a fire at a Joplin       mosque.        September 4, 2015: A Planned Parenthood clinic in Pullman,       Washington was intentionally set on fire. No injuries were       reported due to the time of day, but the FBI was involved       because of a history of domestic terrorism against the       clinic. The crime was never solved. The clinic reopened six       months later.        October 22, 2015: A Planned Parenthood clinic in Claremont,       New Hampshire was vandalized by a juvenile intruder. Damaged       in the attack were computers, furniture, plumbing fixtures,       office equipment, medical equipment, phone lines, windows,       and walls. The flooding that resulted from the vandalism also       damaged an adjacent business)        February 24-25, 2016: Travis Reynolds, 21, vandalized a       Baltimore-area women's health care clinic with antiabortion       graffiti. After being arrested, Reynolds ``admitted to police       that he defaced the clinic's doors, walls and windows because       he thought that it would deter women from using the clinic.''       Reynolds pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of       violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act in       October 2016.        March 7, 2016: Rachel Ann Jackson, 71, vandalized a Planned       Parenthood clinic in Columbus, Ohio, with the message ``Satan       den of baby killers . . .'' She pleaded guilty to felony       counts of breaking and entering and vandalism and a       misdemeanor count of aggravated trespass. Jackson was       sentenced to probation, with the judge citing her struggle       with serious mental illness as a mitigating factor.        February 10, 2019: Wesley Brian Kaster, 43, threw a Molotov       cocktail at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia,       Missouri. Kaster admitted to setting the fire because Planned       Parenthood provided abortions, although Planned Parenthood       stated that the clinic was not providing abortions at the       time due to a state law. Kaster was sentenced to five years       in prison.        January 3, 2020: A high school student, Samuel Gulick,       spray-painted ``Deus Vult'' on a clinic in Newark, Delaware       before throwing a Molotov Cocktail at the front window.       Gulick was sentenced to 26 months in prison by a federal       judge.        October 10, 2020: A man threw multiple Molotovs at a       Planned Parenthood clinic in Fort Myers, Florida.        January 23, 2021: An unknown individual fired a shotgun at       a Tennessee Planned Parenthood clinic; no one was injured.       News outlets noted that the attack took place on the       anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision and at a time when       Tennessee's governor, Bill Lee, was involved in a heated       online debate regarding abortion and health care.  [[Page H6657]]         December 31, 2021: On New Year's Eve, a fire destroyed a       Planned Parenthood in Knoxville, Tennessee. The building was       closed at the time for renovations. The Knoxville Fire       Department and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and       Explosives ruled the fire arson. The clinic had previously       been shot at in January of the same year.        May 25, 2022: A masked woman set a fire at a planned       abortion clinic in Casper, Wyoming. The ATF offered a $5,000       reward for information leading to her arrest.                                   ____                          [From NPR, April 10, 2022]    A Texas Woman Has Been Charged With Murder After a So-Called `Self-                            Induced Abortion'                           (By Carolina Cuellar)         A Texas woman has been charged with murder for a what       authorities are calling a self-induced abortion.        Ayesha Rascoe, Host:        In South Texas, 26-year-old Lizelle Herrera is being       charged with murder because of a, quote, ``self-induced       abortion.'' She's been arrested and will be arraigned       Wednesday. The Starr County District Attorney's Office has       yet to comment on the case. Here's Texas Public Radio's       Carolina Cuellar with what we know.        Unidentified Person: (Chanting in Spanish).        Unidentified People: (Chanting in Spanish).        Carolina Cuellar, Byline: On Saturday, across the street       from the Starr County Jail, a sparse crowd of pro-abortion       rights activists chanted for Herrera's release.        Unidentified Person: (Chanting in Spanish).        Unidentified People: (Chanting in Spanish).        Cuellar: At the protest, Cathy Torres, the organizing       manager for Frontera Fund, said based on what she knows about       Herrera's case, it isn't likely to be unique.        Cathy Torres: This is only setting a precedent for other       cases. She's not the first. She won't be the last.        Cuellar: She said many women in Texas are having to choose       self-administered abortions because of the state's       restrictive abortion legislation, like Senate Bill 8. While       SB8 explicitly exempts pregnant women who get an abortion       from criminal repercussions, it makes it nearly impossible to       access abortion services in Texas, and many people are left       with little to no legal options to terminate their pregnancy.        Steve Vladeck, who is a law professor at the University of       Texas School of Law, said that based on current information,       the murder charge doesn't make sense.        Steve Vladeck: The Texas murder statute does apply to the       killing of an unborn fetus, but it specifically exempts cases       where the person who terminated the fetus is the pregnant       woman.        Cuellar: It's unclear whether Herrera induced her own       abortion or assisted someone else's self-induced abortion. He       said details like which statutes were used to charge her will       help paint a clear picture of how prosecutors avoided the       exemption if Herrera performed her own abortion. But right       now, this information is unavailable. Nonetheless, Vladeck       said Herrera's situation shows what will happen as legal       protections around abortion crumble.        Vladeck: You know, I think what this case really is is an       ominous portent of what things are going to look like on the       ground in states that have aggressive abortion restrictions.        Cuellar: Jessica Brand agrees. She's a former prosecutor       and founder of The Wren Collective, a criminal justice       nonprofit organization.        Jessica Brand: We've had a lot of wake-up calls in Texas       for how far people are willing to go to prosecute women, to       strip women of their rights.        Cuellar: According to Brand, while legal ground for the       case is shaky, it shows how legislation like SB8 emboldens       people to push legal boundaries around abortion. She adds       that as restrictions continue to grow, they will       disproportionately affect marginalized communities, like       those along the Texas-Mexico border. This is because they       often lack the resources that would allow them to travel out       of state and obtain safe medical abortion services.        Brand: It's very, very dangerous. If they decide that a       self-induced and termination of pregnancy is, in fact--      qualifies as murder, you can imagine the horrific precedent       that sets.        Cuellar: Shortly after the protest, a legal defense fund       covered Herrera's $500,000 bail. I'm Carolina Cuellar in Rio       Grande City.     Madam Speaker, I stand, as I said earlier, with a  10-year-old victim who had to run to be able to secure an abortion  after being raped.   I stand on the Constitution where the Fifth Amendment says that we  are due life and liberty. I stand in front of ``In God We Trust,'' and  I tell my friend from Louisiana that the Constitution says that we have  a right to freedom of religion.   We speak what we believe. That is what this legislation does, and  that is what reproductive freedom is. It is to ensure that the GOP does  not criminalize abortion in all 50 States.   It is to ensure that Republicans are not plotting a nationwide ban to  criminalize. This Constitutional expose, and explanation, indicates  that we have the right to travel and the right to be constitutionally  secure in that.   Further, we need to go a step further and criminalize anyone who is a  bounty hunter and hold them accountable and put them in jail.   Specifically, this bill provides and makes sure that we prohibit any  person or healthcare providers who provide legal abortion or services,  that we don't stop that, that we don't stop any person or any entity  for helping healthcare providers. Let me thank you and ask support of  this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in strong support of H.R. 8297, the  Ensuring Access to Abortion Act of 2022.   H.R. 8297, the ``Ensuring Access to Abortion Act of 2022'' will  protect women and girls from others preventing or interfering with a  person's ability to access abortion care across state lines.   H.R. 8297 prohibits anyone acting under state law from interfering  with a person's ability to access abortifacient drugs, abortion  counseling, or abortion services out-of-state.   When I cosponsored this bill, I was specifically thinking of the  women in my hometown of Houston, who now must travel 12 hours to reach  the nearest abortion clinic in New Mexico.   I fear that Texas women and girls will because of the state's  antiabortion laws will be living behind a new ``Iron Curtain.''   The harrowing stories of people escaping across the Berlin Wall to  freedom will be replaced by women escaping Texas to save their own or a  loved one's life.   I am concerned that there will be a new Underground Railroad with  conductors ferrying women to New Mexico where they well have the  freedom to make their own medical decisions.   It is the landmass of the state of Texas that makes this bill  desperately needed.   Texas is the second-largest state in the US with an area of 268,597  square miles or 171,902,080 acres which is more than 7.4 percent of the  United States total land mass.   In comparison, Texas is about 1.65 times larger than California, at  163,696 square miles.   Texas is not the largest state, however. Alaska, the largest state in  the US is nearly 2.5 times larger than Texas at 663,300 square miles.   Texas has 29 million residents and the 13th highest GDP in the world  at 1.78 trillion as of 2019.   If Texas were its own country, it would be the 40th largest out of  193 countries in the world, bigger than every country in Europe.   It is the quantitative, logistical, and legal challenge of driving to  gain abortion services.   To the South is the country of Mexico with passport requirements  which costs hundreds and often many weeks to obtain.   Those women living in regions of the state that border other states  with prohibitions on reproduction options for women will make travel to  New Mexico the only option.   To give some perspective on the size of Texas.   Austin is closer to New Orleans than it is to El Paso.   San Diego is closer to El Paso than it is to Houston.   The distance from Washington, D.C. to New York City is about 228  miles, or four hours driving.   The distance from Dallas to Houston, which is roughly 230 miles, or a  little over four hours in a car.   To the north and northeast are Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma all  of which have and made add to the hurdles of reaching a service  provider by car.   It takes around 13 hours to drive the 805 miles from the northernmost  point to southernmost Texas. You would start in Texhoma, a small town  that sits on the border of Texas and Oklahoma then drive south through  Lubbock, San Antonio, and all the way down to Brownsville, the  southernmost city on the tip of Texas.   It takes 11 hours to drive 773 miles from easternmost to westernmost  points across Texas.   Any drive of just a few hours may place women in the jurisdiction of  unincorporated areas, rural towns, and counties where aggressive  enforcement of a state law may be a priority.   Republican Texas lawmakers have already passed SB 8, one of the most  barbaric and archaic anti-abortion laws in the country, that denies  women the right to bodily autonomy after carrying a fetus for more than  6 weeks.   If left to their own devices, those lawmakers hope to prevent Texan  women from seeking abortions not only in Texas, but elsewhere as well.   That is why I wholeheartedly support H.R. 8297, the ``Ensure Access  to Abortion Act of 2022.''  [[Page H6658]]    This bill would prohibit any person acting under state law from  preventing, restricting, impeding, or retaliating against:   health care providers who provide legal abortion services to out-of- state residents;   any person or entity who helps health care providers provide such  services;   any person who travels to another state to obtain such services;   any person or entity who helps another person travel to another state  to obtain such services; or   the movement in interstate commerce of drugs that are approved to  terminate pregnancies.   Women in Texas and in other states with anti-abortion laws are  already in crisis. They are already forced to flee their communities,  incur undue financial costs, and combat social stigma to seek abortion  care beyond their state boundaries.   We cannot allow these women to then be additionally prosecuted for  exercising their right to abortion care in states where that right is  still upheld.   The ``Ensuring Access to Abortion Act of 2022'' would protect women  in need of abortions from litigation.   But it goes admirably beyond that by protecting those who support  women in exercising their reproductive rights.   Many organizations and community networks have rallied around women  since the Supreme Courts Dobbs decision.   Churches, non-profits, and private companies have all stepped up to  the plate to support women carrying unwanted pregnancies whether it be  through financial contributions, transportation assistance, housing  options, or access to abortion drugs.   The ``Ensuring Access to Abortion Act of 2022'' would shield them  from those who wish to make personal gains off the private medical  decisions of women.   Just last week, a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio was denied an  abortion in her home state because she was six weeks and three days  pregnant.   I will say it again: A 10-year-old girl. Six weeks and three days  pregnant.   The anti-abortion trigger laws in her state forced this little girl  to travel 175 miles to Indianapolis in order to have her rapists' fetus  removed from her young body.   This little girl had to leave the comfort of her community, leave her  state, and drive for hours in order to get the necessary medical care  she undeniably needed.   Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would have  preferred it if she could not have done even this.   Many conservative lawmakers would have preferred to see lawsuits  filed against the family member who made her abortion appointment, the  nurse who greeted her at the clinic, the parent who drove her home.   Maybe they would have even preferred to see lawsuits against the  owner of the gas station where the family refueled their car, or the  search engine that helped them locate the abortion clinic that saved  their child from becoming a 10-year-old mother.   Imagine if lawmakers had decided that this little girl had to see a  physician 24 hours in advance of her appointment. Imagine if they had  mandated that she see an ultrasound of her fetus. Imagine if they had  required the physician who cared for her to counsel this child on the  benefits of adoption.   That is the reality many Republican lawmakers would like to see.   That is why these two bills are so important.   I stand in proud support of both H.R. 8296, the ``Women's Health  Protection Act of 2022,'' and H.R. 8297, the ``Ensuring Access to  Abortion Act of 2022.''   I urge my colleagues to stand up for women and girls and the  providers who meet their medical needs every day.   We cannot let those who wish to relegate women to second-class  citizens turn back the clock any further.
