 Mr. Speaker, middle class families should be the focus of  tax relief, not billionaires, not the wealthiest Americans.  Unfortunately, the Ryan-McConnell tax plan fails that basic test.   Independent analysis shows that the Republican plan would actually  raise taxes on many middle class families, giving billionaires, the top  1 percent, the biggest breaks. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says  that middle class families could actually pay an increase of $1,290 a  year. Even worse, the families I represent would be asked to foot the  bill for a big, massive giveaway to the rich.   Under the Republican plan, the wealthiest families, 5,400 families  that are the superwealthy in this country, would get a $270 billion  break through the repeal of the estate tax--100 families in my home  State of Michigan, the DeVos family, certainly the Trump family. This  is not representative of the values of the American people.   Just saying that the people at the top won't benefit doesn't make it  true. Read the bill. Look at these analyses. This is a giveaway to the  wealthiest Americans, and it is wrong.                            ____________________
