 Madam President, soaring fuel prices are impacting every  corner of the globe and hitting the pocketbooks of American families  and businesses. Today, a gallon of gas costs $4.52--nearly $1.50 more  than a year ago. From food to clothing to rent, growing transportation  expenses are pushing already rising prices even higher.   Yet, while the American people are taking a hit, while the local mom- and-pop stores pay more for energy and goods, big oil companies are  announcing giant profits. They have hit the jackpot.   Over the first 3 months of the year, ExxonMobil reported $5.5 billion  in profits, Chevron recorded $6.3 billion, and Shell raked in $9.1  billion--its largest quarterly profit ever. In just 3 months, these  three companies made nearly $21 billion in profits.   Now, robust profits are usually a signal for companies to invest in  capital and labor and build the foundation for future growth, but Big  Oil has different priorities. Rather than increasing business  investment or production, these companies have almost uniformly pumped  profits directly to their executives and wealthy shareholders.   In February, even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine sent gas  prices skyrocketing, the Financial Times reported that seven of the  largest oil companies--including Exxon, Chevron, BP, and Shell--were  expected to return $38 billion to shareholders through buybacks this  year, plus another $50 billion in dividends. Big Oil hasn't hidden its  strategy: Hold back production, and rake in the profits.   In a March 2022 survey, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas asked oil  executives for the primary reason that publicly traded oil companies  were restraining production despite high oil prices. The No. 1 answer  they gave, reflecting the view of nearly 60 percent of those surveyed,  was that it was ``investor pressure to maintain capital discipline.''  To put it another way, they were saying that they don't want to produce  more oil because more production will hasten the end of high oil prices  and exorbitant investor profits.   Some oil company executives have been even clearer. Just last month,  Chevron's chief financial officer confirmed that the company's top  priority is its dividends, not investing in its business, and BP's CFO  made similar comments during his company's first quarter earnings  call--so much for BP's advertising campaign that it is investing in  green energy.   Instead of resuming the production they cut in 2020, oil companies  have kept output constrained, turning a 50-percent increase in prices  at the pump over the past year into record-setting profits.   Make no mistake, our domestic producers have the capacity to produce  more. Indeed, domestic crude oil output is below 2019 levels--that is  right, domestic crude oil output is below 2019 levels--and over 12  million acres of leased Federal lands remain untapped.   My Republican colleagues are quick to try to weakly blame President  Biden and ``regulation'' for lagging production, but that is not what  the oil executives say. Look back at that Dallas Fed survey I mentioned  earlier. Only 6 percent of the oil executives surveyed said that  ``government regulation'' was the reason they weren't producing more.  Sixty percent said it was higher profits. Six percent said it was  regulation.   Now, I understand private companies are going to pursue high profits.  That is business, that is free enterprise, and that is a competitive  market. But when Putin and OPEC have outsized influence on the market,  can we really call it a competitive market?   Look, the major oil companies can't control what Putin or OPEC does,  but there is no doubt that Putin's war is taking their profits into the  stratosphere.   And oil companies clearly think this is a great time for more  dividends and more buybacks, not more production, lower prices, and  giving the American people a break. In fact, just last month, Exxon  announced it would triple its stock buybacks this year and next to $30  billion. Thirty billion dollars is an astonishing number.   One of the things about buybacks is that they essentially raise the  price of the company's stock. If you are an executive whose major  compensation is stock options, you are giving yourself a huge raise,  and that is part of this too. It is self-aggrandizement. It is  something that does not square, I think, with the feelings of the  American people and also the needs of the American people.   It is clear that the oil companies are not interested in helping  Americans on their own, so the Federal Government needs to step in. We  need responsible solutions that bring down prices and help families pay  for the basics.   We must use every tool at our disposal. I fully support the  President's pledge to release a million barrels of oil per day from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help stabilize volatile prices. One can  imagine the price at the pump if the President was not doing this. It  would be even further in excess of what is, I think, appropriate.   I have introduced the Food and Fuel Family Savings Act, which would  provide most households with $600 per person, specifically to cover  higher gas and grocery costs this year. My bill would be fully paid  for, targeted to those families making under $80,000, and would also  ease medium- and long-term inflation by crafting a fairer tax code.  Instead of waiting for inflation to disappear, it would provide  immediate and real help to Americans.   I have also joined my colleague Senator Whitehouse in introducing  legislation to return some of those windfall profits that oil companies  are handing out as dividends and buybacks back to consumers.   These are important short-term efforts that will help Americans  struggling with higher costs. But to truly lower costs in the long  term, we must make the transition to clean energy and break our  reliance on Big Oil and hostile foreign actors. I am proud that in  Rhode Island, we are leading the way on offshore wind, a good renewable  resource that when deployed will lower costs for consumers.   The bipartisan infrastructure law is also making key investments to  advance this transition, including over $60 billion primarily for new  major clean energy demonstration and deployment programs.   The President has been calling for additional funding to enable this  clean energy future. We need a package that includes tax credits and  grants that would make clean energy, clean vehicles, and other clean  technologies more affordable and competitive.   If we do these things, we will make ourselves less vulnerable to the  whims of oil companies and cartels that depend on Americans paying more  than they should. We will make our world cleaner, lower costs, and  finally achieve the energy independence that we have wanted all along.   One of the many lessons of the past 2 years is that we cannot rely on  oil for  [[Page S2529]]  plentiful, affordable energy. It is clear that allowing our energy  needs to be held hostage by leaders like Vladimir Putin and  organizations like OPEC is dangerous, but placing our faith in Big Oil  is equally foolhardy given their preoccupation with profits over  people.   As we battle inflation, it is the American people, not executives and  wealthy shareholders, who should be the focal point of our energy and  economic policy.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting policies that  will help families now and in the future.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, today I wish to recognize the dedicated  public service of Michele Mackin, who retired on April 30 as managing  director for contracting and national security acquisitions with the  Government Accountability Office.   For 34 years, Michele has helped Congress analyze the Federal  Government's largest acquisition programs, from the Air Force's C-17  and C-130 aircraft to the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship, Ford-class  aircraft carrier, and Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, along with scores  of other systems and related services that the Departments of Defense  and Homeland Security have procured to make our Nation safe.   She has also been a leading voice on Federal contracting issues and a  vigilant watchdog who consistently brought important issues related to  the improper use of contracts to light. In so doing, Michele has  obtained the respect of the Members of this body and the deep affection  of her colleagues, who for decades have been drawn to her fine example  of public service.   Michele has been a trusted voice on this Nation's shipbuilding  programs, and Congress has relied greatly on her clear analysis and  recommendations to guide us in our oversight role. Since first becoming  a member of the Senior Executive Service in 2013, Michele has testified  before Congress 11 times for a variety of committees--voicing concern  on the Littoral Combat Ship program, raising questions about the Navy's  acquisition strategy for the Constellation-class guided-missile  frigate, highlighting risks in the Coast Guard's Deepwater program, and  advocating for contracting and acquisition reforms at the Departments  of Navy, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs.   Michele epitomizes what Congress and the American public value about  the Government Accountability Office: the honest broker. In embracing  the idea that oversight of programs and contracts represents a sacred  trust, Michele has been a tireless, effective advocate for both the  American taxpayer and the men and women serving the government's many  and varied missions. She has inspired her teams with the notion of  stewardship that the American people should get what they have paid  for, that government should operate fairly and transparently, and  American warfighters should get the capabilities they need to defend  this great Nation.   We wish Michele a fond farewell and thank her for her distinguished  service to Congress and the American public.                            ____________________
