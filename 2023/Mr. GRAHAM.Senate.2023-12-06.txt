 Madam President, I will just pick up where my colleague  left off.   There are four parts to the supplemental appropriations sent over by  President Biden. One deals with Ukraine. And count me in for Ukraine.  Robust aid to Ukraine really helps us here at home. Helping Israel--no- brainer--count me in. Beefing up Taiwan makes perfect sense. There was  money in the supplemental for border security, but it really didn't  address the problem we have.   And here is what I want the body to understand. Here is what happened  yesterday. The FBI Director testified before the Senate Judiciary  Committee about the level of threats we face as a nation. And he said:         [W]hile there may have been times over the years where       individual threats could have been higher here or there than       where they might be right now, I've never seen a time where       all the threats or so many of the threats are all elevated,       all at exactly the same time.    This was yesterday.   What did he say?         Post October 7--    The horrible attack on our friends in Israel--   [[Page S5785]]              [Y]ou've seen a veritable rogues' gallery of terrorist       organizations calling for attacks against us.    He said that yesterday.         [T]he threat level has gone to a whole other level since       October 7.   This was what the FBI Director said yesterday. Are any of us  listening?         I see blinking lights everywhere I turn.    I asked him about blinking lights regarding 9/11. Apparently, they  were blinking, and we missed them.   Do you see any blinking lights?   And he said:         I see blinking lights everywhere I turn.    He said that yesterday. Now, why are Republicans, apparently, more  than anybody else, insisting that the supplemental package not only  help Ukraine, not only help Israel and Taiwan but actually help us? We  have got to change the policy because what we have got is not working.   Yesterday--yesterday--12,000 encounters at the border. The highest  ever, yesterday. Two days before, 10,000 were marching in the wrong  direction.   As these numbers go to new levels and historic levels, the FBI  Director yesterday told us he has never seen more threats against our  homeland than he does today.   And since October 7, every terrorist group in the world is calling  for an attack on America.   I asked him about the border. He is very concerned about the status  of the border.   So we are on track, if this continues, to have 3.6 million illegal  encounters that we know of at the border. That is like beyond  unsustainable. All-time highs every day.   From 2023 to 2020, the encounters at the border are up 368 percent.  Why? Because the policies of the Biden administration make people  believe that if they get to our border, they stay in America and never  leave. And if you don't change that, you are never going to fix the  problem.   Six million people have already come to our border in the first 3  years of the Biden administration. We are on track to do 3.6 million in  fiscal year `24.   The day that people think Trump is going to be the nominee and could  win the White House, you are going to see a run on the border like you  have never seen because people want to get the last good deal under the  Biden administration. Because when Trump wins, if he does, all this is  going to change.   There are two problems that have to be fixed. You make an asylum  claim in America at the border; you pass the initial credible fear  standard, which needs to be elevated; you are released into the country  to go to your hearing regarding your asylum claim 3 to 5 years later-- that makes people believe they are released, and they will never show  up. Once you are here, you are never going to leave. We have to change  that.   While you are waiting for your hearing that may be 3 to 5 years away,  you need to wait outside the country. That would stop a lot of the  illegal immigrant flow because when people realize you can't wait in  America, you are home free once you make your asylum claim, they will  be less likely to pay $10,000 or more to wait in Mexico or some other  country for 4 or 5 years.   The second thing is that this administration is abusing the law. The  Secretary of DHS has the ability on a case-by-case basis to allow  urgent humanitarian parole for urgent humanitarian reasons or  significant public benefit. This is meant to be an individual case-by- case analysis. They are using this concept--the Biden administration-- to have blanket humanitarian parole for 240,000 people from four  different countries. That is an abuse of the law. This law is being  used to just flow people through, and that needs to change.   So if you put a cap on how many people could come into the country  through humanitarian parole, getting back to the original intent of the  law, and you told people if you apply for asylum, you have to wait  outside the country before your hearing is held, then you will have a  dramatic reduction in illegal immigration. I know that works. That  doesn't fix a broken immigration system, but it does give us control  over an out-of-control border at a time of elevated threats.   To my Democratic colleagues, I have been negotiating with you for 20  years on how to fix an immigration system that is broken. You need more  legal immigration. You need border security. You have to have a pathway  to citizenship for those who are deserving. I get all that. This is not  all about an immigration reform negotiation; this is about securing the  border at a time of heightened threat to our country.   One hundred seventy-two people on the Terrorist Watchlist we know of  have been caught. Only God knows how many we missed. This run on the  border is locking the Border Patrol down just processing people,  fentanyl poisoning of Americans is at an alltime high, 100,000 people  have died because fentanyl is coming through a broken border. So to my  Democratic colleagues, this is not about immigration; it is about  national security. There are ways to fix this problem if you choose to  do it. I want to help Ukraine. I want to help Taiwan. I want to help  Israel. But we have got to help ourselves.   There will never be a bill I will vote for to help other countries  that are very deserving until we control our own border that is  completely broken. You need to understand that, and the public is with  us. Most Americans would like to have their border more controlled, not  less, and what you are doing is not working.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
