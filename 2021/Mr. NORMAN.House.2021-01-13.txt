 Madam Speaker, I rise today for two reasons: One, to  voice my strong opposition for the impeachment of this President with 7  days left. Two, to also voice my support for the strong police  department many of you want to defund.    Where were your cries to defund when you were leaving this office,  this very room, on January 6?   Height of hypocrisy.
