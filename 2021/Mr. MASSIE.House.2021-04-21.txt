 Madam Speaker, wow, the rhetoric is hot today. Bigotry,  xenophobia, Muslim ban, racism, discrimination. This is what is coming  from the left side of the aisle.   They say that Biden rescinded Trump's Muslim ban--that he has  rescinded the Muslim ban. I want to ask them: Which Muslim ban are they  talking about? Which one are they talking about? Are they talking about  the one they voted for?   By the way, I think it is inappropriate to call it a ``Muslim ban.''  But let's use their language. Are they talking about the bill that 165  of them voted for, including the chairman of this committee, the author  of this bill, and the chairwoman of the subcommittee?   Are they talking about the bill that they all voted for in 2015 that  Obama signed into law called the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and  Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015? I don't think Trump was  President in 2015. Obama signed this bill.   What did it do? It named four countries, not seven. We will get to  the seven later. It named four countries to ban.    What were those four countries? By the way, the ACLU was not happy  about this when Obama and the Democrats on the other side of the aisle  did it. Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Sudan.   And now the Democrats are complaining that the President has too much  power to protect this country, and they want to take some of this back,  but they gave Obama the power to add three more countries. What were  the three he added? Libya, Somalia, and Yemen in 2016. Interesting.   So where does that bring us to? It gets us to seven countries. Did  they overlap or are they maybe five of the same countries? It is the  seven exact same countries that the Democrats voted for that everybody  over on the other side of the aisle who is hurling these claims of  xenophobia voted for. Those same seven countries are now in and on the  website at the State Department that Joe Biden runs.   Now, what does this do? Again, I want to be clear. It is not a total  ban. But, by the way, Trump's wasn't either. It was a temporary  suspension. But what they have done, and what Joe Biden perpetuates on  these same seven countries--this is not a Muslim ban, but he is doing  it to the same seven countries, perpetuating the Terrorist Travel  Prevention Act of 2015, he is saying you can't get a visa waiver if you  are from one of those seven countries.   Now which is worse? I mean, you can say, okay, it is not racist to  just make it harder to travel, if we do it for 5 years or do it  forever, that is not racist or xenophobic. But if you do it for six  months, like Trump proposed, 180 days, well, now that is racist right  there.   This is so ridiculous. I can't even believe they have the audacity to  pretend they didn't vote in 2015 to add these seven countries.   Let's just get back to protecting this country. Let's not use these  bills and these provisions to say that one side is racist, or one side  is xenophobic, or you are a bunch of bigots. President Obama was not  xenophobic when he put these seven countries on his list, because they  were the seven countries that the Democrats on the other side of the  aisle chose. They are the seven countries that Obama chose.   I say, let's protect this country and get back to working together.                    [From the State Department website]  Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of                                    2015         Under the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist       Travel Prevention Act of 2015, travelers in the following       categories must obtain a visa prior to traveling to the       United States as they are no longer eligible to travel under       the Visa Waiver Program (VWP):        Nationals of VWP countries who have traveled to or been       present in Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iran, Iraq,       Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, or Yemen on or after March 1,       2011 (with limited exceptions for travel for diplomatic or       military purposes in the service of a VWP country).        Nationals of VWP countries who are also nationals of       Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or       Syria.        These individuals can apply for visas using regular       appointment processes at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. For       those who require a visa for urgent travel to the United       States, U.S. Embassies and Consulates stand ready to handle       applications on an expedited basis.        If an individual who is exempt from the Act because of his       or her diplomatic or military presence in one of the seven       countries has his or her ESTA denied, he or she may go to the       CSP website, or contact the CSP information Center. The       traveler may also apply for a nonimmigrant visa at a U.S.       Embassy or Consulate.        U.S. Customs and Border Protection strongly recommends that       any traveler to the United States check his or her ESTA       status prior to making any travel reservations or travelling       to the United States.
