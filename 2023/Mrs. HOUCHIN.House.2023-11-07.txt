 Madam Speaker, if you ask anyone who knows him, you  will learn that Colonel Charles Eckart of Corydon, Indiana, among other  things, is devoted. He is devoted to his faith, to his family, and to  his country.   Colonel Eckart served in the United States Army for 28 years. He  served our Nation with unwavering dedication, protecting our freedom  and ensuring our liberty. His service extended beyond the call of duty,  making a profound impact on countless lives and communities. This is  why he is being inducted into the Indiana Military Veterans Hall of  Fame.   Colonel Eckart was awarded the Bronze Star for his heroism during the  Tet Offensive in Vietnam.   He taught English literature at his alma mater, the U.S. Military  Academy at West Point. He was the battalion commander in charge of the  U.S. Army Reserves in Jeffersonville and retired as a colonel in 1993  in Indianapolis.   Although he retired, his service never stopped. He has served his  community of Corydon for decades and has served as the West Point  liaison for Indiana's 9th District for the last 23 years.    This is where my staff and I have had the honor and privilege of  getting to know him.   Colonel Eckart is loved by my staff, his family, his community, and  his country. It is truly a blessing to honor him on the House floor  today.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Colonel Eckart on being inducted into  the Indiana Military Veterans Hall of Fame. Indiana is proud to call  him one of its own.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 847 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H.

The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any further       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except one motion to recommit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger  Fernandez), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Last night, the Rules Committee met and produced a rule, House  Resolution 847, providing for the House's continued consideration of  appropriations bills for fiscal year 2024.   The rule provides for H.R. 4664, the Financial Services and General  Government Appropriations Act of 2024, to be considered under a  structured rule with 104 amendments made in order.   It provides one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations or  their designees and provides for one motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and support the  underlying pieces of legislation.   H.R. 4664, the Financial Services and General Government  Appropriations Act of 2024, was subject to a robust committee process,  one that saw both Republicans and Democrats offer amendments during the  markup.   This is a work product the whole House can be proud of. Chairman  Womack and his team, working together with Ranking Member Hoyer and his  team, have produced a comprehensive and timely bill. While I am sure  the two sides have differences of opinion on the final product, I am  also sure I am joined by all my colleagues in thanking them for their  hard work.   There are many aspects of this appropriations bill that I want to  highlight. First and foremost is the commitment to rooting out wasteful  spending.   The bill limits funds for 31 unauthorized accounts for a savings to  the American taxpayer of approximately $64 million. It ensures that the  Small Business Administration focuses on its core mission--helping  small businesses--and not undertaking unnecessary climate activism  outside of its primary responsibilities.   The bill also claws back wasteful spending from previous fiscal  years, including money used to hire an army of IRS workers. The  American people have been very clear. They don't want tens of thousands  of additional IRS agents.   I also commend this bill as a product of strong cooperation between  the Appropriations Committee and the authorizing Financial Services  Committee, on which I am proud to sit. The bill furthers a lot of the  efforts we have been working on in that committee.   It would prevent the SEC under Chair Gensler from finalizing rules  that vastly overstep the Commission's jurisdiction, including ones that  push ESG and Green New Deal agenda items over the interests of everyday  investors.   The bill prevents the Federal Housing Finance Agency from forcing  responsible borrowers to subsidize individuals with bad credit.   This bill also eliminates funding for the Federal Insurance Office  and stops the Federal Government from taking over the insurance  industry, an industry that is already successfully regulated at the  State level.   I would be remiss if I did not mention the waste and abuse that this  bill prudently targets, starting with penalizing the administration for  not submitting its budget request on time. If the President can't  complete this task, then there must be consequences. This is a basic  principle in business and in our households, one our government would  be prudent to similarly adopt.   Additionally, this legislation prohibits funds for Federal agencies  until telework policies are reinstated to prepandemic standards. The  pandemic is over, and it is long past time that the Federal Government  returned to work. Our constituents deserve fully staffed and responsive  agencies, and I commend Chairman Womack for his commitment to this  principle.   Finally, we are here today and over the course of this week to  consider more appropriations bills like the one provided for in this  rule because we must rein in Federal spending.   To be more exact, this bill comes in at approximately 20 percent  below the President's request, without sacrificing essential government  functions. If enacted, it represents a modest 7 percent cut below last  year's fiscal level.   The most important number we should all keep in mind is $33 trillion,  that is $33 trillion in debt. We can no longer afford to kick the can  down the metaphorical road. Madam Speaker, there is no road left.   We need to pass this rule and the FSGG appropriations bill so we can  continue to deliver on the fiscal sanity that puts us back on the right  path.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the sky is not falling. I would remind my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle that the spending levels in this bill  are the same as they were just 10 months ago. The sky was not falling  then, and the sky is not falling now.   We are talking about cuts to some agencies, agencies that are intent  on overregulating our small and midsize banks out of business.   If our colleagues on the left would have their way, we would have  three major national banks and no access to community lending.   I certainly think my constituents would rather have access to their  community banks than worry about how much funding level we are giving  those agencies.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Langworthy).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to touch on a few things mentioned by my  colleague on the other side of the aisle.   We talk about no economic cost to what they are doing in this bill in  terms of climate, but we saw during the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank  and Signature Bank that our regulators Federally were spending more  time focused on climate risk to our financial sector than to systemic  risk.   This is an asleep-at-the-wheel approach of the Biden administration  that we are trying to avoid in this piece of legislation.   My colleagues also discussed the District of Columbia. Well, the  District of Columbia is receiving Federal funds in this piece of  legislation which does give us an opportunity to weigh in on what we  think the policies and the policy riders that should follow within that  should be attached to this piece of legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, again, this bill funds at a level that  we were just at 10 months ago. The sky was not falling then. The sky is  not falling now, despite protestations of my friends from the other  side of the aisle.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, with the Nation $33 trillion in debt, a number higher  than the U.S. GDP, Congress has the responsibility to reduce Federal  spending when possible.   According to the CBO, the United States ran a $1.7 trillion deficit  in 2023, driven by $6.1 trillion in spending and $4.4 trillion in  revenues following a $1.4 trillion deficit in fiscal year 2022.   This type of spending is completely unacceptable, and every Member of  Congress knows it.   With regard to funding for public defenders, $1.14 billion is  afforded in this bill for public defender services. This provides $8.7  billion for the judiciary, of which $110.4 million is above the fiscal  year 2023 enacted level.   There is no amount of spending cuts that our friends on the left will  support. We have to get our fiscal house in order. This is a  responsible step forward while still providing for the needs of the  American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would note for my friends on the other side of the  aisle that 40 percent of the debt was incurred under Nancy Pelosi. Both  parties are responsible, but it is only House Republicans that seem to  be focused on cutting Federal spending. It just simply cannot continue.   It is why House Republicans have put forward and support a bipartisan  debt commission. We are talking about discretionary spending in these  bills, not mandatory spending. The lion's share of our debt is due to  our mandatory spending. We must address that.   Again, I commend Chairman Womack on this piece of legislation for  trying to cut unnecessary programs, stop funding for unauthorized  programs, cut spending, and get us back on a better path of fiscal  sanity.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, continuing to say that Republicans want to  cut Social Security and Medicare, to quote my colleague, ``cutting  these programs down to the bone,'' doesn't make it so.   Republicans are committed to reducing spending. We are committed to  trying to find a way to get our fiscal house in order and to get us out  of the calamity that we are currently in with our financial situation.   The debt commission won't make cuts. It might make recommendations on  how we can restore the Nation's fiscal health, which is a matter of  national security. It doesn't matter if we don't make cuts or if do we  make cuts if Social Security becomes insolvent. We cannot let that  happen, not on our watch.   Republicans are taking the initiative and taking the lead on trying  to solve the problem.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I note again that this bill is funded at  levels that we were just under 10 months ago. If we were operating just  fine 10 months ago under the grants that my colleague mentioned, then  we will be operating just fine following the passage of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   We face another week of big legislation under consideration for a  vote on the House floor to better the lives of everyday Americans. H.R.  4664, the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act  of 2024, as well as the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development  appropriations bill, which was provided for under a separate rule, are  important steps in delivering on our promises for a Nation that is both  responsive and responsible to the American people and one that delivers  a government that is accountable.   It is Republicans that are keeping our Commitment to America. With  the passage of these two bills, we are closer to finalizing the  appropriations process. We can continue to lead while also reining in  out-of-control government spending.   As I said in my opening remarks, we need to pass this rule and the  FSGG appropriations bill so we can continue delivering fiscal sanity to  put us back on a better path.   I look forward to moving these promises out of the House this week. I  ask my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on the previous question  and ``yes'' on the rule.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Leger Fernandez is as  follows:     An Amendment to H. Res. 847 Offered by Ms. Leger Fernandez of New                                   Mexico         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
