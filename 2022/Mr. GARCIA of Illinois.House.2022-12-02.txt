 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the work  of Illinois House Majority Leader Greg Harris, who is retiring from  office at the end of this session after 16 years of dedicated service  to the north side of Chicago and to our entire city and State.   Simply put, Majority Leader Harris' tenure in the General Assembly  has been historic. He spearheaded the effort to legalize same-sex  marriage in Illinois in 2013, championed healthcare reform, and has  fought with great success to expand the access to housing in our State.   Majority Leader Harris is a skilled and compassionate legislator. As  the first openly gay person in Illinois legislative leadership, he has  brought a lived experience to his work and has created a more equitable  city and State.   I am grateful for all the work Majority Leader Harris has  accomplished. His work will benefit people in Illinois for generations  to come. May he enjoy his well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
