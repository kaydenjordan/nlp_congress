 Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Judiciary Committee and a  professor of constitutional law, I rise against this uncommonly silly  and unprecedented so-called resolution of insistence.   We have already received hundreds of thousands of documents from the  Department of Justice, and yet now they want to subpoena information  relating directly to an ongoing criminal and counterintelligence  investigation which the majority knows full well the Department of  Justice cannot and will not release to us.   And why are they doing it? Well, presumably it is all to manufacture  a constitutional crisis so somebody can get fired over there, so they  can impeach Rosenstein, as they are talking in the Judiciary Committee,  so they can sack the Attorney General, so they can get rid of Mueller,  or whatever.   Do your jobs. Look what is going on in America. We have got more than  2,000 kids who are separated from their families by the policy of this  administration. Their parents don't know where they are. Let's do our  job. Let's reunify those kids with their parents.   We saw the Parkland massacre. We saw the Las Vegas massacre. We saw  the massacre in San Bernardino County. We have not had one hearing on a  universal criminal and mental background check that is desired by 97  percent of the American people--not one hearing. Instead, we are caught  up in this nonsense because they can't get over Hillary Clinton's  emails.   Enough. Get over it. Do your jobs.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Arizona says there is a loose fence  in America. There is a loose fence. Fifteen U.S. intelligence agencies  told us in January of 2017 that Russian agents had engaged in active- measure campaigns to undermine the American election. They had a  propaganda campaign to put poison on the internet through Facebook and  through other social media. They directly conducted a campaign of cyber  espionage and sabotage against the Democratic National Committee, and  they tried to break in to our election systems in more than 20 States.  And what have they done with the loose fence? Nothing. They have helped  to open the gates.   That is what we should be talking about today, not this ludicrous,  absurd resolution.                                time  1100
