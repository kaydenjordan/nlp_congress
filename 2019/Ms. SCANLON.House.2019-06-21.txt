 Madam Speaker, while I would love to rise in celebration  of the first day of summer, the cold, hard fact is that, as  temperatures soar, so does urban gun violence.   During a graduation party last weekend in my district in southwest  Philadelphia, a gunman opened fire, claiming one life and injuring five  other people.   Last weekend, 23 separate shootings claimed 32 victims and caused  five deaths in just 2 days in Philadelphia--23 shootings and five  deaths in one weekend.   What is infuriating is that there are proven, commonsense measures  that will reduce gun violence in our cities, and the number one  strategy is background checks.   115 days have passed since the House sent two bipartisan, commonsense  gun safety bills to the Senate. They would have strengthened our  background checks. And what has the Senate done? Nothing.   During those 115 days, 11,400 people have died from gun violence in  the United States.   Senator McConnell likes to joke about his legislative graveyard, but  countless families are actually burying their loved ones while he does  nothing.   The American people deserve better. Our children deserve better.                            ____________________
