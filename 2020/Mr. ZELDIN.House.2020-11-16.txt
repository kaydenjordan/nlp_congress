 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 910, the  National Sea Grant College Program Amendments Act of 2020, which would  authorize roughly $513 million over 5 years for NOAA's National Sea  Grant College Program.   Mr. Speaker, representing a district almost completely surrounded by  water in New York's First Congressional District, Sea Grant has worked  to support our local fishermen and oyster growers, protect our beaches,  and support marine science research that is essential for our local  economy and environment.   Leading some of the largest bipartisan coalitions of lawmakers to  ever support Sea Grant, with my Democratic colleague, Congressman   Joe  Courtney from Connecticut, we have helped secure critical funding over  the years for Sea Grant through the appropriations process.   With imported seafood making up the vast majority of American's  seafood consumption, this critical program will help strengthen local  seafood businesses on Long Island and across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  bipartisan legislation.
