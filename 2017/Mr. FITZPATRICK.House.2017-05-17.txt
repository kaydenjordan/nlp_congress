 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of our Nation's  teachers. Teachers change lives every day across our Nation and around  the world, shaping our students and our communities.   Each of us can remember a teacher who made an impression on our life  as an educator, a coach, or a mentor, often beyond the walls of the  classroom.   Last week, in honor of Teacher Appreciation Week 2017, I had the  opportunity to travel the Eighth District to see firsthand the amazing  work that teachers do across Bucks and Montgomery Counties.   Throughout the week, I had the opportunity to read to preschool  students at the Elbow Lane School in Warrington to discuss our national  debt with eighth graders in Newtown Middle School, marked the Sanctuary  Model accreditation of the Valley Day School in Morrisville, and held a  student townhall with the AP government class students at Bensalem High  School.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Teacher Appreciation Week, and I  call on every American to carry out that appreciation for our teachers  all year long.                                time  1030                       My Constituents Deserve Answers     Mr. Speaker, I rise today because this week marks  the 1-year anniversary since the EPA established the health advisory  level of 70 parts per trillion to limit the lifetime exposure to  perfluorinated compounds like PFOA and PFOS.   To some, these acronyms and this anniversary may mean nothing, but to  me and my constituents--more than 70,000 Pennsylvanians in Bucks and  Montgomery Counties--it has been a year of confusion, concern, and  anger sparked by the rightful fear that their health has been  endangered by these PFCs.   The use of firefighting foam at military bases in and around our  district has contaminated dozens of public wells and over 140 private  wells with these compounds, leaving many residents scared and  municipalities and local governments looking for answers.   Mr. Speaker, every American deserves access to clean, safe drinking  water. Yet, for too many of my constituents, these elevated levels of  PFCs have put them and their families at risk.   While work has been done, there is still far more work to do; and I  am pleased that the recent government funding measure included  directions for the Secretary of Defense to continue addressing these  pressing issues, specifically by requiring all military services to  establish procedures for prompt and cost-effective remediation of PFC  contamination, and also by delivering a report to Congress by the end  of the summer assessing the number of military installations across the  country impacted and the effect on drinking water in the surrounding  communities, as well as departmentwide plans for community notification  of contamination and procedures for timely remediation.   However, our work cannot stop here. Not only should a health study be  executed to know if PFOS and PFOA have compromised my constituents'  long-term health, other issues must be addressed, including interacting  with the Department of Veterans Affairs regarding service-connected  condition care for military veterans potentially impacted and finding  ways to offset trickle-down costs for those forced to connect to public  water in impacted areas.   After a year, my constituents deserve more answers, and we will give  them to them. They demand action. I will fight for both.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr.  Buck, for his leadership on this important issue, and I rise in strong  support.   Mr. Speaker, my great-uncle, Phil Fitzpatrick, was a proud patrolman  with the NYPD. He was also a poet, often referring to police officers  as soldiers of peace. This week, as we recognize Police Week 2017, I  find myself thinking of him and a line from one of his poems, where he  wrote: ``When he kisses his wife and children goodbye, there's the  chance he will see them no more.''   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, these words were true for my family. This  month marks 70 years since my great-uncle was shot while attempting to  disarm a robber in a Manhattan bar, a fatal injury he succumbed to days  later.   Mr. Speaker, for too long, law enforcement across this country has  been forgotten or, worse yet, ostracized. At the same time, their vital  mission continues, and it continues to grow more dangerous. Just last  year, ambush-style killings of law enforcement officers increased by  167 percent, according to the National Association of Police  Organizations. Despite all this, each day, tens of thousands of brave  women and men continue to put their lives on the line to serve and  protect our communities.   This week, we recognize Police Week 2017, but the dedication and  sacrifice of our blue line deserves to be respected every day. As a  former law enforcement officer, I am proud to stand here today in  support of those brave women and men.   Today, the House has a chance to take decisive action to protect our  law enforcement officers by passing the legislation before us. The Thin  Blue Line Act sends a clear message to those who intentionally target  our police officers. Vicious attacks on law enforcement officers will  be met with justice.   I urge my colleagues to stand up for law enforcement today, support  this rule, and pass H.R. 115, the Thin Blue Line Act. The bipartisan  support it deserves must be delivered today.                                time  1315
