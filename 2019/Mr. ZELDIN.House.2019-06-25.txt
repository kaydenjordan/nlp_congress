 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to rise today recognizing  Rabbi Dr. Steven Moss of B'nai Israel Reform Temple, who is retiring  after serving his community for over 47 years.   Rabbi Moss became the first ordained rabbi for B'nai Israel in June  of 1974 and has honorably served his community ever since.   Rabbi Moss' service to his community and his accomplishments are  nothing less than extraordinary. He has been the chair of the Suffolk  County Human Rights Commission since 1992 and has served as the  chaplain to the Suffolk County Police Department, with the rank of  deputy chief of chaplains, since 1986.   Additionally, Rabbi Moss is the co-chair of the Suffolk County Anti- Bias Task Force; chair of the Islip Town Anti-Bias Task Force in the  battle against anti-Semitism and other bias crimes; director and  founder of STOP/BIAS, an educational program for people who have  committed hate and bias crimes; former president of the Suffolk County  Board of Rabbis; board member on the New York Board of Rabbis and the  Center for the Holocaust, Diversity and Human Understanding at the  Selden campus of Suffolk Community College; founder of the Jewish  Hospital Referral Service; pastoral care coordinator of the Suffolk  Partners in Dignity; hospital chaplain at Good Samaritan Hospital,  Brookhaven Memorial Hospital, and Southside Hospital; and is the  longest sitting member of the Islip Town Board of Ethics.   I have known Rabbi Moss since I was a little kid. Nearly 27 years  ago, he was the rabbi who presided over the bar mitzvah service for me  and, this November, will be the rabbi for my daughter's b'not mitzvah.  He has left a lasting impact on so many lives, including my own.   One of the things I love the most about Rabbi Moss is how he visits  people in hospitals, nursing homes, and elsewhere all the time, every  day. If you think you have lost touch with Rabbi Moss and it has been  20 years since you have last spoken to him, even if you weren't really  that close with him back in the day, if he finds out that you are at a  local hospital, he will come and visit you and pray for you.   His family services during the High Holy Days are amazing for the  kids. He involves everyone. It is not easy to get every single kid in a  temple totally engaged, all in, without much effort, but Rabbi Moss has  charisma that is second to none.   Most importantly, he is simply a very kind, warm, and decent human  being who loves everyone.   Rabbi Moss is now en route to Poland, where he will bike 60 miles  from the gates of Auschwitz to the Jewish Community Center in Krakow,  which is also known as the ``Ride for the Living,'' in honor of the  millions of people who were murdered during the Holocaust.   Rabbi Moss and about 300 other bikers will be biking the entire 60  miles in one day to raise money for the Jewish Community Center in  Krakow, which supports the growing Jewish population there and in the  surrounding areas.   When asked about his upcoming experience, Rabbi Moss stated he  believes the experience will be overwhelming but that he is excited to  witness the growth of the Jewish diaspora.   On Sunday, B'Nai Israel held a going-away party for Rabbi Moss, where  they gifted him with a bronze plaque signifying that the sanctuary  within the synagogue will be named after him. Rabbi Moss deserves  nothing less after having served over 47 years at the synagogue.   He has been an incredible role model and mentor to both my family and  me, and he has continued to be a remarkable role model for thousands of  others.   I look to him as a community leader, an inspiration, and a teacher,  one with an amazing ability to connect with anyone. I would like to  thank Rabbi Moss for all he has done for our community, and I wish him  nothing but the best in his retirement.                            ____________________
