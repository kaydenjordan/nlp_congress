 Madam Speaker, today we will vote on a resolution that  will somehow try to legitimize the last 5 weeks' worth of phony  impeachment inquiries going on downstairs in a secure room.   Instead of voting on and taking up the issues that matter to the  American people, we continue to chase this witch hunt trying to take  down the accomplishments of our President, Donald J. Trump. Indeed, the  economy we have, the low unemployment we have, and the success we are  having in the Middle East and other areas around the world aren't good  enough.   When my colleagues on the other side of the aisle admit that they  probably won't win another election and they have to try to use the  impeachment process to try to take the President down, that shows how  phony this process is.   So to try today to pass a resolution to somehow legitimize the last  5-plus weeks' worth of work and, indeed, really 2\1/2\ years' worth of  attacking this President shows that this place has a misplaced set of  priorities.   Instead of doing the work of the American people, they are using this  as a political process to attack what we have all been able to  accomplish.                            ____________________
