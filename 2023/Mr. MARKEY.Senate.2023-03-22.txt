 Madam President, over the past several weeks, I have  heard my colleagues on both sides of the aisle voice concerns about an  issue I have been raising for years--protecting children and teens from  online dangers. Recently, much of that conversation has focused on the  social media app TikTok.   I want to be clear. TikTok poses serious and specific privacy  problems. We are talking about a company that could expose American  users', including young users', personal and sensitive information to  the Chinese Government. The intelligence community has raised grave  concerns that Beijing could potentially influence millions of American  TikTok users with the platform's algorithms, spread malware to our  smartphones, force the company to amass troves of data on users, and  then demand that the information be handed over to the Chinese  Communist Party.   In other words, TikTok could collect your personal data without your  consent and then target you with information that the Chinese  Government wants you to see or potentially, even worse, monitor where  you go and what you do.   We already know that TikTok is currently on privacy probation with a  Federal Trade Commission consent decree. They had to pay a $5 million  fine for violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. That  is my law. We should listen to those warnings, and we should do our job  to legislate and regulate in response to these warnings.   I am pleased to hear so much concern for the experiences of our young  people online. This is the kind of formidable bipartisan movement to  rein in the overreach of Big Tech that we needed in this Chamber 3  months ago when lobbyists flooded to the Capitol to kill my Children  and Teens' Online Privacy and Protection Act--COPPA 2.0--to raise  protections up to age 16 for young people in our country in terms of  the protection of their privacy.   Here is the reality: Asserting that TikTok stands alone as the one  platform that poses a serious surveillance threat to our Nation's young  people is deliberately missing the Big Tech forest for the TikTok  trees.   It is in this dark, dank forest where even more dangers lurk. TikTok  needs to be regulated immediately--we can agree on that--but it is  absolutely not the only digital danger kids face today. There is no  justification for starting and stopping there, because do you know who  else is on privacy probation with the Federal Trade Commission in  addition to TikTok? YouTube. Google's video platform also violated my  law. The Federal Trade Commission fined it $170 million for invading  kids under the age of 12 and their privacy. That is just a slap on the  wrist to Google, $170 million. Oh, and Facebook too. The Federal Trade  Commission fined Facebook $5 billion for violating users' privacy  protections. Remember, TikTok was fined $5 million. Facebook has been  fined $5 billion for violating privacy in our country.   So, yes, we do have to address the TikTok threat, but what we really  need to do is to take on all of Big Tech with a set of commonsense  protections to stop the tsunami of privacy invasions kids face today  online.   America's children and teens are literally dying because of the  impacts of social media platforms, and we must save them from drowning.  In other words, I agree with my colleagues. Let's make sure kids are  protected from Chinese surveillance; but at the end of the day, our  moral obligation is to protect our youngest people from an entire  industry that poses a direct and existential threat to their  generation's well-being.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just announced that 1  in 3 high school girls in the United States of America had seriously  considered suicide in the last year--1 in 3 teenage girls seriously  considered suicide in the last year. And over half of all teenage girls  say that they are ``persistently sad or hopeless.'' Banning TikTok will  not solve that problem.   At least 1 in 10 girls in the United States attempted suicide in the  past year. Can I say that again? At least 1 in 10 girls in the United  States attempted suicide last year. Among LGBTQ+ youth, the number was  1 in 5 who attempted suicide in the past year. Banning TikTok will not  solve that problem.   Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about  their bodies, Instagram made them feel even worse. Banning TikTok will  not solve that problem.   And do you know where that latest statistic comes from? Instagram's  parent company, Facebook. Just remember, about 22 million teens log  into Instagram each and every day in America.   Our children and our teenagers--they are sick, and Big Tech is the  parasite preying upon them every single day in our country. These  aren't Republican  [[Page S888]]  children. These aren't Democratic children. These are America's  children.   The truth is that a myopic focus on a single app is a major missed  opportunity. Why would we act on only one company when we should and  can act on all of these companies that are preying upon the children  and teenagers in our country as we debate here on the Senate floor?    Taking on TikTok alone will not solve the sinister surveillance that  kids and teens face online every single day. Here is an example.   Let's say Congress does ban TikTok in the United States or, perhaps,  the Federal Government simply forces the app's Chinese parent company  to sell or to divest. Would that stop China from tracking teens online?  No, it wouldn't. We would still have no rules and no laws stopping the  Chinese Government from simply buying sensitive information about young  users, which data brokers already traffic during their normal course of  business in the United States of America, because, right now, a 14- year-old girl with bulimia or anorexia in our country has zero privacy  rights online. Are we going to do something about that? Do we want to  let that young girl continue to be made vulnerable by unscrupulous  American or Chinese companies?   If we are going to debate this issue, let's talk about it. Let's get  right down to what this whole thing should be about: Big Tech should  not control the agenda in terms of our protections for young teenage  girls or boys in our Nation.   She, that 14-year-old girl, cannot tell Instagram or Snapchat or  YouTube: You may not collect, share, or sell my personal information.  By the way, her parents can't tell those companies either. Banning  TikTok will not change that. Banning TikTok does not stop the Chinese  Government or its partners from simply buying the data we are afraid  the company will hand over willingly.   Is this threat somehow lessened if it is a transaction as opposed to  part of a takeover? Of course not.   Here is the truth: Right now, an entire generation is growing up with  some of the most powerful companies in history that are tracking,  targeting, and traumatizing them every single day in our country. Big  Tech is knowingly and willfully fueling a youth mental health crisis in  our Nation.   You don't have to take my word for it. Listen to the President of the  United States. Listen to the Surgeon General of the United States.  Listen to the American Academy of Pediatrics in our country. Experts  all over our Nation are drawing a straight line from Big Tech's  business model to the devastating impacts on young Americans' well- being.   Do you know what will help solve this problem? Data privacy  protections for children and teenagers in our country if we want to  really deal with the threat to our Nation when one in three teenage  girls considered suicide last year. That is a threat to our Nation.  When 1 in 10 teenage girls actually attempted suicide last year, that  is a danger to our Nation. A lot of it is as a result of social media.   Let's get down to this issue. Let's debate TikTok. Let's debate all  of it in terms of threats to our country, because the data these tech  companies collect about young users is the raw material--the inputs-- for powerful artificial intelligence systems. These algorithms take  information about kids and teens and use it to push toxic content to  those young people that they know will grab their attention and keep  them scrolling on the app so they can sell more ads and make more  money, and banning TikTok will not solve that problem.   On the topic of algorithms, if we are worried about the Chinese  Government using TikTok's algorithm to influence our elections and our  democracy, we should also be worrying about how China uses Facebook and  Twitter and Instagram and YouTube, as well, to undermine our democracy.   Let's get at this. If we are going to debate all of this, let's put  it out here finally. Let's just get Big Tech out of this debate and  have 100 Senators talk about the real threats to teenagers and to our  democracy. Let's have that debate. We already saw Russia manipulate  Facebook in 2016. If we want to protect democracy, let's do it for  every single social media platform in our country.   Young people are particularly vulnerable to Big Tech's algorithmic  practices. That is why, for more than a decade, I have been introducing  legislation that would solve that problem. My update to the Children's  Online Privacy Protection Act for kids under 12 and their parents  online would give them a bill of rights for kids 16 and under in our  Nation. The parents could just tell those companies: Stop tracking my  child. Stop tracking my 14-year-old girl. Stop tracking my 15-year-old  girl. If she goes online because she has bulimia or anorexia to get  more information, you can't sell that information now to companies so  that they can target that girl with more products or information when  the parents are only talking to the family's physician.   Let's give those families some rights. Let's stand up for those  families against these tech companies that are monetizing the mental  health of the children in our country. Let's stop those companies from  putting profits over people, over teenagers.   We came very close to passing key provisions from that legislation at  the end of last year. My bill almost made it. Unfortunately, industry  lobbyists--they stood in our way. They made it impossible for it to  pass, because it destroys their business model of preying upon, making  money off of, young people in our Nation. But we just can't be  deterred.    We have to be more determined than ever to get this done on behalf of  the parents, the pediatricians, and young people who are demanding  action. I know we can do it, and there are leaders in the House, in the  Senate, in both parties, who want to get this done.   So, yes, we must be clear-eyed about threats of Chinese surveillance.  Yes, we must be clear-eyed about TikTok's national security risks. And,  yes, we must be clear-eyed about the unique threats to young people in  our country who are on that app.   I would urge my colleagues: Lift your gaze. Take off your blinders.  Be honest about what legislative proposals to ban TikTok can and cannot  accomplish on behalf of our youngest and most vulnerable in our  country.   Our obligation, in this moment, is to end the sinister surveillance  across all of the big tech behemoths that are fueling a youth mental  health crisis in this country.   TikTok poses a serious and unique problem, but we know the problem is  much bigger and much more pernicious than just one single app, as bad  as it is.   We have a responsibility to take action, and I call on my colleagues  to join, in a bipartisan fashion. As we debate TikTok, let's debate all  of it. Let's pass the bill that protects the imminent threat to the  mental health of the children and teenagers in our country every single  day.   We want to talk about TikTok and its longer term threats? Let's talk  about the threat right now. Let's talk about how young people are being  harmed.   Let's pass that legislation at the same time. That is going to be my  goal as this debate unfolds. It is to have votes on the floor of the  Senate on the protection of the children and teenagers in our country  from Chinese and American companies that are exploiting them every  single day.   I close with that number that I started with: One in three teenage  girls in the United States contemplated suicide last year. One in 10  teenage girls attempted suicide last year. We all know the role social  media is playing in this. This is our moment to take on this entire  industry globally to make sure that we protect the most precious  resource we have, to protect the future of our country, and that is  young people. They may be only 20 percent of our population, but they  are 100 percent of our future. And, right now, they are being exploited  by a single industry. Let's take on that industry.
