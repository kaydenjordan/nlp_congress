 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  conference committee report. The Interior and Environment section  provides $35.6 billion, which is $300 million more than fiscal year  2018 enacted.   We made critical investments in this legislation in Indian Country,  environmental protection, public land management, and the arts. The  Environmental Protection Agency is funded at $8.8 billion. This funding  will enhance the EPA's ability to protect human health and the health  of our environment.   We continue to invest in land and water conservation funds, civil  rights initiative programs, and historic preservation. We worked in a  bipartisan way to increase funding for the National Endowment for the  Arts and the Humanities.   Finally, it is critically important that this Interior bill upholds  the Federal Government's trust responsibilities to our Native American  brothers and sisters.   Funding for Indian Country is over $1 billion more than the  President's budget, and we did it in our committee's nonpartisan way.  Programs in the Interior bill impact all of us, from preserving our  natural and cultural resources, to protecting our health and safety.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to  vote for it as well.
