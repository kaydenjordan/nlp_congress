 Mr. Speaker, last month, more than 30,000 scientists,  including many from Florida, congregated for Neuroscience 2019, an  annual event dedicated to understanding the brain and the nervous  system.   Now, one of the many brain diseases that was discussed at this annual  meeting was glioblastoma, which is, unfortunately, prevalent in the  part of Florida that I represent. As a matter of fact, just last week,  my friend, Mark Cunningham, who was diagnosed with this aggressive  cancer 3 years ago, passed after many years of fighting for his life.   I ask that you join me in praying for the Cunningham family and all  those still fighting this horrible disease. I also ask that you thank  God for the inspiring person that Mark proved to be every day of his  life.   I would just say that I am thankful for the neuroscientists working  tirelessly to learn more about this disease. Last year, our community  received more than $48 million in funding from the National Institutes  of Health to conduct research aimed at understanding the nervous  system.   I have seen firsthand the important work being done at research  institutes in my community, including the Max Planck Florida Institute  for Neuroscience, and I am very confident that we can save lives.                            ____________________
