 Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of a grateful nation  to pay tribute to the unparalleled sacrifices of Utah's Gold Star  families. Thank you for your commitment to defending the Constitution  of our great Nation. Thank you for your selfless service to others. And  thank you for your love of our country, the United States of America.  It is essential to our Nation's survival that we recognize and remember  the sacrifices you have made.   Given the extraordinary nature of your sacrifices, the duty of  recognizing and remembering them is of utmost importance. Furthermore,  in a time when our Nation's cardinal values are more regularly  attacked, this work mends the fraying fabric of freedom. My purpose  today is to honor all that you, the Gold Star families of Utah, have  done for our Nation and its citizens.   On August 1, 2020, a group of Utahns gathered at the North Ogden City  Hall. There, in the heat of summer, the families, friends, and  neighbors of fallen soldiers came together with business leaders and  government officials to dedicate the North Ogden City Gold Star  Families Memorial Monument. This monument, the first of its kind in  Utah, but not the last, recognizes and remembers the sacrifices of  Utah's Gold Star families. A similar monument has been built in St.  George and will soon be dedicated. The monuments stand as beacons of  light and hope, tributes to those who have been lost.   The idea for these monuments was inspired by the work of the Woody  Williams Foundation whose mission is ``to honor, recognize, and serve  Gold Star Families and the legacy of their Loved Ones who have paid the  ultimate sacrifice.'' Their work, which focuses on the philosophical  pillars of homeland, family, patriot, sacrifice, and legacy, gave North  Ogden City and St. George a vision of what was possible.   After seeing the monument in North Ogden City, stakeholders in St.  George decided they would raise funds, find land, and construct a  monument of their own. St. George City, with the help of numerous  residents and businesses began the work of designating space, securing  over $100,000 of funding, and planning construction for the monument.  The committee worked tirelessly to unify, educate, heal, and inspire  others. Months of work led to a beautiful monument which now stands to  honor Gold Star families and the losses they have endured.   Eight feet tall and 13 feet wide, the monuments made of solid black  granite are two-sided tributes to the fallen. One side of each monument  bears the words: ``Gold Star Families Memorial Monument, a tribute to  Gold Star Families and Relatives who sacrificed a Loved One for our  Freedom.'' The other side tells a story across four granite panels  highlighting the themes of homeland, family, patriot, and sacrifice.  The most significant component of each monument is a gaping hole at the  center of the solid granite slabs. The empty space, a silhouette of a  saluting servicemember, represents the legacy of the loved ones of the  Gold Star families who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.  Together, these features tell each community's unique story of  sacrifice.   On the day of the dedication of the North Ogden monument, powerful  stories and memories were shared. I want to highlight just a few.   Kirk Chugg, the director of Follow the Flag North Ogden, said there  could be ``no better place [for the tribute]. As people go about their  day, we hope they see the monument and teach their children what it  means. It publicly proclaims to families that we have not forgotten  them.''   ``This will help us remember what America is all about,'' said Debbie  Allen, mother of the late Lt. Kenneth ``Kage'' Allen. ``I think too  many people forget what we stand for.''   James Laselute, of Layton, was there representing his stepson, the  late Lance Cpl. Quinn Keith. He said: ``For our family, things like  this help us through the grieving process and remind us that our loved  one's legacy endures.'' He continued: ``Monuments like this are what  keeps their name alive.''   Neal Berube, the mayor of North Ogden City at the time of the  monument's dedication shared: ``The Gold Star designation dates back to  World War I, when military families displayed service flags featuring a  blue star for every immediate family member serving in the Armed  Forces. The star's color would change to gold if a loved one died so  the community would know the price the family had paid for freedom.''   Mayor Berube then concluded: ``The strength of our nation is our  military. The strength of our military is our soldiers. And the  strength of our soldiers are our families.''   As the people of St. George set out to dedicate their Gold Star  Families Memorial Monument, similar sentiments have been shared.  Jennifer Moxon, Bronwyn Mount, and Mayor Michele Randall--who, with the  help of the St. George City Council, staff, and in partnership with the  Major Brent Taylor Foundation, have helped lead the development of the  St. George monument--have made powerful statements of gratitude and  hope.   Jennifer Moxon, mother of the late Sgt. Douglas Lee Moxon, recently  [[Page S1772]]  wrote: ``We are a family military. The very freedoms that we sometimes  take for granted are what our sons and daughters fight for every day.''  She continued: ``When we lost our son, my perspective changed. The  sacrifices these servicemembers and their families make every day are  deserving of respect and honor. This monument allows us to pay tribute  to the family members who lost loved ones. It is a place where we can  come, feel peace, and hopefully recognize their sacrifice will never be  forgotten.''   Gold Star Mother Bronwyn Mount, mother of the late Sgt. Bryan Cooper  Mount, recently shared: ``I am constantly surprised by the realization  that so many people all over the country are remembering and honoring  Cooper. To have so many people working towards this dedication, for the  last 20 months, has been humbling to our family. To have multiple  friends and families be willing to donate to the cost of the memorial  has touched us deeply. We are so grateful to be able to visit the  memorial and think of Cooper's, and others', sacrifices. We are  grateful for a community that cares about the sacrifice.''   Mayor Michele Randall shared: ``On August 6th, 2020, Sgt. Cooper  Mount's flag-draped casket arrived at the St. George airport. Moved by  the emotion and patriotism of the procession from the airport to the  mortuary, the City of St. George chose to be the second city in Utah to  install a Gold Star Families Memorial Monument in the heart of the city  at historic Town Square. Saturday, March 26th, 2022, will be the  dedication of the memorial and the culmination of many hours of work  and over $100,000 dollars raised by our residents. I cannot wait for  our community to see this breathtaking monument in remembrance of our  Gold Star families.''   I am honored to have the opportunity to highlight the great work that  so many people freely participated in to make this memorial, which  recognizes and remembers the sacrifices of Utah's Gold Star families,  possible. These monuments are not the last of their kind in Utah or in  the United States. More monuments are being discussed, planned, and  constructed. The movement to honor Gold Star families across America  has taken hold of many communities throughout the country.   Let us not allow this movement to rise in relevance for a moment and  then fade. Let us recognize and remember, forever, the sacrifices of  our Nation's Gold Star families.                            ____________________
