 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION            Singapore--Air-to-Ground Munitions Kits and Services         The Government of Singapore has requested to buy one       hundred (100) KMU-556 Tail Kits for Joint Direct-Attack       Munition (JDAM) GBU-31; nine hundred (900) KMU-572 Tail Kits       for JDAM GBU-38 and Laser JDAM GBU-54; two hundred fifty       (250) MAU-169 Computer Control Group for 500lb Paveway-II       (PWII) GBU-12; and two hundred fifty (250) MXU-650 Air Foil       Group for 500lb PWII GBU-12. Also included are DSU-38 laser       guidance sets; Common Munitions Built-In-Test/Reprogramming       Equipment; spare parts, consumables, accessories, and repair       and return support; aircraft and munitions support and       support equipment; personnel training and training equipment;       unclassified software; unclassified technical books and other       publications; U.S. Government and contractor engineering,       technical and logistics support services, studies and       surveys; and other related elements of logistical and program       support. The estimated total cost is $55 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a strategic partner that is an       important force for political stability and economic progress       in Asia.        The proposed sale will support the Republic of Singapore       Air Force's capability to contribute to coalition operations       and meet its national defense requirements. Singapore will       have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into       its armed forces.        This proposed sale will not alter the basic military       balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon Missile and       Defense, Tucson, AZ. A portion of the defense articles is       anticipated to come from U.S. Government stock. There are no       known offset agreements proposed in connection with this       sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Singapore.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-03       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Paveway II (PWII) is a maneuverable, free-fall Laser       Guided Bomb (LGB) that guides to a spot of laser energy       reflected off the target. The LGB is delivered like a normal       general purpose (GP) warhead, and the semi-active laser       guidance corrects many of the normal errors inherent in any       delivery system. Laser designation can be provided by a       variety of laser target markers or designators. An LGB       consists of a non-warhead-specific MAU-209 or MAU-169       Computer Control Group (CCG) and a warhead-specific Air Foil       Group (AFG) that attaches to the nose and tail of the GP bomb       body.        The GBU-12 is a 500lb GP bomb body fitted with the MXU-650       AFG to guide it to laser-designated targets,        2. Joint Direct-Attack Munitions (JDAM) consist of a bomb       body paired with a warhead-specific tail kit containing an       Inertial Navigation System (INS)/Global Positioning System       (GPS) guidance capability that converts unguided free-fall       bombs into accurate, adverse weather ``smart'' munitions. The       JDAM weapon can be delivered from modest standoff ranges at       high or low altitudes against a variety of land and surface       targets during the day or night. The JDAM is capable of       receiving target coordinates via preplanned mission data from       the delivery aircraft, by onboard aircraft sensors (i.e.,       FLIR, radar, etc.) during captive carry, or from a third-      party source via manual or automated aircrew cockpit entry.        a. The GBU-38 is a 500lb JDAM, consisting of a KMU-572 tail       kit and BLU-111 or MK-82 bomb body.        b. The GBU-31 is a 2,000lb JDAM, consisting of a KMU-556       tail kit and BLU-109 or MK-84 bomb body.        c. The GBU-54 Laser Joint Direct Attack Munition (LJDAM) is       a 500lb JDAM that incorporates all the capabilities of the       JDAM guidance tail kit and adds a precision laser guidance       set. The LJDAM gives the weapon system an optional semi-      active laser guidance in addition to the INS/GPS guidance.       This provides the optional capability to strike moving       targets. The GBU-54 consists of a DSU-38 laser guidance set,       KMU-572 tail kit, and MK-82 or BLU-111 bomb body.        3. The Common Munitions Built-In-Test (BIT)/Reprogramming       Equipment (CMBRE) is support equipment used to interface with       weapon systems to initiate and report Built-in-Test (BIT)       results and upload/download flight software. The CMBRE       supports multiple munitions platforms with a range of       applications that perform preflight checks, periodic       maintenance checks, loading of Operational Flight Program       data, loading of munitions mission planning data, loading of       GPS cryptographic keys, and declassification of munitions       memory.        4. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        6. A determination has been made that Singapore can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        7. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Singapore.
