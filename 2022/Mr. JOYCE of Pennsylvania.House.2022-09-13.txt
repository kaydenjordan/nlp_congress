 Mr. Speaker, this morning, we received  data that highlights once again the failure of the Biden administration  to provide for our economy and to provide for the economic well-being  of America.   At home in Pennsylvania, I have heard stories of parents unable to  afford back-to-school clothes and supplies for their children and  patients unable to afford the gas to put in their cars to drive to  doctors' appointments.   These problems are fruits from the same poisonous tree. Reckless  government spending has sent prices skyrocketing across our economy.  Instead  [[Page H7746]]  of addressing this cost, liberals continue to double down by passing  their so-called Inflation Reduction Act while the Congressional Budget  Office now reports that this act will increase our deficit through  2026.   The fact is simple. President Biden has proven that he is unable to  stop the runaway inflation that has raised the cost of housing, raised  the cost of groceries, and continues to affect energy sources  throughout America. The answer to this crisis will not be found in more  government handouts.   Now more than ever, we need to stop the inflation that is crippling  our economy and hurting Pennsylvania and all American families.                            ____________________
