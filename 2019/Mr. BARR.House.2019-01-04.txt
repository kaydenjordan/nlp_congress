 Mr. Speaker, yesterday's vote against commonsense border  security is a sad commentary on the misguided priorities of the new  majority in Congress.  [[Page H226]]    Instead of working in good faith to achieve a bipartisan compromise  to end the partial government shutdown and address the very real crisis  at our southern border, the new Democrat House leadership signaled that  all they really want to do is to continue their fight with this  President.   By totally dismissing what career professionals at the Department of  Homeland Security have said, that they actually need to impede the flow  of criminals, gangs, human traffickers, and drug dealers into our  country, the new leadership has signaled to the country that the new  majority has been co-opted by the most extreme and hyperpartisan voices  of the far left who are so far outside the mainstream and are so  blinded by their animosity toward this President that they have become  willing to place the interests of illegal immigrants ahead of the  interests of the American people.   They would rather turn a blind eye to lawlessness. They would rather  compromise public safety and allow criminal gangs and drugs to flood  across our borders than even negotiate with this President.   In their meeting with the White House earlier this week, the  Democrats refused to even listen to a briefing of the Secretary of the  Department of Homeland Security about the threats we face from an  unsecured border.   This is a matter of national security. It is time for Congress to put  the safety of the American people over open borders and political  games.                            ____________________
