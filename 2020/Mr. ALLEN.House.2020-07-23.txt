 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again this Congress is being asked to vote on an  enormous spending package after being produced in just the last few  weeks.   How can the American people possibly have time to learn where their  tax dollars are going?   Today, we are considering amendments to a four-bill, 689-page package  that totals $219.6 billion in discretionary spending, plus another  $37.5 billion in emergency spending.   The bills in this package spend billions on top of what the current  budget agreement allows, and they also contain partisan poison pills,  like overturning the administration's Mexico City Policy, allowing  foreign organizations to receive Federal funds, even if they perform  abortions.   Let me underscore, under the Democrat majority, we can't even stick  to the budget that was agreed to.   As a former business owner--and if you talk to any business owner,  they will tell you the same thing--you have to operate within a budget.   Every day, families across this country are sitting down at the  kitchen table making tough choices to live within their means.   I am appalled by the lack of fiscal responsibility being shown by  this body today as we seem to hold ourselves to a different standard  than American workers and families.   Unfortunately, that is just business as usual in the 116th Congress.   The level of appropriations for State Department and Foreign  Operations, which is what this amendment is specifically targeting, is  $8.5 billion higher than Fiscal Year 2020, an increase of nearly 15  percent.   The bill continues funding normal activities through Overseas  Contingency Operations, rather than through the normal funding  accounts, which is a mechanism that was originally set up to avoid  spending constraints.   My amendment today is simple. It would reduce State and Foreign  Operations spending by 5 percent for Fiscal Year 2021. If you do the  math, my amendment would cut about $3.3 billion.   Even with my modest 5 percent cut, this division would still increase  spending for Fiscal Year 2021 compared to Fiscal Year 2020.   I believe my Democratic colleagues should support my amendment, since  they will still be spending a lot of your hard-earned money, just a bit  less than they initially intended.   I want to be clear, though. I do not want to cut funding going  towards our cherished and critical ally, Israel.   I also want to know that our diplomatic efforts abroad are necessary.  In fact, my son is currently living overseas and working on behalf of  our Nation's interests. But it is important that we look at the balance  sheet and make cuts wherever possible.   We can no longer neglect our national debt crisis, and my colleagues  must take a serious look at Washington spending and start to take back  control.   For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we must act  immediately to rein in Federal spending so we don't leave our next  generation with an insurmountable debt.   Mr. Speaker, I am the proud grandfather of 13 grandchildren, with one  on the way, and I believe it is my duty to do everything in my power to  avoid placing a $26 trillion and rising burden of debt on their backs.   My amendment is just a small first step toward bringing fiscal  responsibility back to Washington. I urge all my colleagues in this  body to support my amendment today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I understand we are in unprecedented times. But of the  $10 billion in spending that Democrats say go towards international  coronavirus relief, only $2.5 billion is designated to health programs,  and a significant amount of those funds are diverted away from  coronavirus.   And let me just say that I understand the need to work with our  allies on a vaccine and global health response to the coronavirus, but  I believe that our priorities should be focused on combatting the virus  here in the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I cannot overstate the importance of restoring fiscal  sanity here in the United States Congress. It is in the best interests  of the future of our country that we take desperately needed steps to  rein in our national debt.   We are passing along to future generations an enormous debt burden.  Does anybody understand that? I mean, can you imagine our children's  children's children's children dealing with this?   I would ask all my colleagues today to think about your kids, your  grandkids, and your great-grandkids before casting your vote.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, this bill that we are debating here is a  partisan travesty and spends entirely more than this government can  afford. That is why I rise again today to offer an amendment to cut  spending to the Interior and Environment portion of the bill.   In addition to its overspending, this bill attempts to delegitimize  President Trump's replacement for the Obama administration's  overreaching WOTUS rule. The farmers and landowners in my district will  tell you how devastating that would be.   It continues down the path that the far left have been touting this  entire Congress, implementing socialist Green New Deal policies  disguised as emergency funding, but this couldn't be further from the  truth. This bill not only spends more of Americans' taxpayer dollars,  but forces others to spend more, forcing onerous regulations on  American business owners that would ultimately lead to higher costs for  our American families.   Continuing to adhere to the Obama administration's outdated and  repressive regulations would be detrimental not only to the energy  sector workers, but to millions of American families whose budgets  depend on affordable and reliable fuel and natural gas, and would  jeopardize America's energy independence.   Today's minibus totals $219.6 billion in discretionary spending, plus  another $37.5 billion in emergency spending, busting the budget  agreement and increasing funds in the form of BCA cap-exempt funding,  with almost a third of the funding of this division not subject to the  BCA caps.   And let me remind you that under the Democratic majority, we can't  [[Page H3824]]  even stick to the budget that was agreed to. The Interior and  Environment division would provide funding at a whopping 41.4 percent  above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and 59 percent over the  President's request.   While the President's budget proposed to reduce or eliminate programs  in the EPA that are better left to States, communities, and private  individuals, the House's proposal for Interior and Environment  maintains or increases spending on EPA programs.   I am a former business owner, and just like any good business owner  or family knows, you must operate within a budget and make tough  choices to live within your means. As Members of the people's House, we  must hold ourselves to the same standard that American workers and  families do. My simple amendment is a good place to start.                                time  1845    My amendment would reduce interior and environmental spending by 5  percent for fiscal year 2021. I am going to do some quick math for you.  My amendment would cut about $2.7 billion.   Even with my 5 percent cut, this division would still dramatically  increase spending for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020. To  be honest, I wish we could cut more, but this is a place that I believe  we can start.   Even with my amendment, we still will be spending a lot of taxpayer  dollars, so I believe my Democratic colleagues could easily support  this.   Our national debt crisis can no longer be ignored, and my colleagues  must take a serious look at Washington spending in order to start  taking back control.   Madam Speaker, earlier today I mentioned my 13 beautiful  grandchildren, and I am excited that we have another one on the way. I  believe it is all of our duties to do everything possible to avoid  placing a $26 trillion, and growing, national debt burden on the backs  of the next generation.   My amendment is just a small, first step toward bringing fiscal  responsibility back to Washington.   I urge all of my colleagues in this body to support my amendment  today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let me try to understand what we are saying here. We  have a $25 trillion or $26 trillion and growing debt in this country. I  mean, is there no concern for future generations?   And when you look at the explosion of this debt--I mean, when I saw  the appropriations package, I could not believe it. I mean, we can't  even live within a budget? I mean, what kind of message are we sending  to our children and grandchildren here?   We can't leave them with an insurmountable debt simply because we as  a body refuse to take some commonsense steps to take back control of  this spending. We can't even cut 5 percent?   I am deeply concerned about the future of this country, and I urge a  ``yes'' vote on my amendment today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for  holding this special order.   This is a topic that we need to have a family discussion on. This  Congress needs to sit down together and have a family discussion on  where we are as a nation because I am deeply troubled by the state of  our Nation, and most of my constituents who talk with me on a daily  basis ask me what in the world is going on.   I go back to my childhood. I grew up on a farm, and I learned the  value of hard work. I tell people that outside of this President, my  daddy was the hardest worker that I have ever known. I am not sure he  could outwork this President.   Mr. Speaker, my dad was one of five people in my county that you  would go to see if you were going to run for public office. That is how  much he cared about his community; that is how much he cared about that  county; and that is how much he cared about his State.   I will be honest with you. My mother, my brother, my sister, and I  would get upset with him because he spent time doing things outside of  the home, trying to make our county and our State a better place to  live. So, one day, I asked him about it.   I said: Dad, why are you so involved in public service?   He said: Son, I grew up in the Great Depression, and I fought in  World War II. And in both times, I really thought there was a  possibility we were going to lose this country.   I think he made a covenant with God that he would do everything he  could to sustain the great Nation that he had the opportunity to grow  up in and farm and to be involved in education and all the amazing work  that my father did for that community. But he left me with this--and my  dear friend, Ralph Norman, talked about this tonight.   My dad said: Son, you have to understand one thing. Apathy is the  enemy of freedom.                                time  2015    You look at voter turnout, and you look at folks who say, ``I really  don't want to get involved,'' or, ``I don't want to get out and knock  on doors or make phone calls.''   Folks, I am going to sound the alarm. I am going to sound the alarm  for a lot of different people groups.   Take the small business community. The small business community  generates about 50 percent of the jobs in this country. Seventy percent  of all the new jobs created in this amazing economy we had before  COVID-19 were generated by the small business community.   The first reason I ran for Congress was because of the war on past  administrations on small business.   Let me tell you, small business, you need to get involved in this  process, because if we aren't careful, there will be another war on  small business.   I came down here today to talk about two amendments, and a lot of  those amendments dealt with the regulatory environment that, prior to  President Trump, was destroying the small business community.   You know, one of the greatest privileges that I have had in my life-- and I think this is maybe the greatest gift I have ever received from  God--is the privilege to give people the opportunity to have a good  job, to have the dignity and respect they deserve, to empower them to  be what God created them to be, and to allow them to provide for their  family, their country, and their church.   There is no greater satisfaction that I have found in this country--I  have not found one person who is unhappy, that is not filled with joy  when they are serving others. And we still have a tremendous amount of  that going on in this country.   But over the past few months, we have seen radical progressive  attacks on our Nation. What started as legitimate and peaceful protests  has since been hijacked by violent lawbreakers.   Now, let's be clear, the mob wants total anarchy. And we are seeing  it play out before our eyes, and it started long before we got here.  Now we are experiencing attacks on law enforcement. I saw that in my  generation on the military.   The destruction of Presidential memorials, the establishment of so- called autonomous zones. If you ask these folks who are destroying  these things, they don't even know who they are, but all that does is  that represents authority.   Well, I was fortunate almost 20 years ago to become--well, I had a  spiritual awakening, and I began to have this thirst for the Bible. And  so I began to research the Bible and to try to run my business and to  exhibit leadership skills and to deal with the issues of our culture  based on Biblical history and what is going on in the Bible.   Well, Romans 13 is very clear about authority. God ordains all  authority. And I encourage you to read Romans 13, because it will tell  you and describe to you the issues involved with authority and what  happens to a nation when those who rebel against authority, what can  happen.   In fact, I also am involved in many Bible studies here in Congress,  and it has been quite an education for me to  [[Page H3834]]  understand what is the relationship between God and government in our  culture.   Obviously, we heard tonight that this Nation was founded based on  people who came here seeking religious freedom. And so if you look at  exactly why God ordained government 4,000 years ago, it was one thing,  and that is to restrain evil. That is to deal with anarchy. That is to  deal with exactly what we are faced with right now.   Mr. Speaker, Members of this body are turning away from God. We  should be one voice here condemning this anarchy and evil we are seeing  across this country.   Well, I believe the best way forward is for our State and local  governments to step up. The Federal Government also has a unique role  to play.   Like I said, Speaker Pelosi and Democratic leaders have shown time  and time again that they would rather pass partisan, political  messaging bills than work with Republicans on bipartisan legislation-- like meaningful police reform.   My dear friend Senator Tim Scott has worked tirelessly to provide  police reform that I believe will work for America. The police force  needs it. They need our support. And I will tell you, they have my  support. Yes, there are going to be bad outcomes. It is the human  condition. We talked about that as well.   But there should be, at this time in the history of our country,  under this pandemic, unprecedented bipartisanship. But, clearly, over  the last few weeks, it shows that we would rather appease those on what  we term the radical left than work toward a more perfect Union.   Please, my friends, please, America, wake up.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues across the aisle realize sooner  than later that appeasing the mob will never stop. It will never be  enough. It is just like government funding. I have seen that in reality  with this pandemic. It is a feeding frenzy, and we are seeing it play  out right before our eyes here.   And let me tell you something: We need to look and try to look into  the future. Say, for example, if we were born today, when we look back  and understand why we are leaving our children and grandchildren--and I  don't know how many generations--400, 500 years--the obligation of this  debt. I don't know of any nation in history that has done something  like that. I mean, that in itself is a crisis.   Yet we are continuing to explode the debt. When I saw the  appropriations package, I could not believe it. We are trying to fight  the pandemic. Yes, we have created a lot of debt to deal with that,  and, yes, you are going to have to deal with emergencies. But just to  go and spend money that you don't have?   People say, well, this is taxpayer money. This is not taxpayer money,  folks. This is maybe 400 to 500 years down the road. Now, how are you  going to explain that to your children and grandchildren?   Mr. Speaker, there are seven influences in our culture: There is the  church. There is family. There is education. There is arts and  entertainment. There is the media. There is the government. And there  is the business.    And where do those influences stand today?   The church has been mitigated. Our Founders--yes, they didn't do it  perfect, but let me tell you, the church was a tremendous influence in  the founding of this country. When they couldn't agree, they brought in  the great ministers. And the ministers would reveal the Scriptures and  tell those Founders: This is how you come together.   We don't have that here. I have never heard somebody stand up and  say: This is what the Scripture says and this is why we need to come  together, and this is how we need to move forward.   I did say on this House floor in a Special Order on Bible Week that I  believe that the Bible has an answer to every problem we have got, if  we just researched it and we had someone to come down and tell us how  we should go. There are profits everywhere. We listen to them on Sunday  mornings.   Come on, folks, we need wise counsel.   Then there is the family. The family has been devastated. Fifty  percent of the children in this country are born in single-parent  homes. I don't blame children for being angry. And single moms, I tell  you, my heart goes out to them.   Education, you know, we took the values that God gave us out of the  education system, and we are seeing the fruits of that right now.   Arts and entertainment are supporting everything out there that,  frankly, is very difficult for us to understand. The media, the media  is so biased today.   The government, the government is trying to fix everything. Let me  tell you, the more problems we have in this society, the more this  government has got to spend. Folks, there is not enough money in the  world to fix a culture in anarchy. It won't work.   The business community, the business community is under siege. Like I  said, the reason I ran for Congress is there was a war on small  business.   Big business, I will tell you, I am disappointed in some of these  large companies that are buying in to some of these things that we see  today--the anarchy, the other things.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is time in America that we stand up and  defend the Nation we love. And those who wish to harm it--yes, people  ask me: Do you think we are under God's judgment?   I say: No, I think that would be a lot more difficult than what we  are seeing right now.   When you are under the judgment of God, you have got to look back at  what Israel went through. But I can tell you this. God could have  stopped this pandemic like that. God can stop this anarchy like that.  But God has removed his protection, in my opinion, from this Nation.  And until we repent from our evil ways and confess our sin, then God  will heal our land, and that is the only hope that we have.
