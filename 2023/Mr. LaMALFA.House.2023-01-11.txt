 Madam Speaker, in September of 2022, President Biden  declared the pandemic is over. Despite this, he has continued to extend  his public health emergency declaration.   Declaring an emergency gives the President overreaching authority  over Congress and the State health departments.   While this emergency is in place, the Federal Government can keep  States from removing ineligible people--that the rolls should be  cleaned up--from the Medicaid rolls, and the welfare state will keep  growing unchecked.   This declaration has enabled the emergency use of vaccines and  allowed the President to mandate involuntarily those vaccines to vast  swaths of the public with little input or debate from Congress and the  courts. It has also given him legal cover to buy votes with attempts at  student loan debt forgiveness, rent freezes, and eviction moratoriums.   Under the cover of this declaration, the President attempted to  change laws, impose decrees, and has altered the economic life of  millions of Americans very negatively.   This is setting a terrible precedent by allowing the executive branch  to rule by decree with no oversight or input from Congress. He is  replacing Congress' speech and debate with his own Presidential pen.   This gross overreach of authority must end and move back to a debate  and an open process.                            ____________________
