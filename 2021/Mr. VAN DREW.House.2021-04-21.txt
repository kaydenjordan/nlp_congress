 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.   In the midst of an unprecedented and ongoing border crisis, as CBP  struggles to keep up, Democrats focus on a bill that will not only be  expensive but will continue to hamper and slow down our hardworking  women and men with the CBP.   Almost a billion taxpayer dollars--almost a billion taxpayer  dollars--provided for by the hardworking men and women in America, both  legal immigrants and others, literally, to provide access to legal  representation to noncitizens. I guess they would call it noncitizen  human infrastructure. But really it is just another payday for lawyers.   America is struggling. Our borders are struggling. Our neighbors are  struggling. We all want to help. But let's help America. Let's love  America. Let's take care of our American people. Oppose this bill.
