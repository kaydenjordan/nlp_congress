Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5333, the Over-the- Counter Monograph Safety, Innovation, and Reform Act.   Over-the-counter medications are widely used to treat common ailments  such as colds, headaches, and seasonal allergies. In fact, more than  240 million Americans use OTC products every year and trust these  affordable remedies to get well and stay well.   Despite the success and high utilization of these medicines, the Food  and Drug Administration's regulatory framework for oversight of OTC  products, also called the monograph system, is outdated and incomplete.  The system was created more than 45 years ago, yet movement on  unfinished items has ground to a halt due to the cumbersome notice and  comment rulemaking process. I will give an example that was pointed out  in committee that the FDA brought out.   The FDA advanced notice proposed rulemaking for this one started on  December 4, 1979. Through a process of 20 different procedures they  went through, they got to November 19, 1997, almost 18 years later, and  what do they do? They reopen the administrative records to consider new  data. It is taking too long. That is what this bill would remedy.   The lack of modernization makes it impossible for manufacturers to  address safety concerns and offers little incentive to develop new  products.   H.R. 5333, which I introduced with the Health Subcommittee chairman,  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess); the Health Subcommittee vice  chairman, the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie); the Health  Subcommittee ranking member, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green),  the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette); and the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell) would provide meaningful and long overdue  reform to FDA's monograph system.   The necessary reforms would create a more flexible framework that  accounts for advances in science, permits timely updates to safety  information and label changes, and creates a workable process for  completing unfinished monographs.   By updating the current burdensome process, Congress would also  create a pathway to market for new and innovative products that greatly  benefit our constituents and reduce strain on our healthcare system.   Safe, reliable, and affordable OTC drugs allow consumers to treat  common ailments at home, usually without visiting a healthcare  provider, saving the healthcare system $102 billion annually.   Our bill would improve regulatory certainty for manufacturers and,  over time, we would see additional investment in research and  development, leading to new, innovative OTC medicines that will  continue to save Americans and our healthcare system money.   I thank my colleagues, FDA, and stakeholders for working so closely  with me over the last 2 years to ensure that this modernization effort  appropriately addresses and resolves this complex issue.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 5333 to  modernize the broken monograph system, strengthen consumer protection,  spur innovation, and increase consumer choice.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), the chairman of the Health  Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I just want to thank all the  members for all their hard work on this. Especially, I want to thank  the gentleman from Oregon, the chairman of the full committee, for his  work on this piece of legislation. Also, I want to thank the staff.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.
