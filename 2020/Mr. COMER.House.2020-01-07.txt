 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reaffirm my strong support  for the Second Amendment and stand up for the constitutional right for  all Americans to keep and bear arms.   At a time when efforts are underway across the country to restrict  gun ownership, patriotic Americans are rising up in strong defense of  the Second Amendment. This is especially true in my home State of  Kentucky, where there is significant grassroots energy on the side of  defending a right that our Founding Fathers considered to be of  critical importance.   Whether it be red flag laws or other proposals aimed at limiting  access to firearms or ammunition, politicians across the country are  seeking to roll back the basic rights of law-abiding Americans. As a  member of the Congressional Second Amendment Caucus, I pledge to  strongly oppose these proposals as well as any effort to infringe on  the fundamental freedom of gun ownership.                            ____________________
