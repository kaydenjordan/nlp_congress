 Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about  the President's recent interference in war crimes cases involving  members of the U.S. military and the President's inappropriate public  statements regarding these cases.   The President has the power to pardon, but he has a responsibility to  use that power wisely, not recklessly. The way he has gone about it in  this instance does a real disservice to our troops and the entire  American military justice system.   Good order and discipline are critical and time-honored traits of the  U.S. military, not only to enable military readiness and effectiveness  but also to ensure that military men and women remain firmly tethered  to our Nation's moral and ethical principles in the most demanding  wartime environments.   A few have argued that the President has the authority to pardon, but  that is a false defense. The issue is that the President's intervention  in these cases sends a damaging message to the world, our adversaries,  and, most importantly, our men and women in uniform. The Commander in  Chief's actions should make us safer and stronger in the world, but  President Trump's actions do not.   The cases in which the President intervened fall far outside of the  norm. The President's pardon authority has traditionally been reserved  for nonviolent infractions, including draft evasion and desertion. I am  aware of no other instance in which a President has intervened to grant  clemency for violent crimes committed while in uniform, especially for  war crimes including murder.   Especially concerning is the President's decision to intervene in a  case prior to its even going to trial--an action that I believe is an  insult to our entire system of military justice.   Just this morning, the President again intervened--via tweet--to stop  a Navy administrative review process that could have resulted in the  removal of a servicemember from the Navy SEALs, despite the fact that  the servicemember was previously found guilty of posing for photos with  a dead ISIS fighter. We must expect more from our military men and  women, especially those in our Special Operations forces.   Regrettably, President Trump has repeatedly advocated for a return to  torture, stating that we should ``take out the families'' of terrorists  and expressing his view on standards of military conduct by saying:  ``You have to play the game the way they are playing the game.'' The  President's statements are reminiscent of former Vice President  Cheney's embrace of the ``dark side'' of counterterrorism--the very  kind of thinking that underpinned later abuses at Abu Ghraib and the  CIA's use of torture as part of its so-called Detention and  Interrogation Program.   President Trump tweeted in October that ``we train our boys to be  killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!''   No, Mr. President, the U.S. military does not prosecute its own for  carrying out lawful missions in service to our Nation. We do not train  our troops to kill indiscriminately. We do not train them to attack  noncombatants. We do not train them to violate the Geneva Convention  and the rule of law because we want our troops to be protected by those  same standards. To think or say otherwise is to go against discipline,  the selfless service of so many, and the history of our military.   As former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff GEN Dempsey wrote in  May:         Absent evidence of innocence or injustice the wholesale       pardon of US servicemembers accused of war crimes signals our       troops and allies that we don't take the Law of Armed       Conflict seriously. Bad message. Bad precedent. Abdication of       moral responsibility. Risk to us.    I couldn't agree more.   Some have claimed that the President's intervention in this case has  somehow improved the morale of our military and given them more  confidence on the battlefield. On the contrary, President Trump's  disregard for our military justice system risks undermining the  confidence of our servicemembers in the rule of law--especially those  who are courageous enough to bring allegations of war crimes to light  and testify against their teammates.   By substituting his judgment for that of commanders and military  juries, the President may also inadvertently increase the risk to our  U.S. personnel overseas. When we do not hold our military personnel to  appropriate standards of conduct, it makes it more likely that they  will face similar abuses on the battlefield and less likely that we  will be able to hold our enemies accountable.   There is no one with more credibility and no one with the service and  sacrifice who can say it any better or more authentically than former  Senator John McCain, who stated:         This is a moral debate. It is about who we are. I don't       mourn the loss of any terrorist's life. What I do mourn is       what we lose when by official policy or official neglect we       confuse or encourage those who fight this war for us to       forget that best sense of ourselves. Through the violence,       chaos, and heartache of war, through deprivation and cruelty       and loss, we are always Americans, and different, stronger,       and better than those who would destroy us.    Those are the words of John McCain.   I believe the President's actions minimize the honorable service of  all U.S. servicemembers who have served with discipline and distinction  since 9/11 and have answered our Nation's call throughout the history  of this country.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
