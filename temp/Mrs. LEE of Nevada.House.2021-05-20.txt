 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues  in bringing attention to the widespread violence against the Asian- American community. This pandemic has inflamed hatred and racism, and  we must lend our voices in support of our Asian-American brothers and  sisters.   In Georgia, just 2 months ago, a horrific attack targeted three  Asian-owned spas, and eight lives were lost. They were working parents,  grandparents, and spouses, and they left behind an unconscionable loss  and emptiness in their communities.   We know that this attack is not isolated. Since the start of the  pandemic, there have been more than 6,600 reported incidents of anti- Asian hate. Across this country, Asian Americans are living in fear for  the safety of themselves, their friends, and their families.   On this floor this week, we passed two critical pieces of legislation  to condemn the attack in Georgia and to ensure accountability for hate  crimes against the Asian-American community.   We must continue to stand with the Asian-American community and put  an end to this violence. My district, my home State of Nevada, and our  Nation, welcome diversity, and acts of hatred and bigotry have no place  here.                            ____________________
