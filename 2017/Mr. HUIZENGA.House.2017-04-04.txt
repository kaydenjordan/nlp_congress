 Mr. Speaker, small businesses and entrepreneurs are  what drive the American economy. I meet with these folks all the time  when I am back home in the Second District, as I know my colleagues do  when they are back in their districts, and we see firsthand the  benefits that these people's dreams, their innovations, their hard  work, and as they provide to our communities that inspiration.    These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk-takers are critical to our  country's economic growth and prosperity. In fact, small businesses are  responsible for more than 60 percent of all of the net new jobs. Let me  repeat that. Small businesses are responsible for more than 60 percent  of all the net new jobs over the past two decades. This isn't just a  one-time blip. This is over the last two decades.   So if our Nation is going to have an economy that provides  opportunities for every American, then we must promote and encourage  success and growth for our small businesses, our startups, and our  entrepreneurs. It is this notion that I think brings us to this  legislation we are discussing here today.   H.R. 1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, would simply level  the playing field for small companies by updating Federal rules that  allow small businesses to better compensate their employees with  ownership in those businesses.   Currently, the SEC rule 701 permits private companies to offer their  own securities as part of written compensation agreements with  employees, directors, general partners, trustees, officers, or other  certain consultants without having to comply with rigid Federal  securities registration requirements. The SEC rule 701, therefore,  allows small companies to reward their employees.   Despite the SEC having the authority to increase the $5 million  threshold via a rulemaking, the SEC has once again chosen to prioritize  what, I would argue, are highly politicized regulatory undertakings  instead of focusing on its core mission, which includes the  facilitation of capital formation. That is one of the key core jobs of  the Securities and Exchange Commission. Well, if the SEC isn't going to  focus its priorities, then Congress will help them do that. So that is  why we are here today on this bill.   I believe it is imperative that small businesses not only in West  Michigan, but across America, have the ability to compete. A critical  element of competition and success is, first, that small businesses be  able to offer compensation packages that attract and retain top-tier  talent in their fields. In today's world, that includes rewarding  employees with stock options. To me, this is common sense. Small- business employees have a clear and vested interest in the success of  their employers, and oftentimes they are attracted to it.   I know, having some younger children myself that are coming into  adulthood, they are looking for that excitement. They are looking for  that opportunity. They are looking to be builders themselves.   Well, by increasing the rule 701 threshold to $10 million, it will  give these private companies more flexibility to attract, reward, and  retain those employees. This simple change would allow companies to  offer twice as much stock to their employees annually without having to  trigger additional disclosure information to investors about those  compensation packages that include securities offerings.   By reforming this regulatory burden, Mr. Speaker, startups, small  businesses, and emerging growth companies will be better equipped to  attract highly talented individuals from companies that are better  capitalized and able to provide cash compensation. By incentivizing  employees with stock options, small businesses will now be able to  compete on a more level playing field in order to retain those valuable  employees rather than seeing them flee to cash, frankly.   This bill is an example, I believe, of positive, bipartisan results  that can be achieved when Republicans and Democrats reach across the  aisle. I commend our sponsors of the bills, Representative Hultgren,  who spoke a little earlier; Representatives Delaney, Higgins,  MacArthur, Sinema, and Stivers, for their leadership on this issue; and  my friend from Colorado, as well, and what he is doing.   I encourage all my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the chairman for his leadership on this particular issue.   Mr. Speaker, small businesses and entrepreneurs are what drive the  American economy. I meet with them in my district, the Second District  of Michigan, all the time. I know my colleagues do as well back in  their districts.   We see them firsthand. We see firsthand the benefits that their  dreams, their innovations, their inspiration, and their hard work  provide to our communities.   These innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk-takers are critical for our  country's economic growth and prosperity. In fact, small businesses are  responsible for 60 percent of the Nation's net new jobs over the past  two decades. Not 2 years, not 10 years, but over the last 20 years, the  last two decades.   If our Nation is going to have an economy that provides opportunity  for every American, then we must promote and encourage success and  growth in our small businesses and our startups. It is this notion that  brings us this legislation we are discussing today.   H.R. 1343, Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, would simply level the  playing field for small companies by updating Federal rules that allow  small businesses to better compensate their employees with ownership in  their own businesses.

Despite the SEC having the authority to increase the $5 million  threshold disclosure via rulemaking, the SEC has once again chosen to  prioritize highly politicized regulatory undertakings instead of  focusing on its core mission. That mission includes facilitating  capital formation. If the SEC cannot or will not focus its priorities,  Congress will.   It is imperative that small businesses in west Michigan, all of  Michigan, and across America have the ability to compete. A critical  element of competition and success is for those small businesses to be  able to offer compensation packages that attract and retain top-tier  talent.   In today's world, that includes rewarding employees in stock options.  To me, this just makes common sense.

By reforming this regulatory burden, startups, small businesses, and  emerging growth companies will be better equipped to attract highly  talented individuals from companies that are better capitalized and  able to maybe provide some additional cash compensation.    By incentivizing employees with stock options, small businesses will  now be able to compete on a more level playing field with older,  larger, and maybe more established companies. They are going to be able  to retain their invaluable employees as well.   This bill is an example of the positive bipartisan results that can  be achieved when Republicans and Democrats reach across the aisle. I  commend the sponsors of the bill, Representatives Hultgren, Delaney,  Higgins, MacArthur, Sinema, and Stivers for their leadership on this  issue. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1343.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), my fellow subcommittee chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), the author of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  distinguished gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the balance of time  remaining on each side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga)  has 10 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) has  10 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Trott), my fellow Michiganian.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Zeldin).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the balance of time  remaining on each side?   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Shimkus). The gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Huizenga) has 3\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee) has 9 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   My colleague on the other side is trying to maybe split some hairs.  We heard some rhetoric earlier on the floor here which, I think, shows  why many on both sides of the aisle scratch their heads in opposition  to this bill. We heard about monied interests. We heard about corporate  wish lists. We heard about Enron which is, by the way, a publicly  traded company which has absolutely nothing to do with this bill. Now,  that all might play really well on a leftwing political base, but that  is detached from the realities of what our economy is about.   As we have talked, 60 percent of all new job creation happens in  small businesses. These are not corporations. These are LLCs, limited  liability corporations. These are subchapter S sole proprietorships.  These are small entrepreneurs and innovators.   By the way, I looked up the definition of innovator. It is a person  who introduces new methods, ideas, or products. Those are the kind of  dynamic elements that we are seeing here. And I think this confusion  between corporations and Enron and what we are trying to do here is  really a disservice to the American people.   This is about making sure that we update basically an inflation  escalator from 1988. We update a rule that the SEC could have the power  to do, which it has not done, that benefits employees and benefits  those owner-employer's workers who oftentimes, more often than not,  work alongside their employees. So they are the ones who are seeing  this on a daily basis.   I can just say to you that, as was pointed out by my colleague from  across the aisle from Maryland, if we don't do this, what most of those  small businesses are going to do is say: You know what, it is just not  worth the effort; I am not going to do it. And we will see that lack of  upside going to those employees.   As was pointed out by my fellow colleague from Michigan, this is  beyond their salary, this is beyond bonuses. This is an additional way  to make sure that those relationships get cemented in.   So, at a minimum, all you would be doing is voting to confirm the  inflation escalator from 1988. It is not a radical change to the law.  This is a commonsense, I believe, innovative way of trying to make sure  that this next generation of workers has the ability to really reap the  benefits of success here in the United States.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.                     Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Polis    The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No.  1 printed in House Report 115-75.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  motion.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized  for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out a couple of  things.   The Senate Banking Committee has moved an identical bill forward,  unanimously, recently.   Regarding the subject matter that the gentleman from California was  throwing out, this bill is not about anything other than providing  hardworking Americans an opportunity to succeed. It is not about  relitigating the last election or even about Susan Rice illegally  unmasking American citizens. This is about an underlying bill that will  help American citizens.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit, and I  urge them to vote ``yes'' on the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. This is a 5-minute vote.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 331,  nays 87, not voting 11, as follows:                               [Roll No. 216]                                 YEAS--331       Abraham      Aderholt      Aguilar      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bera      Bergman      Beyer      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (GA)      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bost      Boyle, Brendan F.
