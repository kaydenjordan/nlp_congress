 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support  funding for the Iron Dome.   The Iron Dome is a purely defensive system, one that has saved  countless innocent lives. Its whole purpose is to save lives and pursue  peace.   I strongly support Israel's right to defend herself. Since its  formation, Israel, our closest ally in the Middle East, has been under  attack by terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah that deny  its right to exist. The Iron Dome is crucial to protecting lives  against these terrorist attacks who continue to fire thousands of  rockets into Israel.   I am proud of the work that Israel and the United States did together  to develop this successful defensive system, and I urge all my  colleagues to support the Iron Dome Supplemental Appropriations Act.  This should be a totally bipartisan effort.   I particularly thank the members of the Appropriations Committee and  Chair DeLauro, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and many others for their work  for bringing it swiftly to the floor. I urge a ``yes'' vote.
