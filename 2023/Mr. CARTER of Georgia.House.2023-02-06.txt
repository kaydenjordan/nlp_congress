 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  legendary college football coach Mark Richt for his induction into the  College Football Hall of Fame.   Mark Richt coached the Bulldogs for 15 seasons and amassed a 145-51  record. He went on to win two SEC championships and multiple division  titles. His lengthy tenure saw numerous iconic moments in Georgia  football history.   After leaving the University of Georgia, Rick became the head coach  of the Miami Hurricanes. He coached there for three seasons, which  included an Orange Bowl appearance.   Mark Richt has been known for his off-the-field work just as much as  for his on-the-field work. He has partnered with numerous nonprofit  organizations throughout the years.   In 2021, Coach Richt revealed that he had been diagnosed with  Parkinson's  [[Page H698]]  disease. He has faced that challenge as he has with all in his life,  with courage and a deep-abiding faith in our Lord and Saviour, Jesus  Christ.   Congratulations to Coach Richt for his storybook career. He has  forever changed the lives of many young men, UGA athletics, and college  football.                            ____________________
