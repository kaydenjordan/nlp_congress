 Mr. Speaker, without a doubt, there is a  crisis at the border. Changing demographics have created unprecedented  challenges for the Border Patrol.   In the early 2000s, most illegal border crossers were young Mexican  men and our laws allowed us to quickly return them back to Mexico. But  today, that flow of Mexican men has been replaced with a mix of men,  women, and children from Central American countries.   Human traffickers are exploiting the loopholes in our laws and  understand how our immigration system is broken. These smugglers tell  vulnerable families that their child is like their ``visa'' to stay in  the U.S., if they can just get themselves turned in to the border  patrol. And these smugglers and their propaganda are effective.    Family apprehensions for fiscal year 2019 are already 572 percent  higher than fiscal year 2013. And these traffickers don't care about  the people they smuggle. The result is that immigrants of all ages are  arriving on our doorstep in terrible health.   Border Patrol projects a 133 percent increase over last year in  migrants needing medical treatment after crossing the border. These  changing migrant flows force our law enforcement officers to act as  paramedics, rather than enforcing the laws that Congress has passed.   We need an ``all-of-the-above'' approach to border security, and that  includes manpower, 21st century technology, and barriers. With this  approach, we will deter human smugglers and others crossing hundreds of  miles of open desert with innocent children.   We know this approach works. In areas where we have built a wall  system, such as Yuma, illegal traffic has plummeted by 95 percent.  Let's build on this success.   I encourage my colleagues to stand by President Trump's decision to  use executive authority to carry out this approach and keep America  safe.
