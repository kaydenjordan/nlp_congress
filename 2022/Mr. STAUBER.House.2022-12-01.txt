 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Daniel  Wheat, a young man from Duluth, Minnesota, who recently passed away.   When Daniel was born, doctors told his parents that he would never  walk or talk, but he proved them wrong. While Daniel happened to have  been born with Down syndrome, he didn't let  [[Page H8678]]  it stop him from living his life to the fullest and bringing happiness  to everyone around him.   Daniel lived a life filled with service to the Duluth community. His  warm heart and sense of humor brought endless joy to his family,  friends, and anyone else who was lucky enough to have met him.   From playing the drums and cymbals in Duluth East High School's band  to winning gold, silver, and bronze medals in powerlifting for Team USA  at the International Special Olympic Games, Daniel lived every day to  the fullest. We should all work to embody a perspective like Daniel's  by living each day to its highest potential.   Daniel Wheat was an inspiration to his family, and our entire  community is better off because he was in our lives. I pray that God  watches over the Wheat family as they grieve and remember him.                            ____________________
