 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Domestic violence diminishes us all, and we all have a role to play  to prevent abuse, save lives, and protect victims, which is why I stand  in strong support of my colleague and friend Congresswoman McBath's  Family Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act.   This thoughtful legislation will expand funding for lifesaving  services, such as emergency shelter, a crisis hotline, counseling, and  legal assistance. It is focused on protecting survivors and preventing  domestic violence.   The need for safe spaces is in desperate demand. This need has only  increased with the pandemic. Abusers are now leveraging circumstances  to exert new power and control tactics, like withholding information  about COVID-19 and preventing access to medical care.   Our work must match this uniquely challenging time, and I believe  this legislation does just that.   Recently, I visited Laurel House, a domestic violence nonprofit  organization in my district, and I think of how this bill would support  their mission.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative McBath. This legislation will  save lives.
