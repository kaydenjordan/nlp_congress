 Mr. Chief Justice, I have a question for the counsel  for the President.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Blumenthal asks:         Did anyone in the White House, or outside the White House,       tell anyone in the White House Counsel's Office that       publication of the Bolton book would be politically       problematic for the President?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I thank the Senator for the  question.   No, no one from inside the White House or outside the White House  told us that the publication of the book would be problematic for the  President. I think we assumed that Mr. Bolton was disgruntled, and we  didn't expect he was going to be saying a lot of nice things about the  President, but no one told us anything like that.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.  [[Page S665]]    The Senator from Texas.    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself  and Senators Warner, Heinrich, and Harris.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Blumenthal and Senators Warner, Heinrich,  and Harris reads as follows:         Before the break, the President's Counsel stated that       accepting ``mere information'' from a foreign source is not       something that would violate campaign finance law, and that       it is not campaign interference to accept ``credible       information'' from a foreign source about someone who is       running for office. Under this view, acceptance of the kinds       of propaganda disseminated by Russia in 2016--on Facebook and       other social media platforms, using bots, fake accounts and       other techniques to spread disinformation--would be perfectly       legal and appropriate. Isn't it true that accepting such a       thing of value is, in fact, a violation of law? And isn't it       true that it is one of the highest priorities of our       Intelligence Community, including the CIA, NSA, DNI, and FBI,       to do everything possible to prevent such foreign       interference or intervention in our elections?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. It is, without question, among the very highest  priorities of our intelligence agencies and our law enforcement to  prevent foreign interference in our election of the type and character  that we saw in 2016.   When Russia hacked the databases of the Democratic National  Committee--the DCCC--when they began a campaign of leaking those  documents and when it engaged in a massive and systemic social media  campaign, our intel agencies and law enforcement had been devoting  themselves to preventing a recurrence of that type of foreign  interference.   If I am understanding counsel and the President correctly--and I  think that I am--they are saying that not only is that OK to willingly  accept that but that the very allegation against the President that Bob  Mueller spent 2 years investigating didn't amount to criminal  conspiracy. That is, Did he prove beyond a reasonable doubt the crime  of conspiracy? Again, we are talking about something separate from  collusion here, although my colleagues keep confusing the two. Bob  Mueller didn't address the issue of collusion. What he did address was  whether he could prove the elements of criminal conspiracy, and he  found that he could not.   What counsel for the President is now saying is that, even if he  could have, that is OK. It is now OK to criminally conspire with  another country to get help in a Presidential election, as long as the  President believes it would help his campaign, and, therefore, it would  help our country. That is now OK. It is OK to ask for that help. It is  OK to work with that power to get that help. That is now OK.   It has been a remarkable evolution of the Presidential defense. It  began with ``none of that stuff happened here.'' It began with  ``nothing to see here.'' It migrated to, OK, they did seek  investigations of the President's political  [[Page S688]]  rival, and then it became, OK, those investigations were not sought by  official channels to official policy. They were sought by the  President's lawyer in his personal capacity. Then it migrated to, OK,  we acknowledge that, while the President's lawyer was conducting this  personal political errand, the President withheld the money, but we  think that is OK.   We have witnessed over the course of the last few days and the long  day today a remarkable lowering of the bar to the point now where  everything is OK as long as the President believes it is in his  reelection interest. You could conspire with another country to get its  help in your election either by its intervening on your behalf to help  you or by its intervening to hurt your opponent.   Now, we are told that that is not only OK, but it is beyond the reach  of the Constitution. Why? Because abuse of power is not impeachable. If  you say abuse of power is impeachable, well, then, you are impeaching  Presidents for mere policy. Well, that is nonsense. They are not the  same thing.   They are not the same thing as Professor Turley has argued. They are  not the same thing as Bill Barr has argued. They are not the same thing  as Professor Dershowitz argued 21 years ago, and they are not the same  thing today. They are just not. You can't solicit foreign interference,  and the fact that you are unsuccessful in getting it doesn't exonerate  you. The failed scheme doesn't make you innocent.   A failed scheme doesn't make you innocent. If you take a hostage and  you demand a ransom and the police are after you and you release the  hostage before you get the money, it doesn't make you innocent. It just  makes you unsuccessful--an unsuccessful crook--but it doesn't mitigate  the harmful conduct.   And this body should not accept nor should the American people accept  the idea put out by the President's lawyers today that it is perfectly  fine--unimpeachable--for the President of the United States to say  ``Hey, Russia'' or ``Hey, Ukraine'' or ``Hey, China, I want your help  in my election'' because that is the policy of the President. We are  calling that policy now. It is the policy of the President to demand  foreign interference and withhold money from an ally at war unless they  get it. That is what they call policy.   I am sorry; that is what I call corruption, and they can dress it up  in fine legalese, but corruption is still corruption.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Maine.
