 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent  that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The ACTING  PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.      The online Record has been corrected to read:   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the  quorum call be rescinded.  Madam President, this year's Winter Olympics are  officially underway on the home turf of the Chinese Communist Party. Of  course, Americans are rooting hard for our outstanding Team USA  athletes, but this year's setting has also trained spotlights worldwide  on the abuse and repression the CCP inflicts on its own people and  aspires to inflict on much of the world. Unfortunately, this has also  occasioned some instances of jaw-dropping tone-deafness and gullibility  from American voices.   I noted on this floor several years ago that as China has modernized  its economy, too many wealthy and powerful American actors have seemed  willing to help whitewash the CCP's many abuses or at least turn a  blind eye. Hollywood self-censoring our own American films to satisfy  President Xi and his cronies is just one example.   Well, last week, one American broadcaster seemed to uncritically  amplify the CCP's propaganda goal when they included a member of the  oppressed Uighur minority in the opening ceremonies.   This broadcaster called the CCP's obvious propaganda stunt ``an in- your-face response to those Western nations, including the U.S., who  have called this Chinese treatment of that group `genocide.' ''  President Xi couldn't have scripted it better.   Also, last week, a faculty member at a Big Ten university went on TV  and compared China's secret police to American police officers and  China's tyranny to America's voting laws. Here was the quote:         Who are we to criticize China's human rights record when we       have ongoing attacks by the agents of the State against       unarmed citizens, and we've got assaults on the voting rights       of people of color in various States in this country?    Really? Beyond absurd.   The truth is, the CCP has turned Xinjiang Province into a giant  oppression factory, where they enslave, sterilize, and commit genocide  against the Muslim minority.  [[Page S531]]    The truth is, the CCP has systematically worn down human rights and  democracy in Hong Kong and jailed Hongkongers for speaking up.   The truth is, the CCP is an aggressive, irresponsible presence in the  Pacific region and well beyond.   America's national security and economic competition with the CCP is  a defining challenge for our country--and not just us but for all our  friends and partners around the world, anyone who values an  international order built on freedom and self-determination instead of  their opposites.   Last year, the Senate took some bipartisan steps to strengthen  America's hand in that competition. The bipartisan U.S. Innovation and  Competition Act was not any Senator's or any committee's or either  party's idea of a perfect bill, but this delicate compromise product  made headway on issues from critical supply chains to counterespionage,  to intellectual property. And the Senate passed the bill last June, and  the House has done nothing for 8 months--nothing from House Democrats  from last June until just last week.   So a few days ago, instead of passing the Senate's careful  compromise, House Democrats slapped together a partisan bill stuffed  with poison pills and the kinds of things they tried to put in their  reckless tax-and-spending spree that failed at the end of last year.  They didn't even bother to try working with House Republicans. The  whole exercise was completely unserious.   House Democrats' version mentions the word ``climate'' nearly as many  times as it mentions the word ``China.'' It pours billions into the  U.N. Green Climate Fund so the United States can borrow money from  China to give it to an international body, which can then give it to  China.   Their bill even goes out of its way to include provisions on--listen  to this--marijuana banking.   China has been steadily building up its military and economic might,  and the Democrats' answer is to help Americans get high?   Drug overdoses on fentanyl just became the leading cause of death for  Americans aged 18 to 45 across our entire country. Much of this poison  pours into our country from, of course, China. And Democrats' plan to  combat this is some more marijuana on the side?   Needless to say, this is not a winning strategy for a global  competition between great powers.   So here is the bottom line. The bipartisan Senate USICA bill was  itself a delicate compromise product. Any Democrats hoping to yank the  bill to the far left or insert poison pills are badly, badly mistaken.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, today President  Biden will welcome Olaf Scholz, the new German Chancellor, to his first  visit to Washington since taking office.   Germany is a crucial ally of the United States. Tens of thousands of  U.S. servicemembers reside in Germany, contributing to the collective  security of the NATO alliance. According to the State Department,  bilateral trade between our countries totaled more than $260 billion in  2019.   Many in Washington on both sides of the aisle appreciated the  increasing leadership role that Chancellor Scholz's predecessor, Angela  Merkel, played in international affairs. Germany's overseas  contributions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Africa demonstrated a growing  willingness to contribute to international missions that advance our  collective security interests.   The German people have built the largest economy in Europe and the  fourth largest in the entire world. They are indeed a major player, but  there is no question Germany could do more given its influential role,  including within the EU and NATO, to advance our shared foreign policy  and security interests.   Back during the Cold War, the West German military was truly a  capable fighting force, but Germany's military has been allowed to  atrophy in the decades since. Today, it lags behind the state of the  art and suffers from shortfalls in readiness and regular maintenance.   Germany endorsed the 2014 NATO pledge to commit 2 percent of its GDP  to defense and 20 percent of that defense spending toward modernization  by 2024. But it has taken very few credible steps to meet that pledge.   Meanwhile, threats to the alliance have only grown since 2014.  Russia's and China's decades-long modernization efforts made it clear  that 2 percent will not suffice for NATO to meet these growing  challenges.   Here in Congress, we have demonstrated our commitment to NATO and to  Europe's security. We hosted Jens Stoltenberg for a joint address to  Congress 3 years ago. We have included measures supporting America's  presence in Europe in our annual Defense bills, including significant  investments in our European Deterrence Initiative.   So I hope that Chancellor Scholz will reciprocate and take this  opportunity to reassure us about Germany's commitment to NATO and our  collective defense. Our friends are too powerful and too prosperous not  to contribute more militarily to our alliance.   Of course, building military capabilities takes time. But the urgent  issue of Russian aggression in Europe also demands courage and  firmness, and it demands it right now. We know how such resolve works.  The United States and our allies displayed such firmness again and  again in standing up to Soviet pressure, and West Berlin remained a  free city because of it.   Chancellor Scholz has plenty of tools at his disposal to join his  allies in sending a strong signal to Putin that aggression against  Ukraine would carry a tremendous--tremendous--cost.   So let's take one example. A bipartisan chorus in Congress has  opposed the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline for years. We have viewed it as a  new geopolitical tool for Putin to undermine Ukraine and divide Europe.  Germany acknowledges the international community's concerns, hence  German delays in moving the project forward.   It would be a powerful demonstration of German leadership for  Chancellor Scholz to declare firmly and simply that Russian escalation  in Europe will result in the termination--the termination--of Nord  Stream 2--not another pause, the end of the pipeline, period.   Likewise, it would send an important message if Chancellor Scholz  commits, like other NATO allies have done and like his own  predecessor's national security advisor just recommended, that Germany  will help Ukraine with legitimate military capabilities so that it can  better defend itself against aggression.   So, in conclusion, Germany has been an important pillar in NATO and a  strong ally of the United States literally for decades. We welcome the  new Chancellor to American soil. The time is now--now--for Germany to  stand up and protect the peace and defend the stable Europe that modern  Germany itself has helped construct and from which it has greatly  benefited.
