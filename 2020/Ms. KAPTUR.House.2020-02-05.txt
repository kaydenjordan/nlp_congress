 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairwoman of the  Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee for yielding me this time,  and I thank her for her unyielding support for water issues across this  country, including in our very critical Great Lakes region. She has  been a true and unyielding champion on these issues, and I thank her.   Today's package of bills includes key priorities for protecting not  just our Great Lakes, but ecosystems across our country. H.R. 4031, the  Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2019, enjoys broad support  from the Great Lakes region. The 49 cosponsors of the bill represent  every ideological perspective of our caucus, and today's bill, which is  on suspension, is a testament of that bipartisan, bicameral critical  support.   In that vein, Mr. Speaker, I must also commend my colleague from  Ohio, Congressman   David Joyce, for his steadfast effort to work  collaboratively to collect signatures for H.R. 4031 so we could move it  from 2019 to 2020.   This Great Lakes Act recognizes the enormous, unmet need for the  region. The interagency collaborative effort has brought to bear  resources, expertise, and stakeholders from across the local, State,  and Federal portions of the region and helped to focus resources on a  major hot spot.   The Maumee River is the largest river that flows into the entire  Great Lakes and is also facing gigantic harmful algal blooms. The  Maumee River dumps all of these nutrients into Lake Erie, which then  feeds the most productive part of the lake, endangering, annually,  native species and creating massive harmful algal blooms with the  critical ingredient of microcystin, which is toxic.   Annually, the harmful algal blooms threaten Toledo's drinking water  system, which had to be shut down 3 years ago. It threatens the safety  of our beaches and longevity of our ecosystem.   This Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is assisting communities to  address the root causes of the blooms.   Since 2010, over 4,000 projects have been completed across the basin,  the largest watershed in the entire Great Lakes, and a recent  University of Michigan study revealed that each dollar spent on the  Great Lakes Restoration Initiative will result in $3.35 million in  additional economic activity.   The long-term goals of the initiative are delisting of the areas of  concern, ensuring that fish are safe to eat and the Asian carp is kept  out, and control of numerous environmental problems across our lakes,  the largest source of freshwater on our continent.   Today's legislation offers a ramp-up back to the level for the  restoration initiative initially envisioned when the program was first  funded in fiscal year 2010. So it is pretty new as Federal programs go.  This gradual ramp-up represents a consensus across the delegation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation on final passage.   Again, I want to thank Chairwoman Grace Napolitano for her work  across both sides of the aisle and with Members of this House from  every region of the country.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2382, or  the U.S. Postal Service Fairness Act up for a vote today.   Madam Speaker, 13 years ago, the Postal Service was saddled by this  body when we required it--not with my support--to prefund its  retirement benefits. Unfortunately, this prevented the Postal Service  from addressing critical equipment modernization needs. Thankfully,  this legislation allows us to correct this misguided requirement.   The post office is a constitutionally mandated institution. A sense  of community is sustained every time the mailwoman or mailman delivers  a letter, increasing connectivity in rural and urban districts alike.  The Postal Service delivers close to 190 million pieces of mail every  single day and is a testament to American ingenuity. Indeed, postal  workers are the best ambassadors, receiving an overwhelmingly high  public approval rating of 74 percent.   While we work to ensure the post office's financial health, we must  also continue to increase innovation, such as through modernizing  postal services. For example, creative initiatives could increase  access to basic functions in post offices and underserved communities.   I thank my friend, Representative Peter DeFazio, for his true  leadership on this bill, and urge all my colleagues to support its  passage, and thank those who did.                            ____________________
