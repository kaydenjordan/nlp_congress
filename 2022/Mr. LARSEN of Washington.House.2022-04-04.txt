 Madam Speaker, Everett, Washington,  suffered a tragic loss 2 weeks ago. On Friday, March 25, Everett Police  Officer Dan Rocha was killed in the line of duty while responding to a  call near Everett Community College.   Today, the city of Everett celebrated Officer Rocha's life at a  memorial service attended by many family members, his friends, law  enforcement, other first responders, and, of course, community members.   My thoughts and prayers are with the Rocha family during this very  difficult time, Dan's wife, Kelli; his two sons, Thomas and Harrison;  and his very large extended family.   As a citizen of Everett, I myself have called upon the Everett Police  Department a few times in my neighborhood for help, for assistance, and  just for presence. They have always responded without question.   Officer Rocha made an incredible impact in a short time at the  Everett PD, serving as an officer for the last 4 years. Two years ago,  he landed his dream assignment as a day-shift patrol officer in north  Everett. On the day he passed, Officer Rocha was doing the job he  loved, serving and protecting the community.   Sadly, the Everett PD has experienced tragedy before. In 1999,  Officer Brian DiBucci was killed while pursuing a suspect near the U.S.  2 trestle.   Law enforcement officers like Officers Rocha and DiBucci have  dedicated their careers to keeping northwest Washington communities and  residents safe.   I know that the women and men of the Everett Police Department will  continue to go out into the community every day and carry on Officer  Rocha's legacy by upholding that department's commitment to service,  integrity, professionalism, and honor.   Today, I stand with my hometown of Everett to honor Officer Rocha and  his service to our community.   I thank Representative Newhouse for this opportunity to participate  in the Special Order tonight.
