 Madam Chair, I rise in support of my friend's amendment.   According to Up For Growth's recent 2023 report, we have  underproduced housing by millions of missing homes across our country.  That reality pushes homeownership out of reach for too many Americans,  and we have to fix that.   While there is no silver bullet solution to this problem, several  studies have indicated that restrictive zoning laws remain among the  largest barriers preventing construction of additional housing supply,  and that drives up prices.   As a result, Representative Flood and I introduced a bill called the  Yes in My Backyard Act. Our bill is designed to eliminate some of these  discriminatory land use policies and remove some of those barriers that  prevent new housing construction across our country.   That bill is consistent with this amendment. My friend and colleague  from Delaware and I have championed funding through the Department of  Housing and Urban Development's Pathways to Removing Obstacles to  Housing grant program. This isn't about forcing any community to do  anything. It is about trying to encourage communities to make decisions  that allow for more housing construction.   Madam Chair, I am disappointed that this year's bill cuts funding for  that program because that hurts our ability to solve this crisis.
