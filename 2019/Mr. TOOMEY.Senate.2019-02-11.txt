 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to discuss two economic issues this  evening. The first is a reaction to a proposal that comes to us from  our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Let me preface this with  the observation that I am pretty sure we are living through the  strongest economy in the United States in my adult lifetime. It has  been fantastic for the people I represent.   Our unemployment rate is pretty much at a 50-year low. African- American and Hispanic unemployment is the lowest that has ever been  recorded. The youth unemployment rate is extremely low. It is at  historically low levels. Our economy has accelerated, and wages are  growing exactly as we said they would. It is very simple. The demand  for workers has grown so much that employers are being forced to bid  ever higher for the services of the workers.   Now we are in a tremendously enviable position of having more job  openings in America than there are people looking for work in America.  It is fantastic. This is exactly what we want to have happen.   Last week, the President was right when he said that our economy is  the envy of the world. It is totally true.   So what do our colleagues on the other side of the aisle propose to  do in light of the fact that we have this fantastic economy? Well,  Senator Sanders and Senator Schumer joined up and made a proposal that  we adopt legislation that would severely restrict the ability of  American companies to buy back their own stock. This is just the latest  iteration of a socialist tendency that seems to be growing on the far  left. This is a horrendous idea.   I suppose we shouldn't be surprised when we hear a Socialist-leaning  idea coming from a self-described Democratic Socialist or a Socialist  Democrat--whatever the description is--but I am surprised to hear this  coming from the Senate minority leader.   Let's talk about this a little bit. First of all, what is a stock  buyback? It is not that complicated. It is when the owners of a company  take some or all of their money out of the company.   Let's think about it this way. A business is owned by its  shareholders, and the shareholders hire a management team to take their  money and invest it in a way that will generate a return for the  investor, for the shareholder. That is the role of the management team.   So why would they buy back their own stock? The reason they would buy  back their own stock is that sometimes it happens that the management  team of a company is just not able to deploy any more capital in a way  that would generate a better return than what is generally available in  the marketplace. What sometimes happens is companies might make huge  investments; they may be investing tremendous amounts--record amounts-- in expanding their capabilities, expanding their production, more R&D,  and expanding their staff, but they can reach a limit as to how much  they can expand and how much they productively invest at any given  point. If they have more money--more cash--than they can productively  deploy, they have an obligation to return that to the people who  actually own it; that is, the shareholders, the investors. That is  their obligation.   Shockingly, Senators Sanders and Schumer are suggesting that  companies be forbidden from being able to return some portion of their  excess capital to their shareholders unless the company first complies  with a list of political demands that Senators Schumer and Sanders are  advocating.   Let me tell you why this is such a bad idea. I will give you three  reasons. No. 1, it is a disturbing and profound attack on freedom. No.  2, it would be terrible for the economy. And, No. 3, it would hurt the  very people they presumably intend to help. Let me go through them in  order.   First of all, as far as freedom goes, whose company is it? To whom  does a given company in America belong? I have always thought they  belonged to the shareholders of those companies--the people who saved  up and invested in them, the people who have launched those companies,  and the people whose capital made it possible. So, of course, it should  be within the rights of the people who own a company to decide what to  do with the profits after all expenses have been covered and taxes have  been paid. That is what we are talking about here.   I have a question for my colleagues. The question is, What principle  confers on politicians the right to control whether and when and under  what circumstances an investor can withdraw his own money from a  business in which he invested? I don't know what that principle is.   I will say, to me, it seems exactly equivalent to confiscating the  property of somebody--in this case, their ownership in a business--and  redistributing that confiscated asset to whomever they choose. That  strikes me as pretty close to the definition of socialism. It clearly  is an attack on the economic freedom that underpins our entire economy,  an entire market economy.   My second point, and related, is this would be terrible for the  economy. It would do great harm to an economy that is doing quite well  right now. The main way it would be so damaging is it would scare away  capital.   Just stop and think about it. Our economy thrives when people are  willing to invest in existing businesses, in new businesses, and in  startup businesses, but that investment is an absolutely essential part  of a thriving economy. Well, people are much less likely to make an  investment if Congress makes it harder to take that investment out. So  what we would do is we would dry up sources of capital for companies  that need that capital because investors would understandably say:  Well, we are heading down the road of putting all kinds of limits on my  ability to ever get my money out. I think it may be good to just park  it and not invest it.   That would be a very bad development.   The proponents of this idea of restricting companies this way say  they want to ``incentivize productive investment.'' I have to laugh  because I have a secret for our colleagues. You see, the free  enterprise system already provides an incentive for productive  investment. It is called the profit. That is the whole idea. So we  don't need to punish people for making an investment as a way to  incentivize productive investment. In fact, it will not work at all.    I think some of what they have argued displays a little bit of  confusion about how this works. In their argument about why something  has to be done, they say that 90 percent of profits go to buybacks and  dividends. What else would you use it for? I mean, you first have to  cover all of your expenses before you have a profit. So you could have  record amounts of research and development, record amounts of  expansion, records amounts of employment, and growth in employment, but  after all of that is covered, only then do you have the profit. That is  what is left over. And after you have covered all of those things, why  wouldn't you have buybacks and a distribution to the investors?   That raises this question: Exactly what problem is it that our  colleagues think they are solving here? We are running at record high  levels of investment in our economy. Capital expenditures have gone  through the roof in response partly--largely--due to the change in the  tax law that we made. The buybacks that have been occurring have  coincided with record levels of investment. What is the problem here?   By the way, as I pointed out earlier, wage growth has accelerated at  the highest rate we have seen in many, many years. I really don't  understand what problem they think we are solving.   By the way, there is an alternative to distributing excess capital to  shareholders. The alternative is keeping the capital trapped in the  company where it is not being put to its most productive use. You see,  one of the great dynamics of a market economy is that by returning  excess capital to shareholders, the shareholders get to decide what new  idea deserves to be funded by recycling this capital. Whether it is in  the form of dividends or stock buybacks, we encourage this capital to  find a new home--a new startup, a new idea, or an expansion of an  existing business. The capital is constantly being redirected to the  best ideas, as long as you allow it to happen.   Finally, this idea would be very harmful to the people it is,  presumably, meant to help. About 40 percent of all equities in the  United States are  [[Page S1164]]  held in pension and retirement accounts. These are the accounts of  teachers and cabdrivers and truckdrivers and folks who work at  factories and do every other job that our economy depends on, who put a  little money away. It may be in a 401(k) plan, in an IRA, or in an  employer-sponsored pension plan; these folks own an awful lot of the  stock in America. Well, buybacks are good for their investment because,  in some cases, it returns cash that can then be redeployed. In other  cases, it provides a bid; it provides upward pressure on the stock  price, which is good for the value of their savings. Over time, if the  stock gets retired, then the diminished supply gets that much greater a  share of all of the future earnings. This is completely a win-win for  savers and investors.   Let me just conclude by saying it is a very, very bad idea for  America to take any steps down the road toward socialism. This is very  much an idea of that ilk. In fact, it is a big step in the direction of  a collectivist socialist economy, and we should reject this out of  hand.                                  U.S. Trade    Mr. President, I also want to touch on an unrelated topic, but it is  an important one; that is, the ongoing discussion we are having in this  Congress and across the country with respect to trade.   I think most of us in this Chamber agree that international trade is  very good for the United States. I know it is very good for  Pennsylvania.   I think we all understand that if we impose tariffs on imported  goods, that is a tax that American consumers have to pay on a product  or a service just because it originates somewhere else. If you add up  the impact of the tariffs that this administration has already applied,  according to the Congressional Budget Office, that is already going to  take one-tenth of a percent off of our GDP, off of our economic growth.  That is assuming no further tariffs occur, which is unknown at this  point.   In particular, I want to address a category of tariffs that are known  as section 232 tariffs because that is the part of the trade law which  justifies these tariffs. This is an old law. It is a Cold War-era trade  law that is designed to allow a President to impose tariffs when he  believes there is a national security threat that requires these  tariffs, these taxes on some foreign product for some reason that  affects our national security.   In my view, the recent imposition of these 232 tariffs on aluminum  and steel were not really about national security. They had other  motives and other purposes, and, in my view, they have done much more  harm than good.   If you look at tariffs on imported steel, you might believe that it  is helpful to the people who are in the steel industry. We have about  140,000 Americans employed at steel mills. It is possible that the  tariffs are helpful to those companies and those employees at some  level. The problem is, we have 6.5 million people in companies that use  many, many multiples, and everybody who works in that sector of our  economy across a wide range of industries is put at a competitive  disadvantage when they have to pay that tax on imported steel and  aluminum.   Some examples come to mind. Allegheny Technologies is a company in  western Pennsylvania that last year had to pay $16 million in taxes on  the steel they imported. They had no choice but to import it because of  the unique nature of that steel. It is threatening one of their  production facilities.   American Keg is the only steel keg maker in the United States and  makes beer kegs in Pennsylvania. They had to lay off one-third of their  workers in March of last year because they are not as competitive as  they need to be.   Colonial Metal Products is a small manufacturer. They use steel in  fabrication. Their entire workforce is at risk.   The list goes on and on because fundamentally these taxes make many  companies that use steel and aluminum less competitive.   That is not the only problem. As we all know, many American exporters  are subject to retaliation by companies that experience these tariffs.  So there are a lot of problems.   I have introduced legislation that is meant to address this. One  aspect of this that I think is very important is that the Constitution  unambiguously assigns to Congress the responsibility for managing our  economic relations--our competing trade relations with other countries.  In the Constitution, that explicitly includes the responsibility for  deciding whether and to what extent we should impose tariffs on the  products of other countries. Yet for years Congress has just let  administration after administration take this responsibility that the  Constitution gives to us.   So what my legislation does is pretty simple. It says, let's restore  to Congress the responsibility that the Constitution gives to Congress.  Let's make sure that national security-related tariffs are only imposed  when Congress says they should be imposed.   The legislation has 11 original cosponsors, roughly even between  Republicans and Democrats. Senator Warner is the lead Democrat on this  bill, and Senators Sasse and Hassan are also original cosponsors. Four  of the cosponsors are from the Finance Committee, which has  jurisdiction over this issue. There is the House companion, which is  also bipartisan. There are 61 organizations, business groups and  others, that have endorsed this from the outside.   It is important to make the point that our legislation, while it is  designed to restore to Congress this important responsibility, doesn't  eliminate the ability of a President to invoke section 232 and impose  tariffs if there is a genuine threat to American security. What the  President needs to do is explain the threat, make the case to the  Congress, and under our legislation, there is a mechanism that requires  expedited consideration of the President's request. It can't be  filibustered. It doesn't take 60 votes. There is a strict timeline. So  this can't languish on a shelf somewhere; Congress has to respond.   One other feature that is important in this bill is that the  executive branch determination of whether there is a threat to national  security would no longer be conducted by the Commerce Department, as it  is now; it would move to the Department of Defense. My view on that is  very simple. The Department of Defense is the entity within our  executive branch that is best qualified to determined threats to our  national security.   I am hopeful that we will grow our support and be able to get a vote  on this legislation.   I should point out that there are other legislative approaches. There  are other ideas on 232. There is one bill that, like mine, would shift  the responsibility for evaluating the threat from the Commerce  Department to the Defense Department, but the difference with some of  these other pieces of legislation is they contemplate a disapproval  resolution. They simply observe that Congress can pass a law to prevent  or rescind a 232 designation, but these alternative bills would do  nothing to restore that responsibility to Congress today. We could pass  a law if we had the votes, and we could override a Presidential veto.  We could pass a law to rescind any kind of tariff. The alternative  legislation doesn't change that fact. What my legislation does is it  would require the affirmative consent of Congress before the tariffs  can go into place. That is a fundamental difference.   So I think, for the sake of expanding trade, but importantly, in my  mind, for the sake of restoring the constitutional responsibility that  is assigned to Congress, we ought to pass this legislation.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  February 12; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that following leader  remarks, the Senate resume consideration of S. 47 and that the Senate  recess from 12 noon until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly conference  meetings; finally, that all time during recess, adjournment, morning  business, and leader remarks count postcloture on S. 47.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous order.   Thereupon, the Senate, at 7:24 p.m., adjourned until Tuesday,  February 12, 2019, at 10 a.m.
