 Mr. Speaker, investing in innovation is vital to  strengthening America's economic and national security. That is why I  supported the America COMPETES Act of 2022, which makes a historic  investment in American technology and innovation.   This bipartisan bill addresses 21st century challenges by  turbocharging the domestic production of semiconductors, increasing the  manufacturing workforce, and investing in STEM education. I am proud  that my amendment, which creates partnerships with local industries to  tailor STEM education to local economic needs, was included in the  House version of the bill.   This amendment will broaden the scope of STEM education and offer new  opportunities in rural communities like much of my district. With  transformative investments in some of Illinois' biggest industries,  like manufacturing, education, energy, and biotechnology, the America  COMPETES Act will strengthen the STEM pipeline in my district and  across the country.   I am proud of this bipartisan effort to support American economic  competitiveness and urge my Senate colleagues to act quickly to send  this legislation to the President's desk.                            ____________________
