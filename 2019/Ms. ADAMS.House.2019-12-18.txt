 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record my statement in  support of the Articles of Impeachment against President Donald J.  Trump.   After reviewing hours of testimony, countless pieces of evidence, and  the Administration's own words and actions, I believe the case has been  made that the President abused his power and obstructed Congress from  fulfilling its constitutional duty.   As such, I will support both articles of impeachment today on the  House floor.   The evidence shows that the President put his interests above those  of the country.   We must act quickly because President Trump's behavior poses a clear  and present danger to our democracy.  [[Page H12189]]    His words and actions show that he is actively looking to interfere  in next year's election by any means necessary.   We cannot stand for that kind of misconduct in our country's Chief  Executive.
