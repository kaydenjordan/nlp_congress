 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Strategic  Production Response Act.   The President sold an unprecedented amount of the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve, which was constructed to be used solely during national  emergencies. I regret that the President has instead used it as a  political tool to attempt to lower gas prices.   Perhaps the most frustrating thing is this administration's constant  demonization not just of fossil fuels but of the very men and women who  work so hard to produce them.                                time  1300    It is vital for a business to have regulatory certainty to ensure  price stability, and President Biden's lack of guidance has created the  most unclear times for the energy industry in modern history. You can't  attack the oil and gas industry, say you want to put them out of  business, and then complain when gas prices go up.   It is critical for the SPR to be accessible to the most vulnerable  citizens at times of crisis: wildfires, flooding, tornadoes, and  hurricanes.   All over the country, including in my home of Utah, there are  abundant fossil fuels that can be cleanly and responsibly developed on  Federal lands that could be used to replenish the SPR for times of real  crisis.   This is why I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
