 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my good  friend, Gerald Clark, a true American hero from my district who passed  away on April 19.   Gerald dedicated his life to helping his fellow veterans and their  families and patriotically served his country during World War II.   Gerald viewed his time with the U.S. Army as an adventure. He fought  with the 75th Infantry Division at the Battle of the Bulge and lost his  leg defending our country fighting the Nazis.   He was awarded a Purple Heart for his service and sacrifice. He was  honorably discharged after being hospitalized over a year. Then he  returned to Tennessee; married his wife, Bea; raised five children; and  continued to serve his community.   For decades, Gerald held memberships in the American Legion, AMVETS,  Disabled American Veterans, Military Order of the Purple Heart, and the  Veterans of Foreign Wars, in the belief that his support lent strength  to the voice of each organization.   Gerald was also a leading advocate for opening a Tennessee State  Veterans' Home in Knox County. Thanks to his efforts, Ben Atchley  Tennessee State Veterans' Home opened in 2006, and my father actually  passed away in that veterans' home, so I hold it very close to my  heart, Madam Speaker.   It is my honor to salute Gerald Clark one final time here on the  House floor. He will be greatly missed.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Jordan for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, right now, we have an immigration disaster at the  southern border of the Biden administration's own creation. Instead of  putting a stop to this madness, my colleagues across the aisle are  encouraging this open borders agenda by bringing the NO BAN Act to the  floor today.   The NO BAN Act limits the President's ability to make executive  decisions about who should be allowed to enter our country. This would  dangerously weaken the President's executive authority on important  issues related to national security.   To put this reckless idea into perspective, Customs and Border Patrol  agents recently caught two Yemeni terrorists at the southern border.  Thank God, law enforcement caught these terrorists, but this is exactly  why executive authority on immigration issues needs to remain in place.   Madam Speaker, a responsible President would notice what is going on  at the southern border and use his authority to step in for the sake of  national security. It is naive to believe there aren't bad actors who  want to hurt Americans actively trying to exploit this ongoing crisis.   President Biden needs to use his executive authority to solve the  immigration and national security crisis his administration has  created. If he is not physically or mentally capable of doing this, he  should step down.    Madam Speaker, I thank Vice Chairman Johnson for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, the crisis at the southern border is a problem of the  Biden administration's own creation. As soon as they took office, the  Biden administration slapped an ``open for business'' sign on our  southern border. They scrapped commonsense immigration policies that  were keeping our country secure. Now, our southern border is  overwhelmed with immigrants who expect to enter the country without  proper vetting.   Hiding among those massive crowds of people are drug smugglers, child  traffickers, and terrorists who have no intention of positively  impacting American communities.   We need to know who is coming into our country and why, for the sake  of national security.  [[Page H2045]]    Ironically, even though Joe Biden and Kamala Harris decried this  practice, children are still being packed into overcrowded detention  facilities and sleeping in cages. They were outraged about this back  when they were campaigning for President, but now they are actually  silent on the issue.   We need to get back to the successful border security policies of the  Trump administration, including construction of our border wall. I am  an original cosponsor of the Finish the Wall Act, which would resume  construction of the border wall and make it more difficult for folks,  especially the bad actors, to cross the southern border illegally.   House Republicans are ready to secure the border, and I am proud to  join my colleagues on the floor this evening to call out the Biden  administration's ongoing inaction. If President Biden is not physically  or mentally capable of addressing this problem, he should step down.
