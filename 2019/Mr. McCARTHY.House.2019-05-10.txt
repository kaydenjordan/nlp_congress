 Madam Chairwoman, I thank Congresswoman Kay Granger for  yielding me the time, and I thank the gentlewoman for offering this  amendment. You will see me vote for this amendment.   Madam Chairwoman, I rise to ask a simple question to this body: What  is our mission? Are we here to make positive change for our fellow  Americans, to solve problems, to respond in times of hardship, or are  we here to message?   I would say, collectively, together, the answer should be we are here  to make the change to help those in hardship. These are the moments in  time when people do not ask if you are a Republican or a Democrat.   When Houston was flooded, I was down there that week touring with  Members from both sides of the aisle, and nobody was arguing from  either side.   When Puerto Rico was hit, it was then, as I was the majority leader  and Congressman Steny Hoyer, at the time, was the whip, now the  majority leader, that we put a codel together with the Republicans and  Democrats. We just didn't go to the Keys. We went to Puerto Rico and  the Virgin Islands together to work to help to make sure we rebuilt.   When California had the devastating fire, one of the worst we have  ever seen, I flew with the President. When we landed, we were met by  the Governor of California and the Governor-elect. Not only did we tour  together and were of different parties, but we talked about how to  rebuild. We flew down because California has more than just one  devastation and one fire. We talked and we bonded on the basis of how  we would work together. That is what America expects.   The bill that we will have on the floor today does not meet the  criteria of both of us working together, and that is just not right.  But yesterday, with the work of Congresswoman Kay Granger and the  others in the Appropriations Committee, we put together one in working  with the Senate Republicans on Senate Appropriations and made an offer  to the Democratic side.                                time  1045    I want to publicly say that to everyone. I know we can do better, and  I know we can solve this. I made a commitment to the majority leader,  Steny Hoyer: let's work together and be right back here next week and  get this solved. This has gone on too long, too much hardship, and we  could rise to the occasion.   The information I have gotten back from the majority leader is that,  yes, he wants to work with us; yes, they want to move this bill today.  But I don't want to move a bill for the sake of saying I moved a bill.  I want to make law and help those in need.   I have spoken to the President, and I have spoken to the leader on  the Senate side. I believe we can solve this all by next week.  [[Page H3708]]    So today when this vote is done, and the messages are given, let's  not stop. Let's put our committee together, and let's work through this  weekend and the beginning of next week. I know the very best of us will  rise to this occasion, and we could be right back here not with a  debate of partisanship, not with a vote that defines pretty close to  how we are registered inside this floor, but one united vote that will  become law that the President will seek to sign.   We know the outcome of the bill that we will vote on today. The  President said he is not going to sign it. People are hurting. He wants  to solve those problems, too. We want to make sure that even the money  that we have already voted on to deliver gets delivered to the areas  that need it the most. We want to make sure that we make the  corrections so that the fires and the floods will not come back as  severe as they were before from any ability that we have to do to stop  that.   I will make this pledge to everyone in this House, all partisanship  aside, let's do this together. Let's show America that when it comes to  a time of need that we all put partisanship aside and that we put  people before politics.   So, yes, carry on the vote today, but I am not going to be voting for  it. I want to you know where my heart is. We will be back here next  week. We will make law, and we will solve this. Just as the offer went  across the aisle, I know we can do better.
