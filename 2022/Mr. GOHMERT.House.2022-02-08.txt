 Madam Speaker, I have an article here about the Justice  Department. It says it continues to go easy on the 2020 rioters.   These are people that destroyed government buildings, destroyed  places of business, yet this administration continues to not just  prosecute but persecute people who just came into the Capitol wrongly  that should be punished. But to have people let loose immediately after  burning people, being  [[Page H1019]]  involved in incidents where people were killed, is absolutely an  outrage to judgment.   Then, to put people under the control of a deputy warden at the D.C.  jail who absolutely, maliciously, intentionally despises anybody that  supported President Trump--and she is in charge of these people? This  is so dangerous and should not be allowed.   On top of that, we have the January 6th Committee. They were not  interested in following the traditions and the rules of the House with  regard to committees, where both parties could submit people for that  committee membership.    There is so much damage that is being done to this institution. It is  not the collegial working--sure, we have disagreements over the years,  strong disagreements, but we have never seen anything like what we are  experiencing now where we could have a commission that is totally made  up of people that the one party only wanted on the commission and  others that the other party wanted on were eliminated.   So, something has to be done.   Now, we have seen that this administration has not been particularly  concerned with its constitutional duties, like the one in Article IV  that mandates that the Federal Government must protect the States from  invasion.   You know, to Woodrow Wilson, four or five dozen people was an  invasion. Nowadays, this administration thinks 2 million is not an  invasion even though they bring death and suffering in the form of  drugs, sex trafficking, and human trafficking.   At the same time, for the first time since I have been in Congress,  we have seen that our mail--we have gotten two mail just a day apart.  One came in September 17, stamped by the Department of Justice as being  received and reviewed and examined. Another, from a Christian  missionary to me, it was reviewed by the Department of Justice.   The Supreme Court has made clear that the Department of Justice  cannot even get a search warrant to search a Member's office, yet this  administration, like this House, doesn't think the rules, the laws, the  Constitution, perhaps, mean what they say.   We have to get back to following the Constitution if we are going to  preserve this Republic. It is in a dire situation. It is in a desperate  situation.   If we do not get back to following the Constitution and observing the  rules of the House, then our Republic will be lost. That is where we  are being taken right now.                            ____________________
