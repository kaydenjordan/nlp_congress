 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on behalf  of myself and Senators Risch, Graham, Ernst, Fischer, Cruz, and Perdue.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Crapo and the other Senators for counsel  for the President:         How many witnesses have been presented to the Senate at       this point in this trial, how many pages of documentary       evidence have been put in the record before the Senate in       this trial, and how many other clips and transcripts of       evidence have been presented to the Senate in this trial?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question.   I think it is important to recognize that--because the House managers  keep talking about the need for witnesses, you can't have a trial  without witnesses--you have seen a lot of witnesses. There were 17  witnesses who were deposed and testified--12 in public, 17 who were in  closed hearings below.   So far you have seen in these presentations 192 video clips from 13  different witnesses. So testimony was shown here to you. Just as you  would in a trial in an ordinary court sometimes play the video of a  deposition instead of having the witness take the stand, you have seen  video clips from 13 different witnesses.   The House managers dramatically wheeled into the Senate a record--I  think it was reported as being 29,000 pages. I think the more official  number is 28,578 pages. So you have got over 28,000 pages of documents  submitted into the record provisionally in evidence in this trial,  subject later to potential objections for hearsay and other evidentiary  objections.   You have also heard here the arguments that have been presented,  along with presentation of both the documentary and testimonial  evidence by video clip and by slides that were put up. You have heard  arguments for up to 24 hours from each side. We didn't take all of our  time. The House managers argued for over 21 hours, putting on, with  their video clips and their excerpts from documents in the record,  their case.   So at this point there has been a lot put on here in terms of a  trial. You have seen the witnesses in the clips--all the most relevant  parts. You have seen the documents put up in excerpts on screens.   And as a result of this, the House managers have consistently said  over and over again--before they came here, they said they had an  overwhelming case. It was already buttoned down. They didn't need  anything else.   They said when they got here that it was proven--every single  allegation, every line in each Article of Impeachment. They said:  Proven, proven, proven.   We don't think that that is true, but those are their words. That is  what they are telling you--that they have had sufficient evidence to  make their case. They said ``proven,'' ``sufficient,'' ``uncontested,''  and ``overwhelming'' at least 68 times in the proceedings on the floor  here.   Manager Nadler told us just today that they think they have not only  proved it beyond a reasonable doubt but beyond any doubt because of the  evidence that they have already put on in front of you.   We don't think that is true. We think we have demonstrated it is not.   But the point is that the House managers have already put on a  substantial amount of testimony from witnesses through their clips of  prior deposition and hearing testimony. They have already presented to  you a large portion of the most relevant documents from those 28,000.  You have heard from the witnesses; you have seen where their testimony  conflicts. You can see which is the better, more persuasive version of  the facts.   You have been able to see what it is that they have in the record  that they say was overwhelming--already ready to go to trial--and this  proceeding, therefore, has already had a lot of the earmarks of a  trial.   So don't be taken in by the idea that we can't have a trial here, you  can't have a valid proceeding unless they bring someone in here to  testify live, because it wouldn't be just one person. If we start to go  down that route, it is not presenting the case that was prepared in the  hearings below; it is opening up discovery for an entirely new case,  and there would have to be depositions and witnesses on both sides, and  there is no need to do that if they really believe what they are  telling you--that it is already overwhelming. It is already proven.   There is no need to go on to anything else when you have already seen  so much and House managers had their chance to prepare their case.   And, again, I would also just make the point to bear in mind what is  the set--what precedent would be set if this Chamber has to become the  investigatory body for impeachments that were not prepared properly in  the House.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Arizona.
