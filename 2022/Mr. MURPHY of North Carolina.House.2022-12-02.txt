 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  Jackie Walorski MIECHV Reauthorization Act.   Maternal, infant, and childhood home visiting programs support  pregnant women and their young children with evidence-based approaches  that improve maternal and child health outcomes for the most  vulnerable.   Over the last 30 years, I have taken care of many single mothers who  struggled to take care of their children. Sadly, the problem is only  getting worse with the explosion of fatherlessness in this country.   This is a program we all wish didn't need to exist, but we are all  very glad that it does. This is actually when the government gets it  right.   I personally have been in these homes, when I was in the State  legislature, and these young women desperately need our help. Even more  so, the children of these single mothers need our help.   This program will help young mothers get the help that they need for  their children. These are not handouts; these are hand-ups. This is  what government is supposed to do.   I am proud of our colleague and dear friend, the late Congresswoman  Walorski, for her dedicated leadership on behalf of women and babies  throughout the country.   Jackie shined a bright light in this Chamber and was resolute in her  love and support for American families. This bill cements her legacy  and will improve the lives of millions of Americans for generations to  come.   I am honored to support this legislation and urge all of my  colleagues to vote for the reauthorization act in honor of Jackie  Walorski.
