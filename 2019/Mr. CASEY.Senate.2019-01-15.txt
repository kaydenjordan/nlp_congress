 I ask unanimous consent that Rahmon Ross of my staff be  granted floor privileges for today's proceedings.    Madam President, I rise to talk about the Medicare Program  and in particular a news story that came to our attention this past  weekend.   This is the headline from a story dated January 11, late in the day,  and it is by The Hill newspaper. You will not be able to see it from a  distance, but the headline reads: ``Trump officials consider allowing  Medicaid block grants for states.''   Here is what just the first two short paragraphs outline. The story  begins as follows:         The Trump administration is considering moving forward with       a major conservative change to Medicaid by allowing States to       get block grants for the program, sources say.        Capping the amount of money that the federal government       spends on the health insurance program for the poor through a       block grant has long been a conservative goal. It was a       controversial part of the ObamaCare repeal debate in 2017,       with much of the public rallying against cuts to Medicaid.        After the failure of that repeal effort, the Trump       administration is now considering issuing guidance to states       encouraging them to apply for caps on federal Medicaid       spending in exchange for additional flexibility on how they       run the program, according to people familiar with the       discussions.    I will not read the rest of the story, and I will not enter the whole  story into the Record because folks can look it up, and there are other  stories as well that cover this same news. So, in a sense, it is a big  new development, but it is an old story.   It is an old story of Members of Congress and the administration  coming together to try to make changes to the Medicaid Program. In this  case, it differs only slightly in that, so far at least, this seems to  be an initiative that is an administration-led initiative. We are not  aware of any--as far as I know--congressional involvement, but it is  not all that much different, right? It is the same thing.   We had a long debate in 2017 about whether we should not only repeal  the Affordable Care Act but thereby do two things to Medicaid--one is  to end over time Medicaid expansion, and second would be to have cuts  to Medicaid that would result from this same idea, the so-called block  granting of Medicaid.   I believe we litigated--if we can use that word in a legislative  sense--that in 2017. The repeal bill did not pass the Senate in the  summer of 2017. There were other attempts that didn't come to a vote on  full repeal. Then we had an election in 2018. Healthcare was a major  part of that debate, most of it centering on protections for  preexisting conditions and other consumer protections in the law.   If you look at the last 2 years, we had one-party rule in  Washington--Republican President, House, and Senate. There were major  efforts by the administration and by both majorities in the Houses of  Congress to make substantial changes to Medicaid, and it did not  happen. So failing all those attempts, now the administration, I would  assume, is trying to do it secretively but, now exposed, wants to make  changes to Medicaid by way of granting waivers and inviting States to,  in essence, change Medicaid at the State level.   This initiative will not affect Pennsylvania--or it is highly  unlikely to affect Pennsylvania in the near term. So this is about  major parts of the country but not every State. It is a bad idea, in  short order, because what this block granting means is benefits get  cut.   It is very simple. When you cut a program that is focused on  healthcare for low-income children, healthcare coverage for those with  disabilities, children and adults, and helping seniors have the benefit  of skilled care in a nursing home--that is another benefit of  Medicaid--you are talking about benefits being cut over time. Maybe  there will be more cuts in one State versus the other, depending upon  the nature of the waiver and the particulars of the program in that  State, but it is going to be cutting Medicaid. It is a bad idea, and I  think the American people understand that, especially after the debate  in 2017. It is a bad idea, and I think the American people understand  that.    Maybe there are some folks who didn't really appreciate Medicaid;  probably a lot of them in Washington didn't appreciate Medicaid before  the 2017 and 2018 debates. Maybe there are folks who weren't paying  attention for a lot of years and didn't realize the scope of Medicaid,  didn't realize it covers 70 million Americans. I know that is why some  Republican-elected officials in the Congress are very hostile to it;  they think it covers too many people. But after 2017, those who were  misinformed or had forgotten or just were never aware of the benefits  of Medicaid got a real good reminder because of the debate we had. That  was one positive outgrowth of that long and difficult debate on  healthcare generally--the Affordable Care Act specifically--but also,  by extension, Medicaid.   A proposal like this to block-grant Medicaid, which was proposed  numerous times here in the Congress over the last couple of years,  hurts basically those three groups of Americans. It hurts kids, hurts  people with disabilities, and hurts our seniors.   I think the part of it that people tend to forget is that this  program helps middle-class families as well. If you have a disability,  your income might be higher than low income, but you get the benefit of  Medicaid. A lot of middle-class families have a loved one in a nursing  home who would not be able to afford that kind of long-term care  without the benefit of Medicaid. A lot of those families are middle  class.   When it comes to children, of course, it is for children from low- income families, but those children are getting  [[Page S228]]  what many believe to be the gold standard for children's healthcare.   I like to say that in Pennsylvania, Medicaid is a 40-50-60 program.  It is real simple: 40 percent of the kids in our State, thankfully,  have the benefit of Medicaid; 50 percent of people with disabilities-- roughly, about half of the people in our State with disabilities get  the benefit of Medicaid. Thank goodness they do. Thirdly, 60 percent of  people getting long-term care in Pennsylvania could not get it without  the benefit of Medicaid.   In some States, the percentages might be higher or lower than that,  but when you have a program that covers 40 percent of your children, 50  percent of your population with disabilities, and 60 percent of your  seniors could get long-term care, which they need--those folks who have  long-term care need it and have to have it. When you have that kind of  program, which covers roughly 2 million people in Pennsylvania and 70  million nationwide, you are going to get the attention of a lot of  people when you are messing with it. That is a technical term,  ``messing with it.'' By saying, to some degree, under the cover of  darkness--not having a debate on the floor of the House or the Senate  but sending guidance to States, inviting them to apply for a waiver,  and it takes a while to approve the waiver, then all of a sudden it  comes out, and the waiver is granted--guess what. If you live in a  State where that happens and you are on Medicaid, you might not have  Medicaid a year from the waiver being granted--or 2 years or 5 years.  At some point, you may be adversely affected by that. This is very  serious business when it comes to those very vulnerable Americans.   In so many ways, Medicaid, like a lot of things we debate here--not  only Medicaid, but Medicaid is one of many examples we could cite-- tells us who we are as a nation. People around the world don't respect  America simply because America has the strongest, best military. We  have the best fighting men and women in the world; no one is even  close. But there are a lot of nations that spend a lot on their  military and have strong, fighting men and women; they have a strong  military, and they are not respected like we are. Thank God we have a  strong military and the strongest economy in the world. We are blessed  by that.   But one of the other ways the world respects us is that they often  conclude that we treat our own people better than some other places do.  Medicaid, which is a 50-year-old program, is a program that tells us  who we are as a nation, whom we value, and whom we are willing to fight  on behalf of. It tells us a lot about who we are. America is great  because we care deeply about those 70 million people who get the  benefit of that program, just as we care deeply about other Americans  who benefit or have a connection to our government.   Before any administration or any part of our government takes an  action that will lead to the cutting back of a program like Medicaid-- whether it is by way of legislation or by way of waiver or regulation-- they need to hear from us.   I, for one, am willing to fight on this for a long time. If I do  nothing else but fight this battle, sign me up because we are going to  fight hard. I am not certain we will win, but I think we will win this  battle. Medicaid tells us who we are. Why do I say that? Well, because  we hear from families all the time.    I got a letter at the beginning of the debate in 2017 from a mom.  Like a lot of Members of the Senate, you get a letter from a mom or a  dad or a family member who sits down to put pen to paper--in a sense,  to write you a letter or send you an email or to express what their  lives will be like without a program, what their lives will be like if  a change goes forward.   In this case it was Pam, a mom talking about her son Rowan. Rowan is  on the autism spectrum. This mom talks about the prospect of not just  learning that and what that meant to her and her family and the  challenge of it, obviously, but also the benefits she received because  of Medicaid--in Pennsylvania we call it Medical Assistance, or by the  shorthand, MA.   I will not read the whole letter, but Pam talks about, in just one  example of what Medicaid means, the wraparound services--all of the  services that a child who has a disability gets, maybe on either the  autism spectrum or a physical disability or maybe a child who has Down  syndrome.   In this case, Rowan is on the autism spectrum. She talks about the  behavioral specialist consultant and the therapeutic staff support work  that helps her and the benefits of that and what that means to Pam, as  a mom, and to her family--but also what it means to her son Rowan. She  talks about Rowan benefiting ``immensely from a program called the  Child Guidance Resource Center,'' which recently started a new program  called the CREATE Program. It is a social skills program specifically  for autistic children ages 3 to 21. She enrolled Rowan in that so- called CREATE Program.   She goes on to say: ``I am thrilled by Rowan's daily progress. I  cannot say enough great things about this program.''   That program would not be part of the life of that family, absent  Medicaid. That program would not be part of the life of that family in  the instance where that family was living in a State that had been  granted a waiver that allowed block grants that, thereby, allowed cuts  that resulted in that family not getting that kind of service.   Thankfully, she is in a State where the Medicaid Program is strong  and will be defended aggressively. But I don't want a Rowan in another  State or a Pam--a mom in another State--not having the benefit that  Rowan in Pennsylvania has and that Pam in Pennsylvania has.   Pam goes on to say: ``Without medical assistance, our family would be  bankrupt or my son would go without the therapies he sincerely needs.''   At the end of the letter, she concludes by asking me, as her  representative, to think about her family when we are debating these  issues. She talks about her husband and her son Rowan first, and then  she concludes the letter this way:         Please think of my 9-month-old daughter, Luna, who smiles       and laughs at her brother daily; she will have to care for       Rowan late in her life after we are gone. Overall, we are       desperately in need of Rowan's Medical Assistance and would       be devastated if we lost these benefits.    That is what one mom said about the importance of Medicaid to that  family.   My point in raising this issue--even though, thankfully, we have  beaten back an effort to legislatively change the Medicaid Program for  the worse, and we now have an administrative effort to undermine the  program, but I raise this simply to say that family in America should  not have to worry for 10 minutes about whether their government is  going to continue those important benefits to their son or to their  daughter, whatever the case may be. Maybe their mom is in a nursing  home or maybe a neighbor has a son or a daughter who, because of income  levels, is getting Medicaid. They shouldn't have to worry for 10 or 15  minutes about that because we are America. We made the decision 50  years ago--and it was a good decision--to take care of those families  and to do everything we could.   Some days we will not get it right; some days we will make mistakes.  But on most days, a program like that is helping lots of families, tens  of millions of them, and the bureaucrats or the elected officials or  the administration officials in Washington who seek to make changes  that will adversely affect even one of those families has to look those  families in the eye--or should look them in the eye--and tell them why  that is good, not just for that family but why that is good for  America. How is that going to help us?   I know what the argument will be. I hear it over and over again. They  say that the program is unsustainable, right? We are not going to be  able to afford this much Medicaid 10 years from now, 15 years from now,  25 years from now. Well, when they say ``unsustainable'' around here, I  want to translate for you. That means they are not willing to make  people of means pay for it. Let me say it bluntly: If we have to charge  someone else who has a high income to preserve Medicaid, sign me up for  that too.   Let's be very clear about this. This program is that important. I  believe there are a lot of Americans of means--of high incomes--who  would want to make sure this program is preserved. I know there are  some politicians around here who are always talking about how you have  to make sure that they have  [[Page S229]]  low tax rates, but I think a lot of those Americans want to preserve  the Medicaid Program, want to strengthen it, want to make changes that  are appropriate, want to make it more efficient where we can, but there  are a lot of Americans out there of great means who want this program  preserved. So we have a lot of work to do to make sure we move in the  right direction.   Let me make one or two more final points, and I will conclude.   One of the other questions is, What happens if a block grant proposal  goes through nationwide but even in more limited instances?   Way back in November of 2016, one of the many organizations that  track this kind of a program over time--the Medicaid Program or  healthcare programs--issued a report. It has issued many of these  reports, but here is just one for your consideration. The name of the  organization is Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It is here in  Washington and has been around a long time. It was very helpful in the  debate on healthcare and about the impact of various proposals.   Here is what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in  November of 2016. The date was November 30, 2016. In order to save some  space, I will not read the whole report, and I will not enter it into  the Record. People can look it up, right?   Here is the headline: ``Medicaid Block Grant Would Slash Federal  Funding, Shift Costs to States, and Leave Millions More Uninsured.''   Here is what some of the headlines say in the report. The first one  reads ``A block grant would cap Federal Medicaid funding in order to  achieve savings for the Federal Government.'' That is what the proposal  is intended to do.   No. 2, ``The likely magnitude of the Federal funding cuts and  resulting cost-shift to States would be very large.''   No. 3, ``Such a block grant would push states to cut their Medicaid  programs deeply.''   The last two are as follows: ``Medicaid is already efficient and  innovative.'' That is true. We don't talk about that enough, but it is  true.   The last headline is ``A Medicaid block grant would lead to draconian  cuts to eligibility, benefits, and provider payment rates.'' What they  didn't mention there is that cuts to Medicaid would also hurt a lot of  hospitals, especially rural hospitals.   Here is the number from the House Republican budget plan for fiscal  year 2017. We are going back now to the latter part of 2016. Here is  what the report concludes, and this is in the instance of being  implemented as law: ``It would have cut federal Medicaid funding by $1  trillion--or nearly 25 percent--over ten years, relative to current  law, on top of the cuts the plan would secure from repealing the ACA's  Medicaid expansion.''   I realize that number is bigger than what we are talking about here  because we are talking about a number of States changing their Medicaid  Programs because of a block granting waiver that was granted to that  particular State, but I am not too concerned about the overall number  because that is impossible to predict.   Even if just one State were to be granted this kind of a waiver in  implemented block grants, a lot of people in that State would lose  their Medicaid. I think we should be concerned if it were one person  losing Medicaid because of that, let alone thousands or tens of  thousands or hundreds of thousands or, in fact, millions. If block  granting were to be granted for the whole country, you would be talking  about double-figure millions losing that kind of coverage. Even if it  were to be a much smaller number, we should be very concerned about  this.   Here is another reason not to mess around with Medicaid in a way that  adversely impacts people or undermines the program. I hear from a lot  of politicians in Washington from both Houses and both parties. I  think, in almost every instance--and there is probably an exception to  this--they speak from their hearts and do truly care about what is  happening in their communities and in their States because of the  opioid crisis. It is everywhere. It is urban, rural, and suburban. It  is everywhere, and it is devastating. We have never seen a public  health problem like it in probably 100 years or at least not anything  worse than it. It is a problem in Pennsylvania, and it is a problem in  every State, as I am sure the Presiding Officer would agree. Yet here  is the part they don't talk about. Sometimes the same people say, ``I  really am worried about the opioid crisis, and I want to do the  following to help people who are in the grip of that addiction, and I  want to institute a program or provide funding or otherwise,'' and that  is wonderful when they have that initiative. Yet sometimes those same  Members of Congress, in the next breath, will say, ``But I want to  block grant Medicaid'' or ``I want to cut or cap Medicaid'' or ``We  need to cut back on what we spend on Medicaid,'' and they vote for  budget after budget after budget and bill after bill to cut Medicaid.   What do you think is the No. 1 payer when it comes to the opioid  crisis, the primary payer for opioid treatment and recovery? You  guessed it--Medicaid.   If you are going to go down this road and talk about this program as  if it were some far-off program for them, for someone else, you should  look in the mirror because Medicaid is an ``us'' program, not a  ``them'' program and not a program for someone far away. It is for our  neighbors. It is for our friends if they have opioid addictions and can  only get treatment and services mostly because of Medicaid expansion-- actually, as part of the Affordable Care Act.   Medicaid itself, the core program, of course, is a program that makes  sure that a child has healthcare. Even if he is of low income and his  mom or his dad or the person taking care of him is not working and  doesn't have employer coverage, he gets the benefit of Medicaid. Guess  what. When that low-income child gets Medicaid, we all benefit. That  child is more likely to grow up healthy, and he or she will be more  productive and will be a stronger part of our economy. So Medicaid for  low-income children or children from low-income families helps all of  us. It doesn't just help that child. It is not just a nice thing to do.  It is the right thing to do, but it is also very practical.   Medicaid helps people with disabilities whether they have profound  disabilities or otherwise. They have to be eligible for it based upon  their disabilities, but we have made a decision that that is a good  thing to do for that individual and for society. The same is true of  people making decisions about a loved one's going into long-term care  and one's spending down one's assets, and there is usually a big gap  after one spends down. Middle-class families--sometimes people above  middle class--spend down. They can't afford the cost of nursing home  care, and the State says and the Federal Government says: We want to  help you.   That is why Medicaid is so critical to nursing homes. If you look at  the dollars spent, it would not be entirely inaccurate to say that  Medicaid is a nursing home program with help for children and people  with disabilities as well.   I am just putting the administration on notice that if it wants to  continue to pursue this, we are going to have a big fight about it, and  it is a fight that will go on for a long time. It will go on in the  courts. We will litigate it on this floor. We will litigate it in  committees and fight about it in the House and in the Senate. We will  fight in the streets of our States, and we will fight about it for a  long time until we win because we have other things to do to lift  people up around here. We have to do more on healthcare--lower the cost  of healthcare, lower the cost of prescription drugs--and make sure that  these programs work well. We don't have time for throwing millions of  people off of healthcare or tens of millions off of healthcare. There  is a broad, bipartisan consensus on a whole range of things we could do  on healthcare. That is what we should work on.   The administration, if it is doing the right thing, would abandon  these reckless, extreme ideas on Medicaid and join us--join both  parties in both Houses--in trying to do something positive and  constructive and American on healthcare. I don't think it is American  to say to a child, ``Yes, you had Medicaid before, but we couldn't  afford it. You are not going to have healthcare any longer'' or to say  that to someone with a disability or to a senior.   If the administration wants to fight, we are going to be ready to  fight, and  [[Page S230]]  we will punch hard in that fight--figuratively speaking, of course. We  will fight every minute of every day against this.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
