 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Judy White  on her retirement from the Riverside County Office of Education.   Known as a history maker and stereotype breaker, Dr. White has been a  distinguished educator for the past 40 years. Most recently, she served  as the Riverside County Superintendent of Schools, where she led the  county's 515 schools, ensuring that all 430,000 students in the county  received the quality education they deserve.   Dr. White has dedicated her career to bettering public education  throughout the Inland Empire. She encouraged students to pursue their  educational dreams, and she secured millions of dollars in funding to  bridge the digital divide in our communities.   There is no doubt that Dr. White has been an incredible asset to the  students of Riverside County, and I am glad to have had the pleasure of  working with her. She sets a high bar in everything she does, and I  wish her a happy retirement and all the best in her future endeavors.                            ____________________
