 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 984,  the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition  Act and I want to thank my fellow Virginian, Congressman Rob Wittman  for introducing this bill, and the gentleman from Utah, Chairman Bishop  and the gentleman from Arizona, Ranking Member Grijalva, for their  leadership and cooperation in bringing the bill to the floor.   Four hundred ten years ago, the first English settlers founded  Jamestown, Virginia. The founding of Jamestown represented a first step  in the creation of our great Republic, and the success of this colony  is owed to the help of the indigenous people of Virginia.   With this assistance, the Jamestown colony weathered a difficult  first few years in the New World before expanding, with English  colonists pushing further inland. The same Native Americans who had  helped those first settlers were pushed from their land without  compensation. Treaties, many of which precede our own constitution,  were made in an effort to compensate Virginia's Native Americans.  Unfortunately, as history has repeatedly shown, these treaties were not  often honored.   Like many other Native Americans, and many other groups who were not  white, and despite their contributions to the founding of our nation,  Virginia's Indian Tribes were pushed to the fringes of society. They  were deprived of their land, prevented from getting an education, and  denied a role in our society. Virginia's Native Americans were denied  their  [[Page H4259]]  very fundamental human rights and the very freedoms and liberties  enshrined in our Constitution.   This bill will finally grant federal recognition to the Chickahominy  Tribe, the Eastern Chickahominy Tribe, the Upper Mattaponi Tribe, the  Rappahannock Tribe, the Monacan Indian Nation, and the Nansemond Tribe.   Federal recognition of Virginia's Indian Tribes will promote tribal  economic development and allow Virginia's tribes to flourish  culturally. Federal recognition, a process that has been ongoing for  these tribes for over 30 years, will lead to a bright future for a  whole new generation of tribe members.   Mr. Speaker, I was a member of the Virginia General Assembly in 1983  when many of these tribes first gained formal recognition from the  Commonwealth of Virginia, and I am proud to be here today supporting  federal recognition for these tribes.   The time has come for this Congress to act, and I therefore urge my  colleagues to support this bill.
