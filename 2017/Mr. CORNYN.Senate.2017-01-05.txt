 Mr. President, I would just say, I had the pleasure of  sitting here listening to the Senator from Connecticut talk about his  concerns about repealing ObamaCare, and I would say it strikes me that  their posture is that we sold the American people a lemon, and we  insist they keep it.   Our position is that ObamaCare has been a failure. It has been a  grand--in terms of scale--experiment, a national experiment that has  failed.   Yesterday I talked about the fact that my constituents are writing me  and telling me that their premiums, in many instances, have doubled,  and their deductible has gotten to the point that they are effectively  self-insured so their insurance does them virtually no good.   We will vote to repeal ObamaCare, but obviously we are not going to  leave people hanging out to dry. We are going to make sure they have  coverage that they choose and that they can afford. I welcome the  assistance of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try to craft  a bipartisan reform.  [[Page S83]]    The biggest failure of ObamaCare was the fact that when our  Democratic friends had 60 votes in the Senate and they had President  Obama in the White House and a majority in the House, they jammed it  down the throats of the American people. That is really why ObamaCare  is unsustainable--because it was purely a partisan political exercise.  We need to start over by repealing ObamaCare and then reforming our  health care system so people can buy the coverage they want at a price  they can afford. We are going to work very carefully to make sure the  transition is thought out, methodical, and very carefully done.                                 Nominations    Soon, Mr. President, we will be considering and confirming men and  women nominated by the President-elect to fill leadership roles  throughout the administration. This is crucial to ensuring a smooth  transition from one President to another, and it is important to make  sure the next President has the people and resources he needs to help  lead our country.   I have had some of the reporters in the hallway say: How in the world  can you process so many nominees at the same time, so quickly?   I said: It is the tyranny of the calendar. We are going to have a new  President on January 20, and wouldn't you want--for example, the  President's CIA Director choice, the Attorney General, the Secretary of  Defense, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, the Director  of National Intelligence--wouldn't you want all of those key national  security positions filled as soon as possible in case some of our  adversaries decide to take advantage of this transition to try to  threaten the United States?   It makes sense to me that we would work in an orderly sort of way  with our colleagues across the aisle to make this transition a smooth  one from President Obama to President Trump. President Obama has said  that is what he is working to do, and you would think it would make  sense for us to be a part of the solution and not a part of the  problem.   Holding up confirmations just for delay's sake is irresponsible and  it is dangerous. As I speak, there is a hearing going on on the foreign  cyber threats in the Senate Armed Services Committee. People are  justifiably concerned about what our adversaries are doing in cyber  space. But it is not related to just cyber space, it is related to  nuclear threats from countries such as North Korea, obviously the  ongoing humanitarian crisis and civil war going on in Syria and  elsewhere, the threats from Russia not only in cyber space but also to  our NATO allies in Europe, and I could go on and on talking about Iran  and its nuclear aspirations, its ballistic missile capability.   This is a dangerous world we are living in, and why in the world  would we want to make it even more dangerous just to let our colleagues  delay for delay's sake President-Elect Trump getting to fill his  Cabinet, particularly these important national security offices? The  truth is, when it comes to wanting what is best for America, we are all  on the same team. We should all want what is best for our country. It  doesn't do our Democratic colleagues a bit of good to delay the  inevitable because, thanks to former Democratic leader Harry Reid and  the so-called nuclear option that changed the Senate confirmation  rules, we know that President-Elect Trump's Cabinet members will be  confirmed. It is going to happen because it takes 51 votes. Just  delaying for delay's sake out of partisan pique really doesn't do  anything to accomplish any goal but, rather, makes our country more  dangerous and denies the President-elect the Cabinet he has chosen.   When President-Elect Obama was nominated to office, we acted very  quickly. In fact, on the day he was inaugurated--January 20, 2009-- seven of his Cabinet members were confirmed. We were not happy about  the outcome of the election on this side of the aisle. We wished a  different electoral outcome had occurred. But once the voters had  spoken, we accepted their verdict, and we worked cooperatively to see a  smooth transition from the Bush administration to the Obama  administration. I believe it is our duty to do that. Nearly all of  President Obama's Cabinet-level nominees were confirmed within the span  of 2 weeks. We came together, understood that the people had spoken,  and we went to work to cooperate in good faith, not necessarily because  we were happy about the outcome but because it is our responsibility to  do so.   Then there are some of the statements from some of our colleagues  across the aisle that they now appear to be walking away from. In the  spring of 2015, Senator Stabenow, the senior Senator from Michigan,  said: ``When a President wins an election, they have the right to have  their team.'' She said that on April 20, 2015. I hope that not only the  Senator from Michigan but her other colleagues remember that position  they took then and simply reciprocate in good faith during this  transition.   Senator Stabenow is right, by the way. No matter which side you are  on, we know that the voters have spoken. As President-elect, he has the  authority to surround himself with those he sees fit to advise him and  help him as he serves our country.   For some of our colleagues to suggest that keeping the President  understaffed is somehow in the best interest of the American people is  palpably false. It is ridiculous. I mentioned the national security  nominations the President-elect has indicated. One of those first ones  was Senator Sessions, our colleague here in the Senate, the junior  Senator from Alabama, to serve as Attorney General of the United  States. The Attorney General is not only the head of the Department of  Justice and has an important law enforcement role, the Attorney General  also has a very important anti-terrorism national security portfolio as  well. So it is very important that people like Senator Sessions, the  Attorney General nominee, be put in place on a timely basis for the  safety of our community.   Talking about the nomination of Attorney General Loretta Lynch not  even 2 years ago, the senior Senator from Vermont urged a quick  confirmation, saying: ``Confirming the top law enforcement position  should be an urgent priority of the Senate.'' And he is right.   As the minority party is now considering the political strategy of  obstruction, delay, and stall tactics, what has changed except that  your preferred candidate did not win and our preferred candidate did  win? That is the only thing that has changed.   Another nominee the Senate will consider is the President-elect's  choice to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice  Scalia. Last year, after the death of Justice Scalia, we promised the  American people that the next President, whether it was a Republican or  a Democrat, would nominate the successor to Justice Scalia. We didn't  say we would only vote to confirm a Republican President's nominees; we  said that the American people had a right to a voice in who would make  that choice, recognizing that the next Justice on the Supreme Court  could serve 25 or 30 years.   Here we are 15 days before the President-elect is sworn in to the  White House and the minority leader is already threatening to deny the  voices and the vote of the American people from last November by  blocking any nominee indefinitely.   As shocking as it sounds, on Tuesday night, just hours after the  115th Congress was sworn in, Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader,  was asked in an interview on MSNBC if he would ``do his best to keep  the seat open.'' He answered with one word: ``Absolutely.'' Despite  months of calling for a full Supreme Court, all nine members, even  using the hashtag ``We need nine,'' the Democratic leader is now  threatening indefinite obstruction.   Republicans were clear with the American people: We would respect  their voice in whom they wanted to pick the next Supreme Court Justice,  whether it was a Democrat or Republican in the White House, and we  would move forward with that nominee in the new Congress.   I hope our Democratic friends don't slow-walk President-Elect Trump's  nominees. It is one thing to obstruct, but it becomes an even bigger  problem when they intentionally try to keep President Trump from doing  the job the voters have given him the responsibility to do.   The American people made clear in November that they are done with  [[Page S84]]  business as usual here in Washington, DC. Frankly, I don't think it was  a robust endorsement of either one of the political parties. We got an  unconventional President-elect, and I think the American people expect  him to shake this place up, and I think he will. We intend to work with  him to make sure there is a positive outcome for the American people. I  don't think they are interested in political stunts or delay for  delay's sake, nor do they want us to return to the dysfunctional do- nothing Congress of the past. They want results, and they want a path  forward toward a brighter future for themselves and their families.   Let's not keep from President Trump the men and women he has chosen  to work alongside him. That would only make us less safe, our economy  more fragile, and the government less efficient. After all, we are  paying the bills as taxpayers. Why would we want a less efficient or  less effective government? In short, it will not serve the interests of  the American people well.   I know we are ready on this side of the aisle to roll up our sleeves  and get to work. As I have learned through hard experience, the only  time anything ever gets accomplished in the Senate is when we work  together. I am not talking about people sacrificing their principles.  We ought to fight like cats and dogs when it comes to our basic  principles. There are a lot of things that are outside of the realm of  principles where we can find common ground and work together and build  consensus. I think we ought to take advantage of this historic  opportunity to do just that, starting with confirming the President's  Cabinet and letting them get to work to help his administration as soon  as possible.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.    Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to a  dedicated public servant and Texan, Sarah R. Saldana. Ms. Saldana is  stepping down as Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,  ICE, and retiring after many years of Federal service.   Born as the youngest of seven children to working-class parents in  Corpus Christi, TX, Director Saldana learned the importance of hard  work and education at a young age. After she graduated from W.B. Ray  High School in 1970, Director Saldana attended Del Mar Junior College  and graduated summa cum laude from Texas A&M, formerly Texas A&I,  University in 1973. Shortly thereafter, she began her career as an 8th  grade language arts teacher at D.A. Hulcy Middle School in Dallas.  Later, she worked as a technician for the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission, EEOC, and as an investigator and management intern for the  Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD. Additionally, she  worked as a Federal Representative for the Department of Labor  Employment and Training Administration until 1981.   Ms. Saldana then decided to pursue a legal education at Southern  Methodist University, SMU, in Dallas, TX, where she earned her J.D. in  1984. Following graduation, she clerked for the Honorable U.S. District  Judge Barefoot Sanders. As a trial attorney, Director Saldana was an  associate for the law firms of Haynes and Boone, and then Baker Botts,  where she became partner in their trial department.  [[Page S109]]    In 2004, she returned to public service and became an assistant U.S.  attorney for the Northern District of Texas, where she prosecuted a  variety of criminal cases. She also served as the deputy criminal chief  in charge of the district's major fraud and public corruption section.   In 2011, Ms. Saldana was nominated and confirmed to become the first  Latina United States attorney in the history of Texas and only the  second woman to hold that position in the 135-year history of Texas'  Northern District--a region that includes the Dallas-Fort Worth  Metroplex and spans 100 counties and stretches across 95,000 square  miles.   In 2014, Ms. Saldana was confirmed to lead the U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement. As ICE's Director, she helped to oversee the  largest investigative agency within the Department of Homeland Security  and to protect the safety and security of the United States.   Throughout her career, she has served with integrity and character.  Ms. Saldana has served the people of Texas and the United States with  honor--fighting illegal immigration, public corruption, organized  crime, sexual predators, and other dangerous criminals.   Her legacy will continue to benefit the American people and I join  with her family, friends, and coworkers in saying that her experience  and dedication to public service will be missed.   I offer my appreciation to Sarah R. Saldana for her service to our  Nation and send my best wishes for the years ahead.                            ____________________
