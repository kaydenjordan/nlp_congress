 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this because I want to  remind everybody this is continental offshore; this is not State-owned  property. This is the property of the American public.   So, if we are going to extend that aspect, I want the same type of  application to lands out in western Arizona and the Western United  States. So we have to start looking at this.   We have seen opposition, basically, state that they can't coexist:  fundamental energy development, exploration, and tourism. But we see  that very vibrantly in the Gulf State of Louisiana. We see one of the  most vibrant fishing areas. The argument doesn't hold muster in that  regard.   In regards to that, we need to explore and find out exactly what kind  of resources are actually there. It makes a big difference in regards  to energy independence because those who spend money for tourism have  to have a job, and plentiful energy at affordable prices help American  businesses and the American worker.   So the same aspects we are trying to extend here for Florida should  be extended all the way across the board.   But, once again, this is the public's property. It needs to be well  invested, and the government has the due diligence in which to do that.   We can take into consideration the concerns of the military. We do it  time and time again in southwestern Arizona. We have the Goldwater  Range, the Yuma Proving Ground, yet we still coexist with the natural  resources and environmental protections.   I think, within that aspect, I rise in opposition, and I would ask  everybody to defeat this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, the irony of this aspect, to explore something  that is of the public nature of the people of the United States, the  ironic aspect is unfathomable.   To look at seismic, we don't even want to do seismic. We need seismic  in regard to looking at moorings in regard to big wind. That is what we  have seen over and over again, that this area wants to have big wind.   The other part to this aspect is, how does that work when you have to  have a Russian tanker moored outside of your bay, which is one of the  most easily spilled aspects of oil that you have to have for heating  oil and natural gas in regard to heating your energy platforms in the  areas? That is just unfathomable to me.   We do this better, and the technology is actually coming back around.   As the Western Caucus chairman, we went down to Houston to actually  see the technology that exists. It is profound, absolutely profound  what is there.   No one is asking to go past go, collect $200. What they want to do is  follow the rightful process in that aspect.   There is evidence like I cited in the Gulf States. Definitely when  you look at Louisiana, it is a plethora. It is one of the most diverse  aquatic ecosystems around.   There is a way to have this and looking at it and benefit everybody.   Once again, the dichotomy of trying to separate one aspect of  holdings for the American people, and then apply it to out West, where  there is even more defined aspects of jurisdiction, to land aspects of  public lands and public minerals and gas leases, is just ironic.   Mr. Chair, I remain in opposition.    Madam Chairwoman, specifically, the CPP aimed to  dramatically reduce carbon dioxide, CO2 emissions, from new  and existing power plants. These new regulations called for an  unrealistic 32 percent nationwide cut in CO2 emissions by  2030 from 2005 levels.   I have just got to tell you, we are wrapping up scientific evidence,  and we are putting a moral cloud on it. That is exactly the definition  of what Alinsky wanted us to start talking about and moving processes.   These new mandates placed incredible burdens on States. They would  have increased the electrical rates and endangered overall reliability  of the grid. Due to this unprecedented overreach, Congress rejected  these new regulations, using the Congressional Review Act.   Specifically, the Senate voted on November 17, 2015, to reject these  rules, and the House followed suit on December 1, 2015. Unfortunately,  President Obama decided to veto both of these pieces of legislation and  continue his war on coal.   We shouldn't be picking winners and losers. Climate change has been  going on for eons of time. That is why you can actually have a fossil  coming from Green River, Wyoming, that is nowhere close to the ocean. I  vote against this.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Chair, 32 fires in 2015. The average over the last 10 years has  been 15 to 20 fires. We ought to know better.   In Arizona, I have had to witness the most catastrophic fires in  Arizona history because of our mismanagement of forests: The Wallow  fire, the largest fire in Arizona history; and then the Yarnell fire,  where we lost 19 firefighters.   It is incredible that what we are doing is we are trying to have  jurisdiction over fires. There is a reason why we have had to subsidize  that: because we have put the industry out of business by sue and  settle.   Folks, there is a cost to these fires, and you have to start looking  at mitigation in that aspect. If you want climate change mitigation,  the best thing you can do is have a dynamic forest that actually  produces more oxygen than carbon. That means medium- and small-growth  trees, not old-growth trees. A happy medium of all is a dynamic forest.   So if you are preventing this--the gentleman from Arizona ought to  know better. We are sitting on catastrophic results in Arizona. Let's  not impugn the trees in Alaska.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, my amendment is straightforward. It would prevent any  funds in this bill from being used to carry out the EPA disastrous 2009  Endangerment Finding.   The EPA's Endangerment Finding has served as legal justification for  the Federal Government to attack American energy under the guise of  climate change since 2009.   The Information Quality Act provides a framework for the oversight of  the quality of information disseminated by the Federal Government.  Unfortunately, bureaucrats in President Obama's EPA evaded the  requirements set forth in the Information Quality Act by refusing to  admit that the document was a highly influential scientific assessment.   If climate change is as dire as some of my colleagues consistently  argue, why then did President Obama's EPA go to such lengths to prevent  their assessment from rigorous peer review?   Interesting.   In April of this year, President Trump's Office of Management and  Budget released a memo to ``reinforce, clarify, and interpret agency  responsibilities with regard to responsibilities under the Information  Quality Act.''   In April, the Competitive Enterprise Institute petitioned the EPA to  stop using the 2009 Endangerment Finding until it subjected itself to  the high-level scientific peer review that is legally required under  the Information Quality Act.   CEI's petition to the EPA found numerous instances in which the EPA  failed to meet the Agency's own peer review standards for the highly  scientific assessments. Some of the failure of the EPA noted by CEI  include failing ``to allow public, including scientific and  professional societies, to nominate potential reviewers,'' allowing an  EPA employee to conduct peer review, utilizing peer reviewers who were  reviewing their own work, and reliance on the United Nations Climate  Change Panel reports that do not meet Federal peer review standards.   Completely obnoxious.   Now, even the staunchest advocates for taking aggressive action on  our climate should be able to agree that the process the EPA used to  adopt the Endangerment Finding failed to meet the required peer review  process.   Fortunately, there is an alternative. Madam Chairwoman, I believe the  best way to improve our environment and to ensure the economic  prosperity of this country is to rely on sound science, not on the  opinions of unelected bureaucrats at the EPA.   If climate alarmists are so confident that the 2009 Endangerment  Finding is sound science, then conduct proper peer review, following  the guidelines of the Information Quality Act put forth by OMB, that  will assure the outcome.   Madam Chairwoman, this is not a partisan issue. No matter what side  of the climate change debate you fall on, we can all agree that the EPA  has evaded its responsibility to peer review and developing sound  science when authoring its Endangerment Findings.   The process was broken, and good process makes good policy, which  makes good politics. This body should not fund the implementation of  policies based on the 2009 Endangerment Finding.   Madam Chair, I urge all Members on both sides of the aisle to support  my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask one simple question: If Members of this  body are so confident of the 2009 endangerment findings, then high- quality peer review would result in the same outcome, correct? What  would be the fallacy with that?   Once again, good process builds good policy builds good politics. We  fail to do that. We want to use science when it is convenient for us.  That is the problem.   The other side calls themselves the party of science. Then they  should be all for this peer review aspect. But, no, we don't want to do  that because it is not convenient.   Once again, I agree. Climates are always changing. That is why we  find fossilized fish up in western Wyoming. Was man around during that  time? No, not at all. Were the carbon footprints  [[Page H4963]]  at that time very similar to what they are today? They were higher at  that point in time.   Science has been peer-reviewed, and that is why we have gotten to the  point that when I give you one set of circumstances, you get the same  outcome. That is what peer-reviewed science is. This country is set  upon sound science. We ought to determine that.   Madam Chair, I ask for everybody to vote for this, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Abraham).    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota.  Chronic wasting disease is 100 percent fatal. We have similar diseases  like mad cow disease in cattle and scrapie in sheep.   One of the things that we are very concerned with, as the gentlewoman  alluded to, is that we have no testing available for hunter  populations. Is it communicable to human beings and to other aspects of  agriculture? Those are some of the things that we really need to  address.   As the gentlewoman said, we have now seen it in 25 States, so it is  spreading. Once again, being 100 percent fatal, we have to address this  because we have whole populations that are at stake.   We can put our ingenuity to task here. We can solve this problem, but  it is at the forefront.   I thank the gentleman from Louisiana. As a veterinarian, as a  physician, he understands the dire ramifications of this. I thank the  gentlewoman for accepting this.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairman, this amendment attempts to change the  requirements for oil and gas leases. I will say it's very  entrepreneurial in its disguise.   But I want to remind people in regard to how big this aspect is. This  is a small, little area. To give you an example, ANWR is the size of  Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and New Hampshire combined.  Energy developed with ANWR is just one-fifth the size of the Dulles  Airport. Amazing. If you have ever been there, it is something to be  seen.  [[Page H4965]]    As the Congressional Western Caucus chairman, we actually took that  liberty of going up there and being hosted by the gentleman from  Alaska. What you are being told and what is being there in aspect isn't  the same.   So, Madam Chair, I actually join the gentleman from South Carolina  and ask for a ``yes'' vote.    My colleague, Mr. Mullin, is absolutely correct. When  former President Obama directed the EPA, BLM, and other agencies to  target industries for greenhouse gas emissions, they went directly for  the oil and natural gas first.   But this EPA rule targeting methane is completely unnecessary. It is  produced as a byproduct of oil and natural gas production, but it is a  valuable product in itself that can be sold and is sold. It is  something that oil and gas companies routinely capture and sell. They  were doing a great job of this even before this rule. It was  unnecessary.   Even EPA estimates show that the methane emissions have decreased  while the production of natural gas and oil have increased over the  same period. The free market has provided an incentive to reduce  methane release on its own. There is no further need for the EPA to  impose this bureaucratic hurdle. It is expensive. The cost is estimated  to cost our economy $530 million annually. Amazing.   Once again, as Ronald Reagan used to say:         Government is not the solution, government is the problem.    This is a regulation in search of a problem.   Madam Chair, I support the gentleman's amendment.    Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Chairwoman, I rise today in support of this commonsense  amendment that will protect American jobs and the economy but prohibit  funds from being used for implementing the Obama administration's  flawed social cost of carbon, or SCC, valuation.   This job-killing and unlawful guidance sneakily attempts to pave the  way for cap-and-trade-like mandates. Congress and the American people  have repeatedly rejected cap-and-trade proposals.   Knowing that he could not lawfully enact a carbon tax plan, President  Obama attempted to circumvent Congress by playing loose and fast with  the Clean Air Act to unilaterally implement this unlawful new  requirement under the guise of guidance.   The social cost of carbon is not based on science, and the models can  be easily manipulated to arrive at whatever conclusion is desired.   Once again, when we look at carbon, it is a nutrient for plants. To  say otherwise is disrespectful. Once again, we play loose and fast with  sound science.   So, in regards to this, the House has decisively voted a dozen times  to block or defund and oppose the social cost of carbon. I support the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, we had the same discussion yesterday. Once  again, these are offshore leases that are part of the American public's  domain, not the State of South Carolina or California or Massachusetts  or Florida. I understand that application.   But, once again, we also have heard that we want to have responsible  renewable energy, so we are actually predisposing no seismic aspect.  Well, how do you actually look at moorings in regard to subsurface  anchors if you didn't use seismic activity? That is contradicting all  the way around the aspect here.   Once again, this just shows that we want nothing of the sort: no  seismic, no wind, no solar, no oil and gas. That is unbelievable.   If this is the kind of attitude that we want going forward, those in  Arizona and the Western States that have public lands ought to be  getting a lot more say in those applications.    And when we start looking at it, maybe what we ought to  do, if we are talking about oil spills, one of the worst ways to  actually import oil is through boats. So maybe we ought to disallow  ships, because a ship that has an accident is one oil spill away from  anywhere.   So this just begs my indifference in regards to what the heck we are  trying to do here. It is looking at our assets. We have a due diligence  to the American people to look at those assets for public assets.                                time  1600     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, even  though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I have been sitting on the  floor. I sat in the House Committee on Natural Resources yesterday and  heard this assault on oil and gas. So I want to remind everybody that  the only mechanism to fund LWCF is actually these funds from the Outer  Continental Shelf oil and gas.   It is amazing. It is absolutely amazing that we have this rhetorical  conversation on the House floor.   So we are against adding any access to know what the resource  actually is by seismic. We are responsible on behalf of these resources  to the American public. Yes, the American public actually owns these  jurisdictions. And what we are doing is we are leveraging as that  opportunity to fund LWCF.   Be careful, Will Robinson, what you are asking for.   Those responsible applications, we heard it over and over from the  gentleman from Louisiana. Once again, these are an asset of the  American people, not South Carolina, not Florida, not California, not  Massachusetts. So responsible applications here, we have got to be  taking in good stewardship.   So with that in mind, I caution everybody that LWCF is the only  mechanism for funding. The only mechanism for funding is these Outer  Continental Shelf oil and gas leases.   These are responsible aspects, and they actually know what the  resources are. You are going to need seismic, if you are going to look  at alternative energy aspects, particularly wind, in regards to  permanent moorings.   So from that standpoint, I just offer a cautionary plea. Be careful  what you ask for. You may end up having no funding at all.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting Chair. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, we don't need a moratorium off the coast of  California. We actually need a resurgence in domestic energy  development offshore.   I heard from the gentleman that the last oil spill was in 1969. Let's  see, it is 2019. Fifty years later, technology has been much different.   While the local demand for oil in California has dropped over the  last 40 years, foreign dependence has increased from 5 percent to 57  percent.   In 2018, California imported 135 million barrels of oil from Saudi  Arabia alone. According to the national offshore energy industry,  leasing in the 240 million acres of currently off-limits areas would  support an additional 165,000 jobs and inject $15 billion in annual  contributions to the economy.   There are already 23 active oil platforms in Federal waters adjacent  to California. Once again, let me repeat, there are 23 active oil  platforms in Federal waters adjacent to California. These platforms  produced nearly 17,000 barrels of oil per day in 2016 and  [[Page H4976]]  brought in $32.8 million in total royalties in fiscal year 2016. In a  State that is importing 57.5 percent of its refined oil from foreign  nations, it is imperative that we take the opportunity to utilize  domestic energy supply.   Once again, let's highlight that: 57.5 percent is from overseas,  which is much dirtier than what we produce here. If we are concerned  about climate change and emissions, we ought to be importing less and  looking at what we actually do.   Last but not least, I would like to remind everybody that we just had  a conversation on the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is funded  exclusively by Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas. Once again, the  people who don't want this for their States, maybe they should turn  down LWCF funding because it seems contradictory to the conversation.   Once again, I remind my colleagues that Federal waters belong to the  U.S. people, not the States of California, Florida, South Carolina, or  Massachusetts. We have a due diligence to look at the management of  those resources.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, yes, I am landlocked by California, but you  know the old adage. I am waiting for oceanfront property in Arizona, as  the song goes.   Once again, let's take a look at this. When we start talking about  offshore assets for the Outer Continental Shelf, there is less  jurisdiction with regard to that versus what we do on-shore. If we are  giving this type of leverage to States with offshore assets, we ought  to be giving those States like Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and  Montana more jurisdictions because the law is better on their side than  it is with those on offshore.   Once again, I find it interesting that we have a dichotomy here. We  are all for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but we are unwilling  to look at the resources it takes and where they are derived from to  make sure that that is permanently, in perpetuity, funded.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, the EPA's announcement in late December  intended to revise the cost-benefit findings behind the MATS aspects  and benefits. The Obama-era EPA's own estimate of the cost implementing  MATS exceeded its estimate of benefits by 1,233 to 2,400 times, an  absurdity papered over by the accounting trick of double counting as  co-benefits reductions in non-mercury emissions as though these  reductions were already achieved under other regulations.   The financial costs of this implementation are between $4 to $5  million annually--no, I am sorry--$9.5 billion annually.   Once again, the rule hasn't even been put out yet.   Don't you think we ought to be waiting to find out what the actual  rule is before we say no go?   Because we don't even know where it goes.   We also want to take a look at catastrophic wildfires. Catastrophic  wildfires are the largest aspect in regard to contaminants into the air  as we witnessed in hazardous breathing times, particularly in Montana  and California. So from that standpoint, I urge a ``no'' vote against  this one because it is premature to actually what the rule is coming  out.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
