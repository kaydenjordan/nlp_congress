 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman very much.   Madam Speaker, 800,000 American workers, 800,000 workers in our  Federal workforce, have either been sent home and furloughed with no  check or told to report to work with no check, with no payment.   I have got air traffic controllers living in my district, Madam  Speaker, who have had to take money out of their kids' 529 college  funds. They have had to take money out of their own retirement funds in  order to pay their family bills, and there is a 10 percent penalty for  doing that. Who is going to pay them back the 10 percent? Is the  President of the United States going to do that?   What about my constituents? I have tens of thousands of Federal  workers. What about my constituents who are being forced to put their  mortgage on a credit card this month? Who is going to pay them back?   And what about the dishonor and the humiliation brought on our  government by this?   The President of the United States didn't do this to hundreds of  thousands of workers in Putin's Russia or in Orban's Hungary or in  Duterte's Philippines. This is our people that he did this to.                                time  1115    These are our workers, who he sent home with no paycheck. People are  texting me. They are emailing me their paystubs today, which say zero  dollars gross, zero dollars net, after having worked 40 or 50 hours  this week.   I have scientists in my district who are working on preventing  outbreaks of E. coli contamination, salmonella, insect infestation of  our food supply, and they have been told not to go to work.   Madam Speaker, this is an outright outrage and a scandal. At the very  least, we can pass, on a unanimous, bipartisan basis, this legislation  to try to repair the damage by saying that every Federal worker will  get back every penny that he or she is owed by the United States  Government.   We need to make sure that, if this ever happens again, if the  President ever holds the Federal workforce, the government, and the  people hostage again, that the Federal workforce will not be the ones  who have to pay for it. We should pass this immediately, and we should  reopen the government immediately.
