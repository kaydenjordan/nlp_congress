 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of an  extraordinary group of people.   Yesterday was National Maritime Day, and I rise to bring attention to  the House legislation that I recently introduced, H.R. 5879, the World  War II Merchant Marine Congressional Gold Medal. I hear the cheers from  all of my colleagues here on the floor as they line up to support this  piece of legislation.   Last year, my colleague, Susan Brooks, my good Republican friend,  introduced this legislation. I am grateful to her and to Congressman   Don Young of Alaska for their support of this legislation this year.  This bill has obvious bipartisan support and bicameral support. Senator  Murkowski of Alaska is leading this bill in what some call the upper  Chamber; we simply call it the Senate.   During World War II, our Armed Forces relied upon the Merchant Marine  to ferry supplies, cargo, manpower and womanpower into both theaters of  operation: the Pacific and the Atlantic. They paid a heavy price for  their service.   The Merchant Marine casualty rate was the highest among all branches  of the U.S. Armed Forces. An estimated 8,300 merchant mariners lost  their life during the war, and around 12,000 were wounded. But these  brave men and women, who put their lives on the line to sustain our  Armed Forces, were not even given veteran status until 1988, much less  public recognition for their invaluable service.   Today, I am going to meet with a group of World War II Merchant  Marine veterans: Charles Mills from Texas, age 97; Eugene Barner from  Kansas, age 92; and Robert Weagant from Illinois, age 92. I will also  be meeting with families of other veterans who are no longer with us. I  am meeting them to hear firsthand their stories of bravery and peril in  the service of our Armed Forces. They deserve the recognition of a  Congressional Gold Medal, and that is precisely what this legislation  will do.   I urge all of the Members of this House and the Senate to give our  Merchant Marine veterans and their families the honor they deserve.   I will also be discussing with these gentlemen and their families a  piece of legislation that we introduced the day before yesterday, we  call it the Energizing the American Shipbuilding Industry--taking a  small percentage of the oil and natural gas that we are now exporting  and requiring that that be on American-built ships with American  mariners, so that we can maintain the extraordinary tradition of  bravery and service that the World War II mariners showed this Nation.   If we are successful in passing this legislation, we will be building  some 50 ships, or more, in our shipyards all across America, providing  jobs in the upper Midwest, where they build the great engines for these  ships: the pumps, the pipes, and the electronic systems. We would also  be providing some 1,800 jobs for the next generation of mariners.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not only to support the  Congressional Gold Medal for the World War II mariners, but support our  effort to create mariners for the next generation, which, hopefully,  will not be a war but, if it is, we know that we can rely on them, just  as we did in World War II.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).
