 Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago, I declared this  year the year of the child. In the course of that moment, I have seen  the abuse of children around the world.   In Ukraine, Russia has stolen 700,000 children, all the way to the  United States of America and the State of Texas, where the State  education agency is attempting to take over the seventh-largest school  district in the Nation, the Houston Independent School District, where  the children have been performing at their very best, even in spite of  the pandemic.   There has been a law that was passed that suggested that if the  schools had a number of years of what we call failing grades, then it  would immediately throw them into the hands of the State agency that  has no capability of running a school system; no capability of dealing  with teachers and raising their salaries; no capability of dealing with  parents, support staff, and excellent children and their performance.   I am asking the U.S. Department of Education and President Biden to  step in to protect school districts across America and to keep them  from the political football that happens with Republican Governors who  are attempting to make an example of these school districts.   These children are brilliant. They can learn. They are majority- minority, and they can learn. I believe it is important that school  districts be allowed to teach with the teachers' and parents' lead and  not to be taken over by a board of managers that answers to no one.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from  Florida and the gentleman from Illinois for their distinguished  leadership of the CBC Special Order and to acknowledge our chairman,   Steve Horsford, and the leadership to be able to acknowledge a very  important moment.   Mr. Speaker, this is a time that draws memories, it draws emotions,  and it draws a lot of tears.   I am very privileged and honored to have worked for the Southern  Christian Leadership Conference as a college student in a program  called SCOPE. How fortunate I was in the aftermath of the assassination  of Dr. Martin Luther King to meet his foot soldiers, which included  James Orange, Hosea Williams, Andy Young, Reverend Dr. Ralph Abernathy,  and a young man by the name of Jesse Louis Jackson, who we are  privileged and honored to be able to not only know but to have his  wisdom and his brilliance in leadership even with us today.   Amongst those great leaders was a young man as well by the name of  John Lewis, who continued, in his admiration for Dr. King, his own  journey and fight. He was in the Freedom Riders, beaten at that time,  as fellow riders, who did not look like him, were beaten bloody and  even lost their life. Many Americans don't recall that history. Some  call it the second civil war and the aftermath the second  reconstruction.                                time  2015    There were many people who were willing to sacrifice their lives  because of the right to vote--the right to vote, which was denied. The  amazing aspect of their fight was that it was nonviolent.   They trained extensively to suffer at lunch counters. They were spit  upon, beaten, hit in the head, pulled off the stools. There were  multiple movements that could contribute to this question of civil  rights and voting rights.   Many people were reminded of the ``I Am a Man'' campaign to try to  bring dignity to garbage workers and sanitation workers that Dr. King  fought for in Memphis, Tennessee, where he saw his untimely and brutal  death.   This weekend was a commemoration of Bloody Sunday. Bloody Sunday  actually happened on March 7, 1965.   Mr. Speaker, we are here on this day, the actual March 7, 1965. It  was a group of nonviolent churchgoers, one might say, that walked  across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to be able to make a move from Selma,  Alabama, to Montgomery to show the State of Alabama and then-Governor  Wallace, a raging segregationist, who later was reformed and reborn--to  be able to say that they needed the right to vote or to show our  President, our southern President, Lyndon Baines Johnson, that they  needed the right to vote.   It was that march that was bloody. John Lewis was beaten near death,  and others were beaten. Preceding that, Jimmie Lee Jackson was shot  dead.   A little girl named Sheyann, who was 8 years old, was there this  weekend. She was there, as we were all there, in memory of John Lewis,  Martin King, Hosea Williams, many other foot soldiers, and the women  that were involved as well from Alabama and the surrounding South.   We gathered together, Members of Congress, the Congressional Black  Caucus, Cabinet officers, and the President of the United States, to  say that Congress has not done its job.   The demise of the Voting Rights Act started with the Shelby case in  2013 in Alabama. It was simply a case of a city council person trying  to get and make sure that he had fairness with every person having a  right to vote. Unfortunately, the case went up to the United States  Supreme Court, and the arguments were shocking to most of us.   It was: Why do we need this? We have thousands of African-American  elected officials. Yes, they had been gained by the 1965 Voting Rights  Act, but it was clear that if you are able to get rid of polio because  we have the polio vaccine, as one Justice said--as I recall, it was  Justice Ginsburg--then why would you get rid of the polio vaccine just  because you have been able to get rid of polio because of the vaccine?  Why would you get rid of the Voting Rights Act, particularly section 5,  just because you have found some progress?   Mr. Speaker, I can tell you that as we have seen the loss of the  Voting Rights Act in 2013, we have not been able to reauthorize a  simple bill that was four or five pages long that simply says that you  have the right to vote unfettered. It doesn't have color in it. It  indicates no person can be discriminated against.   Yet, we have seen a mountain of discriminatory laws, voter  suppression; purging; gerrymandering; not getting a drink of water;  cutting out hours, if you will, with respect to voting, making sure  that people who work night shifts can't vote, people who work hourly  wages can't vote; no same-day registration. Here we are in 2023.   Mr. Speaker, I would offer to say that we are long overdue with the  Voting Rights Act. It is really crafted in the Constitution because the  15th Amendment said we have the right to vote unfettered without  discrimination; the 14th Amendment, equal protection of the law; and,  of course, the 13th Amendment, so personal to many of us of African  descent and those who are the descendants of enslaved Africans. It was  the 13th Amendment where  [[Page H1139]]  the United States said for once that slavery was over.   Voting rights capture the very essence of who we are as a democracy.   To Selma, I thank you for being another cradle of democracy. For  those marches of those individuals and children, Mr. Speaker, were  utilized--it was a children's march that was utilized in order to  ensure that we could vote.   As a Member of the United States Congress and the Judiciary  Committee, I have been part of a bipartisan reauthorization of the  Voting Rights Act. It was in 2006, and it extended the Voting Rights  Act for 25 years. We passed the P.L. 109-246, H.R. 9.   It is well known that large numbers of Members of the House-- bipartisan--voted for the Voting Rights Act, and 98 Members of the  Senate. This is the reauthorization. We also renamed it the Fannie Lou  Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act  Reauthorization. Ultimately, at a later time, we added the Honorable  Barbara Jordan and a number of other Texans who were engaged in voting  empowerment, and we did it in a bipartisan manner.   It troubles me that we cannot come together and pass a voting rights  bill that does nothing but allow Americans to vote. The Shelby case has  dismantled the infrastructure of safe voting, constitutional privileges  of equal protection of the law, and of course, the fear of voting-- people being arrested just for activating the right to vote, not being  cautioned that they may not have had their registration right but put  in jail--outright intimidation.   It is important for us to be on the floor today to be able to  reinforce and to extend a hand of friendship and partnership. Why can't  we reauthorize this bill? Why can't the Senate accept the John Robert  Lewis Voting Enhancement Act with a new formula dealing with section 4  that deals with the formula under section 5? I am pleading with our  colleagues to do so.   It is important, as I conclude my remarks, to recognize that voting  is unfettered, and it is a choice of the American people. In this  democracy--a two-party system most often, though there are other  parties--we are either elected or unelected. That is the greatness of  America.   Over the years, we have accepted the peaceful transfer of power until  that day, January 6, 2021. I hope we will never see that day again.   That is no excuse for not passing the Voting Rights Act. It is no  excuse for not recognizing that the importance of the Voting Rights Act  is wrapped up in the history of African Americans, even though voting  is for everyone. It is wrapped up in our basic history of not being  counted as a whole person in the Constitution. As slaves, we were never  able to even muster that sacred right to vote.   Landed people voted; unlanded did not. White women didn't have the  right to vote, and unlanded people did not have the right to vote, if I  might use that term.   Over the years, things changed. A brief moment of reconstruction that  was just like a blink of an eye--barely even saw it. Then we went into  the darkness of Jim Crowism and the viciousness of the Klan, which  lasted into the 20th century.   I would think with that kind of history, America, which is the  greatest country in the world and has overcome so much, would want to  be that bright and shining city on the hill, to be able to show the  world what democracy really is and what voting really is, that you can  oppress people at one point and lift them up at another point. You can  oppress the descendants of enslaved Africans. You can oppress slaves.  You can do it into the 1800s and into the 1900s. Yet, you can do  better.   Mr. Speaker, I would also say that we must not be afraid of the kind  of words that make us a great country. Let us not be afraid of  diversity, equity, and inclusiveness. When has that ever hurt anyone?   It only says that all of us, whether you are a person of faith or  otherwise--I say all of God's children, but if you are not, it says all  Americans, patriots, have every right to be in this country with all  the benefits of the Constitution.   I do believe in the Declaration of Independence, that we all are  created equal with certain inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.   Let me also say to you, as we look at this idea of voting, African  Americans and others, Americans, have fought in every war. We have been  in every war from the Revolutionary War. We have shed blood in every  single war and conflict alongside our brothers who don't look like us.   Mr. Speaker, in my final words, we have not been able to study  slavery the way we should have. We did have Juneteenth. I hope that we  will have the whole Nation celebrating Juneteenth, a Federal holiday  that acknowledges the time of slavery and late time of release out of  Texas 2 years later.   What we have not done is we have not passed H.R. 40, a simple bill,  just a commission to study slavery and develop reparation proposals.  What would that be? Just an analysis of the economic, social,  psychological, health, and educational impact of slavery in this Nation  and why the trajectory shows that the indicia of how African Americans  are today in America is related to the connection of slavery.   Every discipline will show that our numbers are down. We should not  be judged by--wealthy this person and wealthy that person. You need to  look at the respective communities, rural and urban, and you will find  Black people without healthcare, large numbers; without wealth, large  numbers; without psychological, scientific, and sociological analysis.  We can do something and bring this country together.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that reparations and the legislation of H.R.  40, an executive order that the President could do tomorrow, would be a  healing, restoring, and repairing time in our life.   Mr. Speaker, I conclude my remarks by citing Harriet Tubman, one of  the greatest generals we ever had, who freed many slaves, risked her  life to go back to get those who were not free. She was part of the  Underground Railroad, and it keeps me going.   Just like the words of John Lewis: Never give up, never give in,  never give out.   In the framework of freeing the slaves, if you hear the dogs, keep on  going. If you see the lights, keep on going. If you hear the noise,  keep on going.   Mr. Speaker, if you want a taste of freedom, we need to keep on  going. That is America. I hope tonight that my colleagues and those who  are viewing us will keep on going, for freedom is before us, and we  need to keep on going.   Mr. Speaker, I have said it once and I will continue to say it until  it gets done: we have to pass the Voting Rights Act, which corrects the  damage done in recent years to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and  commits the national government to protecting the right of all  Americans to vote free from discrimination and without injustices that  previously prevented them from exercising this most fundamental right  of citizenship.   We cannot have free and fair elections without this essential  legislation.   In the 58 years since its passage on this day in 1965, the Voting  Rights Act has safeguarded the right of Americans to vote and stood as  an obstacle to many of the more egregious attempts by certain states  and local jurisdictions to game the system by passing discriminatory  changes to their election laws and administrative policies.   Mr. Speaker, for most of the past 56 years, support for the Voting  Rights Act and protecting, preserving, and expanding the right to vote  of all Americans has been an issue that Americans have supported in  overwhelming numbers across the nation.   On July 9, 1965, the House passed the Voting Rights Act by a 333-85  vote, with Democrats voting 221-61 and Republicans 112-24. The House  later approved the VRA conference report on August 3 by a 328-74 vote  (Democrats 217-54, Republicans 111-20).   The Senate passed the VRA on August 4 by a 79-18 vote, with Democrats  voting 49-17 and Republicans 30-1 and this landmark legislation, P.L.  89-10, was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson as on August 6,  1965.   Five years later, on June 22, 1970, the VRA was renewed for five  years as Public Law 91-285, passing the House by a vote of 272-132 and  the Senate by a vote of 64-12.   Five years after that, on June 4, 1975, Congress extended the VRA for  seven years, enacting Public Law 94-73, with majorities of 341-70 in  the House and 77-12 in the Senate, and on June 29, 1982, a Republican- controlled Senate joined with a Democratic House  [[Page H1140]]  to pass Public Law 97-205, extending the VRA for 10 years, with the  vote in the Senate of 85-8 and the vote in the House of 389-24.   Ten years later, the bipartisan Voting Rights Language Assistance Act  was passed as Public Law 102-344 on August 26, 1992. And on July 27,  2006, the Voting Rights Act was extended for 25 years when the Congress  passed Public Law 109-246 (H.R. 9), the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks,  and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments  Act of 2006. The vote for H.R. 9 was 390-33 in the House and 98-0 in  the Senate.   Every extension of the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by a  Republican President, from Richard Nixon to Gerald Ford to Ronald  Reagan to George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush.   This chain of bipartisan support for voting rights stood solid and  unbreakable until the Supreme Court's horrendous decision in Shelby  County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013).   Between 1982 and June 25, 2013, Section 5 of the VRA stopped more  than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes in their tracks, including 107  discriminatory changes in Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I was a member of this Committee in 2006 when, led by  Republican Chairman James Sensenbrenner, it compiled a 15,000 page  record documenting the continuing need for the Voting Rights Act, and  especially its Section 5 preclearance provisions, and reported  favorably H.R. 9, the legislation reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act  for 25 years, which in turned passed the House by an overwhelming 390- 33 vote and passed the Senate by a unanimous 98-0 vote.   I was never prouder to be an American and a Member of Congress than I  was the day I attended White House signing ceremony where President  George W. Bush signed the bill into law.   So, it really should not have been necessary and urgent for us to be  here, as the Voting Rights Act was authorized until 2031.   But on June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v.  Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA,  and paralyzed the application of the VRA's Section 5 preclearance  requirements, which protect minority voting rights where voter  discrimination has historically been the worst.   The current conservative Supreme Court majority has simply never  understood, or refuses to accept, the fundamental importance of the  right to vote, free of discriminatory hurdles and obstacles.   It was predicted at the time by me and other defenders of the  precious right to vote that the Supreme Court's misguided and naive  decision would usher in a wave of state and local initiatives intended  to suppress and nullify the rights of black Americans, persons of  color, young adults, and marginalized communities to exercise the most  basic act in the political process: voting.   As we have seen in recent elections, this prediction has tragically  come to pass.   To increase transparency and to ensure there is time for effective  remedial action, the Voting Rights Act should be strengthened by adding  a new section that requires each State and subdivision to identify all  new laws, regulations, or policies that include voting qualifications  or prerequisites to voting covered by the Act and ensure that no  covered practice is implemented unless it has been precleared.   It is useful, Mr. Speaker, to recount how we arrived at this day.   The reason it is important to review this history is so that we  always remember the true and fundamental purpose of the Voting Rights  Act, and that was to protect and empower black Americans, who had for  two centuries been exploited, victimized, persecuted, scapegoated,  cheated, and treated with both benign and malignant neglect all because  they were excluded from participating in the political process and the  making of decisions that affected their lives.   It is interesting to note the absence of the current frantic efforts  to disenfranchise black voters and other person of color had no  antecedent in 1994, when unexpectedly Republicans won the House  majority for the first time in 40 years and majorities in several state  legislatures across the country.   Nor did it happen in the after of the 2010 elections when Republicans  recaptured the House majority after holding the White House for two  consecutive terms.   What accounts for the lack of vote suppression action then and the  desperate actions we see now?   I believe the answer is clear and simple: 29 years ago in 1994, and  as recent as 13 years ago in 2010, conservative Republicans still  believed they could compete for democratic political power fair and  square and that ideas and principles could attract majority support.   With the demographic changes and generational replacement taking  place in America, the maturation and coming of age of the beneficiaries  of the Great Society, and the rise of what social and political  scientist call the ``Obama Coalition,'' they no longer believe that.   They now hold it as an article of faith that they cannot win if they  do not cheat; instead of taking their ideas and arguments to the  voters, they have opted to change the rules so they can handpick the  voters.   They have disenfranchised voters, but voters have continuously  overcome those efforts.   Black voters in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin braved  a deadly pandemic to exercise their right to vote in an act of  political self-defense against the most corrupt, incompetent,  indifferent, and racist administration since the end of the Civil War.   In so doing, they vindicated and made prophetic the words of  President Lyndon B. Johnson, the greatest legislative strategist and  tactician of our lifetime, who saw clearly the need and power for good  of the Voting Rights Act:   ``The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for  breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which  imprison men because they are different from other men.''   Fifty-eight years ago today, in Selma, Alabama, hundreds of heroic  souls risked their lives for freedom and to secure the right to vote  for all Americans by their participation in marches for voting rights  on ``Bloody Sunday,'' ``Turnaround Tuesday,'' or the final, completed  march from Selma to Montgomery.   Those ``foot soldiers'' of Selma, brave and determined men and women,  boys and girls, persons of all races and creeds, loved their country so  much that they were willing to risk their lives to make it better, to  bring it even closer to its founding ideals.   The foot soldiers marched because they believed that all persons have  dignity and the right to equal treatment under the law, and in the  making of the laws, which is the fundamental essence of the right to  vote.   On that day, Sunday, March 7, 1965, more than 600 civil rights  demonstrators, including our beloved former colleague, the late  Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, were brutally attacked by state and  local police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they marched from Selma to  Montgomery in support of the right to vote.   ``Bloody Sunday'' was a defining moment in American history because  it crystallized for the nation the necessity of enacting a strong and  effective federal law to protect the right to vote of every American.   No one who witnessed the violence and brutally suffered by the foot  soldiers for justice who gathered at the Edmund Pettus Bridge will ever  forget it; the images are deeply seared in the American memory and  experience.   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to preventing brazen voter  discrimination violations that historically left millions of African  Americans disenfranchised.   In 1940, for example, there were less than 30,000 African Americans  registered to vote in Texas and only about 3% of African Americans  living in the South were registered to vote.   Poll taxes, literacy tests, and threats of violence were the major  causes of these racially discriminatory results.   After passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which prohibited  these discriminatory practices, registration and electoral  participation steadily increased to the point that by 2012, more than  1.2 million African Americans living in Texas were registered to vote.   In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act became law, of there  were approximately 300 African Americans in public office, including  just three in Congress.   Few, if any, African Americans held elective office anywhere in the  South.   Because of the Voting Rights Act, in 2007 there were more than 9,100  black elected officials, including 46 members of Congress, the largest  number ever.   Mr. Speaker, the Voting Rights Act opened the political process for  many of the approximately 6,000 Hispanic public officials that have  been elected and appointed nationwide, including more than 275 at the  state or federal level, 32 of whom serve in Congress.   Native Americans, Asians and others who have historically encountered  harsh barriers to full political participation also have benefited  greatly.   We must all do our part to preserve this most important legislation  because it was earned with the sacrifices and the lives of our  ancestors.   The right to vote is a ``powerful instrument that can break down the  walls of injustice'' and must be protected against attack from all  enemies, foreign and domestic, using all the legal tools at our  disposal.   I look forward to the discussion of these matters with our witnesses.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I would inquire as to how much  time is remaining.
