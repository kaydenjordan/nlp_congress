 Mr. Speaker, soon the Supreme Court will rule on the  challenge to the Texas abortion law case. The law implements the  Nation's toughest restrictions on abortions.   Signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott in May, it prohibits abortion  after a heartbeat is detected in the unborn child. This usually occurs  around 6 weeks. The law makes exceptions for medical emergencies.   The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing challenges to this bill by pro- abortion groups that want the law overturned. The upcoming ruling will  be closely watched as an indicator as to whether the Federal courts  will uphold future States' rights to implement pro-life legislation  rather than continuing to overreach their Federal court authority.   Unborn babies are human lives. All too often, abortion is referred to  as simply a medical procedure, and the sanctity of life is devalued.   At 6 weeks, an unborn child has a heartbeat of approximately 98 beats  per minute. Blood vessels begin to form in the circulatory system, and  the brain is rapidly developing. This is a human life.   By 10 weeks, an unborn baby has arms and legs, fingers and toes. The  baby's pain receptors have been developing for weeks. This is a human  life.   By 15 weeks, all the unborn baby's major organs have formed, and the  baby has a fully developed heart that pumps 26 quarts of blood per day.  The baby can feel pain.   All too often, these facts are overlooked and sidelined and not even  addressed in the issue of abortion.   It is my hope that the U.S. Supreme Court will see the merits as to  why the State of Texas heartbeat bill was implemented. According to CDC  statistics, 619,591 babies were aborted in the United States in 2018.  That is 619,591 lives that could have been the next teacher,  firefighter, parent, or President of the United States. Upholding the  heartbeat bill would save the lives of countless unborn babies, both  male and female.   Here in Congress, I continue to be the protector of life and champion  for the Hyde amendment in Federal legislation. Taxpayer money should  not be used to end the lives of innocent, defenseless babies with  beating hearts.   The right to life is our most fundamental, natural, and God-given  right. I will continue to fight to oppose pro-abortion plans to force  taxpayer funding for abortion. Your taxpayer dollars should never be  used to be funding abortion on demand.   Mr. Speaker, I believe in the sanctity of life, and I will continue  to fight for the rights of preborn babies.                            ____________________
