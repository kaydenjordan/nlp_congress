 Madam Speaker, supply chain disruptions caused by  the pandemic have contributed to rising prices across America. These  disruptions included considerable congestion at our ports last year.   In this void, the Port of Cleveland in my district, increased its  tonnage by nearly 70 percent, helping to keep goods moving across  America and beyond.   Yet, even as congestion has eased, international shipping companies  have been charging extremely high fees to transport goods.   This is driving up costs on store shelves and hurting our small  businesses while leaving key products waiting on our docks.   Last week, the House passed, and President Biden signed into law the  bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform Act. The law cracks down on these  unfair shipping fees.   This will help goods get in and out of docks like the Port of  Cleveland quicker, it will reduce costs for families, and it will level  the playing field for our businesses. I call that a win-win.                            ____________________
