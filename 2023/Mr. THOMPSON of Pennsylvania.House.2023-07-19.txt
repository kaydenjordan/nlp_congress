 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the month of July as National Ice Cream Month and celebrate  America's favorite frozen dairy treat.   As the weather gets hotter and the days get longer, there truly is  nothing like a bowl of sweet, smooth ice cream to help turn down the  heat. Dedicated in the United States by the late President Ronald  Reagan, National Ice Cream Month serves to boost spirits and cool  temperatures, especially on a day as warm as this one.   Not just a staple of the American diet, American ice cream also  boosts local communities. Keep an eye out for the more than half of ice  cream shops in the United States that are family owned and have been in  operation for more than 50 years.   Madam Speaker, you can support local scoop shops the entire month  throughout the summer. Enjoy the sweetest month of the year by  supporting local businesses and industry.                            ____________________
