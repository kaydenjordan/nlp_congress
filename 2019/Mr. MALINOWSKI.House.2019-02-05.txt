 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the memory of John  Lee, a resident of New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District who  passed away on January 25 after waging a courageous battle with cancer.   Mr. Lee immigrated to America in 1987 and worked day and night to  build a better life for himself and his family. In 2000, he became a  citizen, and like many immigrants, he understood the meaning of civic  duty and the importance of a single person's vote better than many of  us whose families have been here for generations.   So when he was faced with a cancer diagnosis, his first thought was  not to sink into despair. He simply asked: ``What's next?''   As his diagnosis progressed, Mr. Lee began to understand the pressing  need for legislation to protect people with preexisting conditions, and  the question of, ``What's next?'' was answered.   He spent his remaining time fighting to help make our healthcare  system more just and to make America, as he put it, a Nation of us, not  of me.   Today, I am truly honored to be joined at the State of the Union by  his siblings. Mr. Speaker, John Lee has already helped to shape our  understanding of what must be done to make healthcare a human right for  all Americans. May his legacy be that we have finally done it.                            ____________________
