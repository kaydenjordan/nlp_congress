 Mr. Chair, I appreciate all the great work that my  colleague, Congressman Conyers, has done not only on this issue, for  the many years you have served distinguishably in this Congress, but  thank you so much for yielding some time.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1695, the Register of Copyrights  Selection and Accountability Act of 2017.   I represent the San Fernando Valley, which is in the Los Angeles  area. For my constituents, for the families in my district, copyright  protections are not an abstract philosophical issue, ladies and  gentlemen. The families in my district depend on strong copyright  protections in order to earn a living, to feed their family. They work  in film and television studios and in music publishing. They are  artists, set designers, producers, union drivers; they work on lots,  and they work in every aspect supporting this incredible industry.   There are 127,000 film and television production jobs in Los Angeles  County. According to a recent report, the core copyright industries-- film, television, music, video games, and publishing--make possible 5.5  million jobs and bring in $1.2 trillion of gross domestic product to  the American economy.   Good copyright laws and regulations mean jobs and whether or not a  family can put food on the table and a roof over their heads. We need  to give the Copyright Office the respect and authority it deserves as  the overseer of 5.5 million American jobs.   I have heard from my constituents for years about the need to empower  the Copyright Office to keep up with  [[Page H2871]]  the industry and the technology changes. This is not a new debate,  ladies and gentlemen.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and to  continue to stand up for American copyright jobs.
