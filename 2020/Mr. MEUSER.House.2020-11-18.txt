 Mr. Speaker, many of the voters in Pennsylvania and in my  district are rightfully upset and concerned about the irregular actions  which occurred in the past election. There are valid reasons for the  collective feeling of disenfranchisement and of distrust stemming from  various election processes and procedural changes which were outside of  statute.   Thousands--no--millions in Pennsylvania have a feeling of intense  frustration and believe that their constitutional rights have been  violated. To start, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court granted a 3-day  extension for late-arriving ballots, usurping the authority of the  State legislature and contradicting the U.S. Constitution, which  clearly states: ``The times, places, and manner of holding elections  shall be prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof.''   These constitutional authorities are not fair-weather laws, despite  the challenges posed by the pandemic. The highly irregular actions of  the Pennsylvania Supreme Court resulted in the unlawful counting of  over 10,000 ballots that arrived after the statutory required time of 8  p.m. on election day--nobody disputes this--mitigating an accurate  ballot count and, at the same time, fueling great distrust in the  process.   Second, there are serious disputes over how individual mail-in  ballots with technical errors were handled across the Commonwealth.  Pennsylvania State law dictates that mail-in  [[Page H5874]]  ballots must be signed, dated, and included in a secrecy envelope, and  that ballots that are missing required information and/or signatures  should be disqualified or, at a minimum, authenticated.   Just hours before polls opened, the secretary of state of  Pennsylvania issued inconsistent and contradictory guidance, giving  Pennsylvania counties the authority to decide whether to reject ballots  that contained discrepancies or take additional measures to correct  them. This happened. This is a highly irregular thing to do.   As a result, Philadelphia, Montgomery, Allegheny, and Bucks County,  four of the largest counties in Pennsylvania, allowed literally  thousands and thousands of ballots to be fixed or cured, a measure not  pursued by most other counties and which violated State election law.   Third, Republican poll watchers in Philadelphia were kept at an  unreasonable distance to observe the pre-canvassing and canvassing of  ballots. Even after a court ruling allowed poll watchers closer access,  Philadelphia officials actually appealed the order to the Pennsylvania  Supreme Court.   Why would local election officials make the process blatantly more  restrictive to poll watchers, some of whom resorted to using binoculars  to do their jobs?   This, too, actually happened. An estimated 687,000 ballots were  counted during this time of no lawfully required poll watchers. Such  actions, Mr. Speaker, raise very legitimate doubts surrounding  transparency and accountability of Presidential election.   Further adding to the frustration and distrust felt by millions in  Pennsylvania, the media projected the outcome while such valid disputes  were outstanding before due process took place and well before judicial  rulings were made.   In Pennsylvania, the cases before the courts could involve tens of  thousands of ballots, of votes, an amount, if deemed unlawful, would  mandate an automatic recount. In a close election, counting all legal  votes takes time, yet it is absolutely essential to assure to a  candidate, but more so to the voters, that the vote count be honest,  lawful, and fair.    The implications for our country are significant now and beyond 2020.  Along with a fair election of the United States of America President,  what is at stake here is the integrity of our election process and the  faith the American people have in it.                            ____________________
