 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of the International Human Rights Defense Act, which I am honored to  have joined with Senator Markey and Representative Jacobs in  introducing just this week.   Now, this is the first bill I have introduced as a Member of Congress  and it is an issue that is very personal to me. As the first LGBTQ+  immigrant to serve in this body, I know how important it is for the  U.S. to stand for human rights around the world.   Right now, there are nearly 70 countries around the world where  LGBTQ+ people are criminalized just for being themselves. In 11  countries, you can be executed for loving your partner, and we know  that discrimination exists all across the country and the globe.   Here in the U.S., even our freedoms are being rolled back as we see  what happened just this last week in this very Chamber attacking trans  people. Our bill ensures that regardless of who sits in the Oval  Office, our foreign policy should always reflect a strong commitment to  human rights.   This bill permanently creates an LGBTQ+ global envoy office at  ambassador-rank level and codifies numerous goals and initiatives  within the State Department. LGBTQ+ rights are human rights.                            ____________________
