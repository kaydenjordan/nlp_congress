 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the firefighters of  Station 9 in west Little Rock, Arkansas, for their selfless service  during the horrific tornado that struck our city and region in March.   The firefighters of Station 9 were standing in their building when it  was directly hit by the tornado, completely destroying it.   Despite their fire station being in ruins, they immediately got to  work clearing debris, providing emergency assistance, and serving as an  important beacon of hope for those in need in that neighborhood.   Their tremendous efforts were a critical component in helping my  hometown recover from one of the worst storms in recent history.   I am proud to honor the brave firefighters for their dedicated work  in the face of destruction and ruin. Their service stands as a model of  resilience and strength for our entire State and Nation.                          Recognizing Heide Harrell     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my good friend,  Heide  [[Page H4958]]  Harrell, on being a recipient of the Public Relations Society of  America, Arkansas Chapter's 2023 Crystal Award.   Heide and I worked together at Arkansas-based Delta Trust and Banking  Corporation, a Little Rock-based banking, trust, and investment  company, where she was the communications and marketing officer.   Today, she serves as the vice president and communications director  at Stephens, one of the largest privately held independent investment  firms off Wall Street.   Just a few years ago, Heide was selected as an honoree in the 27th  class of Arkansas Business 40 Under 40.   Heide is truly an inspiration to all through her hard work and  leadership. Mr. Speaker, I thank Heide for being a great friend and a  creative force for good across our community.                          Recognizing Madison Murphy     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a longtime friend  and a terrific civic leader in our State, Madison Murphy, on the  occasion of Highway 167 from El Dorado to Little Rock being dedicated  in his honor.   Madison has been an inspiration to all Arkansans for many years and  has received numerous awards and recognition for his work throughout  the State.   He has been named to the Arkansas Business 40 Under 40 list and named  Arkansas' Tourism Person of the Year for his financial support and  inspiration in the creation of the Murphy Arts District in El Dorado.   Madison has also served as chairman of the Arkansas Highway  Commission from 2003 to 2013, where he championed the widening of the  Highway 167 corridor to provide a four-lane connection between south  and central Arkansas, improving roadway safety, mobility, and transit.   Throughout his leadership as chairman, a temporary half-cent sales  tax was implemented that funded 31 highway widening projects to improve  connectivity across the State.   I applaud Mr. Murphy for his leadership and service to the State of  Arkansas and congratulate him on this recognition.                        Control Deficits and Spending     Mr. Speaker, last Saturday, this House--all the Democrats  and 31 Republicans--rejected a stopgap spending measure, which would  have lowered spending for the 4 weeks of the continuing resolution  period; secured the border with important needs, a critical element  that every day we see and hear from our constituents; and established a  commission to tackle the biggest challenge this House and this Nation  has, which is that 70 percent of our spending, Mr. Speaker, is not  voted on on this House floor. It is on autopilot--mandatory spending.   These mandatory spending programs require bipartisan attention to  reform them. We can keep the promises made to the American people on  Social Security and Medicare, but we need to get our fiscal house in  order.   I support that commission, and I was so disappointed that 31  Republicans joined the Democrats to reject it.   Now, in this period of 45 days, as we continue to look for the most  conservative spending policies that we can achieve across this House  floor and in the Senate, let's be committed that we will have a  bipartisan commission on debt and deficit and get this spending and  these deficits under control.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10 a.m. on Friday, October 6,  2023.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 3 o'clock and 24 minutes  p.m.), on Wednesday, October 4, 2023, (legislative day of Tuesday,  October 3, 2023) under its previous order, the House adjourned until  Friday, October 6, 2023, at 10 a.m.  [[Page H4980]]                                ____________________
