 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  [[Page H2346]]  support of H.R. 1065, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act that just  passed this House of Representatives.   Pregnancy discrimination holds working parents back and threatens  financial stability, with women of color being disproportionately  harmed by the lack of workplace protections.   It is long past time we ensure that every worker is entitled to  reasonable accommodations to support a healthy pregnancy.   We just celebrated Mother's Day. What if, in addition to flowers one  day a year, we make sure that during pregnancy, workers have fair  working conditions and are never in the position of risking their  safety to continue providing for themselves and their families?   This bipartisan bill simply requires reasonable accommodations for  pregnant workers, like adequate breaks, and protects them from  discrimination that can drive them from the workplace. No pregnant  worker should have to choose between their and their baby's health or  their job.                            ____________________
