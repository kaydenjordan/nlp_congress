 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  year's National Defense Authorization Act. This is a product of  bipartisan work, from all across Congress, and especially within our  Armed Services Committee.   It is a historic investment in our defense. It makes a strong step  forward in our important priorities within the Pacific, for some of our  most challenging areas of the world, the investments in the Pacific;  the continuing assistance to Ukraine; as well as making advancements in  shipbuilding and preventing the decommissioning of some ships and  platforms that remain relevant in this very challenging time.   We can and should continue to do more in the future, and I trust my  colleagues to make those investments as we move forward.   As I wrap up my term here on the Armed Services Committee and in the  House, I thank the committee staff on both sides of the aisle, as well  as my staff in my congressional office and district office, for their  unrelenting focus on the issues that are covered in the NDAA. I am  proud to say that we had 23 items in this year's bill that provide  significant, tangible results for our national defense, for the Navy,  and for the Hampton Roads region.
