 Mr. Speaker, this morning I was at Penn  State University, a great land grant university, for the inaugural  conference of the Consortium to Combat Substance Abuse. Penn State has  brought together a diverse group of stakeholders to address the largest  public health crisis of our lifetime: the opioid and substance abuse  epidemic.   This group will draw on the expertise of researchers, educators, and  practitioners from Penn State campuses across the Commonwealth to  develop and implement effective programs, policies, and practices aimed  at preventing and treating addiction and its spillover effects on  children, families, and our communities.   Pennsylvania has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic, especially our  rural communities, though no household is immune.   On Saturday, Americans had the opportunity to protect their  communities and prevent the spread of addiction by safely disposing of  expired, unwanted, and unused prescription drugs, thanks to the Drug  Enforcement Administration's 17th Annual National Prescription Drug  Take Back Day.   It is encouraging to see communities working together to slow the  spread of the opioid epidemic. It is my hope that through increased  awareness and action at all levels we can eradicate it once and for  all.                            ____________________
