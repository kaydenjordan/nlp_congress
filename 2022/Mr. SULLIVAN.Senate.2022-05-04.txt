 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, I call up my motion to instruct  conferees, which is at the desk.    Madam President, as recently as the early 1980s, our  Nation produced the vast majority of the critical minerals and  renewable energy technology we use in America but not anymore.  Unfortunately, Russia and particularly China have a stranglehold on  most of these critical minerals and clean energy technology that our  Nation needs.   To make matters worse, Madam President, some of these critical  minerals and materials we are importing, like solar panels and EV  batteries, are processed and manufactured in China using forced labor  in some of the worst environmental standards in the world.   Madam President, may I have 30 seconds to complete my statement?    We can change this, Madam President. We must change  this.   My motion to instruct is simple. Any renewable energy project  receiving Federal funds cannot use materials, technologies, or critical  minerals from  [[Page S2317]]  China or Russia--simple, commonsense, humane, and in the interest of  America's workers and our national defense.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes.
