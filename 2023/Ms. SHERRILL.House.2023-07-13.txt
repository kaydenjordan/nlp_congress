 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to fight for the fundamental  rights of servicewomen and military families as they come under attack  by the extreme Members of this legislative body.   When our servicemen and -women joined the Armed Forces prior to the  Dobbs decision last June, they did so with the understanding that they  and their families would receive comprehensive, high-quality healthcare  services regardless of where they were stationed. That includes, what  was a constitutionally guaranteed right at the time most joined,  abortion care, no matter the State in which their base was located.   There are now 16 States that restrict access to abortion care at 16  weeks or less. Just this week, Iowa passed a 6-week ban. The  servicewomen and military families serving in every one of those States  are now facing a completely different healthcare landscape than when  they signed up to serve.   According to one study, women in States with abortion bans are nearly  three times more likely to die during pregnancy, childbirth, or soon  after giving birth. These are the conditions our servicewomen and  military families are facing when they are assigned to serve on  military bases across this country.   In fact, since the Dobbs decision last year, 46 percent of  servicemembers no longer have access to abortion care.   We can state fact after fact about the disturbing health outcomes for  women in certain States or the scope of this issue after Roe v. Wade  was overturned.   Today, I want to go beyond the numbers and share the personal and  human impact of these anti-abortion laws.   In Texas, Amanda Zurawski was 18 weeks pregnant when her water broke,  putting her at high risk for developing a life-threatening infection.  Doctors told Amanda that her life was in danger and the fetus was going  to die. The doctors could not provide the medical care she needed  because their hands were tied by Texas law.   Because she was denied an abortion, Amanda eventually developed  sepsis and nearly died. Her ability to get pregnant in the future may  be damaged. Amanda survived and testified before the United States  Senate in April about this harrowing experience where the laws of her  home State of Texas nearly killed her.   Around 120,000 servicemembers are currently serving in Texas alone.  On top of that number, think of the number of family members living  there with them. Our servicemembers sign up to serve our country with  the understanding that one day they may be called upon to make the  ultimate sacrifice. No servicemember should have to accept a reality  where they could die as a result of the State laws where they are  stationed.   In the wake of the Dobbs decision, the Department of Defense  recognized that abortion is a time-sensitive procedure and access  should not be delayed for members or military families. They moved  swiftly to put in place policies that ensure servicewomen living in  highly restrictive States could travel to another State to receive the  healthcare they need. This is the bare minimum our government can do to  support and protect the women who signed up to serve our Nation.   That is why I offered an amendment to this year's NDAA to codify this  basic policy. My amendment was rejected, and instead, the majority in  this House is moving forward with Representative Ronny Jackson's  amendment that does the exact opposite.   This extremist, anti-healthcare, anti-servicemember amendment is  dangerous and must be defeated.   Throughout the entire NDAA process, from the markup to the current  consideration by the House, far right Members of this legislative body  have tried to use the defense budget--a historically bipartisan, must- pass piece of legislation--to force their extreme agenda on our  servicemembers and our country.   They are attacking servicewomen, LGBTQ+ servicemembers, immigrant  servicemembers, and more. Why are they using the defense budget for  this?   Because they know they can't get these highly unpopular policies  passed otherwise. America is not on their side.   We cannot let them play politics with our national security. As I  stand here before you, every flag officer promotion is being held up by  Senator Tuberville to promote his extreme rightwing assault on women. A  gentleman who was voted into office by less than 1.5 percent of the  Nation is now holding our national security hostage.   As Members of Congress, it is our duty and responsibility to stand up  and support our military and to ensure they have the resources and  healthcare they need to do their job and defend our Nation. I will  never back down from that duty, and I know my colleagues speaking here  today won't either.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise today in vehement opposition to the amendment  proposed by Representative Jackson.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to thank the troops  and talk about honoring their sacrifice, and that is all, frankly,  empty words and broken promises if this amendment passes.   This amendment puts servicewomen and military families' lives at risk  by denying the basic right to travel for healthcare that is no longer  available where they are stationed.   Now that Iowa passed anti-abortion restrictions, 46 percent of  servicewomen do not have access to abortion care. This would enact a  dangerous healthcare travel ban.  [[Page H3507]]    Servicemembers signed up to put their lives on the line for our  freedoms, our national values, and our constitutional rights. They did  not sign up to put their lives on the line or their spouses' lives on  the line because they cannot get access to basic care.    I was an officer in the Navy. What I learned was that good leaders  protect their squadron. They don't abandon them in favor of their own  politics or agenda.   How am I supposed to recommend to young girls in my district that  they should attend a service academy like I did when we know this  amendment would mean that they would be signing away their right to  basic healthcare?   This amendment makes our servicewomen pawns in the majority's extreme  agenda and is a steppingstone to larger bans, restrictions, and  wholesale disregard for women's healthcare in America.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Houlahan), my good friend and a tireless champion for servicewomen.    Madam Chair, I thank Ms. Houlahan for her comments, and  I strongly associate myself with the gentlewoman's remarks.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin),  one of our strongest advocates for women's healthcare.    Madam Chair, I couldn't agree more with the  gentlewoman, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Escobar), who is someone who not only fights for women in Congress but  fights against her home State's draconian laws.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield the remaining time to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow), who is my friend and a valued  colleague and partner in this effort.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
