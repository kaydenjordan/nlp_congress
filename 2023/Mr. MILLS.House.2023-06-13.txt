 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Wilbur Harry  Cline's 100th birthday and honor his service as a World War II veteran.   Eighty years ago, Wilbur answered the call to defend our freedoms and  this great Nation. He served our great Nation in the 133rd Regiment,  34th Division, in the United States Army during World War II.   He received the Purple Heart, Good Conduct Medal, and Campaign Medal  with three bronze stars for shedding his blood to defend this great  Nation. He is a true patriot who marched through liberated Rome and  faced horrendous battle conditions throughout his journey.   He is such a devout man that he is even known to have recited the  Lord's Prayer as the German 88 artillery shells rained down around him  and wounded him in 1944.   While he does not think of himself as a hero, he is to his son,  Michael; his family; and this entire Nation. It is a privilege to  recognize his service to our country and celebrate his 100th birthday.   I wish Mr. Cline many more joyful years to come with his family. I  thank him, and God bless.                            ____________________
