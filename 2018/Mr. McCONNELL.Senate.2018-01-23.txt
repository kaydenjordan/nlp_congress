 Mr. President, first, this morning began with reports  of the tragedy at Marshall County High School in Benton, KY. State  officials have reported at least one confirmed death and several  injuries. My staff in Western Kentucky is at the high school and is in  close contact with local officials. They are monitoring the situation  and will be providing me with updates throughout the day.   I know I speak for communities across my home State in sending  prayers of comfort and healing to students, faculty, and everyone  affected by this violence. Our hearts are with the entire community in  Marshall County, and our gratitude is with the first responders who  rushed into harm's way.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we might call today the ``first day of  the rest of the 115th Congress.'' Yesterday, an overwhelming bipartisan  majority of Senators voted to end a filibuster of government funding  and conclude a short-lived shutdown of the Federal Government. This  regrettable episode reminded all of us that, in the Senate,  brinksmanship and hostage-taking simply do not work. The only path to  meaningful progress is the hard work of crafting legislation and  persuading colleagues on both sides to support it.   Yesterday evening our agreement to reopen the government, secure  funding for our men and women in uniform, extend health insurance for  vulnerable children, and further delay three ObamaCare taxes was signed  into law. Now serious negotiations can resume on key issues such as  immigration and border security, disaster relief, healthcare, and  providing adequate levels of defense spending to support the new  national defense strategy--just to name a few. Because common sense and  bipartisanship won out yesterday, we have a fresh start today. I  challenge every one of us to make the most of it. The American people  are watching.   Once again, I want to thank the bipartisan group of Senators-- spearheaded by Senator Graham, Senator Collins, Senator Flake, and  several of our Democratic colleagues--who helped bring an end to this  regrettable incident. I particularly wish to thank Senate Finance  Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch for his powerful advocacy for the 9  million children and low-income families who rely on the State  Children's Health Insurance Program.   Senator Hatch co-created SCHIP with Senator Ted Kennedy on a  bipartisan basis more than 20 years ago. I know he counts this program  among his proudest legislative accomplishments, and with a career like  Senator Hatch's, that is really saying something.   I understand the 6-year SCHIP extension the Senate passed yesterday  will  [[Page S446]]  be the longest extension in the program's history. Its passage offers  just one more testament, as if we needed one, to Senator Hatch's moral  conviction, political skill, and care for the most vulnerable in our  society. It reminds us how much we will miss his work when he retires  at the end of this Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, we have a long list  of legislative priorities to tackle in the coming weeks, but  legislation is not the only bipartisan business that the Senate needs  to handle. Yesterday afternoon I filed cloture on three nominees to  fill important positions in the administration: Alex Azar, to serve as  Secretary of Health and Human Services; Sam Brownback, to serve as  Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom; and Jerome  Powell, to serve as Chairman of the Federal Reserve.   Today the Senate is considering the nomination of Mr. Powell, who  brings with him degrees from Princeton and Georgetown and a record of  high achievement in both the public and private sectors. Since his  nomination to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in  2011, which received strong, bipartisan support, he has served as a  steady voice and a thoughtful leader. I very much look forward to  supporting his confirmation as Chairman.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, while the press  was focused on the unfortunate lapse in government funding, the good  news about last month's historic tax reform law continued to pile up.  The number of Americans preparing to receive pay raises, special  bonuses, and other benefits, thanks to the historic tax cuts passed  last month, continues to grow. These are just the first fruits of a law  that also lays a long-term foundation for better job opportunities,  higher wages, and more investment.   On this subject, here is something that not many have realized yet.  Even the Democrats' government shutdown couldn't keep this Congress  from finding new ways to cut taxes and let the American people keep  more of their hard-earned money. Included in yesterday's bipartisan  bill was an additional $31 billion in tax cuts. Specifically, we  delayed three onerous taxes that were created as part of ObamaCare.   Last year, as part of comprehensive tax reform, we repealed the  unfair individual mandate tax at the heart of ObamaCare. Now we have  taken care of three more. One was ObamaCare's deeply unpopular tax on  medical devices. Another was the so-called ``Cadillac tax,'' which  Senator Heller of Nevada has worked hard to delay. That tax penalizes  employers who offer generous benefits. The third, simply called the  ``health insurance tax,'' makes plans more expensive.   All three of these taxes are unpopular. All are key pieces of the  failing ObamaCare health law. Now, because this Congress is so intent  on saving the American people money, all three of them will be delayed.   Personally, I liked the way the New York Times put it. Their headline  read: ``There's a Surprise in the Government Funding Bill: More Tax  Cuts.''   Here is the story's first line: ``Congress is apparently not done  cutting taxes, even after passing a $1.5 trillion tax overhaul last  year.'' I couldn't say it better than the New York Times.   The Senate is never done looking for new ways to take money out of  Washington's pocket and to put it back in the pockets of the American  people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on November 16, 2017, Laurel County  lost a beloved presence in their community with the passing of Glenn  Calebs, Sr. He was 92 and dedicated his life to serving this country  and those around him.   A Navy veteran of the Second World War and a member of the Greatest  Generation, Glenn had a strong sense of patriotism. Those who knew him  said he made it a priority to participate in the annual Veterans Day  celebrations in Laurel County whenever possible. The judge-executive of  Laurel County recalled that he knew he could count on Glenn to be at  his side during the parade every year.   Members of the community knew how deeply Glenn cherished his family  and his church. One of his friends said it best when he recalled to a  local newspaper, ``He was a true gentlemen of Laurel County. . . . He  was a pillar of the community and the community will miss him.''   We are forever grateful for Glenn's service to our country at a time  when we needed it most. I ask my colleagues to join Elaine and me as we  send our condolences to his three children and four grandchildren. We  hope that their fond memories of his selfless spirit will help them  heal from their loss.   Mr. President, the Sentinel Echo recently published an article on  Glenn's life and service. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the  article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Sentinel Echo, Nov. 17, 2017]                             Calebs Remembered                             (By Nita Johnson)         Although his hair became a silvery white as the years went       by, the smile and love for others that marked Glenn Calebs       Sr. never did.        The 92-year-old World War II Navy veteran passed away on       Wednesday at the University of Kentucky Medical Center, where       he had been a patient for the past several weeks.        Calebs spent his life as a farmer after serving his country       during the war. He was dedicated to his family, his church,       and his community.        He was extremely proud of his military service. It was       seldom that Calebs was not present for the annual Veterans       Day activities at various locations in the area. In fact, his       recent illness that kept him in Lexington during this year's       Veterans Day celebrations was a source of worry for the       elderly man.        Laurel County Judge Executive David Westerfield got       emotional during this year's program, telling that since the       ceremonies began six years ago there had been three people       who rode in Westerfield's vehicle in the initial parades.        ``I've always had Warren Scoville, my brother Johnny and       Glenn Calebs ride with me,'' Westerfield said. ``This year       none of them are here.''        Westerfield paid tribute to Calebs after hearing of his       passing.        ``Glenn Calebs was a very well respected individual in our       community,'' he said. ``He was a very close friend of mine       that I enjoyed spending time with. He always went out of his       way to help anyone. He proudly served his country and was       always involved in our Veterans' parade each year.        ``Ironically, my last conversation with Glenn was a phone       call he made to me a little over two weeks ago, letting me       know that he wouldn't be able to attend the Veterans Parade       this year. He was so disappointed that he wouldn't be able to       be there,        ``I will always treasure his friendship and he will be       greatly missed,'' Westerfield said.        That sentiment was seconded by Charlie Pennington, who       served as a U.S. Marshal, board member of the London Laurel       County Industrial Development Authority and its eventual       director.        ``He was a true gentleman of Laurel County,'' Pennington       said. ``They don't make them like that every day.''        Pennington said he was more familiar with Calebs from his       farming ventures.        ``He made his presence known at Farmers Markets. He always       raised a garden and had a big crop of tomatoes,'' he said.        ``He had a daughter and two sons and all are fine people,''       Pennington added. ``He was a pillar of the community and the       community will miss him.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life of  Bud Hays of Knott County, KY, who passed away on November 21, 2017, at  the age of 98. A veteran of the U.S. Army, Bud received multiple awards  for his military service during World War II.   Born in Quicksand, KY, Bud was the youngest of a dozen children. The  family moved to Hindman, KY, where Bud grew up in a small log cabin. He  later enlisted in the Army at the age of 16. Serving on the front lines  during the Second World War, Bud traveled around the world to Germany,  Africa, and Australia in service to his Nation. Under the command of  General Patton as an Army infantry medic, Bud risked his own life in  order to save the lives of other soldiers. Bud was shot in the hand  and, after being discharged, received the Purple Heart, Military Heart,  and Bronze Star.   After World War II, Bud returned to Knott County, where he ran a  grocery store, drove a school bus, and raised a family. Bud and his  wife, Elouise, had four children: his son Doug, as well as his three  daughters Kathy, Linda, and Marlene. Elaine and I send our condolences  to their children, their family, and friends.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to recognize a legend in  Kentucky's high school athletics, Coach Stan Steidel. This month,  Dayton High School in Campbell County is marking Stan's decades of  service to the school and its students by renaming the basketball court  in his honor. I would like to join the community in thanking Stan for  his support of Kentucky's student-athletes.   Stan, who graduated from Dayton High School in 1959, has spent more  than 50 years in education, helping guide the next generation of  Kentuckians to a bright future. Throughout his career, he has earned a  long list of accolades as a coach, a teacher, an athletic director, and  as an administrator.   In 1979, along with a group of coaches, Stan established Kentucky's  ``All A'' Classic, a tournament for smaller schools. The first  basketball tournament in 1980 hosted eight schools, all from northern  Kentucky. Through the persistence of many individuals like Stan, the  classic continued to grow. In 1990, the founders' dream became reality  with a statewide tournament with the winning teams from 16 regions.   The classic has continued to develop, adding more sports, arts,  academic team competition, and Junior ROTC tournaments. It has also  grown as a program to help student-athletes compete at a collegiate  level, giving more  [[Page S464]]  than $500,000 in scholarships to attend Kentucky schools. Because of  Stan's passionate leadership, countless Kentucky students are able to  hone their skills and compete across the Commonwealth.   I would like to congratulate Stan for this impressive honor and thank  him for a career of dedicated service to young people throughout  Kentucky. I am proud to join with the Kentucky athletic community in  celebrating Stan's accomplishments.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Gilbert  ``Gil'' Vanover, who has committed his life to serving the people of  McCreary County, KY, and the country.   A Korean war veteran, Gil joined the U.S. Air Force in 1950 after he  graduated from McCreary County High School. During a mission in a B-26  Bomber, Gil's plane was shot down, forcing him and his team to  evacuate. Gil parachuted out of the plane and was later rescued by  Allied Forces.   During his landing, Gil suffered several injuries, causing him to be  discharged from the Air Force. However, that did not dissuade him from  serving his country again, and he reenlisted. After 28 years of service  to his Nation, he retired as a first sergeant at the Wright-Patterson  Air Force Base in Ohio. Among his many well-earned recognitions, Gil  was awarded the Bronze Star and the Cross of Gallantry Air Medal for  his selfless military service to our country.   After his career in the Armed Forces, Gil returned back to his  hometown to serve his community in a new way: as a teacher. He taught  history for 15 years at McCreary County High School, the same school he  had attended years before.   I would like to urge my colleagues to join me in thanking Gil for his  bravery and perseverance in his service to our country, as well as his  commitment to the next generation of his community in McCreary County.  He is an inspiration to his students, neighbors, and all who seek to  help others.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the work of  the Southeastern Kentucky Rehabilitation Industries, SEKRI, a nonprofit  organization in Corbin, KY, which helps provide employment  opportunities for individuals with disabilities.   Before its founding in 1971, men and women with mental or physical  disabilities in southeastern Kentucky often struggled to find real  opportunities for employment. Since SEKRI was established, it has  helped many men and women find work. Seventy-five percent of SEKRI's  workforce is comprised of individuals with disabilities who produce  garments such as caps and protective gear for the Armed Forces. Today  SEKRI has five plants, four of which are in Kentucky, and employs over  550 individuals throughout the region. SEKRI plans to open its sixth  plant in Pineville, KY, this year.   For more than 45 years, SEKRI has helped hundreds of workers with  disabilities in eastern Kentucky participate in the workforce. I would  like to commend SEKRI for its many contributions to the Commonwealth of  Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution on documentary production by the Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations, and ask for its immediate consideration.
