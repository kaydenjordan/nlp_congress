 Madam President, as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my honor to  recognize a small business that exemplifies a rigorous work ethic,  attention to detail, and dedication to tradition. This week, it is my  privilege to name Capital Shoe Fixery of Tallahassee, FL, as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   Known for their expertise in shoe maintenance, Capital Shoe Fixery  has become a local staple, servicing the members of their community  since 1938. Having celebrated their 81st anniversary, the small  business has become a landmark in the State's capitol and remains a  true Main Street favorite. Originally owned by Elton and June Henley,  Nick Camechis's father, John, bought the business in 1966. After  school, Nick spent his days helping his father around the store and  learning the trade. Following the precedent of hard work and tradition,  Nick took over the business in 1995. To this day, Nick expands on his  father's longstanding tradition of fairly priced, high-quality  craftsmanship. Recently turning 65, this shoe cobbler has no current  plans to retire, working 70 hour workweeks with no sick days.   Today, Capital Shoe Fixery remains family-oriented and affordable,  providing only the highest quality of work to their customers. When  customers arrive, they are greeted by Nick's dog Tuck, who also never  misses a day of work. Capital Shoe's clientele ranges from politicians,  college students, dancers, and customers from all walks of life.  Capital Shoe Fixery will take in approximately 60 to 70 shoes a day  during a typical legislative session. Furthermore, Nick is known for  his honesty with customers and will decline new business if he feels  that the damaged shoes are irreparable.   This outstanding quality of service and honesty by Capital Shoe  Fixery has not gone unnoticed. In addition to their excellent reviews,  in 2016, Capital Shoe Fixery was featured in Tallahassee Family  Magazine, where the family-owned business was commended for their work  ethic and attention to detail. The article truly cemented Capital Shoe  Fixery as a Main Street staple, highlighting its unique traits that  allow for remarkable customer experiences.   Capital Shoe Fixery has remained true to their original values by  focusing on quality service with an expert investment of time, care,  and honesty to prioritize the customer. In addition, it is a reminder  of the extensive amount of time and care required to achieve success  and longevity in business. Nick's dedication is a quintessential  example of how hard work can lead to exceptional success. It is with  great pleasure that I extend my congratulations to Nick and Capital  Shoe Fixery. I wish you well as you continue serving the people of  Tallahassee, and I look forward to watching your continued  success.                            ____________________
