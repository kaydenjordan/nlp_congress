 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the President's  efforts to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula.   For almost seven decades, the United States and North Korea have been  adversaries, but this week we witnessed a  [[Page H5139]]  groundbreaking first step for both nations and global security as a  whole.   While much work remains to be done, the commitment to recover the  remains of 7,802 American soldiers who were prisoners of war or missing  in action during the Korean war deserves a special recognition.  Bringing these fallen heroes home will give long overdue closure to the  loved ones and families of those who made the ultimate sacrifice.   We must deal firmly with North Korea while taking steps to ensure a  brutal war is not repeated.                            ____________________
