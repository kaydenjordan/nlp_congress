 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the memory of Batoul  Alfadawi, a resident of Dearborn Heights in Michigan's 13th District.   Her life was tragically cut short at the age of 6 years old from a  hit-and-run. Batoul was a sweet girl with a beautiful soul. She had a  huge enthusiasm for life and a joyful spirit. Batoul loved learning,  spending time with her family, and playing with her friends. I know her  parents and six siblings will miss her immensely.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in paying tribute to the memory of  Batoul, and please say a prayer for her family.               Honoring Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Jefferson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute to Lieutenant Colonel  Alexander Jefferson whose heroic service as a Tuskegee Airman in World  War II was recognized earlier this week in the rededication ceremony of  Jefferson Field in our district.   I was proud to be there in his presence. It was also his 100th  birthday. He is a graduate of Detroit public schools, like myself.  Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Jefferson pursued a military career and  completed pilot training at the Tuskegee Army Airfield.   As a fighter pilot with the Red Tail, 332nd Fighter Group 301st  Fighter Squadron, his unit escorted bombers headfirst into the action,  bravely providing protection from vicious enemy aircraft. They never  lost a single plane.   Mr. Speaker, on August 12, 1944, Jefferson was shot down and captured  by the Germans and kept as a prisoner of war for 9 months. Liberated by  American forces on the 29th of April 1945 and discharged from Active  Duty in 1947, he retired from the Reserves in 1969.   After serving, Lieutenant Colonel Jefferson then became a science  teacher in Detroit, where he then retired in 1979. At his ceremony, my  teacher in high school came up to me and said he was very proud of the  accomplishment I had. He said, Guess what, Lieutenant Jefferson was my  science teacher and my elementary teacher, and now seeing you up there,  I know that he was part of creating that seed and creating more  leadership and really strength within the city of Detroit.   Mr. Speaker, he has received numerous awards for his bravery, and I  am  [[Page H6271]]  truly honored to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Jefferson on  his celebration of service to our country. It was his 100th birthday.  We sang happy birthday to him, and he danced along with many of us,  even in the crisp cold in the city of Detroit, in the middle of the  field.                                time  1015                           Recognizing Hassan Jaber     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize numerous  contributions of Hassan Jaber to the communities of Wayne County,  Michigan, as he retires after more than 40 years of service to ACCESS.   During his time in ACCESS, Hassan Jaber has been a leader in  expanding its programming to include more than 100 platforms in 10  locations to assist residents across the region.   He has created partnerships locally and nationally to advocate for  policy initiatives to fight bigotry, advance civil rights, and create a  better quality of life for immigrants and other vulnerable populations.   I know Hassan Jaber personally. With every obstacle, he never wavered  in leading with compassion and keeping the community at the center of  his work.   Hassan Jaber's leadership and forward-thinking approach have  solidified his legacy as a community leader. His mentorship helped me  grow into the passionate advocate I am today.   Please join me in recognizing Hassan Jaber's work on behalf of  residents of Michigan's 13th Congressional District and southeastern  Michigan as we wish him well on the next chapter in his life.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in tribute to Lieutenant  Colonel Alexander Jefferson, whose heroic service as a Tuskegee Airman  in World War II was recognized this week in a rededication ceremony of  Jefferson Field, and it was done on his 100th birthday.
