 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation.   Don represented Alaska in this House for nearly as long as Alaska has  been a State. Don was a ferocious advocate for the people he  represented, not the least of whom were Alaska's Native people, who  held a special place in his heart.   We are going to miss Don. He was a champion for the North Slope,  Alaska's commercial fisheries, and infrastructure, obviously. Don spent  his career fighting for his constituents to use Alaska's vast natural  resources to bring prosperity to his State.   Don knew what made our country great and how to work across the aisle  to deliver for the people of Alaska.   Don was my first committee chairman when I came here 30 years ago,  and he quickly found me and said: ``I heard you want to be on my  committee.'' I said: ``Yes, Mr. Chairman.'' ``Well, do whatever I tell  you, and you will be just fine.'' I think, at some time or another, all  of us have lived by those words.   I will miss Don. I will miss his friendship, his humor, and his  passion. My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Anne, and the  family.   Rest in peace, Don.
