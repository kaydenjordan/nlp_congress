 Mr. Speaker, we are here at a point in time when prices  are out of control. The American people are getting punched in the face  by higher prices every day.   Gas is over $5 a gallon. The American people are paying hundreds of  dollars more per month because prices are out of control. The Federal  Reserve has a mandate to maintain price stability. The Federal Reserve  is failing in that mandate. My colleagues across the aisle--the  outgoing majority--continue to try to add another mandate to the  Federal Reserve.   The Federal Reserve is failing on step one--price stability. Let's  address price stability so people aren't getting clobbered every day by  higher prices; so people aren't getting clobbered when they go to fill  up their car with gas; clobbered when they go to the gas station;  clobbered when they go to the grocery store to get groceries.   The outgoing majority wants to add another mandate to the Federal  Reserve at a period of time when the Federal Reserve is failing in  their current mandate. Nothing could be more illogical. We need to get  prices under control.   We can do that by unleashing American energy and we can do that by  controlling wasteful spending in Washington, D.C. This bill is  misplaced. This bill moves us in another direction. Instead, we should  be focusing on actually controlling costs.
