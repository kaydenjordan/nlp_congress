 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following GAO opinion letter be printed in the Congressional Record:         Matter of: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and       Nutrition Service--Applicability of the Congressional Review       Act to Food and Nutrition Service Policy Memorandum CRD 01-      2022, Application of Bostock v. Clayton  [[Page S1999]]       County to Program Discrimination Complaint Processing--Policy       Update        File: B-334411        Date: June 5, 2023.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Government                                           Accountability Office,                                                     Washington, DC.                                  Decision       Matter of: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition           Service--Applicability of the Congressional Review Act to           Food and Nutrition Service Policy Memorandum CRD 01-2022,           Application of Bostock v. Clayton County to Program           Discrimination Complaint Processing--Policy Update.      File: B-334411.      Date: June 5, 2023.                                    DIGEST         The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition       Service (USDA/FNS) published a memorandum titled Application       of Bostock v. Clayton County to Program Discrimination       Complaint Processing--Policy Update (Update). GAO received a       request for a decision as to whether the Update is a rule for       purposes of the Congressional Review Act (CRA). CRA       incorporates the Administrative Procedure Act's (APA)       definition of a rule and requires that before a rule can take       effect, an agency must submit the rule to both the House of       Representatives and the Senate, as well as to the Comptroller       General. USDA/FNS did not submit a CRA report to Congress or       the Comptroller General on the Update.        The Update announced USDA/FNS's conclusion that the       prohibitions against sex discrimination in USDA/FNS-enforced       statutes prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender       identity and sexual orientation. Based on this conclusion,       the Update directed state agencies and program operators to       handle complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of       gender identity and sexual orientation as complaints of       prohibited sex discrimination. We conclude that the Update       meets CRA's definition of a rule and no CRA exception       applies. Therefore, the Update is subject to CRA's submission       requirement.                                   DECISION         On May 5, 2022, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food       and Nutrition Service (USDA/FNS) issued a memorandum titled       Application of Bostock v. Clayton County to Program       Discrimination Complaint Processing--Policy Update (Update),       available at https://www.fns.usda.gov/cr/crd-01-2022 (last       visited Apr. 14, 2023). We received a request for a decision       as to whether the Update is a rule for purposes of the       Congressional Review Act (CRA). Letter from Senators Roger       Marshall, Marsha Blackburn, John Barrasso, Tom Cotton, and       James Lankford, to the Comptroller General (June 16, 2022).       As discussed below, we conclude that the Update is a rule       subject to CRA's submission requirement.        Our practice when rendering decisions is to contact the       relevant agencies to obtain their legal views on the subject       of the request. GAO, Procedures and Practices for Legal       Decisions and Opinions, GAO-06-1064SP (Washington, D.C.:       Sept. 2006) (Procedures), available at https://www.gao.gov/ products/gao-06-1064sp. Accordingly, we reached out to USDA/      FNS to obtain the agency's legal views. Letter from Assistant       General Counsel, GAO, to General Counsel, USDA (July 13,       2022). Although USDA/FNS did not provide a substantive       response with its legal views due to ongoing litigation, we       determined we have sufficient information to issue a decision       on this matter. Letter from General Counsel, USDA, to       Assistant General Counsel, GAO (Aug. 4, 2022) (First Response       Letter); Letter from General Counsel, USDA, to Assistant       General Counsel, GAO (Oct. 20, 2022) (Second Response       Letter).                                  BACKGROUND       Prohibitions Against Sex Discrimination in USDA/FNS Programs        USDA/FNS administers federal programs to increase food       security and reduce hunger among children and low-income       people. USDA/FNS, Our Agency, About FNS, available at https:/      /www.fns.usda.gov (last visited Apr. 10, 2023). Laws such as       Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, 20       U.S.C. Sec. 1681-1688, and the Food and Nutrition Act of       2008, as amended, 7 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2011 et seq., include       prohibitions against sex discrimination. Update at 1. USDA/      FNS enforces those prohibitions. Id. Moreover, where USDA/FNS       has delegated certain program responsibilities to states and       other nonfederal entities, these states and entities may       process complaints alleging sex discrimination. See, e.g., 7       C.F.R. Sec. 271.4 (assigning states the responsibility to       administer the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program       (SNAP)), Sec. 272.6 (states may process SNAP applicants'       discrimination complaints).        In the Update, USDA/FNS announced that it had reevaluated       the prohibitions on sex discrimination ``in all FNS       programs'' due to the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock v.       Clayton County, 590 U.S. __, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020). Update       at 1, 2. The Supreme Court in Bostock held that the       prohibition in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964       against sex discrimination in employment includes a       prohibition against discrimination on the basis of gender       identity and sexual orientation. Bostock, at 1741. ``In light       of Bostock,'' USDA/FNS explained in the Update that       ``discrimination based on gender identity and sexual       orientation can [also] constitute prohibited sex       discrimination under Title IX [of the Education Amendments of       1972] and the Food and Nutrition Act.'' Update at 2. With       respect to Title IX, USDA/FNS indicated that it was       ``adopting'' recent analyses by the Department of Justice       and the Department of Education, both of which had applied       Bostock to find that Title IX includes a prohibition       against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual       orientation. With respect to the Food and Nutrition Act,       USDA/FNS said the Act's nondiscrimination provision is       ``sufficiently similar'' to Title VII's nondiscrimination       language as to make Bostock's holding applicable. Id.        Based on the above determinations, the Update directed all       ``State agencies and program operators'' who administer USDA/      FNS programs to ``expeditiously review their program       discrimination complaint procedures'' and ``make any changes       necessary to ensure complaints alleging discrimination on the       basis of gender identity and sexual orientation are processed       and evaluated as [sex discrimination] complaints.'' Update at       3. The Update further instructed state agencies to       ``distribute [the Update] to local agencies, Program       Operators and Sponsors, and all other subrecipients of       Federal financial assistance.'' Id. Finally, the Update       ``advised'' state agencies and program operators ``that the       interpretation outlined in [the Update] does not determine       the outcome in any particular case, which will depend on the       specific facts and circumstances of that case.'' Id.      The Congressional Review Act (CRA)        CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking, requires federal agencies to submit a       report on each new rule to both houses of Congress and to the       Comptroller General for review before a rule can take effect.       5 U.S.C. Sec. 801(a)(1)(A). The report must contain a copy of       the rule, ``a concise general statement relating to the       rule,'' and the rule's proposed effective date. Id. CRA       allows Congress to review and disapprove federal agency rules       for a period of 60 days using special procedures. See 5       U.S.C. Sec. 802. If a resolution of disapproval is enacted,       then the new rule has no force or effect. 5 U.S.C.       Sec. 801(b)(1).        CRA adopts the definition of a rule under the       Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 551(4),       which states that a rule is ``the whole or a part of an       agency statement of general or particular applicability and       future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe       law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or       practice requirements of an agency.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 804(3).       However, CRA excludes three categories of rules from       coverage: (1) rules of particular applicability; (2) rules       relating to agency management or personnel; and (3) rules of       agency organization, procedure, or practice that do not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties. Id.        USDA/FNS did not submit a CRA report to Congress or the       Comptroller General on the Update. In its first response to       GAO, USDA/FNS asked us to ``withdraw [our] request for legal       information'' because of two pending lawsuits concerning the       Update. First Response Letter, at 1. When GAO informed USDA       that those lawsuits did not prevent us from carrying out our       responsibility to assist Congress, and that we would proceed       to issue a legal decision, USDA nevertheless ``respectfully       decline[d] to comment'' on the questions we posed. Second       Response Letter, at 1-2. Although USDA/FNS did not provide a       substantive response to GAO's inquiries concerning this       matter, we reviewed filings in the lawsuits identified in the       agency's First Response Letter to determine if the agency or       other parties raised arguments concerning the applicability       of CRA. We found no such arguments. Based on the factual       information and legal issues we reviewed, we determined we       have sufficient information to issue a decision on this       matter.                                  DISCUSSION         An agency action is subject to CRA if it meets the APA's       definition of a rule and no CRA exception applies. Because       the Update meets the APA's definition of a rule, and because       no CRA exception applies, the Update is subject to CRA's       submission requirement.        The Update meets the APA definition of a rule. It is an       agency statement issued by the FNS/Civil Rights Division to       the Regional and State Directors of all Food and Nutrition       Service programs. Update at 1. It has future effect because       it directs state agencies and program operators to ``make any       changes necessary'' to their complaint-handling processes and       ``distribute this memorandum'' to additional personnel,       among other things. Id. at 3. It prescribes policy for       USDA/FNS, and all others implementing USDA/FNS programs,       by instructing ``that discrimination based on gender       identity and sexual orientation can constitute prohibited       sex discrimination under Title IX and the Food and       Nutrition Act. Id. at 2.        Additionally, none of CRA's exceptions apply:        First, the Update is not a rule of particular       applicability. Rules of particular applicability are those       addressed to specific, identified entities that address       actions that may or may not be taken, in light of the facts       and circumstances. B-334221, Feb. 9, 2023; B-333732, July 28,       2022. Here, by contrast, the Update is addressed to directors       in ``all regions'' and ``all states,'' and instructs them  [[Page S2000]]       to distribute the Update further to ``local agencies, Program       Operators and Sponsors, and all other subrecipients of       Federal financial assistance.'' Update at 1, 3. USDA/FNS       intended the Update to reach everyone implementing FNS       programs and instructed that it did not ``determine the       outcome in any particular case.'' Id. at 3. Thus, the Update       has general applicability. See, e.g., B-333732, July 28, 2022       (explaining that USDA Thrifty Food Plan updates addressed to       ``all families'' lacked particular applicability).        Second, the Update is not a rule relating to agency       management or personnel. ``A rule falls within the CRA       exception for rules relating to agency management or       personnel if it relates to purely internal agency matters,       with no effect on non-agency parties.'' B-334221, Feb. 9,       2023. Here, the Update relates primarily to non-agency       parties. As discussed above, it is addressed to ``all state       directors'' of USDA/FNS programs, among others, and it       directs further distribution to other nonfederal entities.       Update at 1. The Update's stated purpose is to ``provide       direction to'' such non-agency parties, to ensure their       procedures comport with a USDA/FNS policy. Id. That policy,       moreover, concerns the rights of private households to have       their complaints of discrimination based on gender identity       and sexual orientation processed and evaluated as complaints       of discrimination based on sex. Id. at 3. Thus, the Update is       not a rule relating to agency management or personnel. See B-      333732, July 28, 2022 (USDA update to Thrifty Food Plan did       not qualify for CRA's second exception because it addressed       ``the amount of SNAP benefits for qualifying families''), B-      333501, Dec. 14, 2021 (Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention (CDC) mask requirement did not qualify for CRA's       second exception because it addressed public travelers and       conveyance operators).        Third, and finally, the Update has a substantial impact on       the rights and obligations of non-agency parties. We have       recognized that agencies may meet the third CRA exception       when implementing ``new internal procedures'' to ensure       compliance with an ``existing statutory obligation.'' B-      330190, Dec. 19, 2018. Thus, in B-330190, we considered a       Department of Justice (DOJ) memorandum that adopted a zero       tolerance policy with regard to prosecuting certain       individuals who violated 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1325(a) by entering       the country illegally. Id. We found that DOJ's memo did not       ``alter individual rights'' because there was no underlying       change in the legal rights of individuals crossing the       border. Id. Here, the Update purports merely to ``clarify''       existing requirements of anti-discrimination provisions.       Update, at 1. However, unlike in B-330190, the Update       forwards a novel interpretation of the law with respect to       USDA/FNS-enforced statutes.        Prior to Bostock, sex discrimination under Title VII of the       Civil Rights Act of 1964 was not universally understood to       include discrimination on the basis of gender identity and       sexual orientation; rather, the Supreme Court's decision       established that understanding as a matter of law. Bostock,       at 1741, 1754. Importantly, the Update itself is not even a       direct application of Bostock, but an extension of its       holding (in the Title VII context) to the context of USDA/      FNS-enforced statutes. The Update explains how USDA/FNS       ``determined'' that discrimination on the basis of gender       identity and sexual orientation can constitute sex       discrimination under the statutes USDA/FNS enforces, and the       implication is that USDA/FNS had not reached or announced       that determination previously. Update at 3.        The Update does not qualify for CRA's third exception, as       it creates new policy and, in doing so, has a substantial       impact on the rights and obligations of non-agency parties.       See B-333732 at 5 (USDA Thrifty Food Plan update had       substantial impact by ``granting increased benefit       allotments'' to families); B-333501 at 5 (CDC mask       requirement had substantial impact by ``impos[ing] new       requirements on people who are traveling to wear masks'').       Namely, it expands the obligations of state agencies and       program operators by requiring them to ``review'' their       discrimination complaint procedures and ``make any changes       necessary.'' Update at 3. The Update also expands the rights       of FNS benefit applicants by requiring that an applicant's       complaint alleging discrimination on the basis of gender       identity and/or sexual orientation be processed and evaluated       as a complaint of discrimination based on sex, which was not       required prior to the Update.                                  CONCLUSION         The Update is a rule for CRA purposes because it meets the       APA's definition of a rule and no CRA exception applies.       Therefore, the Update is subject to CRA's requirement that it       be submitted to Congress before it can take effect.
