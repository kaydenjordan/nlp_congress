 Madam President, I rise today to honor and  congratulate Mr. Stephen J. Norman on his retirement following 45 years  of work in the community development and affordable housing industry.  Stephen retires from Washington's King County Housing Authority, where  he has served as executive director and been an extraordinary asset to  our State and the greater Seattle-King County region for the last 25  years.   Under Stephen's leadership, KCHA has doubled the number of households  served during his tenure and charted a path forward with an expansive  vision of what a public housing authority can be in the 21st century.  The authority's housing stock and tenant-based programming now house  more than 55,000 individuals, including over 20,000 children. Stephen  oversaw KCHA's designation as one of the first Moving to Work Housing  Authorities in the country, a recognition that enabled KCHA to pioneer  efforts to partner with the education, health, and workforce  development sectors to support residents throughout King County.   As the former assistant commissioner for Homeless Housing Development  in New York City, Stephen has always understood the importance of  service-enriched supportive housing. I am particularly proud of the  work that Stephen has undertaken to expand the HUD-VASH program in King  County, connecting housing and service systems to support our veterans  who are suffering the indignity of living outside.   Stephen has also been a staunch champion of broadening the geographic  availability of affordable housing. KCHA has invested heavily in  workforce housing, reflecting an ambitious Nation-leading effort to  preserve existing housing in gentrifying and high-opportunity areas,  and has pioneered mobility initiatives for families with children  participating in the Housing Choice Voucher Program. The Creating Moves  to Opportunity Program research has served as the foundation for  current efforts by the Federal Government to increase geographic choice  and mobility for households with low incomes. Time and time again,  under Stephen's leadership, KCHA's programs have paved the way for  broader policy change at the State and Federal level.   The host of expansive housing and services programming at KCHA  reflects Stephen's extraordinary skills in developing cross-sector  partnerships, even in the most difficult of circumstances. With his  wit, inquisitiveness, and relentless drive, Stephen has earned the  collaboration and respect of leaders across the State and Nation. He  has served as the president of the board of directors for the Council  of Large Public Housing Authorities and was the  [[Page S350]]  founding vice president and current chair of the board for the  Corporation for Supportive Housing. He has done all of this while  keeping a pulse on the national housing landscape as a tireless  advocate for expanded Federal support for affordable housing. I know  for certain that because of his effective advocacy and vision, today  more people in King County and across the Nation have a place to call  home.   It has been a great privilege to learn from and collaborate with  Stephen over the last two decades. And it is my honor to thank him for  his lifetime of dedicated service to people with low incomes in King  County, the State of Washington, and across the entire country. I wish  him the very best during his well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
