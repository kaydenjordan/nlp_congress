 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of  the Mental Health Matters Act, led by the gentleman from California,  Mr. DeSaulnier.   The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the mental health crisis among  students, workers, and families.   In 2021, over 44 percent of students experienced persistent feelings  of sadness or hopelessness; almost 20 percent seriously considered  suicide; and 9 percent actually attempted suicide. Regrettably, 80  percent of youth in need of mental health services do not have access  in their communities.   As a result, educators have been forced to play an outsized role in  supporting and responding to students' mental health needs, leading to  increased depression and trauma among educators. However, our schools  do not have the specialized staff necessary to respond to the increased  prevalence and complexity of students' mental health needs.   According to a 2019 ACLU study, no state met the student-to-social  worker ratio of one social worker to every 250 students, as recommended  by the National Association of Social Workers. Furthermore, the  national ratio of school psychologists per students during the 2020- 2022 school years was one psychologist per every 1,100 students--more  than double the ratio recommended by the National Association of School  Psychologists.   The rise in mental health challenges is not isolated to students and  educators. Nearly half of the U.S. workforce now suffers from mental  health issues since the COVID-19 pandemic began.   Yet, many workers are denied the mental health and substance abuse  disorder benefits they are legally entitled to receive under their  employer-sponsored health plan.   In a recent report to Congress, the Departments of Labor, Health and  Human Services, and the Treasury found widespread violations of the  Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act by group health plans and  insurers who are failing to maintain parity between mental health and  substance abuse disorder benefits and physical health benefits.  Further, the report recommended that Congress enhance the Secretary of  Labor's capacity to enforce the parity law, including providing the  authority to impose civil monetary penalties for violations. Notably,  this same recommendation was made by former President Trump's  Commission on Combatting the Opioid Crisis, which was led by then- Governor Chris Christie.   In response to these violations and the national mental health  crisis, the Chair of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and  Pensions, Mr. DeSaulnier, introduced the Mental Health Matters Act,  which includes proposals championed by several Committee Members.   This legislation:   Helps Head Start agencies implement evidence-based interventions to  improve the behavioral health of children and staff wellness;   Improves trauma-informed services in schools by developing innovative  initiatives to link schools and local educational agencies with local  trauma-informed support and mental health systems;   Requires colleges and universities to accept existing documentation  of disability and provide reasonable accommodations so that disabled  students can achieve success in higher education;   Provides the Department of Labor with enhanced authority to ensure  that private, employer-sponsored group health plans and insurers  fulfill their responsibility to provide mental health and substance  abuse disorder benefits;   Strengthens protections to ensure workers receive behavioral health  care and other benefits they have earned under their job-based plans;  and, finally,   Directs the Department of Education to award grants to build a  pipeline of school-based mental health services providers and increase  the number of mental health professionals serving in elementary and  secondary schools in high-need areas.   Simply put, the Mental Health Matters Act delivers the resources that  students, workers, and families need to improve their well-being.   I want to thank the gentleman from California, Mr. DeSaulnier, for  championing the bill. I also want to thank those that had sponsored  bills that were included in this legislation: the gentle lady from  California, Ms. Chu, the gentlelady from Massachusetts, Assistant  Speaker Clark, the gentle lady from Connecticut, Ms. Hayes, the gentle  lady from Oregon, Ms. Bonamici, the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr.  Courtney, and the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Norcross, for their  leadership in helping to put together this legislation.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the following letters in support.                                 National Education Association,                                       Washington, DC, May 17, 2022.      Education and Labor Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our 3 million members and       the 50 million students they serve, we urge you to address       the pressing need to modernize America's public school       facilities and address the mental health crisis among       students. Specifically, during the May 18 markup session, we       urge you to support the:        Reopen and Rebuild America's Schools Act (H.R. 604)--This       bill would create a $100 billion grant program and $30       billion tax-credit bond program targeting high-poverty       schools whose facilities pose health and safety risks to       students and educators. It would also provide the means for       such schools to operate safely in accordance with Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, including       heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.       America spends more on public school facilities than any part       of our infrastructure except roads and highways, yet many of       our 100,000 public school buildings are poorly equipped or in       poor physical condition-so poor it undermines student       learning. The federal government, however, remains noticeably       absent from any meaningful investment in this area.        Enhancing Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Through       Campus Planning Act (H.R. 5407)--This bill would promote       positive mental health among college students and encourage       comprehensive planning on college campuses to prevent suicide       and other mental health crises.        Campus Prevention and Recovery Services for Students Act       (H.R. 6493)--This bill would promote evidence-based       prevention and intervention strategies on college campuses.       It would also encourage integration and collaboration among       campus-based health services to address substance use and       mental health.      Mental Health Matters Act (H.R. 7780)--This bill would       promote the use of evidence-based mental health, social-      emotional, and behavioral health interventions for young       children enrolled in early education programs like Head       Start. It would also create a grant program to increase the       number of school-based mental health services providers.        Please support this vitally important legislation.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,      National Education Association.                                   ____                     National Association of School Psychologists,                                   Bethesda, MD, September 28, 2022.      Support for Mental Health Matters Act,        Dear Representative, On behalf of the National Association       of School Psychologists (NASP), we encourage you to support       swift passage of the Mental Health Matters Act and the       package of bills it includes. NASP represents 24,000 school       psychologists who work with students, families, educators,       administrators, and community members to ensure that every       student has access to comprehensive mental and behavioral       health support. We are a nonpartisan association committed to       advocating for research-based policies and practices that       ensure all children have the supports they need to thrive at       school, at home, and throughout life.        Schools play a critical role in our mental and behavioral       health care system, and the widespread shortage of school       psychologists and other school-based mental health       professionals exacerbates existing challenges to addressing       the growing number of students' mental and behavioral health       concerns. In order to provide necessary comprehensive       services, NASP recommends a ratio of one school psychologist       per 500 students. Current data estimate a national ratio of       about 1:1200; however, great variability exists among states,       with some states approaching a ratio of 1:5000. Shortages in       school psychology significantly undermine the availability of       high-quality services to students, families, and schools,       particularly in rural, underserved, and other hard to staff       school districts. The Mental Health Matters Act would provide       much needed support for schools and school-based mental       health professionals to address shortages and expand access       to mental and behavioral health supports by passing the       Elementary Secondary School Counseling Act and the Building       Pipeline of School-Based Mental Health Service Providers Act.        School psychologists are also integral to supporting       students with disabilities, and we provide critical supports       to students, educators, and families regarding special       education. We recommend the passage of the Respond, Innovate,       Succeed, and Empower Act, which expands access to needed       accommodations and supports for college students with       disabilities. Additionally, we encourage the passage of the       Supporting Trauma-Informed Education Practices Act through       the Mental Health Matters Act. Its passage would not only       increase student access to evidence-based trauma support       services and mental health care, but it would also support       the mental health of our educators and other school staff,       which is a necessary component of providing comprehensive       mental and behavioral health supports to students.        Thank you for your leadership and commitment to providing       comprehensive mental and behavioral health supports in       schools. We look forward to working with you on this critical       issue. If you have any questions or would like to follow up,       please contact Dr. Kelly Vaillancourt Strobach, NASP Director       of Policy and Advocacy,.            Sincerely,                                         Kathleen Minke, PhD, NCSP,                                                Executive Director.  [[Page H8241]]                                          ____                                                        AFSCME,                                 Washington, DC, September 29, 2022.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.4 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), we write in support of Congressman       Mrvan's amendment to direct the National Institute for       Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to study and make       recommendations for workers whose mental health is negatively       impacted by their job. AFSCME members and workers across the       nation work in high stress positions including but not       limited to public safety, health care, emergency medical       services and firefighters. Workers such as these already face       workplace stressors that have been exacerbated by the COVID-      19 pandemic forcing essential workers to the brink of a       mental health crisis.        Throughout the pandemic public safety officers, health care       workers and other essential workers answered the call. But       even before the pandemic many of these occupations were at an       increased risk of mental health issues because the nature of       their jobs routinely involves stressful, hazardous,       potentially violent and traumatic situations. A study from       the University of California Berkley found the rate of       correctional or parole officers who have considered suicide       is three times that of the general population. Other research       found suicides rates among correctional officers to be as       high as 12 times that of the general public. Nurses and       doctors have burnout rates and staffing shortages that       directly impact the health care system. A 2020 study       conducted by Mental Health America showed that 76% of health       care workers reported exhaustion and burnout while 75%       reported they were overwhelmed. There is incontrovertible       evidence that this is a national issue that demands a       comprehensive federal scale response.        This amendment recognizes the need to address mental health       at an organizational level. It takes a modern approach to       fund and set up much needed research on workplace and       organization changes that can improve the mental health       outcomes of workers in high stress occupations. Moreover,       this amendment recognizes that it is time we stop adding to       the burden of probation officers, correction officers, public       safety workers, health care workers and others by demanding       that they ``deal with it'' outside of work or figure out how       to provide self-care when the nature of the work leaves them       burnt out, stressed, or in despair that they do not want to       share.        This amendment requires NIOSH to conduct research and fund       training to identify what workplace interventions make a       difference and achieve better mental health outcomes for       workers. It calls for NIOSH to consult with other appropriate       federal departments and agencies to establish a research       program to identify best practices and interventions for       occupations with an elevated risk of workplace stress, post-      traumatic stress or suicide attempts. The focus on best       practices and recommendations would be on occupation-related       or work organization interventions to improve mental health       outcomes to lay the groundwork for a federal response to the       mental health crisis faced by everyday workers.        We ask these workers to put themselves in danger for public       safety. It is time for Congress to support essential and       front-line workers' mental and physical well-being. We ask       you to support Congressman Mrvan's amendment to study       workplace stress and support everyday workers' mental health.            Sincerely,                                                    Edwin S. Jayne,      Director of Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____                                                 September 27, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy, Our       organizations write in strong support of two critical       provisions (Titles VI and VII) contained in the Mental Health       Matters Act (H.R. 7780) that take important steps toward       ensuring parity in coverage of mental health and substance       use disorder (MH/SUD) care and strengthening Americans'       coverage rights under ERISA. We urge the full House to pass       H.R. 7780.        The Strengthening Behavioral Health Benefits Act (Title VI)       would provide civil monetary penalty authority to the U.S.       Department of Labor (USDOL) to enforce the Paul Wellstone and       Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act       of 2008 (MHPAEA). Providing USDOL this authority will make       recent MH/SUD investments (e.g., those contained in the       Bipartisan Safer Communities Act) go much further by ensuring       that insurance companies are meeting their parity       responsibilities and are not the unintended beneficiaries of       taxpayer funds that effectively displace insurance       reimbursement.        Civil monetary penalty authority will position USDOL--which       has one investigator for every 12,500 plans--to step in more       aggressively when necessary to change plans' coverage       practices, make parity a reality, and increase access to       life-saving treatment. This provision carefully balances the       interests of Americans seeking MH/SUD care with insurers,       plan sponsors, and administrators attempting to comply with       the law. By adding MHPAEA to USDOL's existing civil monetary       penalty authority for violations of the Genetic Information       Non-Discrimination Act (GINA), this provision captures the       existing safe harbor provision that protects insurers, plan       sponsors, and administrators that exercise ``reasonable       diligence'' to comply with the law.        Civil monetary penalty authority to ensure compliance with       MHPAEA has enjoyed bipartisan support in the past. The 2016       Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders Parity Task Force       strongly recommended providing this authority, as did       President Trump's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and       the Opioid Crisis. In fact, former New Jersey Governor Chris       Christie, chair of the Commission, stated that the authority       is ``absolutely necessary'' and that the Commission       ``unequivocally'' supported Congressional action to give       USDOL the authority to issue penalties. We also strongly       support Title Vi's increased appropriation authorization for       the Employee Benefits Security Administration and the       Solicitor of Labor to ensure compliance with ERISA, including       the Federal Parity Act.        Our organizations also strongly support the Employee and       Retiree Access to Justice Act (Title VII), which includes       critical patient-protection provisions for the 136 million       Americans enrolled in ERISA health plans. This legislation       would prohibit ERISA plans from inserting provisions into       plan policies (except when agreed to as part of bona fide       collective bargaining agreements) that force beneficiaries       into mandatory binding arbitrations, taking away their access       to federal courts in order to protect their rights under       ERISA. The expansion of these clauses threatens to undermine       Americans' ability to challenge wrongful coverage denials in       the courts. Congress must act to ensure that ERISA       beneficiaries' rights are protected. In particular,       arbitration clauses would require beneficiaries to bring       individual arbitrations to challenge even widespread policies       that adversely impact thousands of individuals. Not only       would such an individual arbitration process provide no       ability to compel insurers to alter their behavior, allowing       even clear cut misconduct to continue across the board, but       most beneficiaries would be unable to identify attorneys to       bring the claim at all, given that attorneys would have no       financial incentive to do so. Thus, binding arbitration would       only serve the interests of the insurance companies at the       clear expense of ERISA beneficiaries.        The Employee and Retiree Access to Justice Act also       addresses the unfairness of ERISA plans requiring       beneficiaries to litigate their claims subject to an       impossibly high burden of proof. By inserting ``discretionary       clauses'' into their plan policies, ERISA plans grant       themselves broad discretion to interpret the meaning of the       terms of the policies they administer and the facts they       consider when adjudicating benefits under these policies.       Many ERISA plans use discretionary clauses as a strategy to       evade liability for improperly denying benefits, particularly       for mental health and substance use disorders, because       discretionary clauses obligate courts to broadly defer to       insurers' coverage determinations. (See Firestone Tire &       Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 115 (1989).) Under the       deferential standard of review, courts only reverse benefit       denials that are found to be ``arbitrary and capricious''--      even if they are incorrect determinations. In contrast, under       state law, where insurers are generally not deemed to be       fiduciaries, such deference is not granted. Instead, courts       apply the ordinary, civil standard of de novo review and       reverse insurers' benefit determinations that are wrong on       the merits.        Ironically, the discretion courts grant to ERISA       fiduciaries based on the application of these discretionary       clauses actually conflicts with the underlying purpose of       ERISA. In adopting ERISA, Congress made clear that it was       designed ``to protect interstate commerce and the interests       of participants in employee benefit plans and their       beneficiaries, . . . by establishing standards of conduct,       responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee       benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies,       sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.'' (29       U.S.C. 1001(b)). Thus, while ERISA was intended to place a       heightened duties on fiduciaries, discretionary clauses have       instead shielded fiduciaries from accountability for their       misconduct--a perverse result given the legislative history.        A recent example of the perverse impact of the judicially-      created, deferential standard of review is Wit v. United       Behavioral Health, No. 14-CV-02346-JCS, 2019 WL 1033730 (N.D.       Cal. Mar. 5, 2019), rev'd, 2022 WL 850647 (9th Cir. Mar. 22,       2022), an ERISA case that has been recognized nationwide as a       landmark for mental health patients. Despite a devastating       100-9page plus trial decision, which found that United       Behavioral Health had breached its fiduciary duties by       placing its own financial interests over the needs of its       beneficiaries by denying nearly 70,000 claims based on       substandard medical necessity guidelines that conflicted with       generally accepted standards of care (``GASC''), in express       violation of plan terms and the laws of four states, a 9th       Circuit panel recently reversed that decision in a sparse,       seven-page decision.        In reversing this landmark decision, the panel completely       ignored detailed and extensive findings of fact, including       that UBH had lied to regulators about its medical necessity       guidelines and that its financial officers had vetoed UBH       clinicians' unanimous preference to use non-profit guidelines       that would have complied with GASC solely because the change       would cost more money for  [[Page H8242]]       UBH. Instead, the panel reversed this important holding       solely based on the standard of review, finding that it was       ``not unreasonable'' for UBH to interpret its ERISA plans to       allow it to apply medical necessity guidelines that were       substantially more restrictive than generally accepted       standards of care.        In other words, the panel did not determine if using       medical necessity guidelines that were more restrictive than       GASC was actually consistent with the plan terms, nor did it       consider whether UBH's actions to place its own interest       above that of its insureds violated its fiduciary duties, but       instead it simply deferred to UBH's conclusions. As a result,       if allowed to stand, tens of thousands of insureds will lose       their ability to challenge UBH's denials, and it--and other       insurers--will be able to continue using overly restrictive       medical necessity guidelines going forward. This proposed       statute is required to prevent such a travesty from happening       in the future.        Nationally, there is a clear movement by states regulating       fully insured ERISA plans to ban discretionary clauses. In       fact, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners       (NAIC) has adopted a model law entitled the ``Prohibition on       the Use of Discretionary Clauses Model Act.'' The NAIC       describes the purpose of the model act to prohibit       discretionary clauses ``to assure that health insurance       benefits and disability income protection coverage are       contractually guaranteed, and to avoid the conflict of       interest that occurs when the carrier responsible for       providing benefits has discretionary authority to decide when       benefits are due.'' Recognizing the pernicious effects of       discretionary clauses in insurance policies, nearly half of       states have banned these clauses.        Because discretionary clauses are a powerful tool that       insurers have to self-justify coverage decisions, such       clauses have become ubiquitous. Where they are allowed to       stand, patients are at a terrible disadvantage in challenging       wrongful denials of healthcare coverage. This is because, in       turning to the courts to challenge wrongful denials of       benefits, patients must overcome a very high evidentiary bar       by proving that their insurers' determinations were       ``arbitrary and capricious.'' This is true even if courts       believe that, on an equal weighing of the evidence, the       insurers' determinations were inconsistent with the terms of       the insurance policies and/or relevant facts known to the       insurers. As the NAIC recognizes, this paradoxically means       that coverage promised in insurance policies is not       necessarily contractually guaranteed.        Federal Circuit Courts have articulated the unfairness that       can result from applying a discretionary review in benefits       cases, while various federal trial courts have noted that the       standard of review in benefits matters is determinative and       that the abuse of discretion standards of review permits       incorrect outcomes.        If discretionary clauses were prohibited for ERISA plans       such outrageous scenarios would no longer be permitted,       because patients would have their claims adjudicated using an       equitable de novo standard of review (meaning from the       beginning, or without deference to the insurer's decision).       This standard means that courts give patients and insurers       equal consideration when deciding whether the insurers'       coverage determinations were wrongful. The evidentiary       standards applied by courts in benefit cases are not       academic. Time and time again, the effect of discretionary       clauses is that patients have little or no recourse for       wrongful benefit determinations.        We urge you to support these critical provisions to help       ensure mental health and addiction parity and protect more       than 130 million Americans' coverage rights under ERISA.
