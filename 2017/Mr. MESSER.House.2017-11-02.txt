 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for his  hard work on this topic.   Mr. Speaker, Hoosiers continue to suffer under the negative impacts  of ObamaCare each and every day. Despite the House keeping its promise  to repeal this disastrous law, the Senate has failed to act.   But, fortunately, we have an opportunity today to make a difference,  to protect our seniors, and to get rid of one of ObamaCare's worst  provisions: the Independent Payment Advisory Board, better known as the  IPAB.   This board consists of 15 unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats who  have the power to ration healthcare for our seniors without any  congressional oversight. For an individual patient, this board has the  power to make your healthcare decisions for you, and that is not fair.   This bill will change that. It disbands the board and ensures our  seniors continue to have access to their healthcare that they need.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to roll back this dangerous  ObamaCare provision and to support this commonsense legislation.
