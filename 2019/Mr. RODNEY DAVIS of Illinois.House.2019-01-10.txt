 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  the life of my friend and hobby radio control industry legend, Joe  Ambrose, who passed away unexpectedly on Friday.   Joe was a lifelong resident of central Illinois and a graduate of the  University of Illinois. He joined Horizon Hobby in Champaign in 2005 as  vice president and in 2008 he became CEO, where he successfully grew  the business over the next decade. This past year he led the largest  acquisition in radio control industry history through the purchase of  crosstown competitor Hobbico RC.   Joe and his company were leading voices for establishing the micro  UAS regulations, hosting myself and other stakeholders in June of 2016  for a roundtable on the topic. Horizon Hobby also participated in the  FAA's UAS Aviation Rulemaking Committee. That group ultimately  developed recommendations for performance-based regulations to allow  certain unmanned aircraft to operate over people.   Joe made things happen in this institution. His visionary leadership  will be missed, and I extend my deepest condolences to his wife, Julie,  their four children, and eight grandchildren.                            ____________________
