 Mr. Speaker, today we commemorate the  birthday of a monumental figure in our Nation's history, Thomas  Jefferson.   Jefferson, who was our third President, was the principal author of  the U.S. Declaration of Independence, and is known as one of the  country's founding farmers--Founding Fathers. He was a founding farmer  also.   Today marks the 275th anniversary of his birth. He played a  monumental role in shaping American politics.   While his legacy is not without complication, Thomas Jefferson  projected a down-to-Earth attitude and desired to be seen as a common  man.   An intellectual, architect, philosopher, musician, and essayist, he  was anything but common.   He founded the University of Virginia in 1819. The university has  kept the Jeffersonian values--discussion, collaboration, and  enlightenment--relevant today. Its mission is to develop tomorrow's  leaders and to ensure that they are well prepared to help shape the  future of the Nation and the world.   Students in Charlottesville will use Founder's Day to reflect on  Thomas Jefferson's legacy and also acknowledge the growth that has been  made in its history.   Mr. Speaker, on this day, we remember a Founding Father, Thomas  Jefferson, and all the contributions he made to this great Nation.                            ____________________
