 Mr. Speaker, on rollcall Nos. 66 (motion to suspend the  rules and pass, as amended, H.R. 374), and 67 (motion to suspend the  rules and pass, as amended, H.R. 538) I did not cast my vote. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on both of the votes.                            ____________________
