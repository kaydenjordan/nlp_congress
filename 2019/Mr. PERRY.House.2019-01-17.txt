 Madam Speaker, folks in the audience, and folks that are  watching this on TV, this is all theater. This is all just political  theater.   Everybody knows. I know. My good friends on the other side of the  aisle know that this isn't going to solve anything. This is not a  solution.   If we were serious about solving this, we wouldn't be voting on  another bill here that doesn't fix anything, that is never going to be  moved through the Senate, that is never going to be signed by the  President.   If we were interested in opening the Federal Government, we would be  negotiating. We would be talking about what our differences are about  border security.   Remember, this is a bill that includes the funding for border  security. That is why we have this partial shutdown, because we have a  disagreement about border security. And we are trying to work it out,  but we can't work it out just by running the same bills that don't do  anything and that are never going to move through the Senate and aren't  going to be signed by the President.   It is time to get serious.   Last year, this government was shut down for a few days over amnesty.  Now it is shut down because the other side doesn't want to talk about  border security. You put amnesty and the lack of border security  together, and that is open borders. That is completely open borders.   Just on the news, if you were watching the last couple days, more  caravans heading north out of Central America through Mexico to the  United States border. That is what is happening right now while our  Border Patrol agents are out there working but not being paid.   Here come these folks. We don't know what their circumstances are. I  am sure there are a lot of fine people in there. I am sure there are  children in there, and the horrors that they are going to suffer on  this trek north up through the desert in these points between the  points of entry.   Madam Speaker, the most recent numbers out of Homeland Security in  November, 51,000 people--that is the ones we caught--51,000 people came  across the border between the ports of entry.   If they were coming to the ports of entry, this wouldn't be half of a  problem, but the problem is they are coming between the ports of entry.  That is one month, 51,000. And those are the ones we caught. We don't  have any idea how many other ones made it through.   And yet some folks are saying: Well, we are going to give you an  extra billion dollars to fix this problem.   It is not an extra billion. It is the same billion, and it is to fix  problems at the ports of entry.   Madam Speaker, the problem is between the ports of entry and the  ports of entry. But we are not going to do anything about the ports of  entry. The billion dollars we are talking about is to muddle around and  maintain things at the ports of entry but do nothing between the ports  of entry, nothing at all. That is the status quo.   That is why we are in this argument, because we are saying we cannot  withstand, we cannot maintain the status quo of 51,000 people a month  coming illegally across our border and do nothing.   We are pleading with the other side: Please, let's do something.  Let's do something different than the status quo, because the status  quo gives us 51,000 people coming illegally across the border.   And they are saying: Well, we are just going to run the same bill to  open the government and do nothing.   We cannot abide that. The American people cannot abide that.   People are working, Madam Speaker, without being paid while people  pour across our border, and we are expecting them to stop them. They  don't have the resources because we are not providing them.   It is time to end this needless show of work. We are here working,  right? We are all here working. We are not doing anything to solve the  problem.   What it is going to take is somebody to sit down at the table and  say, ``Look. See here. This is what I think the issue is,'' and find  some solution somewhere in the middle. But you can't do that if you are  not willing to have a discussion.   We are asking to have a discussion so we can get past this, so people  can get paid and the American people can be assured that their  government is securing their border, their property, their country, and  stopping all these illegal immigrants from coming in; and making sure  that, if they are going to come in--and we are a country of immigrants.   My grandmother, my great-grandmother came here from Colombia, South  America, with the shirts on their backs. They came through Ellis Island  because we had a process. We are all immigrants, and we welcome  immigrants more than any other country on the planet, but we want you  to come legally.   We have a process. We don't want you to just pour across the border  into our country with gang-related violence, with fentanyl, with  opioids that are killing people in our own communities, all these drugs  and crimes and violence. We are asking you to come to the ports of  entry and quit pouring in between the ports of entry. But our laws now  invite them to do that, which is why they are coming.   So I just beseech you, Madam Speaker--and I thank you for your  indulgence and for your time--let's quit this show. Let's quit this  charade. Let's quit this theater. Let's get serious for the people who  are working, for the American people who expect more, and get down to  negotiation, come to a solution, and move on with things, the important  things that plague our Nation.    Madam Speaker, I rise in recognition of the tens of  thousands who will march in support of life tomorrow in Washington,  D.C.   On the 22nd of this month, we will mark the infamous anniversary of  the misguided Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, which legalized  abortion, without restriction, nationwide.   Since the 1973 decision, more than 54 million children have been  murdered in the United States alone. This is the epic tragedy of our  time, and we must stand up for the unborn.   We stand in solidarity with those marching and are determined to  defend the sanctity of human life. We thank them for sharing their  convictions with dauntless courage.                            ____________________
