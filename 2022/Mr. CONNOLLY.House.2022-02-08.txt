 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Maloney for her  leadership, as well as Ranking Member Comer. I am also proud as an  original cosponsor of this bill and as the chairman of the subcommittee  with jurisdiction over postal issues.   This bill contains provisions that, when taken together, will right  the course of the Postal Service, returning it to solvency and removing  undue burdens that have mired it in debt for 16 years.   Much of the blame for the Postal Service's financial struggle rests  squarely here in Congress. In 2003, Congress enacted the Postal  Accountability and Enhancement Act, requiring the Postal Service to  make annual, exorbitant prepayments into its retiree health benefits  fund, a requirement required of no other entity in the United States.  These payments kept the Postal Service from profitability for years,  since 2006.   To be sure, this prepayment is not the only issue plaguing the Postal  Service's financial posture in an increasingly online and digital  society. But as the ranking member indicated, what this bill does do is  takes care of that red ink that we are responsible for and puts the  Postal Service in a position to buy time to develop a 21st century  business model that will work and will continue to serve the American  people.   We owe a debt of gratitude to postal workers who have, every day  during this pandemic, served every household and every business in  America on time and reliably, in terms of providing that lifeline and  that one constant in our lives that we depend on.   This bill is going to shore that up and buttress that. It represents  a bipartisan compromise that is long overdue, and I salute the  leadership of our committee, our chairwoman and our ranking member, in  being able to forge that bipartisan coalition that allows us to address  this issue today in a meaningful way and to pass this bill.
