 Madam Chair, I would like to speak on this amendment  and make a few points.   Madam Chair, it is true the public health establishment is opposed to  this amendment. It is also true, if you look at the amount of allergies  out there, the amount of some other diseases that are affecting young  kids, to some degree, the public health establishment is dropping the  ball, and I don't think we can trust them entirely.   In my district, there is a substantial number of people who drink raw  milk, and I would say it is tilted strongly towards people with a  scientific background; chiropractors, nurses, veterinarians are the  ones who feel strongest about drinking raw milk.   My final comment is I like to talk to people from foreign countries  about the differences between their country and this country. Last  year, I talked to a diplomat from Northern Europe and I asked him what  the best and worst things about America were. To my surprise, he said  the worst thing about America is the difficulty in getting  unpasteurized cheese and unpasteurized milk.   Madam Chair, I thought it was a shame that America, the land of the  free--when people come here from Europe, we are supposed to be freer in  the United States. A complaint from people in Europe where you can  drink unpasteurized milk, raw milk is that we don't have those freedoms  in America.   Madam Chair, I think it is a great amendment for people who believe  in freedom. And like I said, the people in my district who drink raw  milk are the most informed on health issues.
