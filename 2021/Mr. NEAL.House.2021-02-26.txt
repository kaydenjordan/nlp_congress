 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, more than a year has passed since the coronavirus was  first detected in the United States. In that time, we have lost over  half a million people to this relentless virus. We are a nation in  mourning for our lost loved ones, our neighbors, and, indeed, our  colleagues.   As we mourn, much of American life is unrecognizable. Millions of  Americans have lost their jobs, their safety, and their security, and  10 million jobs that were lost have not been returned.   This is the hard reality across this Nation and in every single  congressional district across our country.   Through all this pain, our care for one another is still  recognizable. We have seen this in the countless hours our health  heroes have spent caring for the sick. We have seen other essential  workers who have kept our grocery aisles stocked and our mail  delivered. We have seen the care of neighbors, indeed, helping  neighbors.   Today, Congress acts in the same spirit of care for our fellow  Americans by delivering on the relief our constituents, always with  humility, have been asking for.   This is not about dollars and cents. This is about lives that are at  stake. We can save them by passing this bill. We will get shots into  arms faster. We will help families stay housed and, indeed, put food on  their tables. Most importantly, this package will help families avoid  impossible choices.   The Ways and Means Committee, which has written half of this  legislation--and I must tell you, in all my years, I am really proud of  what we did, and a reminder that it was the CARES Act that saved the  American economy 1 year ago. Full of proven policies, it will fight  both for public health and, simultaneously, the economic crisis.   We will not get back to economic recovery until we defeat this virus.   We are balancing immediate relief and sustained support to keep  Americans afloat and ready to bounce back stronger than ever. We will  make good on our promise of an additional $2,000 from the $1,400 that  we promised. We will enhance and expand the refundable tax credits for  low- and middle-income workers and their families.   Combined, these benefits will provide an average income boost of 33  percent for the poorest 20 percent of American households. This will be  life-changing, and it will lift millions of children in this Nation out  of poverty.   For families, this bill offers massive savings in childcare expenses,  which have been a major barrier to returning to the workforce,  particularly for women.   For millions of jobless Americans, we are ensuring that they can  afford life's necessities until this economy rebounds by extending  pandemic-related unemployment benefits and increasing that benefit.   Access to affordable, comprehensive healthcare is critical, so we  have included provisions to contain costs, particularly for unemployed  workers. We will include help for nursing homes to crush the virus.   Mr. Speaker, we shored up the multiemployer pension plans, and you  should know I am really proud of that as well. Thirty Republicans in  this House have voted for this legislation on two different occasions.  Those plans were jeopardized by COVID, and we intend to correct that.   Delaying is not an option. This is an opportunity to take bold action  that will keep struggling Americans afloat and give them the peace of  mind that better days are still to come.                                time  0020    For those who ask, Is this too much?   The answer is, No.   Economists left, right, and center have agreed with what we are about  to do. They know that too little is not enough as we fight the  pandemic. We will continue to fight the virus like the grave enemy that  it is and give people a fighting chance to make it through the  pandemic. And we must give them a chance for opportunity as we get to  the other side, and that is what we intend to do with this legislation.   I remind my colleagues that this is not the time for partisan rancor.  And I  [[Page H842]]  must say that the debate in the Ways and Means Committee was superb. We  must go big. We must be bold. And we must rise to this challenge  because the American people this evening are counting on us.   Mr. Speaker, I support this plan, and I urge the rest of our  colleagues to support it as well, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation providing a technical  explanation of section 9674 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,  and request that the Joint Committee post the letter on their website  as well.                                     Congress of the United States,                                     Joint Committee on Taxation,                                  Washington, DC, February 26, 2021.      Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: You asked the staff of the Joint       Committee on Taxation to prepare a technical explanation of a       provision to modify the exceptions for reporting third party       network transactions provided by Internal Revenue Code       section 6050W. The specific legislative text is new section       9674 of subtitle G of title IX of the American Rescue Plan       Act of 2021, as amended by the proposed manager's amendment.        Enclosed please find the Joint Committee staff's       description of present law and technical explanation of this       proposal.            Sincerely,                                                Thomas A. Barthold,                                                    Chief of Staff.        Enclosure.   Technical Explanation of the Modification of Exceptions of Reporting  Third Party Network Transactions in New Section 9674 of Subtitle IX of     the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, as Amended by the Proposed                            Manager's Amendment    (Prepared by the Staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, Feb. 26,                                   2021)       Modifications of Exceptions for Reporting Third Party Network                                Transactions                                 Present Law         Present law requires persons to file an information return       concerning certain transactions with other persons. The       person filing an information return is also required to       provide the recipient of the payment with a written statement       showing the aggregate payments made and the contact       information for the payor. These returns are intended to       assist taxpayers in preparing their income tax returns and to       help the IRS determine whether such income tax returns are       correct and complete.        Returns relating to payments made in settlement of payment       card and third party network transactions:        Starting in 2012 (for payments received in 2011), payment       settlement entities are required to report the gross amount       of payments made in settlement of payment card transactions       and third party network transactions to the IRS and to       businesses that receive these payments.        Specifically, the statute requires any payment settlement       entity making a payment to a participating payee in       settlement of reportable payment transactions to report       annually to the IRS and to the participating payee the gross       amount of such reportable payment transactions, as well as       the name, address, and TIN of the participating payees. A       ``reportable payment transaction'' means any payment card       transaction and any third party network transaction.        A ``payment settlement entity'' means, in the case of a       payment card transaction, a merchant acquiring entity and, in       the case of a third party network transaction, a third party       settlement organization. A ``participating payee'' means, in       the case of a payment card transaction, any person who       accepts a payment card as payment and, in the case of a third       party network transaction, any person who accepts payment       from a third party settlement organization in settlement of       such transaction.        For purposes of the reporting requirement, the term       ``merchant acquiring entity'' means a bank or other       organization with the contractual obligation to make payment       to participating payees in settlement of payment card       transactions. A ``payment card transaction'' means any       transaction in which a payment card is accepted as payment? A       ``payment card'' is defined as any card (e.g., a credit card       or debit card) which is issued pursuant to an agreement or       arrangement which provides for: (1) one or more issuers of       such cards; (2) a network of persons purpose, unrelated to       each other, and to the issuer, who agree to accept such cards       as payment; and (3) standards and mechanisms for settling the       transactions between the merchant acquiring entities and the       persons who agree to accept such cards as payment. Thus,       under the provision, a bank that enrolls a business to accept       credit cards and contracts with the business to make payment       on credit card transactions is required to report to the IRS       the business's gross credit card transactions for each       calendar year on a Form 1099-K, Payment Card and Third Party       Network Transactions. The bank also is required to provide a       copy of the information report to the business.        The statute also requires reporting on a third party       network transaction. The term  [[Page H843]]       ``third party network transaction'' means any transaction       which is settled through a third party payment network. A       ``third party payment network'' is defined as any agreement       or arrangement: (1) that involves the establishment of       accounts with a central organization by a substantial number       of persons (e.g., more than 50) who are unrelated to such       organization, provide goods or services, and have agreed to       settle transactions for the provision of such goods or       services pursuant to such agreement or arrangement; (2) that       provides for standards and mechanisms for settling such       transactions; and (3) that guarantees persons providing goods       or services pursuant to such agreement or arrangement that       such persons will be paid for providing such goods or       services. In the case of a third party network transaction,       the payment settlement entity is the third party settlement       organization, which is defined as the central organization       which has the contractual obligation to make payment to       participating payees of third party network transactions.       Thus, an organization generally is required to report if it       provides a network enabling buyers to transfer funds to       sellers who have established accounts with the organization       and have a contractual obligation to accept payment through       the network. However, an organization operating a network       which merely processes electronic payments (such as wire       transfers, electronic checks, and direct deposit payments)       between buyers and sellers, but does not have contractual       agreements with sellers to use such network, is not required       to report. Similarly, an agreement to transfer funds between       two demand deposit accounts will not, by itself, constitute a       third party network transaction.        A third party payment network does not include any       agreement or arrangement that provides for the issuance of       payment cards as defined by the provision. In addition, there       is an exception for de minimis payments that applies to       payments made by third party settlement organizations but not       to payments made by merchant acquiring entities. A third       party settlement organization is not required to report       unless the aggregate value of third party network       transactions with respect to a taxpayer for the year exceeds       $20,000 and the aggregate number of such transactions with       respect to a taxpayer exceeds 200. If a payment of funds is       made to a third party settlement organization by means of a       payment card (i.e., as part of a payment card transaction),       the $20,000 and 200 transaction de minimis rule continues to       apply to any reporting obi igation with respect to payment of       such funds to a participating payee by the third party       settlement organization made as part of a third party network       transaction.        So, for example, if a business that provides a web-based       rental platform for short-term travelers is considered a       third party settlement organization, it does not have to       provide a Form 1099-K to property owners participating on       their web-based site who have received payments of $20,000       or less. On the other hand, if that company is considered       a merchant acquiring entity, it would have to issue a Form       1099-K to all payees participating on its platform who       have received payments of any amount starting with the       first dollar.        There are also reporting requirements on intermediaries who       receive payments from a payment settlement entity and       distribute such payments to one or more participating payees.       Such intermediaries are treated as participating payees with       respect to the payment settlement entity and as payment       settlement entities with respect to the participating payees       to whom the intermediary distributes payments. Thus, for       example, in the case of a corporation that receives payment       from a bank for credit card sales effectuated at the       corporation's independently-owned franchise stores, the bank       is required to report the gross amount of reportable payment       transactions settled through the corporation (notwithstanding       the fact that the corporation does not accept payment cards       and would not otherwise be treated as a participating payee).       In turn, the corporation, as an intermediary, would be       required to report the gross amount of reportable payment       transactions allocable to each franchise store. The bank       would have no reporting obligation with respect to payments       made by the corporation to its franchise stores.        Another rule provides that if a payment settlement entity       contracts with a third party to settle reportable payment       transactions on behalf of the payment settlement entity, the       third party is required to file the annual information return       in lieu of the payment settlement entity.        The payment settlement entity is required to file the       information return to the IRS on or before February 28th       (March 31st if filing electronically) of the year following       the calendar year for which the return must be filed. The       statements are required to be furnished to the participating       payees on or before January 31st of the year following the       calendar year for which the return was required to be made.        The Secretary has exercised authority under these rules to       issue guidance to implement the reporting requirement,       including rules to prevent the reporting of the same       transaction more than once.        The reportable payment transactions subject to information       reporting generally are subject to backup withholding       requirements. In addition, the information reporting       penalties apply for any failure to file a correct information       return or furnish a correct payee statement with respect to       the reportable payment transactions. Any person who is       required to file an information return or furnish a payee       statement but who fails to do so on or before the prescribed       due date is subject to a penalty that varies based on when,       if at all, the correct information return is filed or       furnished. There are penalties imposed for failure to file       the information return, furnish payee statements, or comply       with other various reporting requirements. No penalty is       imposed if the failure is due to reasonable cause. Both the       failure to file and failure to furnish penalties are adjusted       annually to account for inflation.                           Explanation of Provision         This provision lowers and modifies the threshold below       which a third party settlement organization is not required       to report payments to participants in its network. Under the       provision, for any calendar year, a third party settlement       organization is required to report third party network       transactions with any participating payee that exceed a       minimum threshold of $600 in aggregate payments, regardless       of the aggregate number of such transactions.        Third party network transactions include any commercial       transactions settled through a third party payment network.       The provision also clarifies that third party network       transactions only include transactions for the provision of       goods or services (e.g., personal gifts, charitable       contributions, and reimbursements are not included).        For example, an individual who has registered for a mobile       payment service and uses such a service to reimburse friends       or relatives for expenses, or on occasion sells a used item       to another person, would not be engaging in transactions that       are subject to reporting requirements. However, if that       individual were to register with such mobile payment service       for the purposes of engaging in commercial transactions, such       as regularly carrying on a trade or business through use of       that service, the mobile payment service would be required to       report under the provision.                                Effective Date         The part of the provision that lowers and modifies the       reporting threshold is effective for returns for calendar       years beginning after December 31, 2021.        The part of the provision that clarifies that reporting is       not required on transactions which are not for goods or       services is effective for transactions after the date of       enactment.    Mr. Speaker, let me also note on this proud day that it  happens to be the 95th anniversary of the creation of the Joint  Committee on Taxation, and throughout its history it has provided the  Committee on Ways and Means with invaluable advice, and I suspect that  is something we can all agree on.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), who is a member of the Ways and Means  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, the residents of my district and of districts all over  America are jumping for joy. They are jumping because they see this  bill like manna from heaven. There is money for COVID testing; money  for vaccines; money for their pockets; money to help reopen schools;  unemployment checks; tax credits for children; money for hospitals,  health centers, nursing homes, daycare centers, State, county, and  local governments; money for poor families, poor children, homeless  youth, small businesses, restaurants, rental assistance and mortgage  payments so they can stay in their homes. You name it, Mr. Speaker, it  is in this bill.   Joe Biden to the rescue. Thank God for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, and especially the people in Georgia. I  will vote for this bill. I will vote ``yes.'' Yes, Mr. Speaker, I will  vote to rescue and save America.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez), who is a member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene), a member of the Ways and Means Committee who  has had a profound influence on the child credits in this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me begin by recognizing the extraordinary work that has gone into  this legislation by the Ways and Means Committee staff, the Office of  Legislative Counsel, the Joint Committee on Taxation, and many others:  Morna Miller, Amy Hall, Kara Getz, Andrew Grossman, Melanie Egorin, and  Alice Lin, to name but a few of the superb staff members that we have.   They have worked long hours under immense pressure, all while facing  the same challenges of remote school, lack of child care, and concern  for family members that Americans everywhere face. There are too many  names to include here, but let it be known that your counsel is  unparalleled and your expertise is unmatched.   Mr. Speaker, tonight, we recognize that a half a million people have  died. Millions have been affected by this dreadful disease. Ten million  jobs that were lost have not been returned, and 18 million members of  our family are receiving unemployment benefits. People who never  imagined that they might be relying on a food bank are lining up  weekly, and they are part of the unthinkable number of children that  still go hungry as we meet.   With this legislation, we are taking bold action, and, yes, it is  sweeping. I want to thank Joe Biden for his courage and vision in  helping to bring us to this moment. Yes, it will be costly, but if  crushing this virus and ending the suffering that Americans are  currently facing, if it is not worth this investment, then I ask: What  is?   Over the Speaker's rostrum there is an extraordinary quote by a son  of Massachusetts, and I think that it compels us to this moment. Mr.  Webster asked, ``Let us develop the resources of our land and call  forth its powers and build up its institutions, promote all of its  great interests, and see whether we also in our day and generation may  not perform something worthy to be remembered.''   Tonight, as we vote for this legislation, we are going to achieve  something that will be worthy to be remembered.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter listing business  leaders in support of this bill      180 Business Leaders Sign in Support of the American Rescue Plan                       (By Jana Plat, Feb. 24, 2021)         Washington, DC--Today, 180 CEOs issued a public letter to       leaders of Congress, urging rapid, bipartisan adoption of a       stimulus package on the model of the American Rescue Plan.       The following is the text of the letter and the full list of       signatories.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, Minority       Leader McConnell and Minority Leader McCarthy: We write to       urge immediate and large-scale federal legislation to address       the health and economic crises brought on by the COVID-19       pandemic. More than a year after the first coronavirus case       was reported in the United States, our nation is still       struggling to combat the spread and reverse its economic       fallout.        Previous federal relief measures have been essential, but       more must be done to put the country on a trajectory for a       strong, durable recovery. Congress should act swiftly and on       a bipartisan basis to authorize a stimulus and relief package       along the lines of the Biden-Harris administration's proposed       American Rescue Plan.        Strengthening the public health response to coronavirus is       the first step toward economic restoration. The American       Rescue Plan mobilizes a national vaccination program,       delivers economic relief to struggling families, and supports       communities that were most damaged by the pandemic.        More than 10 million fewer Americans are working today than       when the pandemic began, small businesses across the country       are facing bankruptcy, and schools are struggling to reopen.       The most vulnerable Americans--including women, people of       color and low wage workers--are experiencing the worst of the       pandemic, with unprecedented job loss, childcare burdens and       food insecurity. States and cities have been crushed by       pandemic-related expenses and revenue losses.        The American Rescue Plan provides a framework for       coordinated public-private efforts to overcome COVID-19 and       to move forward with a new era of inclusive growth. The       country's business community is prepared to work with you to       achieve these critical objectives.
