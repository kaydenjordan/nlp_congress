 Madam Speaker, like millions of people  around the world, in 2020, I tested positive for COVID. I was  fortunate. After several days in the hospital and 14 days on oxygen, I  was able to recover. Many were not.    Americans and the rest of the world deserve to know exactly where  this virus started and any details surrounding the origins of the virus  that launched the globe into chaos.   If the CCP was not fully transparent during these times, people need  to know that, as well. How long did they cover it up? How long did they  know that this virus had been unleashed?   If we are going to defeat the Communist Chinese Party, our government  has to be transparent about how malicious they have become. The U.S.  and other freedom-loving Nations are going to have to join together to  make sure that we expose their intent to the world.   I believe that we all have the right to know about the origins of  COVID-19, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to  require the Director of National Intelligence to declassify any of the  information that we have on the origins of COVID and the CCP.
