 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer my amendment to  prohibit funding for President Biden's Executive Order No. 14019,  titled: ``Executive Order on Promoting Access to Voting.''   This executive order requires Federal agencies to use their power,  influence, resources, and funding to enter into agreements with  nongovernmental organizations to conduct voter registration and other  questionable mobilization activities.   Mr. Chair, this executive order is nothing but a thinly veiled  attempt to transform the Federal Government into a partisan get-out- the-vote machine for Democrats.   America's civil service should be nonpartisan, and Federal agencies  should not be using taxpayer funds to actively engage in get-out-the- vote operations that have nothing to do with the agency's core  missions.   Mr. Chair, President Biden should not be weaponizing the Federal  Government by using American taxpayer dollars to manipulate our  elections.   To protect the integrity of our elections, this unilateral executive  action must be stopped.   As the founder and chair of the Election Integrity Caucus, it is my  privilege to introduce this amendment to restore transparency and  confidence in our democratic process while keeping Federal bureaucrats  and the swamp from deliberately tipping the balance at the ballot box.   While I wholeheartedly support the right of every American citizen to  vote, I do not support this blatantly partisan mobilization of the  Federal Government for political purposes. No citizen should have their  vote diluted by Federal bureaucrats.   Mr. Chair, let me highlight a few other amendments I submitted that I  was disappointed were not made in order that are worthy of mention.  [[Page H5852]]    First, my amendment No. 93 would insert the text of the Susan Muffley  Act into this bill. This amendment would have righted a grave injustice  against over 20,000 Delphi salaried retirees. While I am disappointed  it was not made in order, I will continue to push tirelessly to make my  constituents and all the Delphi salaried employees whole.   Second, my amendment No. 97 would have required the Secretary of  Labor to report on the efficacy of spending on technical and compliance  assistance to avoid heat-related illnesses. This report was first  proposed by the Timothy J. Barber Act, which I introduced in honor of  my late constituent, Timothy Barber, who passed away from heat-related  illnesses.   Finally, Representative Bishop's amendment No. 150, which I  cosponsored, to restore Job Corps funding--while I am very disappointed  that Job Corps was left unfunded in this bill, I hope that Congress can  find a way to restore Job Corps funding through conference committees.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to vote in support of my  election integrity amendment to stop the Biden administration from  turning our Federal Government into a get-out-the-vote machine for the  Democrats.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to the gentlewoman  from Connecticut, none of the specious political falsities that she  just described have anything to do with enhancing the right of each  citizen to vote in each election.   This is an inappropriate and unconstitutional federalization of  elections, something that is prohibited by the Constitution that every  single person in this room has taken an oath to uphold.   Nothing has been more devastating to election integrity than the kind  of interference and mission creep that we are seeing by this weaponized  Biden administration to try to take our elections and try to manipulate  the vote.   One citizen, one vote is the most sacred honor that we have as  citizens. This needs to be protected under our Constitution. Election  integrity is definitely considered under the purview of the States.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0040     Mr. Chair, quickly, with all due respect, this amendment  has nothing to do with what the gentlewoman is talking about. It has  nothing to do with whether our military personnel, including my own  son, have the right to vote in elections.   This has to do with the weaponization and use of taxpayer dollars to  interfere with and manipulate elections. It should not be part of our  Federal spending. It should not be something that should be used by  partisans in the bureaucracy to try to prime the pump to get more  Democrats out to vote and to use it as a get-out-the-vote scheme. It is  totally inappropriate.   This amendment should be passed by my colleagues, and this executive  order should be stricken.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
