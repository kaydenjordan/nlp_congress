 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from North  Carolina for her leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my strong support for H.R. 1101, the  Small Business Health Fairness Act. I thank my colleagues from Ways and  Means and from the Education and the Workforce Committee for getting  this great idea onto paper and moving this bill forward today.   As chairman of the House Small Business Committee, I am always very  appreciative to see Members from across this body find solutions for  small businesses. That is exactly what this bill is.   For virtually any one of us in this Chamber, it can be said that  hundreds of thousands of our constituents depend on small businesses  for their livelihoods. They have been looking to those same small  businesses for options, as ObamaCare has done the opposite of what it  was supposed to do and it has diminished choices for workers.   By allowing small businesses to join together through association  health plans, the Small Business Health Fairness Act would give small  business employees at least as many choices as those who happen to work  for larger companies.   Association health plans have long been a solution suggested by small  businesses that share their views with me and other members of the  Small Business Committee. This bill puts that idea finally into action.   Mr. Speaker, in our current state of affairs, there are fewer and  fewer healthcare options available for hardworking Americans. This bill  addresses that problem for our hardest hit small businesses and  communities.   While we begin the hard work of making health care not only  affordable but worth buying at all, this bill is an important step in  giving Americans the certainty and choices that they want. I would urge  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill.
