 Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, we received a briefing  as to what was going on in the Russia-Ukraine war, and we heard of the  callousness with which President Putin treats his own troops.   Indeed, 20,000 Russian troops recently died to take a city that was  apparently of no important significance.   I thought, how could a President be so callous knowing that when one  of these troops died, his parents, his siblings, and perhaps his  children are left behind?   Then it occurred to me that here in the United States of America, we  had 109,000 people die of illegal drugs last year, most of it fentanyl,  and our President seems to be willing to do almost nothing.   Mr. Speaker, since almost all the drugs are coming across the  southern border, with 109,000 people dying every year, wouldn't you  figure it is a priority to close the border? No.  [[Page H2588]]    Wouldn't you think it is a priority to arrest or put in prison those  people who are selling these drugs? No.   The major concern is to leave the border open and not put any more  people in prison.   By the way, as far as the ability to prevent people from selling the  drugs and putting them in prison, how many people died of fentanyl last  year in China? None. Why? Because the minute they try to sell it, they  would be in prison.   In any event, I call upon President Biden to finally address the  fentanyl crisis.                            ____________________
