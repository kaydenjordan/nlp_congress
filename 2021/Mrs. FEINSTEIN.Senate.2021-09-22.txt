 Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the ``Small  Passenger Vessel Liability Fairness Act of 2021.''   This bill would help the families of 34 people who were tragically  killed in the Conception boat fire off the coast of Santa Cruz Island,  California on September 2, 2019, and other victims and their families  of similar tragedies. This was the worst maritime disaster in modern  California history, and my thoughts continue to be with the victims and  their loved ones.   In December of last year, my bill, the Small Passenger Vessel Safety  Act, passed as part of the annual National Defense Authorization Act.  It goes a long way toward improving passenger vessel safety, but the  families of the victims are still unable to seek compensation for the  great loss of life they have suffered.   The victims of the Conception boat fire were killed when a fire  started onboard the boat, while passengers and crewmembers were  sleeping below deck after a nighttime swim.   The National Transportation Safety Board's final investigation report  for the fire indicates that the victims were awake and trying to escape  before they were overcome with smoke. Both exits from the bunkroom were  blocked by flames, and coroner reports list smoke inhalation as the  cause of death for all passengers.   The same NTSB investigation also determined that the owner and  operator of the boat was at fault for failing to provide effective  safety oversight. There was no roving watchman as required, the  emergency procedures were not properly followed, and the Coast Guard  failed to enforce safety requirements.   The families of the victims of the Conception boat fire have filed  claims against the owners of the boat for violating federal safety  rules. However, due to an outdated maritime liability law, The  Limitation of Liability Act of 1851, the owner of the vessel may not be  financially liable for any of the losses incurred as a result of the  fire, including the enormous loss of life. My bill would address this  issue.   How the bill would help:   My bill would amend the outdated law to allow families of victims to  bring claims against owners of small passenger vessels found to be  liable for maritime accidents such as the Conception boat fire, and  receive proper compensation for their suffering. It would require small  passenger vessels to be governed by liability laws that allow for  victims to receive compensation.   I am very appreciative of the NTSB and Board Member Jennifer Homendy  and the Coast Guard's responsiveness to several safety recommendations  issued by the NTSB, and for their feedback on this bill. I am  especially appreciative to the families of the Conception boat fire  victims for bringing this issue to my attention, and for their tireless  efforts to improve maritime safety and ensure just compensation for  future victims.   This bill would provide a long overdue update to an outdated law. It  is critical that Congress pass it in a timely manner, so as to ensure  families of the 34 victims may have their day in court and that future  victims of similar tragedies can also seek justice.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Tillis, Mr.          Johnson, Mr. Braun, Mr. Hagerty, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Cramer, Mrs.          Capito, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Hoeven, and Mr. Inhofe):   S. 2809.
