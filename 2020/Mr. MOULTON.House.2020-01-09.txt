 Mr. Speaker, the system of checks and balances is  broken. Last week's airstrike proves it.   After the strike, the administration produced a vague document that  attempts justifying America's push to the brink of war.   Mr. Speaker, I fought in a war started by a President with false and  trumped-up intelligence. We cannot let this President do the same.    Americans deserve to read the declassified report so they can judge  for themselves whether the strike was worth the risk. They will find an  administration shooting from the hip with no strategy to deal with  Iran.   It is time for Congress to lead and exercise the authority the  Founders gave us in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution.   It is time to tell the President he cannot send our troops to war  with Iran without a strategy and without the consent of their  representatives.
