 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 128) supporting respect for human  rights and encouraging inclusive governance in Ethiopia, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 128         Whereas the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia has       been an important partner of the United States and a regional       leader in promoting economic growth, global health, and peace       and security;  [[Page H3070]]         Whereas Ethiopia has helped advance the national interests       of the United States and regional partners, including through       contributions to international peacekeeping, combating       radical Islamist extremism and other forms of terrorism, and       regional cooperation through the African Union;        Whereas Ethiopia has made great strides in addressing       significant challenges in global health, child survival, and       food security;        Whereas Ethiopia's transition from authoritarian rule to       participatory democracy has not kept pace with other reforms;        Whereas the ruling Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary       Democratic Front (EPRDF) claimed to win 99.6 percent of the       vote in elections that were deemed neither free nor fair in       2010 and all 546 parliamentary seats in 2015, thereby further       consolidating the EPRDF's single party rule;        Whereas the Charities and Societies Proclamation and Anti-      Terrorism Proclamation, both enacted in 2009, have       accelerated the contraction of democratic space, severely       limited the practice of fundamental human rights, enabled       abuses by security forces, and impeded efforts to promote       accountability for such abuses in Ethiopia;        Whereas government forces launched a violent crackdown on       protests by ethnic Oromo and Amhara over their perceived       marginalization in 2015, resulting in hundreds of deaths and       tens of thousands of arrests;        Whereas the Government of Ethiopia has recently released       hundreds of political prisoners, but has continued to       periodically detain government critics and opposition       figures;        Whereas the Government of Ethiopia has periodically imposed       a state of emergency that even further restricts freedoms of       assembly, association, and expression, including through       blockage of mobile internet access and social media       communication;        Whereas the 2017 Department of State Country Report on       Human Rights Practices for Ethiopia cited serious human       rights violations, including arbitrary arrests, killings, and       torture committed by security forces, restrictions on freedom       of expression and freedom of association, politically       motivated trials, harassment, and intimidation of opposition       members and journalists; and        Whereas these persistent human right abuses, including       state-sponsored violence against civilians in the Oromia,       Amhara, and Somali regions of Ethiopia, as well as the abuse       of laws to stifle journalistic freedoms, stand in direct       contrast to democratic principles, violate the Constitution       of Ethiopia, and undermine Ethiopia's position as a regional       leader for economic growth, peace, and security: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) recognizes and commends Ethiopia's efforts to promote       regional peace and security, including through the       contribution of peacekeeping forces to regional and United       Nations peacekeeping operations;        (2) recognizes the importance of continued United States       and Ethiopian partnership in combatting terrorism, promoting       economic growth and opportunity, and addressing global health       challenges;        (3) notes with deep concern persistent reports of       widespread human rights abuses and the contraction of       democratic space in Ethiopia, which may threaten stability       and reverse economic progress over the long term;        (4) condemns the use of excessive force by Ethiopian       security forces, including the killing of unarmed protesters,       and the wrongful arrest and detention of journalists,       students, activists, and political leaders exercising their       constitutional rights to freedom of assembly, association,       and expression;        (5) recognizes and commends the recent peaceful and       voluntary transfer of authority from Prime Minister       Hailemariam to new Prime Minister Abiy and welcomes Prime       Minister Abiy's inaugural speech calling for open political       competition and the defense of fundamental human rights;        (6) calls on the Government of Ethiopia to--        (A) lift the state of emergency;        (B) repeal or amend proclamations used as a tool to       suppress human rights in Ethiopia, including the Charities       and Societies Proclamation and Anti-Terrorism Proclamation of       2009, and respect the rights of Ethiopian citizens to freedom       of assembly and expression, in keeping with Articles 30 and       29 of the Ethiopian Constitution;        (C) end the use of excessive force by Ethiopian security       forces and hold accountable those responsible for killing,       torturing, or otherwise abusing the human rights of civilians       exercising their constitutional rights through fair and       public trials;        (D) release all activists, journalists, and opposition       figures who have been wrongfully imprisoned for exercising       their constitutional rights, including those arrested for       reporting about public protests;        (E) improve transparency around development policies and       activities that may infringe upon the human rights of local       communities; and        (F) allow for an independent examination of the state of       human rights in Ethiopia by a rapporteur appointed by the       United Nations;        (7) urges protesters in Ethiopia to refrain from the use or       incitement of violence in demonstrations;        (8) urges opposition groups and the Government of Ethiopia       to directly engage in peaceful discussions to air grievances       and broaden political discourse;        (9) calls on the Department of State and the United States       Agency for International Development--        (A) to engage in a cooperative effort with the Government       of Ethiopia in the formulation of a comprehensive strategy,       in coordination with other donors, to help advance democracy,       rule of law, human rights, economic growth, and peace and       security in Ethiopia;        (B) continue to strengthen ties with Ethiopia, including       through the provision of appropriate levels and forms of       security assistance, in correlation to the Ethiopian       Government's own demonstrated commitment to democracy, rule       of law, human rights, economic growth, and peace and security       in the region;        (C) condemn human rights abuses and the excessive use of       force by Ethiopian security forces while pressing for the       release of individuals wrongfully detained; and        (D) hold accountable individuals responsible for gross       human rights violations in Ethiopia through appropriate       mechanisms, which may include the imposition of targeted       sanctions pursuant to the Global Magnitsky Human Rights       Accountability Act (Public Law 114-328); and        (10) stands by the people of Ethiopia and supports their       peaceful efforts to increase democratic space and to exercise       the rights guaranteed by the Ethiopian Constitution.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 128, bipartisan legislation--we got about 114  Members, maybe as many as 118, a few came in right at the end--is a  visible and necessary manifestation of deep congressional concern that  egregious human rights abuses immediately end in Ethiopia and that  fundamental human rights be promoted and protected for all.   I would note parenthetically that, like others in this House, my  commitment to promoting human rights in Ethiopia spans decades and  includes country visits, chairing numerous congressional hearings and  legislation, including the Ethiopia Freedom, Democracy, and Human  Rights Advancement Act of 2006.   The resolution before us today, Mr. Speaker, is balanced and  recognizes the recent peaceful and voluntary transfer of power from  Prime Minister Hailemariam to the new Prime Minister Abiy, and welcomes  Prime Minister Abiy's inaugural speech calling for open political  competition and the defense of fundamental human rights. However, Prime  Minister Abiy has been a member of the governing Ethiopian People's  Revolutionary Democratic Front since the EPRDF took power in 1991.   Prior to becoming Prime Minister, he played a critical role in the  government security apparatus as the cofounder of the Ethiopian  Information Network Security Agency. He is the leader of the Oromo  Peoples' Democratic Organization, one of the four ethnic groups that  make up the EPRDF.   Also, H. Res. 128 commends Ethiopia's efforts to promote regional  peace and security, as well as our longstanding partnership in  addressing health challenges.                                time  1715    However, the resolution carefully and accurately highlights that,  despite these developments, human rights abuses remain at the core of  the government's treatment--or should I say mistreatment--of the  Ethiopian people.   So after decades of serious human rights abuse--often ignored and  trivialized by some in Africa, the European Union, and the United  States--it is now time for positive action and meaningful deeds. Words,  Mr. Speaker, are just not enough.   In a letter asking Members of Congress to support our resolution,  Amnesty International notes that, in the last 2 months, the government  has released large numbers of political prisoners--although many remain  behind  [[Page H3071]]  bars--and closed the notorious Maekelawi prison, known for its torture.  Yet some have already been rearrested, and all--absolutely all of  them--are at risk of rearrest. Making matters worse, repressive laws  and state of emergency, used to brutalize people, remains in place.  There has been no reform there. None whatsoever.   Human Rights Watch strongly supports H. Res. 128 and has reported in  its reporting on human rights that: ``Since late 2015, security forces  have killed over 1,000 people''--and some estimates put that far  higher--``and detained tens of thousands during widespread protests  against government policies.''   The Human Rights Watch goes on to say: ``A state of emergency began  in February 2018''--that is just several weeks ago--``the second in 2  years, and permits draconian restrictions on rights to freedom of  expression, association, and assembly. Authorities regularly use  arbitrary arrests and politically motivated prosecutions to silence  journalists, activists, and perceived opposition party members. Torture  remains a serious problem in detention.''   Earlier today,  Mike Coffman and I had a press conference. There were  several men and women there who have suffered the torture of the  Ethiopian Government and bear on their bodies and their minds and their  hearts the horrible and horrific indignity of the use of torture by the  Government of Ethiopia. Human Rights Watch continues: ``The Ethiopian  Government has not conducted meaningful investigations into any of  these abuses. Repressive laws restrict the activities of  nongovernmental organizations. The ruling coalition won all 547  parliamentary seats in the 2015 election.''   All of them. What does that tell you?   Mr. Speaker, the 2017 Department of State Country Report on Human  Rights Practices for Ethiopia also cited serious human rights  violations, including arbitrary arrests, killings, and torture  committed by the security forces, restrictions on freedom of expression  and association, politically motivated trials, harassment, and  intimidation of opposition members and journalists.   On February 18 of this year, the U.S. Embassy in Ethiopia issued a  strong statement against the state of emergency. They said, in  pertinent part: ``We strongly disagree with the Ethiopian Government's  decision to impose a state of emergency that includes restrictions on  fundamental rights such as assembly and expression.''   ``We strongly urge the government to rethink this approach''--the  State Department goes on to say--``and identify other means to protect  lives and property while preserving, and indeed expanding, the space  for meaningful dialogue and political participation. . . . `'   My resolution--cosponsored by well over 110, I think it is 118 now,  Members of the House--calls on the Government of Ethiopia to:   Lift the state of emergency;   Repeal or amend proclamations used as a tool to suppress human rights  in Ethiopia, including the so-called Antiterrorism Proclamation--which  accuses any Ethiopian who criticizes the government of being a  terrorist--and the Charities and Societies Proclamation--which makes it  virtually impossible for civil society organizations to function by  severely restricting foreign funding;   We are asking in the resolution to stop the killing of peaceful  protestors and hold accountable those responsible for killing,  torturing, and detaining innocent civilians;   Release dissidents, journalists, students, activists, and political  leaders jailed for exercising their right to free expression and  peaceful assembly;   Engage with citizens about development strategies, especially when  these people could lose their land;   Allow a U.N. rapporteur unfettered access to examine the state of  human rights in Ethiopia. Unfettered. Go anywhere, any time, and talk  to anyone without fear of reprisal or retaliation;   And the resolution calls on the U.S. Department of State and USAID  to, among other things, engage in a cooperative effort with the  Government of Ethiopia in the formulation of a comprehensive strategy  to help advance democracy, rule of law, human rights, economic growth,  and peace and security in Ethiopia, and hold accountable individuals  responsible for gross human rights violations in Ethiopia through  appropriate mechanisms like the Global Magnitsky Act.   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by thanking Congressman  Mike Coffman,  who has been an amazing tenacious supporter for this legislation and  has really made a difference in helping to get it to the floor, and, of  course, our majority leader for actually getting it to the floor. I see  many of my colleagues on the Democrat side. I thank them. This is  bipartisan legislation, and that is what it ought to be.   I want to thank Ms. Bass, the ranking member of the Africa, Global  Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations  Subcommittee, for her cosponsorship and leadership as well, as well as  Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel.   I would also like to thank the many human rights groups and the  Ethiopian-American community, who have and continue to work diligently  and tenaciously to secure fundamental human rights for the people of  Ethiopia.   This is a first step today. My hope is that it will begin a process  of this body being absolutely in solidarity with the oppressed and  standing in opposition to the oppressor.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman), the original  sponsor of the resolution, and, like I said, a giant when it has come  to pushing human rights in Ethiopia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen), one of the cosponsors of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume to close.   Mr. Speaker, I include these letters of support in the Record. I call  attention to the membership an excellent letter written by human rights  and diaspora groups, six groups in all. It is entitled, ``Ethiopia:  Joint Letter About U.S. House Resolution 128'', in support of it. They  make a number of very important points.            Ethiopia: Joint Letter About US House Resolution 128    Democracy, Human Rights and Diaspora Groups Urge Congress to Pass H.                            Res. 128 on Ethiopia         Ethiopia is at a crossroads. On Monday, April 2, a new       Prime Minister, selected from within the ruling coalition,       delivered a speech about planned reforms while the country       was under another State of Emergency. At such a juncture,       amid mounting pressures, the role of the US, Ethiopia's       longstanding international ally to encourage critically-      needed reforms and human rights protections, should not be       underestimated in urging the country toward a new era of       stability.        The undersigned human rights and diaspora groups fully       support the passage of House Resolution 128 for the positive       contribution it can make toward respecting basic human rights       and encouraging inclusive governance in Ethiopia. The       resolution has strong bipartisan support and more than 100       co-sponsors. In addition, H. Res. 128 has significant       grassroots support among constituents across the US who have       ties to Ethiopia. It calls on the government of Ethiopia to       open up civic space, ensure accountability for human rights       abuses and promote inclusive governance.        For the past three years, Ethiopia has faced largely       peaceful and sustained protests in the Oromia and Amhara       regions of the country. These protests were led by youth       seeking opportunity, political reform and more participatory       development strategies. The government responded with       excessive force. More than a thousand protesters have been       killed by Ethiopian security forces, a greater number       injured, tens of thousands imprisoned and many tortured for       expressing grievances. Over a million, mostly from Oromia,       were uprooted due to government-instigated conflict in the       Eastern part of the country.        However, a combination of forces has accumulated in support       of the protesters--diaspora groups and international human       rights organizations helped publicize the protest movement in       Ethiopia and the government's violent response; the US       Congress rallied behind H. Res. 128; international news       outlets gave frequent coverage of the protests. At  [[Page H3074]]       the dawn of this new year, the EPRDF coalition announced       reforms and some changes began to occur. Close to 7000       political prisoners were released in January and February of       2018, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped down within       days, and Dr. Abiy Ahmed, a man with ties to the region most       impacted by the protests, was put forward by the coalition as       Ethiopia's newest prime minister.        In light of these beginnings, now more than ever, it is       imperative that the United States Congress take a stand that       reiterates the need for Ethiopia to take further steps in a       democratic direction by passing H. Res. 128. Ethiopia's       previous transfers of power indicate that leadership change       is often followed by unfulfilled promises, a culling of       opponents and power consolidation. If Prime Minister Abiy is       truly committed to breaking that pattern, this resolution       will encourage Ethiopia to lift the State of Emergency,       ensuring freedoms of expression and assembly and opening up       democratic space, all prerequisites for political and       economic reform.        1) H. Res. 128 is a signal of support for the youth in the       country who have organized to peacefully demand justice and       democracy and have paid a terrible price in terms of loss of       life, injury and arbitrary detention. Accountability for the       human rights violations that have occurred over the last 3       years will be an essential step towards genuine       reconciliation and is a key demand from the protesters.        2) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that could strengthen the       hand of the Prime Minister vis-a-vis less responsive segments       within the EPRDF party coalition structure, requiring       negotiation with the forces that control the country's       security apparatus, intelligence and the economic sectors.        3) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that call on the State       Department and USAID to develop a comprehensive strategy to       support improved democracy and governance in Ethiopia.        4) H. Res. 128 contains clauses that call on the Secretary       of State and Secretary of Treasury to apply appropriate       sanctions on individuals and organizations responsible for       gross human rights.        We support passage of H. Res. 128 as a means to send a       strong, unambiguous signal that the United States Congress       requires concrete reforms. Such reforms are needed to create       a path toward improved respect and protection of human and       civil rights, political stability and sustainable regional       security.        We urge members of the House to pass the resolution.      Amhara Association of America.      Coalition of Oromos for Human Rights and Democracy.      Ethiopian Advocacy Network.

Re Amnesty International USA (``AIUSA'') urges the House to           vote yes on H. Res. 128 which will be on the House floor           on April 10.         Dear Representative: On behalf of AIUSA and our two million       members and supporters nationwide, we are writing to urge you       to vote YES for H. Res. 128, supporting respect for human       rights and encouraging inclusive governance in Ethiopia.        H. Res. 128 outlines key benchmarks for critically needed       human rights reform in Ethiopia and calls for a review of       U.S. policy toward Ethiopia to prioritize human rights and       good governance.        H. Res. 128 was approved by Voice Vote by the House Foreign       Affairs Committee in July 2017 and has strong bipartisan       support with 108 cosponsors including 29 Republicans and 79       Democrats.        Following highly contested elections in 2005 the Ethiopian       government imposed a web of laws criminalizing any form of       dissent or questioning of government policies. These laws       have empowered authorities to engage in widespread       surveillance, and have resulted in the arrest and detention       of members of civil society.        For the past three years the Ethiopian people have been       subjected to brutal repression by the security forces in       response to protests against the increasingly autocratic rule       of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front       (``EPRDF''). Over 1000 people have been killed since 2015 and       according to the Ethiopian government's own admission, 10,000       people were arrested during the first state of emergency       between 2016 and 2017. Amnesty International believes that       the figure is above 25,000. The current human rights crisis       is the result of years of repression by security forces using       sweeping legislation criminalizing dissent, the arrest of       civil society leaders and journalists, and brutal crackdowns       leading to scores of extrajudicial executions, massacres and       the destruction of property and livelihoods. The Ethiopian       government has created a culture of impunity and a climate of       fear.        Ethiopia is currently under its second State of Emergency       since 2016. Amnesty International has documented unlawful       killings, forced displacement, arbitrary arrests, detentions,       as well as torture and the ill-treatment of detainees.        In the last two months there have been some positive       developments in Ethiopia: a new prime minister has been       appointed, the government released a large number of       political prisoners and closed the notorious Maekelawi Prison       known for torture. However, many more prisoners remain behind       bars. While the country's web of repressive legislation       remains in place and the state of emergency is in effect, all       those individuals who have been released remain at risk of       re-arrest. Indeed, some of them have been re-re-arrested. At       the same time protests are continuing and are being met with       brutal force by government authorities.        H. Res. 128 is a direct appeal to the Ethiopian authorities       to listen to their people, change course, and uphold human       rights and the rule of law.        H. Res. 128 calls on the US Secretary of State to:        Conduct a review of security assistance to Ethiopia to       improve transparency with respect to the purposes of such       assistance to the people of Ethiopia and,        Work with the Administrator of the United States Agency for       International Development, to improve oversight and       accountability of U.S. assistance to Ethiopia, pursuant to       the expectations established in the U.S. Strategy Toward Sub-      Saharan Africa.        H. Res. 128 call on the Ethiopian government to lift the       state of emergency and end the use of excessive force by       security forces. The resolution calls the government to       conduct a credible, transparent investigation into human       rights violations committed during the last three years, in       an expedient manner and for those responsible for the       killing, torture, and detention of innocent civilians who       exercised their constitutional rights to be held accountable.        H. Res. 128 call on the Ethiopian government to take steps       to restore the respect and protection of human rights and       enforce accountability as provided under the Ethiopian       Constitution including the        Release dissidents, activists, and journalists who have       been imprisoned; respect freedom of peaceful assembly,       freedom of the press and media;        Repeal of laws that        (i) can be used as a tool to harass or prohibit funding for       civil society organizations that investigate human rights       violations, engage in peaceful political dissent, or advocate       for greater political freedoms.        (ii) prohibit or limit those displaced from their land from       seeking remedy or redress in courts,        (iii) restrict access to justice for displaced persons        (iv) prohibit or otherwise limit peaceful nonprofit       operations in Ethiopia.        H. Res. 128 urges the Ethiopian government to cooperate       with a rapporteur appointed by the United Nations to conduct       an independent examination of the state of human rights in       Ethiopia.        Ethiopia has engaged in a number of ambitious large-scale       development projects that have displaced hundreds of       thousands of villagers. A key trigger of the three years of       protest was the proposed expansion of the capital Addis Ababa       on lands occupied by members of the Oromo community. H. Res.       128 call upon the Ethiopian government to engage in open and       transparent consultations with citizens regarding its       development plans, especially those strategies that could       result in the displacement of people from their land and       address the grievances brought forward by representatives of       registered opposition parties.        Finally, H. Res. 128 reiterates Congress' support for the       people of Ethiopia and their peaceful efforts to exercise the       rights guaranteed by the Ethiopian constitution.        Amnesty International USA urges you to vote YES on H. Res.       128 and for the full House to pass this important resolution.        For more information, please contact me.            Sincerely,                                                      Adotei Akwei,                                          Africa Advocacy Director.     For the past 3 years, they point out, as we  know, Ethiopia has faced largely peaceful and sustained protesters in  the Oromia and Amhara regions of the country. They were led by youth  seeking opportunity, political reform, and more participatory  development strategies. The government responded with excessive force.  More than 1,000 protesters have been killed by the Ethiopian security  forces, a greater number injured, tens of thousands imprisoned, and  many more tortured for expressing grievances. Over 1 million have been  displaced.   Let me just say in conclusion that they talk about the importance of  supporting this. Yes, there is a new prime minister, but as they point  out in their statement, and it is so true, Ethiopia's previous  transfers of power indicate that leadership change is often followed by  unfulfilled promises, a culling of opponents, and power consolidation.  That can't happen again.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution, I think, deserves the support of every  single Member.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank  Chairman Royce for his very kind remarks. I want to thank him for his  extraordinary leadership on combating human trafficking for so many  years.   This bill is just another example of that ironclad commitment to the  victims and to trying to bring to justice the perpetrators of this  offensive and really abject cruelty perpetrated by human traffickers.   H.R. 2219, authored by Chairman Royce and, of course, joined by Mr.  Keating, Mrs. Maloney, and Mrs. Love as original cosponsors of the End  Banking for Human Traffickers Act of 2018, will make an enormous  difference when enacted into law. It recognizes the very important role  the Secretary of the Treasury has to play in the detection and  eradication of human trafficking, and it ensures that the Secretary is  included in the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and  Combat Human Trafficking.   As we all know, Mr. Speaker, profits drive human trafficking. Profits  drive human traffickers to do unspeakable harm to their fellow human  beings. Trafficking victims suffer unspeakable cruelty that scars, if  they are rescued and are the lucky ones who are rescued, scars that  they carry on for the entirety of their life.   This bill goes after the traffickers' profits by turning the  Treasury's watchful eye on the traffickers' system for moving and  hiding money. The Royce bill will ensure that those working at the  Treasury's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing units are  ready, willing, and able and empowered legally to detect signs that  money may by tied to traffickers and to report their findings to law  enforcement.   The bill asks the Secretary of the Treasury to review the  Department's systems and tell Congress if any additional legislative  changes are needed so that the Department can be effective in the fight  against human trafficking.   Finally, the bill adds, as the chairman pointed out in his opening  comments, to the minimum standards to combat human trafficking by which  we evaluate every country in the world, including our own, whether a  government is keeping a watchful eye on financial transactions, putting  the issue on the map for countries that have never thought about it and  may be unwittingly providing financial cover to the traffickers.   This bill will reduce profits of the traffickers and, again, will set  an example for other countries of the world to follow.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Chairman Royce for his bill and hope this body  will strongly support it.
