 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so very  much for her comments. I am truly proud to stand tonight with our  leader of this hour, as well as the leader of our Caucus to pay tribute  to Shirley Chisholm.   Just a little over 50 years ago today, in a 1972 speech announcing  her candidacy for President, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm said:         I am not the candidate of Black America, although I am       Black and proud.        I am not the candidate of the women's movement of this       country, although I am a woman, and I am equally proud of       that.        I am the candidate of the people of America and my presence       before you now symbolizes a new era in American political       history.                                time  2015    Here was a Black woman from Brooklyn, New York, of Guyanese and Bajan  descent, born to a burlap worker and a seamstress, boldly declaring a  new era in American politics.   But despite her best efforts, Congresswoman Chisholm knew that the  outcome of her candidacy was preordained.   At the time, our country was still learning to accept Black people  and women as equal citizens--that is the year I was first elected to my  first elected office--much less electing them as President of the  United States.   Nevertheless, she persisted.   She held an unwavering faith in our common humanity, even when our  common humanity did not hold the same faith in her. It was that same  faith that drove her campaign.   She transcended political norms by bringing the issues of gender and  racial equity to the national stage.   She highlighted and reinforced the importance of diversity at the  table of public discourse.   And she shattered any preconceived notions about Black women in  public service, particularly in politics.   Building on her work as the first Black woman elected to Congress,  she blazed the trail and the torch of progress for many of us who have  followed.   Today, the Congressional Black Caucus, which she helped establish,  has 27 women from districts across the country. I think I speak on  behalf of all of us when I say that we would not be here today if not  for her life and legacy.   So as we celebrate Black History Month and the 50th anniversary of  her Presidential campaign and the 51st anniversary of the Congressional  Black Caucus, let Congresswoman Chisholm's story serve as a reminder  that equality and justice are the responsibility of every generation,  and it is our turn.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the Congressional Black Caucus  and our distinguished leader, Barbara Lee, for offering us this  opportunity.
