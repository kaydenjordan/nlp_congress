 Madam Speaker, it is indeed National Gun Violence  Survivors Week. We all share in mourning the loss of those lives that  have been taken by those filled with anger, hate, and evil. However,  gun violence is a misnomer.   Evil lies in the hearts of people. Guns are inanimate objects, much  like this pen, which isn't going to move for the entire time I am  making this speech.   It is naive to believe that more gun seizures, more violations of our  Second Amendment, are going to do anything other than create more  victims in gun-free zones. Ask Jack Wilson, who stopped evil because he  was armed in that church in Texas recently.   It is naive to think that evil will be disarmed. Only the innocent  will be disarmed in this continued press to have our Second Amendment  violated and eliminated.                            ____________________
