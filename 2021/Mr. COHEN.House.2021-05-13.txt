 Mr. Speaker, in the beginning of this week because of the  routine inspection by the Department of Transportation in Arkansas, it  was discovered that the Hernando De Soto Bridge that crosses the  Mississippi River between Memphis and Arkansas had a major crack in a  structural beam. As a result, that bridge which carries 50,000 cars  across it and much of America's commerce along I-40 is closed, and it  may be closed for as much as months--not days or weeks, but months.   Traffic is diverted to a 1949 bridge, the Memphis-Arkansas Bridge,  which is currently serving the need, but it is difficult, and it is  causing traffic problems in Memphis.   Mr. Speaker, 700 barges are stopped on the Mississippi River--370  going south and 330 going north--which cannot go under the bridge for  fear that the bridge could fall and not support its own weight and  damage the barges.   I am calling on the Department of Transportation to get involved, to  lend its expertise, and to lend money and finances to get this bridge  open. This is a national tragedy, and it shows why we need an  infrastructure bill immediately.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters for her important  work on this bill and for helping with my amendment to be included  therein.   The amendment that I have is cosponsored by Representatives Ocasio- Cortez and Bonamici. It adds a section to the law that says, if you  have got a debt that is beyond the statute of limitations, that debt  collection companies can't go after you.   There is a statute of limitations because sometimes over a period of  time, the facts become kind of vague in people's minds. So the proof  isn't strong, and they want to make sure that this could be an  appropriate subject matter for a court case.   Also, sometimes debts are sold and debt collection agencies buy them,  and they don't really know the facts, the amounts, and all of that. So  if a debt is over the statute, this prohibits the debt collectors from  going after someone.   I think I found this about 8 years ago in an AARP magazine, which I  read, and they said how awful this was. And I thought it was, too. It  took 8 years to get it here because it took a Democratic team to bring  it to the floor to look out for debtors.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate all the support we have got from my  cosponsors, and I hope we pass the bill.
