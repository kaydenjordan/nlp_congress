 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support  for H.R. 3441, the Save Local Business Act.   I have heard from employers across my district in many industries-- agriculture, higher ed, staffing agencies, hospitality, and  construction--about this issue. Under the flawed NLRB standard, not  only employers are confused, but employees, as well, have little  certainty as to their status with multiple employers.   Mr. Speaker, for 25 years, I owned and operated a construction  company in Lancaster County, and we were operated as subcontractors.  Back then, the employer-employee relationship was clear. There was no  question about which employer was responsible for each employee.   The Browning-Ferris decision creates confusion about who works for  whom, discouraging many larger contractors from giving small  subcontractors a job for fear of increased liability. Mr. Speaker, had  that existed when I was growing a company, it would have made it more  difficult to expand our business and create more jobs in our community.   The Browning-Ferris decision was politically motivated and upended a  decades-old standard that worked very well among employers and  employees. According to the HR Policy Association, litigation regarding  the joint employer standard is at a record high. This decision, Mr.  Speaker, has been a jackpot for trial lawyers.   It is time Congress takes action to provide clarity for the thousands  of businesses, both large and small, who are ready to expand and create  jobs. The Save Local Business Act will provide this clarity, and I urge  my colleagues to support this important legislation.
