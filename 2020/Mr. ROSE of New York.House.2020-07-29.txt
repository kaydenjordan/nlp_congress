 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy  of Fred Cerullo, Jr., a family man, a business owner, and a fellow Army  vet.   For more than 40 years, Mr. Cerullo welcomed friends and neighbors to  Owl's Head Service Center, the business his father established in Bay  Ridge in 1956. He treated everyone who stopped by this neighborhood  landmark as if they were family, so much so that even those who did not  own a car would stop by to visit Fred.   After serving in the Army at Fort Dix, Fred passed his devotion on to  his children, to include his son, Fred, my dear friend, who served New  York City as a four-term city councilman and in several other roles in  city government.   Today, my heart goes out to Fred Cerullo's family and to everyone  whom he touched in such a wonderful way. May he rest in peace. We will  never forget Fred's incredible legacy.                            ____________________
