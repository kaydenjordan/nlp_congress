 Mr. Speaker, this week, I voted against the default on  America act, a reckless debt limit proposal that would force Americans  to suffer through pandemic-level economic pain once again because of  brutal spending cuts put forth by House Republicans.   The default on America act would buy us less than a year's reprieve  from default on the backs of hardworking American families, ``keiki,  kupuna,'' ``children, seniors,'' and veterans. The 22 percent across- the-board cuts for critical safety net programs would mean 13 million  fewer health visits for our veterans; 300,000 children would lose Head  Start slots and families' access to childcare; and 1 million seniors  would get kicked off Meals on Wheels. The list goes on.   We need to put people over politics. We cannot afford to gamble with  the lives and livelihoods of everyday Americans. Instead of these  ``pilau,'' ``rotten,'' cuts, we should be focused on ending child  hunger, keeping people housed, taking care of kupuna, and improving  access to veteran services.   The Treasury says we have less than 60 days until our Nation is  expected to default on our loans. America is waiting for us to do the  right thing and pass a clean debt limit increase now.                            ____________________
