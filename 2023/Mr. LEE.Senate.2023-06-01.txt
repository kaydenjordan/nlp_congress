 Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 98 and ask that  it be reported by number.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the amendment by  number.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Utah [Mr. Lee] proposes an amendment       numbered 98.    The amendment is as follows:     (Purpose: To strike the waiver authority for Administrative PAYGO)         Strike section 265 of title III of division B.    Madam President, this amendment is simple. It strikes  section 265 of this bill. Section 263 creates a regulatory pay-go  measure, but section 265 nullifies that by giving outright, complete  discretion to the Director of OMB--who, by the way, just announced the  day before yesterday from the White House that she would use this  effectively to nullify the regulatory pay-as-you-go measure.   Please support my amendment.   I yield the rest of my time to the Senator from Louisiana.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk called the roll.
