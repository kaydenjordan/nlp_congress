 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for this moment to be  able to address about something that I still have trouble understanding  the need to address when people fell, when people bled, when people  died, and we are still here. And all of that happened, so much of it  happened before I was even born, even thought of, and we are still  here.   So, St. Louis and I, we rise today, because in Missouri our right to  vote is being taken away. Taken away from many of us. And by us, let me  be clear that I mean Black folks, I mean Brown folks, I mean Indigenous  folks.                                time  2110    Despite the raising of our voices, despite the marching of our feet,  and despite our turning out the vote to deliver the government to  Democrats, the Senate has yet to do anything about it. H.R. 1 is  gathering dust in the Senate, and the filibuster remains intact. With  every passing day, the reality of the situation worsens.   Yet, rather than acting with urgency, some have even suggested  instead we want to out-organize voter suppression.  [[Page H3897]]  After an election year when Black, Brown, and indigenous organizers  gave their blood, their sweat, and their tears to deliver a Democratic  House, Senate, and White House. A year when Black women turned the  longtime red State of Georgia blue. When Black, Brown, and indigenous  voters stood in disproportionately long lines to cast their ballots on  an election day that is not a Federal holiday. A year when Black,  Brown, and indigenous communities have been disproportionately harmed  by this pandemic, yet turned out in the face of these suppression  tactics to vote in record numbers.   We did this because we were promised justice. We were promised that  our right to vote would be secure, and we were promised a sustainable  future.   But rather than deliver on these promises, we were asked again to  give our blood, our sweat, and our tears?   To those who say just out-organize rather than legislate, I say  shame. Shame, Madam Speaker, that you take our labor for granted. Shame  that you take our struggle for granted, and shame that your promises  continue to go unfulfilled. Like my chairwoman said, we have people who  are living, struggling, burdened, and oppressed in ways that others  aren't, and are the ones who suffer the most.   Shame that rather than doing everything within your power, Madam  Speaker, to deliver us the future, we are being asked to overcome voter  suppression again.   To those who are telling us just to out-organize voter suppression,  my message to you is this: We already did.
