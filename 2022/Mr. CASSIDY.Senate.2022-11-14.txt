 Mr. President, today I honor and pay tribute to  Dan and Sandi Davis. The Davis' have selflessly dedicated more than 40  years of their life to ministry through the United Pentecostal Church.  In October of 2022, the Davis' celebrate 20 years of pastoral  stewardship at First Pentecostal Church in Baton Rouge, LA.   Dan and Sandi met while attending college at Jackson College of  Ministries, in Jackson, MS, and married in 1977. Pastor Davis became a  licensed minister by the United Pentecostal Church International in  1976 and served in a number of ministerial positions at churches in  Louisiana, Mississippi, and Michigan.   In 1989, the Davis' moved their family to Jena, LA, to lead the Shady  Grove United Pentecostal Church. In 2002, after 13 years at Shady  Grove, Dan and Sandi moved to Baton Rouge to begin their ministry at  First Pentecostal Church of Baton Rouge. There, they have since  faithfully served the congregation of First Pentecostal Church and the  Baton Rouge community.   I met Dan when I was running for my first political office. He didn't  know me from Adam. But from the get-go he was encouraging me, as he  encourages everyone. I met Sandi through Dan and through them met  others such as Bishop Tenney and his ``Tennyisms.'' We have had great  conversations regarding music and life. They regularly send notes, text  messages, and messages through others to pick up my spirits. They do  this for me; they do it for everyone. It is the ministry they have had  for 40 years.   Joining the First Pentacostal celebrating these 40 years of ministry  are Dan and Sandi's two daughters, Mandi Davis Hartzell and Heather  Davis Dean; two sons-in-law, Ryan Hartzell and Chantry Dean; and three  grandchildren; Ava Dean, Aidan Hartzell, and Zane Hartzell.   It is truly an honor and a privilege to commemorate the Davis' 20  years of ministry at First Pentecostal Church in Baton Rouge. I am  blessed to have them as friends.                            ____________________
