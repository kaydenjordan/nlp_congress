 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7900, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023.   H.R. 7900 represents a truly bipartisan bill. I thank Chairman Smith  for his tremendous leadership and cooperation in helping to fashion it.   Over the last year, we have seen the best of our soldiers, sailors,  marines, airmen, and guardians. They performed in the toughest  environments and have done so with the greatest level of skill and  professionalism. Without a doubt, these men and women are the greatest  force for good the world has ever seen.   Providing the authorities and resources our warfighters need to  defend our Nation is the greatest responsibility we have in Congress.  We fulfilled that responsibility with this NDAA.   We put our servicemembers first, providing a 4.6 percent pay increase  and expanding benefits for military spouses and families. To counteract  the effects of record inflation on our servicemembers and their  families, our bill provides an additional 2.4 percent bonus to enlisted  personnel.   It includes an additional $500 million for housing allowances to  offset the skyrocketing rents and an additional $750 million to reduce  the price of food and other necessities at our military commissaries.   The investments we make in this bill are focused on ensuring our  warfighters are the best equipped and trained in the world. We  increased funding for readiness, reversing cuts in our military  construction and housing projects; expanding training availabilities  for servicemembers; and improving the safety of the ships, aircraft,  combat vehicles, and facilities where our warfighters serve.   To ensure our warfighters prevail on future battlefields, we focused  on modernization. That means divesting less capable legacy systems and  investing in emerging technologies that will help us stay ahead of our  adversaries.   This bill saves the taxpayer over $6 billion by divesting hundreds of  older, less capable ships, aircraft, and other legacy systems. We use  those savings and more to invest in emerging technologies such as AI,  quantum computing, hypersonic weapons, and autonomous systems.   These investments are so critical because China and Russia are  rapidly modernizing their militaries.   China is outpacing us with advancements in emerging technologies and  weapons systems, and we know China isn't building these capabilities  purely for defense. In recent years, we have seen China use its  military to push out its borders, threaten our allies, and gain  footholds on new continents.   H.R. 7900 is laser-focused on preparing our military to prevail in a  conflict with China. It makes critical investments in new systems  capable of surviving in contested environments. It includes provisions  that will further harden our supply chain and industrial base against  infiltration from China. It reaffirms our support to allies in the  region, especially Taiwan.   It also strengthens our European alliance as these democracies face  grave threats from the unhinged crackpot currently leading Russia.   Threats from adversaries like China and Russia are not the only ones  we face. Terrorists continue to plot to destroy our way of life. We  must continue to take the fight to them anywhere at any time they  threaten us. With strong investments in new capabilities and readiness,  this bill enables our warfighters to do just that.   This bill passed out of our committee 57-1, with all Republicans  voting for it. It is the definition of a bipartisan bill. It will  enhance the congressional oversight of DOD, improve the quality of life  for our servicemembers and families, and ensure the military is  properly resourced and equipped to defend our Nation and its allies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote for this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), the ranking member of the  Military Personnel Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks), the ranking member of the Cyber,  Innovative Technologies, and Information Systems Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Jackson), one of our outstanding freshman members of  the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Carl), another of our outstanding freshman members.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.  [[Page H6226]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Waltz), the ranking member of the Readiness  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   This is truly a bipartisan product, and I thank Chairman Smith for  his leadership in that effort. I know there will be an effort later  today and tomorrow to add extraneous issues to this bill that have  nothing to do with the defense of our Nation. It happens every year.  But like previous years, we will work through those in conference. We  will weed out the ones that don't need to come back to the floor.   Before us today is a critical piece of legislation. It is a good  piece of legislation, and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I oppose the gentleman's  amendment.   It allows some of the most hardened terrorists in U.S. custody a  platform to publicly broadcast their message.   Our military commissions process at Guantanamo Bay has already been  substantially delayed. Letting hardened terrorists know there is a  public audience for their hate will do far more harm than good.   Federal courts have stuck to their guns against broadcasting major  terrorism cases, such as the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, and I see no  reason to make an exception for terrorists at Guantanamo Bay.   Mr. Speaker, even the Biden administration has fought against prior  versions of this amendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, this amendment undermines  the military commissions process and gives hardened terrorists a public  platform. The Biden administration has opposed this.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment completely  undermines the existing contractor debarment processes at DOD. Federal  contractors and subcontractors are already required to comply with the  National Labor Relations Act.   There are already tools to bring contractors into compliance. This  amendment takes the decision out of the hands of the contracting  officer to determine whether or not a contractor is responsible.  Something as small as a single paperwork violation would prohibit DOD  from contracting with a company.   This is an unprecedented prohibition that exists nowhere else in the  Federal Government.   It is a departure from the processes we use to prevent contracting  with bad actors and would undermine our national security. If enacted,  this would severely limit the Department's ability to contract for  goods and services needed to support the warfighter and execute  critical mission sets around the globe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this  effort. It could stop procurement of critical systems needed to counter  China. It could delay construction of military housing projects, and it  could stop work on vital programs to improve the safety of ships,  aircrafts, and combat vehicles.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bad amendment. I urge all Members to oppose  it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment completely  undermines the existing contractor debarment processes at the DOD.  Federal contractors and subcontractors are already required to comply  with the National Labor Relations Act. There are already tools to bring  contractors into compliance. But this amendment takes the decision out  of the hands of the contracting officer to determine whether a  contractor is responsible.   If enacted, this amendment would limit the Department's ability to  receive quality goods and services and drive up costs unnecessarily.   Federal contractors and subcontractors are already required to comply  with the National Labor Relations Act. Yet this amendment would go  further and seek to prefer contract awards based on compliance with  labor agreements in a new and unprecedented way regardless of its  negative impact on small businesses and national security.   I will note that this amendment is opposed by the National Federation  of Independent Businesses, as well as the Workplace Policy Institute  and the Associated Builders and Contractors.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this en bloc  amendment, and I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Crenshaw), another colleague from the Texas  delegation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Waltz).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, so at  this time, I would just urge adoption of this en bloc package and yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment creates an  existential threat to the good order and discipline of the military.   A servicemember may seek an order from the U.S. district court  demanding a status update or final action within 180 days after any  supervisor or office receives a complaint.   This creates an unprecedented right to sue the commanders and force  outcomes of administrative proceedings, some of which could be tied to  active law enforcement investigations. An activist district court judge  could reverse or set aside the final decision of a commander.   I understand that some of my colleagues wish to do away with the UCMJ  altogether. I believe this and other provisions are the first step  toward that end.   This provision will not benefit those who need protection the most in  the Armed Forces and will undermine the strong bipartisan work that has  taken place on sexual harassment and sexual assault.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment demolishes the  good order and discipline of the military and should be rejected.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment is a misuse of  funds and resources on behalf of the DOD. As my colleague from  California just referenced, this bill already includes funding  increases for a myriad of civilian harm programs. There is already $5  million for the Center of Excellence in Civilian Harm Mitigation and $4  million for the Commission on Civilian Harm.   This amendment diverts critical dollars needed to ensure the  readiness of our servicemembers to fulfill unnecessary paperwork  requirements. Worst of all, it creates additional bureaucrats  throughout the DOD whose job it is to second-guess the judgment of our  military commanders.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I would urge opposition to this.  This amendment represents an unnecessary waste of taxpayer money and  undermines the judgment of our military commanders.   I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment would arbitrarily  strip $100 billion out of this bill. That is 12 percent of total  defense spending it would cut. This amendment would have catastrophic  effects on training and readiness. It will endanger the safety of our  servicemembers by delaying critical safety upgrades on the ships,  aircraft, combat vehicles, and facilities where they serve.   It will set back the cleanup and environmental remediation at PFAS  and other contaminated sites and put off construction of new military  housing, schools, and childcare facilities. It will further postpone  critical modernization efforts needed to deter China and other  adversaries. The list goes on and on.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, this amendment guts  the  [[Page H6269]]  bill. It harms our servicemembers and their families. It severely  weakens our ability to defend ourselves and our allies. Given Putin's  atrocities in Ukraine and the increasing threats we face in China,  Iran, North Korea, and other adversaries, this is the worst time to  start slashing defense spending.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, here we have another amendment that would arbitrarily  slash defense spending. This time it is $37 billion added by Mr. Golden  and Mrs. Luria, two Democrat members of our committee, during our  markup.   The amendment before us now would eliminate a 2.4 percent pay bonus  for enlisted personnel, people who make less than $45,000 a year. It  would erase $500 million in additional housing allowances to counteract  skyrocketing rents for low-income servicemembers, and it would delete  $750 million we added to reduce the price of groceries and other  necessities at military commissaries.   The proponents of this amendment argue that we need to spend less on  defense so we can spend more on programs to counteract homelessness,  hunger, and poverty. But their amendment would strip out a bipartisan  effort to ensure our servicemembers with the lowest incomes don't face  those same difficulties. It is hypocrisy at its worst.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Maine (Mr. Golden).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I point out that this $37 billion  that was added in a bipartisan fashion in the committee does not even  meet all the unfunded requirements that were submitted to Congress by  the Defense Department.   Like all Americans, our servicemembers and their families are  suffering from the harmful effects of record inflation. We worked in a  bipartisan manner to address that in this NDAA. This amendment would  strike that language from the bill. I don't understand why anyone wants  to do that and have that effect on our servicemembers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This amendment would prohibit Congress from receiving unfunded  priority lists from service chiefs and combatant commanders. These are  the individuals responsible for executing U.S. military operations  around the world.   It is critical that Congress knows what the service chiefs and the  combatant commanders need to keep our servicemembers safe and ensure  success in their missions.   Here are a couple of examples of FY23 unfunded priorities from  General McConville, the Army chief of staff: $67 million to accelerate  fielding of body armor for female soldiers; $65 million to acquire  cold-weather boots, gloves, and sleeping bags for troops deployed to  cold-weather environments.   Neither of these critical needs were funded in the Biden proposal. We  funded them in this bill only because they were included on General  McConville's unfunded priority list. We likely wouldn't have known  about them otherwise.   These are just a couple of examples of why this amendment is  misguided. There are hundreds more just like it.   I urge Members to oppose this amendment. I remind Members that the  President proposes a budget number that the service chiefs and  combatant commanders have to salute and say, ``Yes, sir''--hopefully,  one day, ``Yes, ma'am''--``That is our number, and we are going to make  it work,'' regardless of what they need.   We have to have that unfunded requirements list so that we can know  what they actually need, and we can then act because the fact is the  President proposes budgets; we write budgets.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment would rob Congress  of critical information we need to keep our servicemembers safe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).                                time  1800     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment would repeal what has been bipartisan  consensus since 2018. The United States should not provide funding for  a bloated international organization to help bring into force a treaty  that the Senate has already rejected. In practical terms, this  amendment would allow tens of millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to be  spent on conferences and junkets in the capitals of Europe to help  resurrect a treaty that the U.S. Senate has already rejected.   Let's be clear: This amendment has nothing to do with U.S. nuclear  testing. Since the early 1980s, every administration, both Republican  and Democrat, has stated that we do not need to conduct underground  nuclear testing. Nothing has changed, and this bill provides billions  of dollars to ensure that it doesn't.   My suggestion to the sponsors of this amendment, Mr. Speaker, is if  you really want to change the policy, then go run for the Senate. There  you can attempt to resurrect the rotting corpse which is the  comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment would prohibit  funding for the W-87-1 nuclear warhead and attempt to life extend the  Minuteman ICBM. In practical terms, this amendment is a backdoor  attempt to kill the U.S. ICBM program.   We have heard time and again from the U.S. Air Force, STRATCOM, and  GAO that the Minuteman ICBM cannot be life extended. The parts simply  don't exist, and we need this new capability.   This would also fly in the face of the decision made by President  Biden in his nuclear posture review to continue retiring the Minuteman  III and replacing it with Sentinel ICBM. This was the same decision  President Trump and President Obama came to when they were reviewing  this data.   Adopting this amendment would also send a terrible signal to our  allies. Allies around the world rely on the protection provided by the  U.S. nuclear umbrella which reduces the incentive for those nations to  pursue nuclear programs of their own. Extending the nuclear guarantee  underwrites the security of over 30 formal treaty allies including  NATO, Japan, Australia, and South Korea. This amendment is akin to  unilateral disarmament and would be a huge win for Russia and China.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon), who serves on the Armed Services  Committee.                                time  1815     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I will say this for my good friend from California: He is persistent.  I hope that this year he is not going to be successful, like he hasn't  been in the past.   This amendment guts a decade and a half of consensus on nuclear  modernization. It would appease foreign dictators and undermine our  alliances. It is opposed by the Pentagon.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment would repeal what  was unanimously inserted into the NDAA during this year's markup.   The underlying bill currently contains a floor of 400 deployed ICBMs.  This is the minimum STRATCOM says it needs to deter both Russia and  China. That is how we got that number, by trusting our military  commanders.   China is building and filling ICBM fields at an unprecedented rate.  Russia is deploying a new heavy Sarmat ICBM. Yet, we are taking time to  debate whether the U.S. should maintain at least 400 ICBMs.   The debate is simple. If you support going lower than the number of  ICBMs that STRATCOM says it needs to deter Russia and China, then you  should support the Tlaib amendment. If you think that 400 is the right  number, and you trust our military commanders in their assessment, then  you should oppose the Tlaib amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson), an outstanding member of the Armed  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment would repeal the  statutory requirement to maintain at least 400 ICBMs. That would  completely undermine our strategic deterrent. I urge all Members to  oppose this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment offers vague language about how the DOD  and VA should plan to address the spread of so-called disinformation in  DOD and veteran communities.   It defines ``malign disinformation'' to include anything harmful to  the good order and discipline or related to vaccinations.   Supporters of this amendment should think long and hard about what  behavior they envision being investigated and criminalized in this  report.   Implying that all who question or all who disagree with COVID  vaccinations are somehow the victims of disinformation is also an  absurd view  [[Page H6281]]  of reality. I find it insulting to our servicemembers and veterans.   This body should not support any language that endorses mass  censorship campaigns based on political beliefs or loose concepts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment is Orwellian and  insulting to servicemembers. I urge all Members to oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment lays the  groundwork for massive new monitoring programs in the name of  preventing extremism.   The amendment would implement verbatim the recommendations of DOD  bureaucrats and political appointees who wrote the two reports.   These reports, which are shoddy and devoid of actual data, recommend  massive expansions of so-called vetting of DOD civilians and  servicemembers.   These recommendations, if implemented, lay the groundwork for new  social media and online activity monitoring, new screening questions  about group and political affiliations, and so-called behavioral  analysis.   The amendment is so poorly drafted that it may require DOD to share  information about extremist activity in the DOD with foreign countries.  It doesn't prohibit the sharing of servicemember information or include  any mention of privacy protections. We can't even say for sure what the  amendment will do.   It asks the DOD to pick six recommendations from a list of 27 policy  ideas. There is a reason we don't implement departmental reports as law  without due consideration. The options range from updating a PowerPoint  to collecting servicemembers' social media data to extremism databases.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment is an abdication of legislative  responsibility and will likely lead to massive civil liberty  infringements at the DOD. I strongly urge its rejection, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment makes unnecessary  changes to section 333 security cooperation reporting requirements and  places needless certification on programs within the Northern Triangle.   The additional reporting requirements are overly burdensome.  Furthermore, requiring additional certification for Northern Triangle  countries is entirely misplaced and not something done for any other  group of countries for security cooperation programs.   It is critically important to maintain, not turn our backs on,  partners in the SOUTHCOM region. Turning our backs on partners only  creates a vacuum for China and Russia to create a greater foothold in  the region.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim).    Mr. Speaker, this amendment weakens our  partnerships in the SOUTHCOM region and helps China to continue their  malign efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this amendment and a ``no'' vote,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, the report required in this  amendment is well intentioned, but the preference against incineration  chooses sides on destruction technology.   We want to make sure the DOD destroys PFAS material using whatever  technology performs the best and conforms to the technical standards  used throughout the Federal Government.   There is a current moratorium on incineration of PFAS material until  guidance on destruction and disposal is published by the administrator  of the EPA.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, again, I oppose this amendment  and urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, this amendment requires the  Department of Defense to establish a voluntary pilot program to provide  secure gun storage or safety devices for personally owned firearms. I  don't think it is the DOD's responsibility. This should be the  responsibility of the servicemember who owns the firearm.   Most firearm manufacturers provide gun locks with the sale of a  firearm. They also are readily available at very low cost at many  sporting goods stores around the country.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I still oppose the amendment. I  urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of these  amendments en bloc.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico  (Miss Gonzalez-Colon), my friend and colleague.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Rogers for  the work he and Chairman Smith did to put this bill together.   I rise in support of the en bloc package No. 2 for the National  Defense Authorization Act of 2023.   This bill includes three of my amendments that will directly benefit  our country's national security as well as the people of Puerto Rico.   My first amendment, 413, directs the Secretary of the Army to ensure  that a modular small arms range is made available for the Army Reserve  in Puerto Rico.   Currently, Puerto Rico only has a single firearms range for  Department of Defense personnel. It is located in Camp Santiago, which  is the south part of the island, which is managed by the Puerto Rico  National Guard, and it is hours away from some of our Army bases on the  island. This amendment was included in the House-passed version of the  NDAA last year.   Amendment 416 requires the Secretary of Defense to enter into an  agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to investigate the  health effects on the island of Vieques that may have been caused by  toxic waste left by the Navy after 70 years of live-fire training. This  amendment was also included in the House-passed version of the NDAA  last year.   My third and final amendment, 417, would require the director of the  Defense Health Agency to conduct a health-related behaviors survey  among the members of all Armed Forces.   This survey, which has been conducted for the past 30 years, was last  conducted in 2018. However, an updated survey is necessary to provide  the Department of Defense with up-to-date information to better  understand the health, health-related behaviors, and well-being of all  servicemembers.   Information on topics such as access to mental healthcare,  understanding the post-deployment needs, and promoting physical health  are needed to identify resources and continue to improve the support  provided to our servicemembers.   Lastly, I will end by expressing my support for the following  amendments that I cosponsored: 958, 968, and 1001, from my friend and  fellow Women's Caucus member, Representative Lawrence from Michigan,  that are included in the en bloc package.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members to vote in favor of this en  bloc package No. 2.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I also urge adoption, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this  amendment and urge our colleagues to vote for it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I, too, urge adoption of this  en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I too urge adoption of the en  bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment would prevent the  Department of Defense from receiving reimbursement under the Economy  Act for support provided to other Federal agencies in firefighting or  disaster response. I support an all-of-Government approach to disaster  response, but DOD does not need to be the piggy bank. FEMA has a  disaster response fund with billions of dollars to reimburse DOD for  their costs. This amendment would be detrimental to readiness and other  mission-critical efforts by taking away funds from their intended use.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I restate my opposition to this  amendment, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
