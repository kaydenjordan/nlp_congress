 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Day  and Day Feed Mill, a family-owned small business in Columbia, KY, as  the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 1954, Garland Day established Day and Day Feed Mill in Columbia,  KY. Garland decided to meet the need for a local feed mill providing  dairy and beef cattle feeds and supplies. A family-run business from  the start, Garland's sons, Allen and Bobby, took over Day and Day Feed  Mill in the early 1960s. Continuing the family legacy, Garland's  grandsons, Anthony and Gary Day, along with their cousin Ray Brock,  stepped up to lead the business in the 1990s. Together, they rebuilt  and expanded the business in 2009, building their new location on the  same spot as the original Day and Day Feed Mill.   Today, Day and Day Feed Mill continues to thrive as a farm supply  store and feed retailer. The family-owned business celebrated its 67th  anniversary in 2021 and is led by the third and fourth generation of  Days. The full-service farm and ranch supply store plays a critical  role in Adair County, providing everything from agro-chemicals and  seeds to fishing and hunting supplies. Additionally, the store supports  local Kentucky small businesses, selling hand-crafted goods and gifts.  The Days' strong sense of family has built a tight-knit, supportive  team, with some families employed there for generations.   Like many small businesses, the Day family has consistently invested  in and served their community. They regularly participate in local and  regional events, ranging from agricultural fairs to hosting an annual  customer appreciation event. Day and Day Feed Mill's outstanding  service and high-quality products have consistently earned them  recognition from industry groups and community members alike. They were  recognized as Business of the Year by the Adair County Cattlemen's  Association in 2012 and Outstanding Agriculturist of the Year in 2018  by the Columbia-Adair County Chamber of Commerce. For several years,  Day and Day Feed Mill has consistently earned the Adair County  Community Voice Readers' Choice Award in several categories, including  Best Agriculture Store, Best Sporting Goods/Hunting Store, and Best  Customer Service. Over the past year, Day and Day Feed Mills adapted to  the challenges caused by the coronavirus pandemic and continued  supporting local farmers as they kept the country fed.   Day and Day Feed Mill is a remarkable example of the critical role  that small, family-oriented agricultural businesses play in rural  communities. Small businesses, like Day and Day Feed Mill, form the  heart of towns across Kentucky and play a critical role in Kentucky's  agricultural industry. Congratulations to Anthony, Gary, Ray, and the  entire team at Day and Day Feed Mill. I wish them the best of luck and  look forward to watching their continued growth and success in  Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Reed  Family Floral of Virgie, KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In January 2020, Evan Sykes founded Reed Family Floral. Evan, who  grew up in Pike County, was inspired by his family's legacy of  entrepreneurship. From 1981 to 2003, his great-aunt and great- grandmother owned and operated a flower shop called Reed Floral. After  graduating from Shelby Valley High School and earning an AA from Big  Sandy Community and Technical College, Evan decided to honor that  legacy and establish his own floral business. Starting with $500, he  began making and selling wreaths. The business grew rapidly, enabling  Evan to purchase a small building to house his operation. When Reed  Family Floral expanded again, Evan had the perfect location in mind. In  August 2021, Evan moved his business into the same building that had  housed his family's flower shop decades earlier.   Today, Reed Family Floral has become a local favorite. As the owner  and sole full-time employee, Evan handles every aspect of the business,  from accounting and marketing, to floral design and delivery. He  prepares flower arrangements for any occasion, including weddings,  school functions, and funerals. Evan's floral arrangements are in  demand year-round, especially around Valentine's Day and Mother's Day.  Notably, Evan balanced his entrepreneurship and education. While  running a full-time business, he is pursuing a BA in accounting at  Morehead State University. As a nonessential business, Reed Family  Floral was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns. Evan  rose to the challenge, working with other small businesses to source  supplies and adapting his contactless delivery options.   Like many small business owners, Evan is active in his community.  Locally, Reed Family Floral has sponsored the Pikeville High School  tennis team and the Shelby Valley High School cheer team. They provide  arrangements for school events, and participate in local fairs. From  day one, Reed Family Floral has valued customer service and high- quality products. Recently, they were recognized by local news outlet  Mountaintop Media as one of the best flower shops in the area.   Reed Family Floral is a remarkable example of the critical role small  businesses play in every aspect of building community. Small businesses  like Reed Family Floral form the heart of towns across Kentucky,  regularly stepping up to support their communities. Congratulations to  Evan and the entire team at Reed Family Floral. I wish them the best of  luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success in  Kentucky.                            ____________________
