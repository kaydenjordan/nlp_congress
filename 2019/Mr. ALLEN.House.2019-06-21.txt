 Madam Chair, I rise to thank the chairwoman and ranking  member for including the Allen-Hice amendment in this en bloc package.   Congressman Hice and I worked together to introduce this bipartisan  amendment to fully fund the President's budget request for construction  of the second project of the cyber instructional facility at Fort  Gordon.   As we all know, cyber is the present and future of modern warfare. In  Georgia 12, the district I have the honor of representing, we are at  the forefront of advanced cyber innovation. In the changing electronic  world in which we live, U.S. Army Cyber Command is an increasingly  significant part of our national security efforts.   U.S. Army Cyber Command is currently transitioning to Ford Gordon,  and this transition requires construction of state-of-the-art  facilities that can accommodate the rapid change of pace required in  cyberspace.   I thank Congressman Hice for joining me in introducing this  amendment, and I urge the passage of this en bloc package.
