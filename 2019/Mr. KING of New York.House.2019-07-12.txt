 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  recognizing me, and let me also thank the gentleman for the support  that the gentleman has given to this bill.   When the gentleman from Georgia went on the bill, it was a major  turning point, so I thank the gentleman for that. It also shows that  this is not a partisan or regional issue. It affects people in all  parties, all districts in the United States, and all States throughout  the country.   This was a major effort which the country came together on after 9/ 11, and as a result of that, there have been casualties and deaths from  all over the country. Now, in my own district, I had 150 people killed,  but I believe there are going to be even more than that by the time  these illnesses run their course.   There are so many people in the prime of life who have been cut down  from these 9/11 cancers, blood disorders, and the various intestinal  tract illnesses. It has just been a horrible experience to go through  for all of these people and their families.   But today is a major milestone on the road to full justice for all  those who risked their lives both on the day of 9/11 and in the days,  weeks, and months after 9/11: those who worked down at the pile of  Ground Zero, those who risked their lives then and are now suffering  the consequences of that and those who will suffer the consequences in  the years ahead. These are late-developing cancers, and that is why it  is so important that this bill be passed.   Let me stress again how bipartisan this is. I commend Jerry Nadler  and Carolyn Maloney for the outstanding work they have done. This goes  back more than 15 years that this fight has  [[Page H5746]]  gone on in one dimension or another. Hopefully, this will be the final  struggle we have. Many details have to be worked out, but this should  be it, today, as far as finally doing what has to be done for those men  and women from 9/11.   Let me also thank the Speaker, Nancy Pelosi. She was instrumental in  getting this passed back in 2010, and I want to thank the gentlewoman  for keeping her commitment to making sure we got it done this year on a  bipartisan basis.   Also, we have people here today like Jake Lemonda from the UFOA, the  Uniformed Fire Officers Association, and Gerald Fitzgerald from the  Uniformed Firefighters Association of Greater New York. We have people,  again, on both sides.   I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Lee Zeldin and Congressman  Fitzpatrick from Pennsylvania, for their efforts.   We have to, again, make sure that the message goes out to the  American people that this is not a regional bill. This is something  that involves the entire Nation. This involves the commitment of the  United States to always stand with and be with those who put their  lives on the line for the rest of us.   So, again, I can't emphasize enough the importance of this. The men  and women out there, those people in our districts that we see, those  people who we see day in and day out, week in and week out, those who  are suffering, those who have had their benefits cut because of the  shortage in the fund, that can never be allowed to happen. We have to  go forward.   And, again, I want to emphasize that this is bipartisan. This  involves the entire Nation, and it is important that we target those  who are the enemies here. The terrorists who attacked on 9/11 brought this about. They are the ones who caused this.   It is the men and women who responded, who went back down to that  pile day after day after day, week after week, month after month, doing  what they could in the rescue and recovery effort, who showed unusual  courage. The least we should do is show what is expected of us, and  that is to do what has to be done to make sure that they and their  families receive the compensation that they need and are entitled to.  This is part of the lasting debt America has to the men and women of 9/ 11 and those who worked in the days, weeks, and months afterwards.    Madam Chair, I urge full support of this legislation. Hopefully, when  it goes to the Senate, it will be acted on quickly. The victims of 9/11  have been waiting too long as it is. We can't allow a day to go by. I  urge adoption of the bill.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
