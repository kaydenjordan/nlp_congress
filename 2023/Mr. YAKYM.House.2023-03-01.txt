 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment is a simple one. It would require  that the President's inflation analysis include not just a top-line  estimate but also a breakdown to the CPI's three major subgroups: food,  energy, and all items less food and energy.   Americans are navigating inflation rates not seen in generations, and  their dollar isn't going far enough because wages aren't keeping up. It  is no wonder that a recent Gallup poll found that 50 percent of  Americans say they are worse off financially than just a year ago, and  that is a level not seen since the Great Recession.   Let me be clear: We have this generational inflation thanks to 2  years of runaway spending. I will grant that the pandemic caused  massive disruptions to our economy, supply chains, and our way of life.  It was going to be a bumpy ride coming out of that.   However, policies like the American Rescue Plan that were rammed  through Congress without a single Republican vote threw gasoline on the  fire and supercharged inflation. With one hand, the government was  giving away money, and with the other hand, they were taking it right  back, and then some, due to inflation.   Yet, Americans have essentially been told not to believe their lying  eyes. They were assured that inflation would merely be ``transitory,''  even as it spiraled higher. They were told it was all Vladimir Putin's  fault, even though energy inflation averaged just over 21 percent in  2021, the year before Russia invaded Ukraine.   Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act--again, without a single  Republican vote. The only problem with the Inflation Reduction Act is  that it doesn't actually reduce inflation.   Everyday Americans' experience with inflation has made one thing  abundantly clear: Not all inflation is created equal. Energy and food  inflation are particularly harmful. There is no more kitchen-table  issue than food inflation. There is no more readily available reminder  of the toll of inflation than the price at the pump.   Energy and food inflation impact every single American and hit those  living paycheck to paycheck especially hard. Seniors and others on  fixed incomes have watched helplessly as costs have risen beyond their  ability to keep up.  [[Page H983]]    My amendment will ensure that the President keeps food and energy  costs front and center before signing an executive order by breaking  out the inflation analysis down to CPI's three main subgroups: food,  energy, and all items less food and energy.   An overall inflation figure is not enough. Last month's inflation  reading showed a 6.4 percent year-over-year rise in top-line inflation,  but let's drill down one level deeper. Food inflation was 10.1 percent,  and energy inflation was 8.7. This has been the story for the last 2  years. Energy inflation has outpaced overall inflation for 24 of the  last 24 months, and food inflation has outpaced overall inflation for  13.   The top-line number simply doesn't tell the entire story. Drilling  down one level deeper in the inflation analysis will increase  transparency for the American people. It will focus attention not just  on inflation but on the type of inflation.   If the President wants to sign an executive order that, for example,  bans new energy production, the American people deserve to know how  that order will impact energy inflation.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Comer).    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight and celebrate a  very special group of Hoosiers.   Over the weekend, the Fairfield Falcons girls basketball team out of  Goshen, Indiana, captured the 3A State title for the first time in  school history.   The Falcons 49-42 win over Corydon Central in Indianapolis was  exhilarating and extra special as it marked Fairfield's first State  trophy in any sport.   We have all heard the maxim, ``defense wins championships,'' and for  the Falcons it turned out to be true.   All season long the Falcons' defense was downright stingy, allowing  the fewest points per game out of any team in Indiana. But it wasn't  only because of their defense that the Falcons are celebrating. In  particular, Head Coach Brodie Garber credits four senior girls he is  graduating for consistently providing leadership and mentorship needed  for his team to take on the title.   Congratulations to Coach Garber and all the Falcons--both players and  staff--on bringing home the hardware.   Thank you for making Hoosiers in Goshen and beyond so incredibly  proud.   God bless you, and God bless America.                            ____________________
