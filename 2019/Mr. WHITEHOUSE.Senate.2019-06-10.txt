 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I come to the floor of the Senate  today, as I do every year at this time, to remember what Rhode Island  abolitionist Frances Whipple McDougall called ``the first blood [drawn]  in the Revolution.'' This past Sunday marked the 247th anniversary of  the Gaspee raid.   This is an image of what happened to the Gaspee. We ought to  remember. Most Americans do not know about the Gaspee Affair. They have  learned about a far tamer incident in Boston Harbor a year later, when  some tipsy Bostonians toppled bales of tea into the water.   I get why Bostonians are proud of their tea party. It is a decent  story that tea was ruined, the British East India Company was out some  money, the Crown got angry, and the American patriots gained notoriety  and momentum for our cause.   But the Gaspee raid offers so much more--a true villain, a daring  escape, a vigorous call to action, the storming of a ship, the  vanquishing of an enemy, a blast in the night, and an earlier stirring  of revolutionary spirit.   The story begins in the 1760s, with King George and the English  Parliament trying to raise money. The Crown needed to recoup losses  from expensive recent wars, and the Colonies seemed like a convenient  place to turn. Their solution was to allow the powerful British Navy to  enforce customs laws, transforming naval officers into well-armed tax  collectors.   The Admiralty commissioned sloops and schooners to troll the  Colonies' most profitable waters for tax revenue. In Narragansett Bay  the Crown sent Lieutenant William Dudingston in an eight-gun schooner,  the Gaspee. The boat and its captain quickly earned a nasty reputation.  Dudingston stopped virtually every vessel in sight, from the biggest  schooners to the smallest packet boats. He harassed sailors, seized  cargo, and annexed Rhode Island vessels, merchants, and watermen, often  on shaky or nonexistent charges.   Historian George Washington Greene, a Rhode Islander and grandson of  Rhode Island's legendary Revolutionary War hero, Major General  Nathaniel Greene, described Dudingston's conduct this way:         Not contented with performing the duties of his office,       still vexatious even when considerately executed, he       multiplied its annoyances by a thousand acts of petty       tyranny. He stopped vessels of every kind without       discrimination--ships just from sea and market boats on their       way to Providence and Newport with their perishable freights,       and to increase the indignity refused to show his commission       or the authority by which he acted.    A further insult, Dudingston sent prisoners and cargo to Boston to  face justice before a British tribunal, not the Rhode Island court  established in Newport. This violated the Colony's agreement with the  Crown to adjudicate such disputes on Rhode Island's soil, an offense to  our Colony's sovereignty.   From winter to spring of 1772, tensions in Narragansett Bay rose.  Among the incidents involving the loathed Gaspee, Dudingston  commandeered Fortune, the ship belonging to the influential merchant  and later Revolutionary War hero, Nathaniel Greene. Rhode Islander  Daniel Harrington notes in a 2017 Providence Journal article that ``the  patriotic fervor'' that had swept ``the colonies [had] seemed to elude  [Greene]--until Dudingston snagged his Fortune and ignited the  righteous spirit of resentment.''   When Greene later led the Continental Army's successful Southern  Campaign, British General Cornwallis would lament: ``That damned Greene  is more dangerous than Washington.'' The ignited spirit was a forceful  one.   On June 9, 1772, the coastal trader Hannah caught Lieutenant  Dudingston's eye as she sailed up Narragansett Bay en route to  Providence. The Gaspee pursued the Hannah and ordered her to stop for  inspection. The Hannah refused. The Gaspee fired a warning shot. The  Hannah sailed on.   Off Warwick's shore, near Pawtuxet Village, things came to a head.  According to the account of Rhode Islander Ephraim Bowen, the Hannah's  skipper, Benjamin Lindsey, sailed his lighter boat over shallows around  Namquid  [[Page S3279]]  Point. Dudingston followed in chase taking his Gaspee, a heavier boat,  into waters too shallow for it. The Gaspee ran aground in a falling  tide.   The Hannah sped on to Providence. Captain Lindsey alerted respected  local merchant John Brown, later a founder of Brown University. Brown  ``immediately concluded that [the Gaspee] would remain immovable until  after midnight,'' Ephraim Bowen recalls, and saw what he calls the  ``opportunity offered of putting an end to the trouble and vexation she  daily caused.''   A Providence man named Daniel Pearce ``passed along the main street,  beating a drum and informing the inhabitants of the fact that the  Gaspee was aground on Namquid Point and would not float until 3 o'clock  the next morning,'' Bowen recalled. Pearce invited ``those persons who  felt a disposition to go and destroy that troublesome vessel to repair  in the evening to Mr. James Sabin's house,'' presumably for some strong  spirits and discussion of an attack.   Once assembled and refreshed, the Rhode Islanders set off into a  moonless night in eight longboats with muffled oars. The group's  ``powder was prepared and bullets run'' as it ``set forth on its  mission of vengeance,'' George Washington Green recorded.   Aboard the Gaspee, the seaman standing watch, Bartholomew Cheever,  first thought he saw light dancing off rocks in the near-blackness.  Suddenly, however, Cheever realized the glints he saw were more than  rocks. The Rhode Islanders and their long boats encircled the Gaspee.  Cheever alerted Dudingston, and Dudingston ordered his men to fire on  the assault party. The Rhode Islanders, however, outnumbered the  British crew by more than 4 to 1 and quickly overwhelmed the Gaspee. A  brief and decisive melee ensued. Soon, Dudingston lay on the  quarterdeck with musket wounds to his arm and groin. The Gaspee would  never again be under British command.   The Rhode Islanders ferried the British crew to shore, where they  were awaited by the Pawtuxet Rangers, a group that exists still today.  The raiders then returned once more to set fire to the Gaspee. The fire  burned until it reached the powder magazines below the Gaspee's decks,  and when the fire reached the magazines, the Gaspee was blown to bits  and was no more.   King George soon learned of the Gaspee raid and was not pleased. The  raiders would face charges of treason, he said, and the gallows, were  they to be found guilty and convicted. The Crown put up the colossal  reward of 500 pounds sterling for the capture of the rebels--50 times  what a colonial farmer would earn in a year.   No Rhode Islander would give up the raiders. Try as they might,  British authorities never found and never convicted the brave raiders  who burned the Gaspee. Word of the Gaspee raid spread swiftly through  the Colonies and stirred revolutionary spirit. George Washington was  actually hosting a British officer when he heard the story. The officer  exclaimed that the Rhode Islanders ought to be ``phlebotomized'' and  that he would personally march 5,000 British regulars ``from Boston to  Charleston, South Carolina, and put down all opposition to the revenue  acts.'' To that assertion, Washington shot back:         I question not, Sir, that you could march from Boston into       Charleston, South Carolina, at the head of 5,000 British       regulars; but do you mean to say, Sir, that you could do so,       as a friend, or as an enemy? If as the latter, and you will       allow me a few weeks' notice of your intention, I will engage       to give you a handsome check with the Virginia riflemen       alone.    Washington punctuated his retort, as an onlooker reported, by  ``[striking] the table so violently with his clenched hand that some  wine glasses and a decanter near him with difficulty maintained their  upright positions.''   Every year, Rhode Islanders gather for a celebration and parade  through Warwick, the neighborhood off of which this event took place.  We gather to remember the daring assault on the Gaspee. We recall our  forebears' resolve for independence, freedom of religion, and the rule  of law. We are also glad to remember that Rhode Islanders are not to be  trifled with. This is a story worth remembering.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
