 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, an 18-year-old carrying  an assault-type weapon shattered the peace in a quiet residential  neighborhood in Farmington, New Mexico.   Three beautiful souls lost their lives. Many more were wounded and  numerous others traumatized.   I praise the heroes who drove to danger to stop the violence. I am  ever grateful for the coordination between local, State, county, and  Federal law enforcement.  [[Page H2372]]    I pray for the quick recovery of the wounded and for the families of  those we lost.   I imagine a world where mothers and fathers drop off their children  at school without fear, a world where families can gather to worship or  simply be at peace in their neighborhood.   Sadly, that peace is shattered by gun violence somewhere in America  every single day. Every day, we are reminded that we don't yet live in  a peaceful country, and yesterday was no exception.   Many of us standing and listening and praying today are committed to  banning assault weapons, especially for an 18-year-old. We are  committed to bringing peace to our communities.   Now, I invite all Members of the United States House of  Representatives to join me in a moment of silence, a moment of  gratitude to our law enforcement, and a moment of prayer to honor the  lives of those we tragically lost yesterday.                            ____________________
