 Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:        The Senator from Maine [Mr. KING] moves to commit the bill       H.R. 1 to the Committee on Finance with instructions to       report the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting       any day on which the Senate is not in session, with changes       that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) cause the bill to not increase the deficit for the       period of fiscal years 2018 through 2027.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 4 p.m. will be equally divided  for debate on the motion.   The Senator from Louisiana.                          Honoring our Armed Forces                         Airman Matthew Chialastri     Mr. President, I called my motion up that is now on the  floor of the U.S. Senate. It is a very simple one. It may be one of the  most straightforward, short motions to be offered in the course of this  debate. The motion is very simple. It refers this bill back to the  committee with instructions to bring back a bill which is deficit- neutral. I believe that can be done, and I think it can be done in a  very short period of time. I think it is important, and I am going to  outline why.   Before I get to that, I will mention that Senators Tester,  Whitehouse, Harris, Van Hollen, Kaine, Warner, Bennet, Udall, Heitkamp,  Manchin, Coons, Feinstein, and Donnelly are all announced supporters of  this motion. I offer my thanks and appreciation to them for their  assistance.   Again, the motion is very simple. Recommit the bill. Have the  committee work it once more, and come back to the Senate floor with a  bill that does not bust the deficit.   This is one of the most important votes any of us will take in this  body. I think it may be the most important. This is a bill that will  affect America and Americans for a generation. If past history is any  guide, this will be the major tax reform bill for the next 20 to 30  years. It will affect every business, every citizen, and our entire  economy. The stakes, in other words, are incredibly high, and it is my  assumption that when the stakes are high, the bar for the process will  also be high. If you are doing something with such enormous  ramifications, it is common sense that you take a great deal of care to  thoroughly understand the provisions of the bill, its implications, its  impacts, its possible unintended consequences and be as careful as  possible in order to determine how this bill will affect our country  and our economy.   Instead, we have the worst possible process. In other words, we have  the highest stakes and the lowest process. It is the worst process, I  think, I have ever seen in a public body. The Bangor City Council would  not amend the leash law using this process. We are talking about one of  the most important bills that any of us will ever vote on that has had  zero hearings before the U.S. Senate. It has had no input from the  citizenry, no input from outside the community of this body--in fact,  outside the committee that has brought the bill to the floor. There has  been no outside expert analysis. There are bound to be mistakes in this  bill.  [[Page S7528]]    In fact, I have a new rule I am proposing today. I am calling it,  modestly, King's law. King's law is: The faster a bill goes through  this body, the worse it will be. That is what we are talking about  today. We are talking about bringing something through the U.S.  Senate--supposedly the world's most deliberative body--with little or  no deliberation, and the impacts are going to be enormous. I just  believe we can slow down and do this right.   The last time there was major tax reform in this country was 1986. It  is very instructive to look back and watch and look and see how they  did it.   No. 1, it was bipartisan from the beginning, and the Senate Finance  Committee had 33 hearings on the bill--33 as compared to 0. Have we  really fallen that far in this institution that we cannot even have a  series of hearings to understand what it is we are doing? It took 10  months to consider that bill, come to a conclusion, and have a vote on  the Senate floor--10 months. We are talking about a matter of days for  the consideration of this bill. The final point about the 1986 bill is  that it had passed the Senate with 90 votes.   That could happen here. Two days ago, I was on a stage with 16  colleagues--Members of the Democratic caucus--all of whom were  prepared, ready, anxious, and able to support tax reform, including  cutting the corporate tax rate to make our businesses more competitive,  but there has been no process to let them in, to allow them to talk.   The point I am trying to make here is, the vote we take tonight or  tomorrow morning--or whenever it is--does not have to be the end of  this process. It can be the beginning of a real process, which is what  it should be.   Now, one of my concerns--there are a lot of problems with this bill,  but the concern I want to focus on today and is the background of my  amendment which recommits and asks that the committee come back with a  deficit-neutral bill--is the debt and deficit itself.   This is a chart that should strike fear into the heart of every  American. This is basically the history of our national debt as a  percentage of the gross domestic product. This isn't dollars because  that can be misleading. Dollars, of course, are worth less now than  they were in 1930 or in 1850.   This is a percentage of the gross domestic product. It started back  in 1790, when the early Americans were paying off the debt from the  Revolutionary War. If you will notice, there is a pattern here that  stops right here. The pattern is, when we get into major catastrophes,  including wars, that is when we have to borrow money, and that is what  we did. Here is the Civil War, but it was paid down in 1910. Then there  was World War I--another huge expenditure. This is why you preserve  your borrowing power for when you actually need it. Then there was  World War II. Now, this line that goes down right here is of the  ``greatest generation.'' The ``greatest generation'' not only fought  World War II, but they paid for it. They paid down the debt, and it  goes down into the 1970s. Then we have a bump up and then down.   Look at where we are headed. We are headed to a place where we are  not going to be able to sustain this debt. Everybody knows that. Yet  the bill we are voting on today expands the deficit by somewhere  between a half trillion dollars and two and a half trillion dollars,  depending upon how it is all sorted out. Of course, there is a little  bit of fake bookkeeping, where the personal changes to the Tax Code  expire in order to not bump up the cost within the budget window, but  everybody knows, and the people in the majority who are supporting this  bill are winking and nodding and saying: Of course, those will be  extended. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say they are going  to be extended and take credit for that and then turn around and say  but don't worry about the deficit.   This is the ``greatest generation.'' This is the ``me too''  generation that is not paying for things, and it is shameful. It is  going to come back to haunt us. Here is why.   We are now in a kind of ``Alice in Wonderland'' of interest rates-- the lowest interest rates that we have had in my lifetime. Around 2  percent is what we are paying on our Federal debt. The problem is, the  average for interest rates on our Federal debt over the last 50 years  has been about 5.5 percent. It is a really easy calculation when the  debt is $20 trillion, for 1 percent on the debt is $200 billion a year.  If you go to 5.5 percent, just interest on the debt is $1.1 trillion.  Now, if that number rings a bell for anyone in this room, that is  because that is the size of the entire current Federal discretionary  budget, defense and nondefense--$1.1 trillion just in interest.  Interest rates are already starting to creep up. This is not an  abstract fear; this is a high likelihood.   I have been around public life and politics for a long time, and I  have heard a lot about deficits. People have been concerned about  deficits until today. The deficit doesn't seem to be a big deal  anymore. I predict that after this bill passes, within a couple of  years when the deficits start to mount up, the same people who are  voting for this bill today are going to say: Oh, my goodness. We have  these huge deficits. What are we going to do? I think we have to cut  entitlements; we have to cut Social Security; we have to cut Medicare;  and, certainly, we have to cut all of those domestic programs. I do not  think that is right.   We had a hearing this morning in the Armed Services Committee with a  group of people who were talking about our national defense strategy.  Virtually everyone at that table--I think there were five or six-- agreed that the cost of rebuilding our defense capability over the next  10 years will be about $1 trillion. That is over and above the current  defense budget. We are talking about an additional $1 trillion. That  happens to be the amount that this tax bill will suck out of the  revenues of this country and be unavailable for any purpose, including  defense.   Those who are concerned in this body about national security should  be very concerned about this bill. I believe it will make it impossible  to do the kind of restoration of the national security apparatus in  this country that is necessary because we are not going to have the  money.   What we are doing is simply borrowing money from our children to give  ourselves tax cuts. That is really the essence of what is going on  here. If we were cutting taxes on a revenue-neutral basis, that would  make sense. I think you could make an argument for broadening the base  and lowering the rates. All of those kinds of things could be done, and  you could get the stimulative effect. Instead, all we are doing is  shifting the tax to our kids. If you are already in a deficit situation  and you cut taxes further, it makes a hole. You fill the hole with  borrowed money, and that borrowed money is going to have to be paid  back by these young people who are sitting in this room today.   If 5-year-olds knew what we were doing and could vote, none of us  would have jobs because we are spending their money. It is as if you  are lying on your deathbed, you call your children over to hear your  last words, and your last words are: Here is the credit card. We had a  great vacation, your mother and I. You pay the bill. That is what we  are doing. It is wrong. It is unethical. We are passing the bill on to  our children.    I know that the purpose is to stimulate economic growth, and I am all  for it. I believe, and said earlier on, that I can see where a  reduction of corporate tax rates and offshore rates is called for to  make us competitive in the world economy, but the idea that these tax  cuts are going to pay for themselves--it has never happened. It has  never happened. It hasn't happened. It didn't happen with the Bush tax  cuts. It hasn't happened in Kansas. It just hasn't happened.   We are talking about a dramatic increase in the Federal deficit on  top of what is already coming. That is what is really bothersome about  this. We can't talk about this bill in isolation without acknowledging  we are already spending half a trillion dollars per year more than we  are taking in--in relatively good times. These are the times when we  should be paying back this debt, not making it worse.   No rational business would be taking on debt when they are doing  well. When you are doing well, you pay down your debt, and then you  have a reserve for when you need it. We have no reserve. We are using  up our cushion. We are using up whatever cushion we might need for  disasters, for some kind of, heaven forbid, conflict, or simply for a  recession.  [[Page S7529]]    This is an incredibly destructive bill, and it doesn't have to be  that way. It doesn't have to be that way.   This is a place where I believe we can work together. This isn't a  yes-or-no issue. I understand the healthcare debate was a yes-or-no  issue: Do you want to repeal the Affordable Care Act or not? Yes or no?  This, however, is about numbers. Should the corporate rate be 25, 22,  28, or 20? Or how do we deal with the AMT or the estate tax or the  personal exemption? All of those dials can be changed in order to  achieve a targeted growth, which is what we all want. I realize growth  is the best way to solve this problem without, at the same time,  exacerbating this really serious deficit problem that we are headed  into.   There are provisions of this bill that have nothing to do with  economic growth. The estate tax--what does that have to do with it?  Eliminating the AMT--what does that have to do with economic growth?  There are provisions in this bill that don't meet the theory of the  bill, yet significantly aggravate its fiscal effect.   My motion is straightforward: Recommit the bill and come back with a  deficit-neutral bill, which I think can be done. It wouldn't take a  month. We can have some hearings that will give us some information  about what the impacts of this bill will be, and we will have a much  better bill. It will be a bipartisan bill, and we can meet the  responsibilities we have to the American people. I believe we owe the  people no less.   As I said at the beginning, there will be no more important bill we  can vote on in this body in our careers, and we owe it to the American  people to, No. 1, understand fully what we are voting on and, No. 2, to  do it in the most careful possible way to be the most targeted and most  effective and most responsible change that we can make in order to help  our economy and also to help all the people of this country.   There are many other issues with the bill, but I chose today to focus  my remarks and also my motion on the effects on the deficit because I  think it is one of the most long-term threats. In fact, the former head  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the national debt is the most  serious threat to our national security in the long run, and to  aggravate it unnecessarily, as this bill would do, I think is  irresponsible.   We can do better, I am sure, if we will slow down, listen to one  another, and do what the American people expect of us.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Pennsylvania.
