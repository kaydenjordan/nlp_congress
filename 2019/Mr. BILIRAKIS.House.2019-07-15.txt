 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Wilson for yielding. He is a  great friend, as well as the chairman. I thank Chairman Engel for  putting this on the floor. Of course, I thank my colead, Mr. Kildee.   Sudan is at a critical juncture between choosing freedom and  democracy or continuing with authoritarian oppression. This resolution  today is a powerful message for the United States that we stand behind  the civilian protestors and a civilian-led government.   Yesterday's violence and the horrific brutality on June 3 proved that  elements of the old regime are still alive and well, unfortunately. Bad  actors within the military, such as the Rapid Support Forces, should be  condemned for their actions and have no place in Sudan's future.   The United States and the international community need to maintain  pressure on the military council to cease all attacks on peaceful  protestors and civilians and to respect their right to assemble  peacefully. The Rapid Support Forces and other perpetrators of violence  also need to be held accountable for their violent acts. These bad  actors have no place in a peaceful and democratic Sudan.   Again, I am proud to be the colead on this timely resolution with Mr.  Kildee. I thank him for his leadership.   One story that I like to tell is when I was in Sudan, in March, I met  with a United States citizen who was a political prisoner there,  detained since January 4, away from his four children and his wife. He  went over to Sudan a few years ago to take care of his mother, his  elderly mother, and I respect that tremendously. He allowed his  brother, who also is a U.S. citizen, to come to the United States and  practice medicine.   Well, in any case, the gentleman was detained because he took his  body to a peaceful rally, a peaceful protest, a democratic rally for  democracy, and he was detained and put in jail. I met with him outside  of jail and he told me his story. We demanded his release, and within a  few days he was released, Mr. Speaker.   Anyway, this just tells you that we have a voice here, as United  States Members of Congress, and we need to use it for a good cause.  This is definitely a good cause.                                time  1530
