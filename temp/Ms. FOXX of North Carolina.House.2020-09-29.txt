 Madam Speaker, on Saturday, the American  people eagerly awaited President Trump's announcement of his third  Supreme Court nomination, and he did not disappoint.  [[Page H5038]]    Judge Amy Coney Barrett is the embodiment of a fierce constitutional  scholar, and her long list of accomplishments is nothing short of  impeccable. She is highly regarded by her former students, clerks, and  colleagues as a woman who possesses a piercing legal mind, a generous  spirit, and a keen intellect. Her dedication to interpreting the  Constitution rightfully by adhering to how it was expressly written and  her impressive track record serve as the underpinnings of her  nomination.   I look forward to her swift confirmation to the Supreme Court and her  continued work serving our great country.                            ____________________
