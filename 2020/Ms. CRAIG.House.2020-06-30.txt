 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for yielding and for  all his work on this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, we must fix our crumbling roads and bridges, expand  broadband--which is the infrastructure of the 21st century--and give  our communities the tools to build resilience against natural  disasters.   This is something my communities across Minnesota's Second  Congressional District are united on. They partnered with me to help  shape the surface transportation provisions in this bill, which include  investments in our infrastructure that would put Minnesotans to work on  critical infrastructure needs like:   Adding a lane on I-35 in Lakeville;   Improving Highway 52 in Goodhue County; and   Completing outstanding projects on Trunk Highway 13 in Savage.   I am proud that today's legislation includes two bills that I have  authored guided by mayors, small business owners, and farmers across my  District--the Local Water Protection Act and the Resilience Revolving  Loan Fund Act--to keep pollutants out of our snow and storm runoff.  This bill will give our communities the resilience they need before  those natural disasters hit.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to set partisan politics aside and  stand up for the infrastructure investment for our communities.
