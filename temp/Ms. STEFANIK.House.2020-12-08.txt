 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  bipartisan bill.   As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Intelligence and  Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I am I proud of our oversight and  legislative activities this year, which have included recharging our  science and technology enterprise, strengthening our Nation's  cybersecurity, expanding the resources and authorities for irregular  warfare activities across the globe, and bolstering our biological  threat and pandemic preparedness efforts.   Two years ago, I introduced legislation in the NDAA that created the  National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence with the  purpose of accelerating and advancing the development of AI across the  Federal Government. I applaud the commission for their work on this  important issue, and I am pleased that this conference report includes  17 of those recommendations, including elevating the role of the Joint  AI Center; modernizing how the DOD attracts and retains AI talent; and  ensuring our AI research ecosystem maintains its competitive advantage  over China.                                time  1300    Second, this bill extends and expands the opportunities for our  Special Operations Forces to partner with foreign forces, build  critical relationships, and more effectively counter the malign  influences of Russia and China. This bill also ensures that all of our  Special Operations Forces--active duty, reserve, National Guard and  their families are provided the care and support that they deserve.   Third, this bill takes concrete steps to protect critical defense  technologies, strengthen cybersecurity cooperation with the defense  industrial base, and rebuild our domestic manufacturing capabilities  for sensitive microelectronics and semiconductor components. This bill  brings transparency to Federally funded research while at the same time  restricting foreign influence on our university campuses.   As the chief advocate for Fort Drum and the 10th Mountain Division, I  am proud to deliver results for the Army's most deployed division since  9/11. This year's NDAA addresses our homeland missile defense, as Fort  Drum is named as the preferred East Coast missile defense site. I am  also proud to include provisions that require plans for renovating  child development centers and review of IT infrastructure enhancements  at Army mission training complexes. These provisions are critical to  enhance readiness and ensure the 10th Mountain Division can conduct  safe and secure operations.   I recognize my partner, my colleague, Congressman  Jim Langevin of  Rhode Island. And lastly, I thank Ranking Member Thornberry for his  extraordinary leadership and guidance, not only this year, but in many  years of his truly exemplary service. He is a giant in the people's  House, and he will be sorely missed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill and vote  ``yes.''
