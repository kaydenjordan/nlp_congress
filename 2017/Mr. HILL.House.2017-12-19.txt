 Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute the U.S. Navy's newest  vessel, the USS Little Rock, and her brave crew.   Commissioned this past Saturday, the new USS Little Rock was built in  Wisconsin and is a littoral combat ship that will operate in waters  close to shore.   The vessel carries with it the namesake of Arkansas' State capital  and the proud history of the former USS Little Rock.   Today, it is also fitting to honor the former USS Little Rock.  Completed in World War II, she was one of six vessels to be converted  to a guided missile cruiser. She was the first U.S. Navy ship to be  named for Little Rock, Arkansas.   The only World War II cruiser on display in the United States, the  former USS Little Rock is the sole survivor of the Cleveland class.   The USS Little Rock served with distinction as a flagship for both  the second and the sixth fleets.   I thank all of those who served on the former USS Little Rock. I wish  the new USS Little Rock the best as she carries out our Nation's  critical maritime strategy and protects our interests across the globe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 3312, a bipartisan bill. A majority  of the majority party and a majority of the minority party on our  committee reported this bill to the House floor. It is sponsored by my  friend, Chairman Blaine Luetkemeyer, who has spent years studying Dodd- Frank, seven long years of studying the impact of Dodd-Frank, and how  to improve it.   This bill removes a requirement that uses $50 billion as an asset  test to designate whether a banking company in this country is  systemically important and, if they are, subject them to higher  regulatory standards.   But instead of ending too-big-to-fail, Dodd-Frank's misguided  designation regime just entrenches it, Mr. Speaker.   Authorizing the government to designate large financial institutions  as systemically important creates a new class of firms that markets  will interpret and assume are too big to fail.   The SIFI designation, as noted by many Members on this side of the  aisle, is, in fact, arbitrary, and I respect my friend that other  numbers in statute may be arbitrary as well. But this one doesn't have  any economic basis on why the participants in designing Dodd-Frank  picked $50 billion.   But over the past 7 years, we have had witness after witness tell us  that we should look a different direction and not have an arbitrary  number of $50 billion.   Several Federal Reserve officials have expressed that similar view.  Mr. Frank, as noted, has expressed that view. So here comes Mr.  Luetkemeyer with an excellent idea, an idea of an activities-based  designation that the Fed has designed itself, Mr. Speaker.   The Federal Reserve has designed the metric we are using to say that  an institution is systemically important. It is activities-based so  that we can distinguish between levels of risk that might be  systemically important to our country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time.   So activity-based standards have already been found effective by the  Federal Reserve. They work and they were used in evaluating  acquisitions on regional banking companies. So Mr. Luetkemeyer is on to  a good idea. Mr. Speaker, instead of using $50 billion that was  plucked out of thin air in the dead of night in the conference  committee in 2010, let's reflect on 7 years and operate in a better  way.    So I urge support of this bill, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Luetkemeyer  for bringing it. I urge our Senators on the other end of this building  to look at this as a model for how we should reform Dodd-Frank in their  own bill.
