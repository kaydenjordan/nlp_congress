 Madam Speaker, America's drug epidemic hit a mild  sobering milestone recently when last year over 100,000 people died of  drug overdoses. There are 275 Americans dying every day. That is the  highest level ever.   My home State of Tennessee experienced some 3,400 fatal drug  overdoses, which is a 49 percent rise from the previous year.   Having served as a community pharmacist for over 30 years in East  Tennessee, this is personal for me. Every one of those people are  someone's parents or someone's children. The main driver of this  increasing death toll is illegal synthetic fentanyl, which is  inexpensive to manufacturer, can be 50 times stronger than heroin, and  people can die from doses equal to only a few grains of sand.   Most illegal, counterfeit fentanyl is developed in China and  trafficked into the U.S. across the border with Mexico by drug cartels  and other criminals. As a Member of the Homeland Security Committee, I  have been to the border to see things firsthand.   Customs and Border Protection officials outrightly admit that  increasing amounts of illicit fentanyl being smuggled, infecting our  communities, and fueling overdoses is largely due to the Biden  administration's chaotic open border policies. When you have the drug  totals up higher than what the cost is--you can get a dose for $20 on  the street, which is unbelievable right now.   These open border policies are effectively a green light to Mexican  drug cartels--looking to exploit an increasingly overloaded immigration  system--to trafficking alarming amounts of counterfeit fentanyl across  the border.   President Biden must take immediate action to reverse the border  crisis his policies created, secure our southern border, and stop the  influx of fentanyl pouring into our country and wreaking havoc on our  communities.
