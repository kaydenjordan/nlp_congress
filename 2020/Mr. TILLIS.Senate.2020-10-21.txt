 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to finish my comments before the vote.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the  brave and hard-working men and women of law enforcement across this  Nation.   Last month, I talked about the dangerous consequences of inaction by  the Senate if we didn't come to protect them. Unfortunately, since my  last speech, four more law enforcement officers, men and women, have  died--been murdered--in the line of duty. That is a 20-percent increase  over the number last year.   That doesn't count the hundreds of police officers who have been  injured in the line of duty, many of them still recovering from their  wounds. The groundswell of violence against law enforcement is  shocking, and it is our responsibility as Senators to act.   Enough is enough. Rather than support radical ideas like defunding  and abolishing the police, the Senate should take the lead and pass  meaningful legislation to protect law enforcement officers, increasing  funding, improving training, and raising standards. That is why I again  call on my  [[Page S6343]]  colleagues to support and pass the Protect and Serve Act, a bill that I  sponsored and a bill that I hope we can get passed.    The Protect and Serve Act would punish dangerous criminals who murder  a law enforcement officer in the line of duty. If they murder a law  enforcement officer in the line of duty, they will be sentenced to  life. If they injure a law enforcement officer in the line of duty,  they will be sentenced to 10 years in prison. The premise of the  legislation is simple: There is no escape from justice for dangerous  criminals who intentionally assault or kill a law enforcement officer.   The Senate passes legislation almost every day in this Chamber by  unanimous consent, but I am sad to report that if I try to get  unanimous consent for this bill, we would have objection on the floor.   The heated rhetoric and the violent attacks on officers are having  real-world impacts, and the safety of law enforcement has never been at  the low that it is today. Across the country, recruitments are down.  Fewer people are applying to go into service or into law enforcement  academies, and retirements are up. We are seeing our law enforcement  ranks dwindle. It is sad, but it is not surprising.   Law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single  day. Every morning, they wake up, they kiss their spouse goodbye, and  they don't know if they are going to come back safely. But when they  spend all day being disrespected while doing this very difficult and  very dangerous job and politicians harass them or allow them to be  harassed, I should say, by violent mobs and protesters, there is no  wonder morale is at an alltime low.   Fewer police means more criminal activity. It means hard-working  American citizens who go to work every day just to make their lives  better are living in communities that are less safe. We cannot sit idly  by and allow the streets to be filled with dangerous, violent criminals  who face no consequences. Instead, we must speak up and show our men  and women in blue that we respect them and we back them.   They put their lives on the line to protect us, and we should do the  work in Congress to protect them. In fact, in the last Congress,  Speaker Pelosi allowed this bill to be voted on. She supported making  it a law. But now her conference is run by radical leftists who want to  abolish the police or defund the police, and she is not even allowing  this bill to be brought to the floor. She won't speak in support of law  enforcement officers despite the rising tide of violence against them.  That is why the responsibility lies here in the Senate for us to show  our support and let law enforcement communities across the country know  that we have their back.   Let's protect police and deputies, and let's pass the Protect and  Serve Act. I urge the American people to call your Senators and tell  them that you want this bill passed. You want law enforcement to be  safer, and you want our communities to be safer. Don't be silent. Help  me fight for the men and women in blue. They are counting on all of us.                            ____________________
