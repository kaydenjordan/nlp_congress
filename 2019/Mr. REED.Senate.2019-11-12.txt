 Madam President, I was unavoidably absent for the  vote this evening due to a delayed flight. Had I been present, I would  have voted no on cloture on the nomination of Executive Calendar No.  87, Chad F. Wolf to be Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans,  Department of Homeland Security.                            ____________________
