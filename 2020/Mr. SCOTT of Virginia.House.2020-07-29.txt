 Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of  the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would remind the distinguished ranking member that we  did have a hearing in February and, actually, a briefing in May that  the minority party decided not to participate in.   And insofar as the Speaker, she was here. If I had opened, she would  have had to listen to me and to you and would have been here waiting  all that time. The Speaker is busy, so I called on the Speaker so she  could speak and return to her busy schedule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs.  McBath), a distinguished member of the Committee on Education and  Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Civil Rights and Human Resources.    Mr. Speaker, could you advise me how much time  is remaining on both sides?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Schrier).  [[Page H3905]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to gentlewoman  from Illinois (Ms. Underwood), a distinguished member of the Committee  on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes), a distinguished member of  the Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from  Connecticut an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Stevens), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Cisneros).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds  to the gentlewoman from Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time  remains on both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend, Congresswoman Rosa  DeLauro, for her work in support of children, families, and childcare  providers.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Child Care Is Essential Act.   Access to affordable childcare is critical to working families in  helping our economy recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.   Without childcare, parents cannot return to work, businesses cannot  reopen, and young children cannot access invaluable early learning  opportunities.   At this moment, the childcare industry stands at the brink of  collapse. Childcare providers already struggled financially before the  pandemic. Now, dramatically low revenue and increased operating costs  are pushing providers towards permanent closures.   In fact, the COVID-19 pandemic has already cost the jobs of roughly  one in four childcare workers, and researchers estimate that we could  permanently lose up to 4.5 million childcare slots. The pandemic has  already impacted the lives of parents, 13 percent of whom have had to  lower their work hours or quit their jobs entirely due to difficulties  in childcare.   Our constituents are calling us to take action. A recent survey found  that more than 8 in 10 voters across the political spectrums favor a  substantial Federal investment in childcare. We must save the childcare  system, which is critical for working families, our economy, and the  healthy development of our Nation's children. We can do that by voting  in favor of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to pass this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
