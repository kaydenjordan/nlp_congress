 Mr. Speaker, every day, courageous men and women in  America's law enforcement leave the safety of their homes to go into  volatile situations, not knowing whether or not they will even return  home safely. These brave police officers and first responders have  dedicated their lives to ensuring our safety, as well as the safety of  our neighborhoods and communities. I honor these fearless men and women  and recognize the sacrifice they and their families make.   But merely saying thank you is not enough. The Thin Blue Line Act  will protect law enforcement officials by giving harsher penalties to  criminals targeting the police and first responders who put their lives  on the line daily to protect and defend us.   It is my duty and privilege to support efforts that give our  dedicated law enforcement officials the best possible chance of coming  home safely every day. Mr. Speaker, this is how I can show my  gratitude. Each House Member should join me in supporting this bill.
