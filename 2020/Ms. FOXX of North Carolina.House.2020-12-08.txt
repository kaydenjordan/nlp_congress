 Mr. Speaker, American innovation is in  the express lane, and we have President Trump and both the private and  public sectors to thank.   The progress that has been made to date on viable vaccine candidates  is astonishing, and it is a promising sign for the American people.   It is truly a testament to the grit and resilience that resides  within this country, and we have come a long way since the beginning of  this year.   We are on the cusp of eradicating COVID-19 once and for all, and the  livelihoods of the American people will be restored.   Mr. Speaker, never bet against American innovation. It has the power  to change the world.                        Personal Battle With COVID-19     Mr. Speaker, recently, my family faced a  test that was unlike any we had faced before: fighting COVID-19.   My husband contracted the virus and spent 4 days in Watauga Medical  Center, where he received excellent care from doctors and nurses. I  tested positive, was totally asymptomatic, but, of course, was  quarantined and understand the frustration associated with that.  Thankfully, though, I was able to continue my work without  interruption, unlike so many others.   We have always been grateful for those in healthcare, treating others  at their own risk, but we understand the situation they are facing  better than ever.   We are even more grateful for the men and women fighting on the front  lines to protect the American people. They do so not out of self- interest but rather through a solemn commitment to protect the sanctity  of human life.   We will be forever grateful for their countless sacrifices and will  continue to pray for their safety and for God's grace to continue.   To those impeccable men and women serving, from the bottom of my  heart, thank you.                            ____________________
