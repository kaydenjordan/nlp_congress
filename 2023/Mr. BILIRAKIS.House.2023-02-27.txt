 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 538) to require the disclosure of a camera or recording  capability in certain internet-connected devices.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 538         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Informing Consumers about       Smart Devices Act''.       SEC. 2. REQUIRED DISCLOSURE OF A CAMERA OR RECORDING                     CAPABILITY IN CERTAIN INTERNET-CONNECTED                     DEVICES.         Each manufacturer of a covered device shall disclose       whether the covered device manufactured by the manufacturer       contains a camera or microphone as a component of the covered       device.       SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.         (a) Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices.--A violation of       section 2 shall be treated as a violation of a rule defining       an unfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed under       section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15       U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)).        (b) Actions by the Commission.--        (1) In general.--The Federal Trade Commission shall enforce       this Act in the same manner, by the same means, and with the       same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though all       applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade       Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) were incorporated into       and made a part of this Act.        (2) Penalties and privileges.--Any person who violates this       Act or a regulation promulgated under this Act shall be       subject to the penalties and entitled to the privileges and       immunities provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act (15       U.S.C. 41 et seq.).        (c) Commission Guidance.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Commission, through       outreach to relevant private entities, shall issue guidance       to assist manufacturers in complying with the requirements of       this Act, including guidance about best practices for making       the disclosure required by section 2 as clear and conspicuous       as practicable.        (d) Tailored Guidance.--A manufacturer of a covered device       may petition the Commission, in a manner consistent with the       rules of the Commission, for tailored guidance as to how to       meet the requirements of section 2.        (e) Limitation on Commission Guidance.--No guidance issued       by the Commission with respect to this Act shall confer any       rights on any person, State, or locality, nor shall operate       to bind the Commission or any person to the approach       recommended in such guidance. In any enforcement action       brought pursuant to this Act, the Commission shall allege a       specific violation of a provision of this Act. The Commission       may not base an enforcement action on, or execute a consent       order based on, practices that are alleged to be inconsistent       with any such guidelines, unless the Commission determines       such practices expressly violate section 2.       SEC. 4. DEFINITION OF COVERED DEVICE.         As used in this Act, the term ``covered device''--        (1) means a consumer product, as defined by section 3(a) of       the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2052(a)) that is       capable of connecting to the internet, a component of which       is a camera or microphone; and        (2) does not include--        (A) a telephone (including a mobile phone), a laptop,       tablet, or any device that a consumer would reasonably expect       to have a microphone or camera;        (B) any device that is specifically marketed as a camera,       telecommunications device, or microphone; or        (C) any device or apparatus described in sections 255, 716,       and 718, and subsections (aa) and (bb) of section 303 of the       Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 255; 617; 619; and       303(aa) and (bb)), and any regulations promulgated       thereunder.       SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.         This Act shall apply to all covered devices manufactured       after the date that is 180 days after the date on which       guidance is issued by the Commission under section 3(c), and       shall not apply to covered devices manufactured or sold       before such date, or otherwise introduced into interstate       commerce before such date.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 538, the Informing Consumers  about Smart Devices Act.   This is a relatively straightforward bill. It requires the  manufacturers of covered devices to clearly disclose if a device  contains a camera or microphone.   Internet connected devices are becoming increasingly present in our  lives, and it is important for people to understand what they are  buying.   This legislation would allow the FTC to go after bad actors and  provide compliance guidance to manufacturers of covered devices.   Not being recorded or monitored without permission is a basic tenet  of privacy that we all have come to expect. Again, we have to get  notification.   Given Senate Commerce Committee leadership has followed suit with a  companion bill, I am hopeful this whets the appetite for bipartisan,  bicameral action on comprehensive privacy protections for all  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Curtis), a great member of the Energy and Commerce Committee  and the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, this is a commonsense bill, a  necessary bill. It impacts our constituents. They need full disclosure.  That is not too much to ask for.   Again, I urge my colleagues to unanimously support this for the  second year in a row. Let's get it across the finish line, get it to  the President's desk as soon as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsors of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1059) to authorize notaries public to perform, and to  establish minimum standards for, electronic notarizations and remote  notarizations that occur in or affect interstate commerce, to require  any Federal court to recognize notarizations performed by a notarial  officer of any State, to require any State to recognize notarizations  performed by a notarial officer of any other State when the  notarization was performed under or relates to a public Act, record, or  judicial proceeding of the notarial officer's State or when the  notarization occurs in or affects interstate commerce, and for other  purposes.

(a) In General.--A State law may modify, limit, or       supersede the provisions of section 3, or subsection (a) or       (b) of section 4, with respect to State law only if that       State law--        (1) either--        (A) constitutes an enactment or adoption of the Revised       Uniform Law on Notarial Acts, as approved and recommended for       enactment in all the States by the National Conference of       Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 2018 or the Revised       Uniform Law on Notarial Acts, as approved and recommended for       enactment in all the States by the National Conference of       Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 2021, except that a       modification to such Law enacted or adopted by a State shall       be preempted to the extent such modification--        (i) is inconsistent with a provision of section 3 or       subsection (a) or (b) of section 4, as applicable; or        (ii) would not be permitted under subparagraph (B); or        (B) specifies additional or alternative procedures or       requirements for the performance of notarizations with       respect to electronic records or for remotely located       individuals, if those additional or alternative procedures or       requirements--        (i) are consistent with section 3 and subsections (a) and       (b) of section 4; and        (ii) do not accord greater legal effect to the       implementation or application of a specific technology or       technical specification for performing those notarizations;       and        (2) requires the retention of an audio and visual recording       of the performance of a notarization for a remotely located       individual for a period of not less than 5 years after the       recording is created.        (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in section 5 or 6 may be       construed to preclude the recognition of a notarization under       applicable State law, regardless of whether such State law is       consistent with section 5 or 6.

(b) Special Commissions or Authorizations Created by a       State; Sanction for Breach or Official Misconduct.--A notary       public may not perform a notarization under section 3 or 4       if--        (1)(A) the notary public's State has enacted a law that       creates or designates a class or type of commission or       appointment, or requires an endorsement or other       authorization to be received by a notary public, as a       condition on the authority to perform notarizations with       respect to electronic records or for remotely located       individuals; and        (B) the commission or appointment of the notary public is       not of the class or type or the notary public has not       received the endorsement or other authorization; or        (2) the notarial regulatory official of the notary public's       State has prohibited the notary public from performing the       notarization as a sanction for a breach of duty or standard       of care or for official misconduct.       SEC. 11. SEVERABILITY.         If any provision of this Act or the application of such       provision to any person or circumstance is held to be invalid       or unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act and the       application of the provisions thereof to other persons or       circumstances shall not be affected by that holding.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill, H.R. 1059. The SECURE  Notarization Act would provide a national standard for notarizing  documents when the signing parties are not physically present.   The process of remote notarization improves the security of  notarizations through the use of multifactor verification of  identification, audiovisual recording of the event, and tamper- detection technology.   Mr. Speaker, it is actually safer. I did a lot of this work in my  other life when I was in the private sector.   By recording the notarization as it happens, remote notarizations can  provide law enforcement with evidence if a fraud is determined to have  occurred.   This is much more secure, as I said before, than a traditional paper- only notarization where once the transaction has occurred, there is  very little evidence left behind.   Preventing fraud and abuse is critical to a well-functioning legal  system. And let's face it, it is more practical.   This legislation passed the House last Congress, and I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation once again.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong), the vice chairman of the full Committee  on Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, this is commonsense legislation.   I have some experience in this area, as does Mr. Armstrong and Ms.  Dean, as well. It is efficient and safe for the public, and we need a  national standard.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this particular bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
