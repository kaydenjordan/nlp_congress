 Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the ranking member on the Health  Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2  minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), ranking member of a  subcommittee on Energy and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), who has fought for life so  long.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today praying that this House will be defenders  of truth, humility, and justice.   I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 3755. The abortion on  demand until birth act is extreme. Abortion for any reason, at any  stage of pregnancy, until birth, is not the will of the American  people.   I spoke with a pediatric cardiologist just this week who shared with  me what is possible today. It is just amazing, because of technology,  what is possible.   We all know that we can look into the womb and see the development of  the baby day by day, week by week. This cardiologist told me that,  today, doctors perform prenatal surgeries and treatments to save lives.  He said doctors can perform surgeries on 20 different organs. That  wasn't possible in 1973 when Roe v. Wade was decided. In fact, the  first successful fetal surgery wasn't until 1982, many decades later.   Look how far we have come. Science has evolved. It is my hope that we  will learn from this and come to reject abortion because it is  inhumane; it is not following the science; and it doesn't reflect the  latest research or modern medicine.   Abortion is the sharpest soul-searching question before us as a  Nation. This question pierces every heart. People have strongly held  beliefs and stories, and both sides are guilty of dismissing one  another.   For those of us who stand for life, we must do a better job of  listening and loving. Fear and despair are only leading to more  arguments, anger, discord, and insecurity.   For me, personally, I have never had an abortion, but I gave thoughts  in my younger years as to what I would do if I found myself pregnant  and alone. It would have been a desperate situation. I can imagine  abortion seeming like an easy solution. It breaks my heart, though, to  think that anyone would consider abortion as their only option or the  best option.   Growing up, I was not much of a baby person. I was 35 and single when  I was elected to Congress, and I didn't even know if being a mom was  part of my future. Today, I can testify that bringing a new life into  the world is the most amazing thing ever. It is the best part of life.   We have two daughters and a son, Cole, Grace, and Brynn. Cole, now  14, was born with the most common chromosomal abnormality. It is called  Down syndrome. When he was born, the doctors gave us a long list of  challenges and chances for heartache.   I understand the uncertainty. I understand the fear. But I couldn't  imagine my life without Cole. His life is worth living.   Yet, in this debate, Down syndrome has been at the forefront. Just  yesterday, a woman named Heidi with Down syndrome lost her court  challenge against the British Government over its law allowing abortion  up until birth for babies with Down syndrome.   This cannot become America's future, where we cherish life, liberty,  and the pursuit of happiness for all.   Like in the U.K., the bill before us is discriminatory. It allows for  abortions based on a baby's sex, race, or disability.   It would override counseling requirements that protect women from  coercion from people who have abused them. It would prohibit laws  designed to protect against sex trafficking and the exploitation of  young girls and women. It would weaken protections for medical  professionals who have religious objections to abortion.   Despite what the majority says, this bill does not codify Roe v.  Wade. This is radical.                                time  0945    Under this bill, viability is whatever the abortionist deems it to  be.   I urge all of my colleagues today to stop the abortion on demand  until birth act.   Open your minds to science, technology. Look and see the mysteries of  the mother's womb. Open your ears to the cries of the unborn.   May hearts break and may we celebrate life. Let's uphold the value,  the dignity, and the potential of every life.

Madam Speaker,       Open up, O heavens, and pour out your righteousness. Let the             Earth open wide so salvation and righteousness can             sprout up together.      I, the Lord, created them.      What sorrow awaits those who argue with their creator.      Does a clay pot argue with its maker?      Does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it, saying,             Stop, you're doing it wrong?      Does the pot exclaim, How clumsy can you be?      How terrible it would be if the newborn baby said to its             father, Why was I born?      Or if it said to its mother, Why did you make me this way?    It is the word of the Lord.

Madam Speaker, I urge all of my  colleagues to stop this bill. Open your minds to science and  technology. Look and see the mysteries of the mother's womb. Open your  ears to the cries of the unborn. May hearts break, and may we celebrate  life--life in the United States of America--life for the living and the  unborn.   Vote ``no.''   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
