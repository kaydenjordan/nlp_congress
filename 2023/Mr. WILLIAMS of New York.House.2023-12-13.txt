 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Stefanik, my colleague from New  York, for introducing this much-needed legislation.   With issues as critical as mitigating anti-Semitism and protecting  our Jewish community, it is vital that we speak today with moral  clarity.   Just days ago, in a hearing in the House Education and the Workforce  Committee, we heard shocking testimony from the presidents of what were  once our most esteemed educational institutions.   Each one of these institutions has more than 100 years of history  educating our youth.   One, Harvard University, is closing in on 400 years of history.   These schools have an embarrassment of riches: Billions of dollars in  annual revenue, much of it from Federal funds, billions more in  endowments--no, tens of billions of dollars in endowments--they have  the resources to reach any educational goal.   When pressed on the solution to the problem of anti-Semitism, each of  them testified that education was, in fact, the solution. Education is  supposed to be the solution to anti-Semitism.   Yet, with all of that history, with all of those resources, with the  esteem of our society and the world, these universities are ground zero  for rampant, virulent, obscene, and inhuman anti-Semitism.                                time  1545    The hearings last week exposed not only the lack of moral leadership  at these schools; it also exposed a sickness in the culture of our  elite universities.   If calling for the murder and genocide of fellow students for the  crime of being Jewish is not immediately and completely repugnant, then  there is no moral compass at the heart of these institutions.
