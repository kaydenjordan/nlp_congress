 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R.  5804.   Human trafficking is modern-day slavery. It is one of the most  heinous crimes imaginable. It deprives its victims of their inalienable  rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   While DHS and the Department of Justice are the lead Federal agencies  in the fight against trafficking, State and local law enforcement  frequently encounter victims and their traffickers. Individuals and  employees of certain industries, such as medical professionals,  educators, and airline employees, among others, are also more likely to  encounter victims and need to know how to identify and respond to them.  This is where the Blue Campaign has come in to fill an important gap.   ``Blue Campaign is a national public awareness campaign, designed to  educate the public, law enforcement, and other industry partners to  recognize the indicators of human trafficking, and how to appropriately  respond to possible cases.''   In the 10 years since it began, the Blue Campaign has helped raise  awareness of trafficking. Materials developed by the Blue Campaign have  helped individuals outside law enforcement recognize the signs of  trafficking and helped those at risk of being trafficked. It has  fostered communication and partnerships between industry, law  enforcement, and nongovernmental organizations.   My bill, H.R. 5804, the DHS Blue Campaign Enhancement Act, amends the  Homeland Security Act to expand the reach of the Blue Campaign through  the use of online educational videos and the creation of a Blue  Campaign Advisory Committee within DHS to provide support and guidance  for future development, training, and outreach.   It expands on the great work of the Blue Campaign and the fight  against human trafficking. It is another step toward ending the cruel  and inhumane exploitation by traffickers and rescuing those caught in  its grasp.   I appreciate my colleagues' support of this bill.                                time  1400
