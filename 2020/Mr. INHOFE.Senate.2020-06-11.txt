 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and congratulate  Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Bergeson, of the U.S. Air Force, and the deputy  commander of United States Central Command, MacDill Air Force Base,  Tampa, FL. Lieutenant General Bergeson is one our Nation's finest  military officers, and he will retire from Active military service on  September 1, 2020, bringing to a close 35 years of distinguished  service to our great Nation.   In 1985, Lieutenant General Bergeson commissioned as a second  lieutenant upon graduation from the U.S. Air Force Academy. He  commanded units at every echelon from fighter squadron to a numbered  Air Force. Lieutenant General Bergeson also held various staff  assignments, including positions as chief of aviation, strategic  operations, Multi-National Forces-Iraq; senior defense official and  defense attache in the UK; and director, Legislative Liaison, Office of  the Secretary of the Air Force, at the Pentagon.   Prior to his current assignment, he served as the deputy commander,  United Nations Command Korea; deputy commander, U.S. Forces Korea;  commander, Air Component Command, South Korea/U.S. Combined Forces  Command; and commander, 7th Air Force, Pacific Air Forces at Osan Air  Base. Over the course of his career, Lieutenant General Bergeson flew  numerous fighter aircraft to include the F-15, the F-22, and the A-10.  He is a graduate of the NATO Defense College in Rome and the Harvard  Kennedy School of Government.   At a time of great uncertainty in the world, particularly in the  Middle East, Lieutenant General Bergeson served as a critical leader in  Central Command, a combatant command that has an enormous influence and  presence in some of the most volatile parts of the globe. Lieutenant  General Bergeson is an exceptional leader and an American patriot who  is committed to our Armed Forces, our national security, and our  Nation. It is for Lt. Gen. Tom Bergeson that we, with profound  admiration and deep respect, pay tribute to for all he has done for the  defense of our Nation for over three decades as a leader and selfless  servant.   Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to recognize Lieutenant  General Bergeson's long and decorated career. On behalf of a grateful  nation, I commend Lieutenant General Bergeson for his dedicated service  to the United States of America. I also wish to recognize the  sacrifices and contributions made by his wife, Pam, and his children,  Erik and Kristin. I extend my best wishes to Lieutenant General  Bergeson and his family and wish them the best in retirement and the  years to come.                            ____________________
