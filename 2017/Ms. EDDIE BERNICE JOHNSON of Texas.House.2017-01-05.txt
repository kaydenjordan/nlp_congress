 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition  of the GOP agenda which will repeal the Affordable Care Act and cause  30 million Americans to lose healthcare coverage.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the Republicans to please examine the harm that  this will do. Because of the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate in  Texas has fallen by 28 percent and still has the largest number of  uninsured Americans, allowing 1.7 million Texans to gain coverage.   While Texas did not expand Medicaid, the State still benefits from  many other reforms brought by the Affordable Care Act. For instance,  Sean, a Ph.D. candidate in economic development at the University of  Texas at Dallas and his wife, Jamie, relied on the Affordable Care Act  when their son was born prematurely and with a heart defect that  required surgery and a transfer to another Dallas hospital. Sean was  reassured that, with his family's ACA marketplace plan, his newborn son  would not be denied coverage for lifesaving treatment.   It is unconscionable to me that the GOP refuses to look at what works  and what needs improvement in this law instead of a full repeal as the  only option. This will deeply harm American families.                            ____________________
