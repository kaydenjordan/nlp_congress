 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   This is an unfortunate moment for the U.S. Senate. We came together  on a bipartisan basis just a very short time ago to pass the CARES Act.  It passed here 96 to nothing. That followed two other bipartisan  efforts that came out of the House, passed the Senate, and were signed  by the President, again, with overwhelming support.   Yet, today, we see from the majority leader a complete political  stunt here on the floor of the U.S. Senate--something that does not  have bipartisan support, something that is go it alone, take it or  leave it, and totally violates the spirit all of us have been working  on during this crisis where we were able to come together in the U.S.  Senate and the House of Representatives with the White House to, on  three prior occasions, pass legislation in a way that addressed the  issues that are important to this country.   Yet, today, we have this situation where the majority leader knew  full well there was not agreement and consensus on moving forward with  this proposal. That is why we are here today. This was, in fact,  designed to fail, designed as a political stunt. It is actually not the  first time we have seen this. You may recall that, just before we came  together and passed the CARES Act 96-0, the majority leader came to the  floor of the Senate back then and tried to ram through an unfinished  product while negotiations were going on between Secretary Mnuchin and  Democrats in the House and the Senate to try to finalize the bill, and  that actually caused unnecessary delay. But the majority leader came to  the floor then and tried to ram it through. It didn't work then, and it  is not going to work today.   I would ask the majority leader--and I think all of us would--to go  back to trying to address these issues the way we addressed them in a  successful manner before. I am going to shortly propose an amendment  that addresses some of those concerns--an amendment to the majority  leader's proposal.   I would like to address some of the issues first, and my colleague,  Senator Cardin, has addressed many with respect to small businesses.  First of all, he pointed out that the one program to help small  businesses that has actually really run out of money is the emergency  loan and grant program.   Let's talk about the PPP program. This is a really important program  to incentivize small businesses and nonprofits to keep employees on the  payroll and allow them to help keep the lights on, pay fixed costs, pay  the mortgage, pay the rent, whatever it may be, so that they can emerge  on the other side of this storm without having had to fold. Many of us  anticipated long before the CARES Act passed that this program would  need more money. I was part of a group that proposed $600 billion for a  program like this, recognizing the demand would be huge, as it is on  other programs. It is not just in need of more money. It needs some  important fixes, which I daresay would have bipartisan support as well.   I don't know if the majority leader saw the letter just this morning  from the National Restaurant Association. Here is what they say:         The PPP is funded at $349 billion, and we expect that       lenders will reach that ceiling shortly. We appreciate the       bipartisan calls this week to provide prompt additional       funding for the program.    Then they go on to say:         However, equally important is the need to address the       limitations of the program that do not recognize the unique       and evolving challenges of the restaurant business cycle and       our path to recovery.    This is not a Republican group or a Democratic group. This is a group  that represents small businesses, restaurants, just trying to get by,  and what they say to us this morning is: Yes, we do need additional  money. We know that. But equally important, let's fix some of the  kinks, and there are kinks in this program.   I got a letter at 12:44 a.m. this morning from a small business owner  who had been banking with Wells Fargo. Then, of course, Wells Fargo hit  the cap. We thought we had dealt with that in recent days. But he is  not sure he is still going to be able to get that loan through Wells  Fargo, and he says:         I've also now looked at more than 100 websites of 7(a)       lenders in the greater DC area and have found that NONE--      capital letters NONE--will accept a PPP application from any       small business that did not bank with them before February       15, 2020.    Here are some other headlines in recent days:   ``Baltimore-area small businesses complain of continuing problems  gaining access to federal lending program.''   `` `Nightmare': 3 small-business owners describe process of applying  for PPP coronavirus loans.''   The Journal Record: ``Community bankers frustrated with PPP  rollout.''   Another headline, this one from another part of the country: ``PPP  loan plan a mess so far for small businesses riding out coronavirus  crisis.''   ``Billions `disbursed' through Paycheck Protection Program? Small  businesses say not yet.''   The Wall Street Journal: ``Big Banks Favor Certain Customers in $350  Billion Small-Business Loan Program.''   Another article: ``Many small businesses are being shut out of the  new loan program by major banks.''   Mr. President, what we are saying here today is, yes, we know we need  more money for this program. Many of us predicted this before we passed  the CARES Act. But for goodness' sakes, let's take the opportunity to  make some bipartisan fixes to allow this program to work better for the  very people it is designed to help: small businesses, nonprofits.   That is what they are asking us to do. That is what the restaurant  association is asking us to do. That is what  [[Page S2170]]  they want us to do, and we could do it probably just as quickly if the  majority leader took a moment to sit down with us and negotiate that  piece.   There are also other major demands on the system right now that we  should address at this moment, and one of them is something I know we  are all hearing about every day, which is to protect the healthcare  workers on the frontlines. After all, if we want to address the  economic crisis, we need to address the health crisis that precipitated  that. We need to flatten this virus out, bring it down, and that is the  best way to get on the road to economic recovery.   I am sure all of my colleagues are hearing from their nurses and  doctors and frontline healthcare workers about the urgent need for  personal protective equipment. We provided funds in the original bill,  but we know, today, that that will be exhausted quickly. We know it  because we can add up the requests coming from around the country. So  let's address that issue. We are hearing about it every day.   Just yesterday at our delegation, our region, Senator Cardin and I  and other members of the Maryland delegation, we wrote to FEMA just  yesterday, to the Administrator of FEMA. We pointed out that in our  most recent requests, Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia  received just a small percentage of the equipment that we requested  from FEMA. The District received no hospital ventilators. I would point  out for all of us who are following this, it is predicted that this-- Maryland, DC, and Virginia--is going to be one of the next hotspots.  Zero ventilators, zero safety goggles--we asked for 663,000 gloves, and  over 1 million respirators masks. We got 4,000 of one. That is one  problem we need to address on an urgent basis, just as urgently as we  need to address the small business situation.   Testing--my goodness, look, this virus, we all know, got an 8 to 10- week head start on us because we were flat-footed when it came to  testing. We need a national rapid testing system so that we can ensure  that people will get the tests and find out whether they have the  virus. That not only helps us fight the virus, but it will also help us  as we try to get the country back to work on the other end of this. I  would propose those are real needs as well and that we can address  those here now.   In addition to that, as Senator Cardin said, we just spoke to  Maryland's Governor yesterday who, in addition to being Maryland's  Governor, is the head of the National Governors Association. He and  Governor Cuomo have worked very closely together. We have a bipartisan  request from the National Governors Association to help States and  local jurisdictions. We have been on the phone nonstop with our local  officials. They are running out of equipment. We have got firefighters  who need help. We have emergency responders who need help.   All of these requests are urgent and, I believe, could be dealt with  on a bipartisan basis, if the majority leader would just take a moment,  instead of trying to rush this through, and we could actually get it  done, as we were able to do before with the 96-to-nothing vote.   So, at this time, Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I  know people are anxious to get out of here. We didn't have to come in  at all, if it hadn't been for the decision to try to ram this through.  I just want to make that point. To the majority leader, we knew this  wasn't going to get through. I see people are frustrated and want to  leave, but let's get it done, and let's get it done right, and let's  have another 96-to-nothing vote here in the U.S. Senate.   So I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader modify the  request and ask that the amendment at the desk, which is the text of  the interim emergency COVID-19 Relief Act, be agreed to; the bill, as  amended, be read a third time and passed with no further intervening  action or debate.
