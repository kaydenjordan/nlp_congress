 Madam Speaker, it is sobering to know that American  exceptionalism is only a few degrees away from extinction. It should  never be that way.   One of the greatest threats we face as a Nation is the creation of a  welfare state and, subsequently, the mentality that is bred by one.   It seems that many have forgotten the simple principle that Americans  have always abided by: Here, we work to earn our keep. Over the course  of the last 9 months, that principle has become lost.   It is evident that America is no longer slouching toward socialism;  we are standing on its doorstep. We are much better than this as a  country.   The welfare-without-work expansions that are being proposed by the  majority are dangerous. One of those expansions is the child tax credit  that bears no work requirements for recipients.   Twenty-five years ago, Republicans and Democrats came together to  reform America's welfare system. It was a bipartisan effort through and  through. But if you fast-forward to today, the majority has ignored the  spirit of that agreement in favor of their own distorted agenda.   Simply put, the majority has turned the child tax credit into a cash- for-kids handout. Remember, the recipients of this handout are not  required to work to receive it.   Just last week, President Biden admitted during a CNN townhall that  he opposes a work requirement. Keep in mind that members of the  President's own party, such as Senator Manchin, are advocating for a  work requirement.   The University of Chicago recently published a study showing how  expanding the child tax credit disincentivizes work. In fact, it would  lead to an exodus of 1.5 million workers from the workforce. America  simply can't afford that.   When you consider the loss of 1.5 million workers and the abysmal  jobs reports that have come out this year, it is clear that something  is wrong. The labor force participation rate plummeted last month to  61.6 percent. The last time the labor force participation rate was 61.6  percent was in April of 1976.   There are roughly 3 months left in 2021, and at this pace America is  on track to fall right off the cliff and onto the rocks below. That is  the cost of government dependency. That is the cost of providing a  steady stream of other taxpayer checks that pay more to sit at home  than to work.   Pitting Main Street businesses against government-led benefits won't  build the economy back. It won't get Americans back to work, and it  certainly won't steer our great country to brighter and better days.   American exceptionalism is not built by welfare or sitting at home  collecting a check. It is built by everyday people who show up at work  and get the job done. If that fundamental principle is lost, then  America will be lost as well.   There is no denying that America is standing on socialism's doorstep.  Look at the state our country is in because of the majority's failed  policies and what could come down the line.   Government dependency robs this great country and its citizens of  unparalleled opportunity. The majority has steered us in that  direction, and the American people should be downright fearful.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the Federal Government needs to stop  sticking its noses in places it does not belong.   For the past 9 months, the size and scope of the Federal Government  have expanded like a balloon being inflated with helium. Look no  further than a provision in the Democrats' budget reconciliation  package that allows the IRS to monitor the bank accounts of every  American. If you made a deposit or withdrawal of more than $600  cumulatively, the IRS would be the first to know. That is $28 a day.   Madam Speaker, the American people are fearful of more government  control, and I share their fear. America should never find itself  standing at socialism's door, and this dangerous provision puts us one  step closer to doing so.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2119, the Family  Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act.   A survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC,  estimated that one-third of all men and women are victims of domestic  violence at some point in their life. In 2018, approximately 40 percent  of female homicides in North Carolina were related to intimate partner  violence. The 2020 statistics aren't any better.                                time  1230    COVID-19 and President Biden's failed economic policies have dealt  our Nation government-mandated restrictions and economic challenges. It  appears those negative outcomes have snowballed to exacerbate an even  worse fallout.   Evidence suggests that in this pandemic environment, stress due to  work, school, substance abuse, and financial struggles have added to  more violence in the home. Especially hard-hit appear to be rural areas  where job opportunities can be hard to find. Recent statistics show  that domestic violence-related homicides have increased in my home  State of North Carolina.   Domestic violence in any form is an evil that demands a strong  response. That is why, in 1984, Congress enacted the Family Violence  Prevention and Services Act, FVPSA, which authorizes programs to  support victims of domestic violence and their dependents. These  programs include grants to support domestic violence shelters and  services and a national domestic violence hotline.   Additionally, FVPSA funds the CDC's DELTA program, which provides  funding to State domestic violence coalitions to develop, test, and  coordinate local prevention and education programs. Since FVPSA's  enactment, Congress has worked in a bipartisan manner to reauthorize  the bill. Sadly, Democrats are now using it as a vehicle to push left- wing priorities. This is disappointing.   Committee Republicans wanted to support a bipartisan bill. I strongly  believe that FVPSA's history of bipartisanship must be continued.  However, the Democrat bill before us puts special interest groups ahead  of victims of domestic violence.   H.R. 2119 paves the way for taxpayer-supported abortions. Forcing the  public to pay for abortions is morally repugnant and should not be  allowed to  [[Page H5896]]  stand in this bill or any bill. Previous reauthorizations of the law  included a prohibition preventing reimbursement for healthcare  services, but this bill drops that prohibition.   The bill also tramples the rights of faith-based providers by forcing  organizations to abandon their sincerely held religious beliefs or give  up helping victims through these programs, meaning that fewer victims  will be able to access vital services and care. Faith-based providers  who offer critical care to survivors of domestic violence should not be  obstructed from operating.   Additionally, this bill lacks commonsense accountability that is  needed after years of Congress ignoring this program. We need to know  what is going on with the program and the Republican substitute would  ensure we have that information.   FVPSA is not an instrument for partisan policies, or it should not  be, especially those that threaten religious liberties. That is why  Republicans offered an amendment that includes a carefully focused set  of reforms that act in the best interest of victims of family violence  and the people who serve them. Specifically, it improves current law,  ensuring that funds are focused on life-saving supportive services.  Democrats opposed it in committee, and I am guessing they will oppose  it on the floor.   Republicans recognize the importance of supporting survivors of  domestic violence. We must understand that dealing with this issue is  best done at the local level and government cannot always provide the  answers. Local civic groups and faith-based providers are best  positioned to provide aid and deliver it effectively.   Congress should support best practices and protect the providers  closest to the victims seeking help. Pushing faith-based providers out  of this important work--as the Democrat-led bill could do--does nothing  to help continue the delivery of locally-driven support services for  victims of domestic violence.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 2119,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Miller).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Bost), who is the ranking member of the Armed Services  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, currently the Secretary of HHS has unimpeded authority  to create resource centers under FVPSA that are meant to provide  victims of domestic violence with help. Unfortunately, the number of  resource centers has grown in recent years without the public's  knowledge. A brief look at the websites of these organizations reveals  that a number of these centers are using taxpayer money to promote a  progressive ideology on gender and sexuality instead of simply  supporting victims of domestic violence. Taxpayers deserve to know the  mission and purpose of these resource centers and whether they are  effective.   The Republican substitute requires the Secretary to provide notice to  Congress before creating additional resource centers. Additionally, it  requires the Government Accountability Office to issue a report on the  effectiveness of these resource centers and provide recommendations for  improvements on how they can do a better job delivering services to  victims.   Madam Speaker, money is scarce and getting scarcer, and we need to  know that taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, victims of domestic violence should not lose important  faith-based assistance simply because bureaucrats in Washington don't  share the same beliefs. Our freedom of religion is the number one  freedom outlined in the Bill of Rights, and yet our friends often on  the other side of the aisle seem to forget that and want to trample on  that right. Faith-based providers have helped victims of domestic  violence for years, and they should not be forced to abandon their  mission because progressives want to use taxpayer resources to promote  a progressive ideology on gender and sexuality.   As we learned from our witness at a hearing on this program,  sometimes victims need to hear from faith leaders to feel really safe  and able to get help. We should not jeopardize that lifeline.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the Democrats' bill strikes a current law provision  that requires certain grant recipients to provide a non-Federal match  for the taxpayer dollars they receive under FVPSA.   Madam Speaker, I agree with my colleagues who have indicated that  funding for domestic violence is not a Federal responsibility. It is a  State and local responsibility. The 10th Amendment of the Constitution  said if their responsibilities were not outlined in the Constitution  for the Federal Government to do, then those responsibilities were left  to the States and to the people themselves.   However, I am a realist. The Federal Government stepped into this  space, in a bipartisan manner, many, many years ago. So, taxpayers  paying taxes at the Federal level have been supporting these programs  for a long time. However, it is appropriate that there be a local match  for this to show that local people have an interest in these programs  and believe they should be supported.   Furthermore, Democrats are refusing to acknowledge that we are nearly  $30 trillion in debt and going up in debt quickly, going down the tubes  quickly. Their radical taxing and spending spree is intended to create  the largest Federal Government expansion since the New Deal. Frankly,  many of them brag about this, which is unbelievable to me.   But Republicans are committed to ensuring taxpayer dollars are used  efficiently and effectively. That is why the Republican substitute  amendment and my amendment ensure the important non-Federal match  provision under FVPSA remains in place. We need some local skin in the  game.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5901]]         Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, this bill contains a number of provisions that are  well-known poison pills for Republicans. Democrats can't claim this is  a bipartisan bill when it takes far-left positions on multiple social  issues that are unrelated to FVPSA's purposes.   This bill was rejected on a party-line basis at a committee markup.  Democrats ignored the long history of bipartisan reauthorizations and  included poison pills and not moving forward.   The Senate was able to leave politics at the door, and there is no  reason for the House not to do the same.   Madam Speaker, the majority of Americans oppose using their hard- earned money to pay for abortions. A Marist Poll conducted earlier this  year showed that as many as 58 percent oppose using tax dollars to fund  abortions.   We have repeatedly seen Democrats attack the lifesaving Hyde  amendment. This, along with the removal of a longstanding prohibition  on using FVPSA funding to reimburse for healthcare services, would risk  forcing taxpayers to fund abortions under this program.   FVPSA dollars are meant to offer hope and healing to victims of  domestic violence, not bring harm to innocent lives.   Madam Speaker, victims of domestic violence deserve access to the  expertise and resources necessary to aid them in their time of crisis,  free from political interference. The Democrats' partisan proposal  could harm the unborn and obstruct high-quality providers from offering  services to domestic violence victims.   As I said before, FVPSA should not be an instrument for partisan  policies, especially those that threaten religious liberties.   Committee Republicans want to continue FVPSA's history of  bipartisanship, yet Democrats have upended the previously bipartisan  balance between prevention services and support for victims and  children at the behest of special interest groups. This is shameful.   I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 2119, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, while many of the amendments offered today by my  Democrat colleagues do not make the bill any worse, they fail to  correct the significant flaws of the underlying bill.   Several amendments offered by Republican Members would have improved  the bill, but Democrats blocked those amendments from being debated.   Two of those I would like to highlight quickly are: An amendment  offered by Congresswoman Mary Miller to ensure FVPSA dollars cannot be  used for abortion services or abortion referrals and an amendment  offered by Congresswoman Spartz to ensure taxpayers know the mission  and purpose of the resource centers authorized under FVPSA.   These amendments are needed to address concerning changes the  Democrats make that open the door for taxpayer funding of abortion  under FVPSA and also double down on attempts to advance a radical  gender ideology through FVPSA's resource centers.   The Democrats missed an opportunity to change course, work in a  bipartisan fashion, and send the Senate a bill we know could become  law. But they have decided to pursue partisan policy over protecting  victims.   Thankfully, this bill is not heading to the President's desk, and I  look forward to working on making further needed improvements so  victims can access the help they need from those they trust.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, again, these amendments do not make any further harm  to the programs, but they also do not cure the flaws in the bill before  us today. I do not oppose this en bloc but urge my colleagues to oppose  the underlying bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the Family Violence Prevention and Services  Improvement Act provides critical services to victims of domestic  violence, and faith-based organizations are some of the leading  providers of these services.   Unfortunately, the Democrats' bill would change that by adding  extreme provisions that stray from FVPSA's important purposes and could  limit participation of the important faith-based providers.   The substitute amendment offered by Congresswoman Letlow ensures that  faith-based providers don't have to choose between their beliefs or  continuing to deliver the vital service and care that help protect  victims.   Congresswoman Letlow's amendment also brings much-needed  accountability to FVPSA. The law currently authorizes the Secretary to  create domestic violence resource centers, but these resource centers  have been used to push a radical gender ideology rather than help  victims of domestic violence.   That is why the substitute amendment requires the Secretary to  provide notice to Congress before creating additional resource centers.  Further, it requires the Government Accountability Office to issue a  report on the effectiveness of these resource centers and provide  recommendations for improvements on how they can do a better job  delivering services to victims.   It has been too long since Congress has exercised effective oversight  of this program, and it is time to change that. Beginning with the  provisions in Congresswoman Letlow's amendment, this law will finally  have some real accountability metrics.                                time  1330    The Democrats' bill also strikes a current law provision that  requires certain grant recipients to obtain funding from sources  outside the Federal Government, so Federal taxpayers are not on the  hook for providing all of the funding.   While Republicans are committed to ensuring taxpayer dollars are used  efficiently and effectively, Democrats refuse to acknowledge that we  are nearly $30 trillion in debt. Their radical taxing-and-spending  spree is intended to create the largest Federal Government expansion  since the New Deal, and this bill is the latest attempt by the  Democrats to create further reliance on government, pushing out  private-sector involvement in these critical programs. That is why the  amendment I offered ensures the important non-Federal match provision  under FVPSA remains in place.   I urge my colleagues to support these amendments, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Louisiana (Ms. Letlow).    Madam Speaker, it is critical that we reauthorize FVPSA in  a bipartisan manner, free from partisan poison pills. The Democrats'  bill fails to do that, but the Republican amendments would set aside  politics, ensuring FVPSA continues to offer help to victims of domestic  violence.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
