 Madam President, I rise today on behalf of this Nation's  farmers and ranchers. I would urge this body to continue in the  bipartisan way that they have been on the farm bill to get this farm  bill passed, keep in good shape the strong farm bill at this moment in  time, and work to improve it and get it out of the body so that farmers  can have the certainty they need with a predictable farm bill.   I believe I am the only actively engaged working farmer in this body.  I have lived on the farm I live on for over 61 years. My wife and I  have been farming the land that my grandfather and grandmother  homesteaded, and my folks farmed after them, for the last 41 years.  During that time, I have been able to see good farm bills that have  worked, and I have seen bad farm bills--the kinds of farm bills that  have resulted in devastating consequences for our family farms, driving  families off the land, paving the way for more consolidation; bad farm  bills that have dried up our rural areas and our small towns and along  the way dried up our rural way of life.   This is an important time for folks in production and agriculture.  The commodity prices are low pretty much across the board. We are  seeing this administration engaging in tariffs and a potential trade  war that is threatening Montana's No. 1 industry--agriculture--and  threatening the viability of the economy of Montana and rural America.  That is why it is critically important that this week we pass a good  farm bill that will work and give certainty to Montana's producers and  rural communities across this country.    In my travels around the State of Montana, I have had a number of  listening sessions on the farm bill. I have heard from farmers and  ranchers. I have visited with them, looked at them eyeball to eyeball,  and heard their concerns and their priorities. During these farm bill  listening sessions in Montana, I heard from grain growers, cattlemen,  sugar beet producers, hops growers, wool growers, pulse growers,  specialty crop producers, and organic farmers. We grow a lot of stuff  in Montana. I even sat down with the folks who fight the good fight to  make sure our kids don't go hungry. I sat down with fifth-generation  Montana farmers and ranchers whose families have worked the land for  over 100 years and young producers who are getting ready to go out for  their very first harvest.   For the most part, they all said the same thing; that is, they want  certainty. They want access to quality crop insurance that is a big  part of the safety net for our farmers and ranchers. In times when they  can't get their paycheck from the marketplace, this safety net is  critically important. They also want to be in a position financially  where they can hand their farm--or their ranch or their operation--down  to their kids and their  [[Page S4480]]  grandkids, but don't just take my word for it.   Since my last farm bill listening session, literally hundreds of  Montana's farmers and ranchers have written in to my office to make  sure their voice is heard on the farm bill.   Tom, from Glasgow, MT, wrote to me about the challenges facing  farmers and ranchers. He said:         I urge you to support the Farm Bill before it expires on       September 30. The legislation that came out of the Senate       Agriculture Committee has a robust farm safety net, including       a strong Crop Insurance Program. Our farmers face a       challenging agriculture economy. They need the certainty of       knowing what programs are available as they make their plans       for the coming years.    That is critically important. Everybody who is in agriculture knows  that you have to plan multiple years out before you can get to a point  where you can harvest that crop and bring it to the bin and bring it to  market. So having that kind of certainty of a long-term farm bill and  getting one done long before September 30 is critically important.   Another fellow by the name of Frank, from Lewistown, MT, wrote me  about the important role the farm bill plays in feeding this country-- the United States. Here is what Frank said:         The farm bill can help put the United States on track to       ending food insecurity and hunger in our country. I urge you       to work on a bipartisan farm bill that protects and       strengthens domestic nutrition programs, especially SNAP.    We have a democracy in this country, and we are very proud of it, but  as we offer that safety net for our folks in production agriculture, we  need to make sure we don't have hunger in this country, to the best of  our ability, because democracies don't work well when you have a hungry  society.   So I am on the Senate floor to tell Tom and Frank and the hundreds of  other Montana farmers and ranchers who have contacted me that their  voices have been heard and that their priorities are reflected in this  Senate farm bill.   This bill reauthorizes critical crop insurance initiatives that keep  farmers in business. It rejects the House attempt to combine and cut  funding for successful conservation practices. It amends EQIP to allow  dollars to flow to producers that focus on research conservation and  drought resiliency. It strengthens our fight against foot-and-mouth- disease. It keeps in place important sugar provisions which have a  multidecade track record of success, especially in the sugar beet  country of Southeast and Eastern Montana. It reauthorizes funding for  agricultural research and, as we know, for every dollar invested in  agriculture research, we see major returns to our economy. It gives the  green light to industrial hemp growers. Industrial hemp is a crop that  can fit in most rotations around this country, and Montana is no  exception, and it reauthorizes funding for critical USDA rural  development grants, which help fund water and wastewater  infrastructure, and it helps build rural communities.   Although the House chose to make political hay out of the farm bill,  I commend the folks in the Senate because we got to work and, through  the Senate Ag Committee, we put together a bill that farmers and  ranchers can literally take to the bank. We did so while protecting the  provisions that feed hungry families and protect seniors.   Now is the time to get this bill across the finish line. Through the  amendment process this week, we have the opportunity to make this farm  bill an even better bill.   We have already attached a bipartisan amendment to this bill that  strengthens the safety net by ensuring that ARC-county payments  probably reflect yields. We are giving more authority to the State and  local FSA committees to identify ARC boundaries that reflect the  conditions and the crops being raised in that region.   I want to thank the Montana Grain Growers for their support of this  amendment, as well as the Montana Farmers Union for their input.   It is my hope that folks continue to check their politics at the door  and do what is right for Montana's family farms--the folks who are  making a living off the land--by passing a good farm bill this week.   Farmers and ranchers are always talking about the future. They are  always thinking about the future, whether it is the future of commodity  prices or market access or costs, yields, or, yes, the weather. They  are constantly thinking about the future of their operation--how they  can implement new practices that will make their operation more  financially viable to pass on to their children. So let's get the job  done this week and pass a good farm bill that gives our producers in  this Nation and my producers in Montana the kind of long-term certainty  they deserve and gives them the keys to building an even stronger  family farm unit.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
