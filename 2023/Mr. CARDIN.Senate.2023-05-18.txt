 Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Asian  American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.   Each May, we celebrate and remember the many contributions that Asian  Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders have made to our  history and continue to make today.   As a nation, we have made significant progress with respect to the  inclusion and representation of the AAPI community across the many  facets of our society, from actress Michelle Yeoh's barrier-breaking  accomplishment this year as the first Asian-American winner of the  Oscars' Best Actress award to Maryland's very own Lieutenant Governor  Aruna Miller, who was sworn in just a few months ago as Maryland's  first immigrant and first Asian American to be elected to statewide  office.   AAPI children are finally getting to grow up seeing faces that look  like theirs in film, music, sports, politics, and every other arena of  public life.   This progress didn't just happen overnight; it is the fruit of labor  of generations of AAPI activists and leaders, along with their allies.  A labor that, in some cases, cost them their lives.   I think of the Chinese laborers, for instance, who played a critical  role in building America's first transcontinental railroad, yet they  were met with discrimination and exclusion at every turn.   They faced hardship, hard working conditions, and were paid only half  as much as their White counterparts.   In June of 1867, 3,000 Chinese railworkers began a highly organized  strike, demanding equal wages and shorter hours. Though they were  initially unsuccessful in their demands,  [[Page S1722]]  the strike demonstrated that the Chinese workforce could not be taken  for granted. Over the next few months, the rail company began raising  railworker wages.   This is just one example of a historic legacy of the AAPI activism  against discrimination, whether perpetrated by the U.S. Government, as  with the internment of 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II,  or by individuals like the racially motivated murder of Vincent Chin in  1982, which ignited the modern Asian-American civil rights movement.  But there is still much progress we need to make.   Stereotypes like the ``model minority'' myth continue to perpetrate  the idea that the AAPI community is a monolithic, hard-working, and  successful racial bloc, which served as a model for how other minority  groups should ``pull themselves up by their bootstraps--if they just  try hard enough.'' Stereotypes erase the diversity within the group we  refer to as the AAPI, which has the highest income inequality across  ethnic groups of any race in America.   Today, AAPI women are still earning, on average, 85 cents for every  dollar earned by a White male. If you break that down into just Native  Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, the number drops even further to just  60 cents for every dollar.   The ``model minority'' myth attempts to pit AAPI people against Black  and Latino Americans by blaming these groups for their own struggles,  rather than acknowledging the role of discrimination in America's  socioeconomics and racial inequality.   In spite of all of this, there is a great historical legacy, rarely  taught in our classrooms, of Asian-Black and Asian-Latino solidarity.  Frederick Douglass, renowned abolitionist, writer, and Marylander, gave  a speech in 1867--the same year as the Chinese rail strike--opposing  restrictions on Chinese immigration in a time when xenophobia and  racism toward Chinese workers was rampant.   He said--and, remember, this was in 1867:         There is such a thing in the world as human rights. They       rest upon no conventional foundation, but are external,       universal, and indestructible. Among these is the right of       locomotion; the right of migration; the right which belongs       to no particular race, but belongs alike to all and to all       alike. It is the right you assert by staying here, and       your fathers asserted by coming here. It is this great       right that I assert for the Chinese and Japanese, and for       all other varieties of men equally with yourselves, now       and forever.        I know of no rights of race superior to the rights of       humanity, and when there is a supposed conflict between human       and national rights, it is safe to go to the side of       humanity.    Human rights has been a key focus of mine during my entire  congressional career. Imagine, Frederick Douglass, over 150 years ago,  proclaimed the very same rights that we are still fighting for today.  He was truly a man ahead of his time.   In the 1960s, 100 years after Douglass's speech, Filipino-American  Larry Itliong led the Delano Grape Strike alongside Mexican-American  labor icon Cesar Chavez. Their efforts led to raises, healthcare  benefits, and pesticide protections for the striking grape workers, who  were primarily of Filipino and Mexican descent. These examples show  that there is power in solidarity towards a common goal.   Even as we celebrate the historic accomplishments of these and many  more members of the AAPI community, we must also maintain a sense of  urgency about how we as members of Congress and as Americans are  meeting the needs of this community today.   Just a few months ago, many East and Southeast Asian communities who  were celebrating the Lunar New Year with their families suddenly had to  fear for their safety following the back-to-back mass shootings  targeting Asian elders in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay.   What should have been a time of celebration became a time of fear,  anguish, and grief, instead. And these shootings were just the most  recent in a string of violent crimes motivated by anti-Asian racism and  xenophobia, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.   In a study led in part by Janelle Wong, a University of Maryland  professor of Asian-American studies, 16 percent of Asian-American  adults and 14 percent of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults  reported experiencing a hate crime in 2021. These statistics are  appalling and unacceptable.   Over 500,000 Asian Americans and 11,000 Native Hawaiians and Pacific  Islanders join me in calling Maryland their home. They are a vital part  of our State's economy and our communities, and Maryland is better off  because of them. I particularly want to highlight the AAPI community in  Frederick County, MD. In the fiscal year 2023 Omnibus Appropriations  bill, I was proud to work with my colleague, Senator Van Hollen, to  secure a $375,000 earmark for the Asian American Center of Frederick.  The AACF provides vital services to lower-income, minority, and  immigrant groups in their community--services including health  insurance enrollment, interpreter and translation services, English as  a Second Language, citizenship classes, business development services,  and so much more.   Because of the funding, Senator Van Hollen and I were able to obtain,  the center will be able to increase programming for language- appropriate and culturally relevant early childhood education.   This is crucial in a county like Frederick, where 13.5 percent of the  residents speak a language other than English at home. Research shows  that high-quality early childhood education increases the children's  readiness for school and narrows the achievement gap by half. And I am  inspired every day by the AAPI-run organizations like the AACF who are  fighting for the futures of their children.   There is still work to be done. I am committed to the ongoing  movement for the AAPI equality and justice, in Congress and beyond. I  hope the Senate will use this Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and  Pacific Islander Heritage Month as an opportunity to recognize this  community's many accomplishments and to continue to work hand in hand  towards equality and justice for all Americans.      American Wetlands Month, World Migratory Bird Day, and Endangered                                Species Day    Mr. President, I rise to celebrate wetlands and the many species they  sustain. This past Saturday, May 13, was World Migratory Bird Day. This  year's theme is ``Water: Sustaining Bird Life.'' World Migratory Bird  Day is officially celebrated on the second Saturday of May in Canada  and the U.S. and the second Saturday of October in Mexico, Central and  South America, and the Caribbean as part of a global campaign to raise  awareness of migratory birds and the need to protect and conserve them.   Migratory birds rely on water and its associated habitats--lakes,  rivers, streams, ponds, swamps, marshes, and coastal wetlands--for  breeding, resting, and refueling during migration; and for wintering.  Yet increasing human demand for water, along with climate change,  pollution, and other factors are threatening these precious aquatic  ecosystems.   Global headlines are sounding alarms: 35 percent of the world's  wetlands, critical to migratory birds, have been lost in the last 50  years. May is American Wetlands Month. Observing it helps draw  attention to our wetlands. We cannot afford to lose them. Wetlands  provide some of nature's most valuable ecosystem ``services.'' They  serve as nurseries and habitat for wildlife, mitigate hurricane damage,  and sequester carbon.   Wetlands also remove excess nutrients, toxic substances, and sediment  from the water that flows through them, helping to improve downstream  water quality and the overall health of waters in our communities. They  are so effective at improving water quality, scientists refer to them  as the ``kidneys'' of a watershed. Wetlands can absorb excess rain or  river water, so they protect against flooding. We haven't idly stood by  as wetlands--and the services they provide--disappear. Instead we are  investing in programs to protect and restore them. It is imperative  that we strengthen the resilience of our natural infrastructure,  particularly in my State of Maryland, which has over 3,000 miles of  coastline. Last month, Vice President Harris announced that the  Department of Commerce has recommended $15.2 million for projects  across Maryland to make communities and the economy more resilient to  climate change.  [[Page S1723]]    Across Maryland, four projects will create jobs and boost economic  and environmental outcomes for coastal communities. The awards were  made under the Biden administration's Climate-Ready Coasts initiative  funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law--BIL--with additional  funds leveraged from the Inflation Reduction Act, IRA. These projects  are part of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's nearly $6  billion total investment under BIL and IRA. These investments will have  a ripple effect. The Middle Branch: Patapsco Delta Sustainable Fishery  and Ecosystem Resilience Project--``MBRI''--in Baltimore City, for  instance, will restore marsh habitat in an urban ecosystem. The MBRI is  part of a larger project called ``Reimagine Middle Branch,'' which is a  community-led initiative to reconnect South Baltimore residents to the  nearby Middle Branch River.   The NOAA investments will help, but wetland loss is challenges that  requires an interagency response. I am proud to have reintroduced the  Coastal Habitat Conservation Act with Senator Graham. Our bipartisan,  bicameral legislation would authorize the U.S. Fish and Wildlife--FWS-- Coastal Program. The Coastal Program was first established in the  Chesapeake Bay in 1985 to address wetlands degradation and the  resulting impacts to fish and wildlife. Since its inception, the  program has expanded to 2 dozen priority coastal areas in all coastal  States.   Today, the Coastal Program is a voluntary, partnership-based, habitat  conservation program focused in 24 priority coastal areas along the  Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes, and  in the Caribbean, including the Chesapeake Bay.   Within these areas, a national strategic plan guides FWS conservation  efforts, integrating Service priorities with the shared goals of  conservation partners and stakeholders. These goals often include  preserving biodiversity and preventing species loss.   On the third Friday in May--this Friday--we celebrate National  Endangered Species Day, which highlights the importance of protecting  species such as the threatened eastern black rail. This secretive marsh  bird is the smallest of its kind in North America and is part of  Maryland's unique identity that we risk losing to climate change. Over  the past 10-20 years, 75 percent of the eastern black rail population  has declined. Primary causes of declination include rising sea levels,  tidal flooding, and habitat loss and destruction.   This year is the 50th anniversary of the Endangered Species Act, ESA.  We should be strengthening implementation of the law, including on  critical habitat. For each threatened or endangered species, the  Services may designate ``critical habitat.'' Scientists have identified  these areas as crucial to the species' recovery and are the focus of  conservation efforts. This concept is particularly important as species  are forced to adapt.   Even our marshes themselves are on the move. The Global Change  Research Wetland located at the Smithsonian Environmental Research  Center in Edgewater, MD, is dedicated to unraveling the complex  ecological processes that confer stability on coastal marshes as they  respond to global environmental change. This 2,650-acre brackish marsh,  which contains 15 miles of protected shoreline along the Rhode and West  Rivers--two embayments of Chesapeake Bay--is home to several long-term  experiments designed to predict what the future holds for coastal  wetland ecosystems as they cope with accelerated sea level rise.   Trying to anticipate and prepare for a future shaped by climate  change is the reason I recently opposed S.J. Res. 23, a Congressional  Review Act--CRA--joint resolution disapproving the National Marine  Fisheries Service--NMFS--rule relating to ``Regulations for Listing  Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants and Designating Critical  Habitat.''   On June 24, 2022, the NMFS and the FWS issued a joint final rule to  rescind a Trump administration rule on designating critical habitat  under the ESA. The Trump rule included a restrictive definition of  ``habitat'' that limited where the Services could designate critical  habitat. Specifically, it barred designating critical habitat in areas  that are not currently suitable habitat, even if those areas could  become suitable in the future. Such a restriction would limit the  Services' ability to designate critical habitat based on the best  available science. For example, the Services would not be able to  designate critical habitat in areas where species are expected to shift  to as a result of natural disasters, in response to climate change, or  after environmental restoration.   I regret that the Senate passed S.J. Res. 23 by a vote of 51-49. I am  relieved that President Biden intends to veto the resolution, and I am  confident Democrats in the Senate will sustain the veto. I was  particularly disappointed in this attack on the Services' mission,  given the popularity and economic activity of wildlife refuges in my  State and across the Nation.   I am pleased the FWS proposes to create a new National Wildlife  Refuge to conserve currently unprotected, high-priority fish and  wildlife habitats across southern Maryland. In collaboration with  landowners, outdoor enthusiasts, conservation partners, and local  communities, the Service proposes to identify lands for protection as  part of the National Wildlife Refuge System in southern Maryland. These  lands would be incorporated into a new National Wildlife Refuge that  encompasses portions of Calvert, Charles, St. Mary's, Prince George's,  and Anne Arundel Counties.   A wide-ranging, collaborative effort over the past 15 years  demonstrated that currently unprotected habitats in these counties  support significant populations of fish and wildlife appropriate for  protection under the National Wildlife Refuge System, primarily  threatened and endangered species like the black rail, waterfowl, and  migratory birds of conservation concern. These species face habitat  loss from land use changes, climate change, competition from invasive  species, and other stressors. Collaborative land management is a  primary reason why Maryland has an excellent track record of recovering  species. We have demonstrated we can solve wildlife challenges on a  bipartisan basis. Knocking out the critical habitat rule--and any  future rule like--is not the answer.   The Delmarva fox squirrel was federally listed as an endangered  species in 1967, but thanks to conservation efforts, it was removed in  December 2015. Loss of habitat is believed to be the major reason for  the Delmarva fox squirrel's demise. By the early 1900s, it was  extirpated from all States except Maryland. In 1967, its range was  narrowed to only four Eastern Shore counties: Kent, Queen Anne's,  Talbot, and Dorchester--less than 10 percent of its former reach.   Efforts to restore the population began in 1945 when the Maryland  Department of Natural Resources purchased LeCompte Wildlife Management  Area in Dorchester County as a refuge for the Delmarva fox squirrel.  Through an active reintroduction program in the 1970s through the early  1990s, several additional populations of Delmarva fox squirrels were  established in Caroline, Kent, Somerset, Wicomico, and Worcester  Counties in Maryland and at a few locations in Delaware and Virginia.  Natural expansion of the population has also occurred on the Delmarva  peninsula. Today, the Delmarva fox squirrel exists in numerous small  pockets of suitable habitat.   Bald eagles have staged such a remarkable population rebound and  recovered to the point that they no longer need protection under the  ESA. The Chesapeake Bay region today is home to more than 3,000 mating  pairs, which represents the largest concentration of eagles in the  lower 48 States. They may actually be doing a little too well.  According to Chesapeake Bay Magazine, they seem to be running out of  room in the bay region. The typical number of chicks per nest has  declined since 1999 from two to one, as the male eagles in a breeding  pair are forced to stay home and protect their nest from ``floaters''  without a nest of their own; as a result, they bring less food back.  Not to worry, however; scientists don't see a problem with fewer young  eagles being produced in the bay's tidewater region, nor do they see a  need for human intervention as the eagles reach equilibrium.   The population is going to remain large because the bay can support  it. The bay is one of the most productive aquatic ecosystems in the  Nation, thanks in large part to its wetlands.  [[Page S1724]]  That is something I take pride in and call on my Senate colleagues and  all Americans to celebrate this month, American Wetlands Month.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that floor  privileges be granted to June Zhu of my staff during today's session of  the Senate.    Mr. President, last month was National Minority Health  Month. Senator Scott of South Carolina joined me in introducing a  Senate resolution commemorating National Minority Health Month. We  couldn't quite get it over the finish line before the end of April, but  I am pleased the Senate is poised to pass the resolution now.   National Minority Health Month has its origins in National Negro  Health Week, which Booker T. Washington established in 1915 to address  the poor health status of African Americans in the early 20th century.   The commemorative month is helpful because it improves the public's  awareness of the health challenges that disproportionately affect  racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. It helps us to  celebrate the progress we have made in addressing health disparities.  Most important, it is a measure to recommit ourselves to tackling the  longstanding health disparities that still exist.   Today, because of historical and contemporary injustices across our  society, including those in the healthcare system, communities of color  continue to face health disparities that result in poorer quality of  life and lower life expectancies when compared to their White  counterparts. For people of color who identify as lesbian, gay,  bisexual, or transgender--LGBT--these disparities are often  exacerbated.   Disparities in healthcare access, treatment, and outcomes are  significant for a variety of reasons. Most important, these disparities  limit the health of the Nation overall. The U.S. population today is  more racially and ethnically diverse than at any other time in our  history. According to the 2020 census, nearly 4 in 10 Americans  identify with a race or ethnic group other than White. In a nation as  diverse as ours and one that is meant to treat everyone equally, it is  immoral for certain populations to receive inadequate, inaccessible, or  poor medical care.   In addition to ethical considerations, health inequities result in  significant costs to our economy. According to a recent analysis,  racial disparities amount to approximately $93 billion in excess  medical care costs and $42 billion in lost productivity per year, as  well as additional economic losses due to premature deaths.   For the health of our families, communities, States and Nation, it is  critical that we work to advance policies that will move in the  direction of achieving health equity.   In recent years, we have faced a variety of serious public health  challenges that have clearly highlighted health disparities. Whether we  are discussing the COVID-19 pandemic, the outbreak of monkeypox last  summer, or the spread of respiratory illnesses like the flu and RSV  this past winter, these public health challenges have shown that we  must respond appropriately and in a timely fashion to ensure that  vulnerable communities receive the resources and care they need.   Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, public health data  has shown that people of color experienced a disproportionate share of  cases and deaths due to this disease. According to data from the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--CDC--released in December  2022, American Indian or Alaska Native adults are 2.5 times more likely  to be hospitalized and twice as likely to die from COVID-19 than White  individuals. Similarly, Black and Hispanic adults are more likely to be  hospitalized and more likely to die from COVID-19. Racial disparities  were also found in access to COVID-19 vaccination for the first few  months of vaccine deployment.   At the time, I fought for additional outreach and better data to  close the vaccination rate gap. Thanks in part to a strong focus on  these efforts, the gaps in COVID-19 vaccination rates finally narrowed  several months after vaccine deployment initially began, but they  should not have existed in the first place.   The COVID-19 pandemic also exacerbated our Nation's behavioral health  crisis as social isolation contributed to spikes in anxiety,  depression, substance abuse, domestic violence, and suicide. Adults and  children across all groups continue to experience increased behavioral  health issues, but the burden on minority populations is heaviest.  [[Page S1755]]    For American Indian and Alaska Native adults, the death rate from  suicide is about 20 percent higher than the White population. In 2019,  suicide was the leading and second leading cause of death for Native  Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders and African Americans aged 15 to 24,  respectively. High school-aged Asian American males were 30 percent  more likely to consider attempting suicide than White male students.  This is why I continue to work with my colleagues to improve access to  behavioral healthcare for everyone.   Prior to the pandemic, people of color and other underserved groups  faced longstanding disparities in health, and today, many of these  inequities continue to persist. Across a variety of health measures,  including infant mortality, pregnancy-related deaths, overall physical  and mental health status, and prevalence of chronic conditions,  minority groups continue to fare worse than white individuals. Life  expectancy is another area where racial and ethnic disparities are  clearly apparent. Today, life expectancy among Black people is nearly 6  years lower than White people, with the lowest expectancy among Black  men.   When we consider chronic diseases like diabetes, minority populations  also fare worse than White people. Diabetes rates for Black, Hispanic,  and American Indian and Alaska Native adults are all higher than the  rate for White adults. These disparities can often be exacerbated for  people of color who identify as LGBTQ, who are more likely to  experience certain health challenges like substance abuse, mental  health conditions, violence, and sexually transmitted infections at  increased rates. I could go on and on.   To address health inequities, we must tackle their underlying causes,  many of which are born out of inadequate access to care for minority  populations, high costs of healthcare, and other social, economic, and  environmental factors, which are known as ``social determinants of  health.'' Factors like one's income level, as well as access to  transportation, education, and housing play a key role in health and  well-being.   Accessible and affordable health coverage is key to addressing health  inequities. I am proud of the work we did to pass the Affordable Care  Act--ACA--which expanded health coverage to millions of Americans  across the country. I am also pleased that we built on the success of  the ACA through the American Rescue Plan to extend care to an  additional 5.8 million Americans, including 181,000 Marylanders. We  have unfinished business, however, as recent Census Bureau data show  that minority groups are still less likely to have health insurance  than their White counterparts.   I am proud of the work that the National Institutes of Health--NIH-- based in Maryland, and NIH's National Institute for Minority Health &  Health Disparities--NIMHD--are doing to advance the field of scientific  research into health disparities.   The evidence-based research that NIMHD invests in at institutions  throughout the country is expanding the scientific knowledge base and  informing practice and policy to reduce health disparities. Some recent  work of NIMHD has focused on the benefits of Medicaid expansion for  young adults; the prevention, treatment, and management of co-morbid  chronic diseases; and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy within communities of  color. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to build on this progress.   As we recognize April as National Minority Health Month, let us  rededicate ourselves to ensuring that all Americans have access to  affordable, high-quality healthcare and renew our pledge to do  everything possible to eliminate health disparities and achieve health  equity once and for all.
