 Mr. President, it has been nearly 8 weeks since  President Biden submitted his supplemental funding request and  identified four key national security priorities. For 8 weeks, Senate  Republicans have been working hard to produce legislation that takes  appropriate action on all four fronts: helping Ukraine defeat Putin in  Europe, helping Israel fight Iranian terror in the Middle East, helping  Asian partners deter Chinese aggression, and helping the men and women  of Border Patrol get the crisis at our southern border under control.   At the same time, we have had to spend several weeks now trying to  convince some of our Democratic colleagues not to tank the entire  effort just because they wish a Democratic President had not put border  security in his request.   A number of Senate Republicans have been working in good faith to  make sure that supplemental legislation makes substantive policy  changes at the border, instead of just throwing money at the problem.   Meanwhile, we have had to explain to Members of President Biden's own  party why the border security issue he included in his proposal was not  extraneous to America's national security.   So here we are. Some very important conversations are ongoing. And  here is the bottom line: The Senate cannot claim to address major  national security challenges without a solution to the one we are  facing on the southern border. We can't pretend to be serious about  threats facing America and our allies without fixing the broken system  that lets 10,000 illegal aliens cross our border in a single day.   I am serious. Senate Republicans are serious, and I hope our  colleagues are as well.
