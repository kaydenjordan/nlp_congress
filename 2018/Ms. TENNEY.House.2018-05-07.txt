 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jessie Patrick,  who currently resides in South Carolina but spent most of her very long  life in Oneida County, New York, in the 22nd District.   On May 12, Jessie will turn 100 years old. Jessie grew up in nearby  Yorkville with her sister, Bertha, and her two brothers, Matthew and  Edward, both of whom served in World War II. She then moved to  Whitesboro, New York, where she worked for General Electric, which was  once located in Utica, New York, for nearly 30 years.   Jessie became an active leader in the Whitesboro community, joining  the Whitesboro Fire Department's Women Auxiliary, St. Paul's Church,  and even owned a restaurant in nearby Marcy, New York, with her  husband.   Jessie has one daughter, Judy; two granddaughters; three great- grandchildren, with whom she loves to spend time. Her family loves to  travel and used to spend many weekends traveling to Boston to go deep- sea fishing. When Jessie isn't deep-sea fishing, she enjoys cooking,  cross-stitching, and gardening.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in wishing Jessie a wonderful, happy, and  healthy 100 years, and many, many more years to come.                            ____________________
