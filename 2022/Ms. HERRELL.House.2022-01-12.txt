 Mr. Speaker, today, it is my great honor to pay tribute  to my friend and colleague, Bob Wooley.   Bob Wooley and I served together in the New Mexico House of  Representatives, and he has a passion for the people. He served as  chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. He also  [[Page H48]]  served in the Army during the Vietnam war. His passion for helping our  veterans stems way beyond his service in the State; it stems throughout  the Nation.   Bob is a no-nonsense cowboy. He has got a zest for life and a zest  for serving God. He also has a zest for telling the truth, even if you  didn't want to hear it.   I am honored today to recognize Bob and his beautiful wife of 48  years, Janna. They have two children and five grandchildren.   Today, in New Mexico, we are celebrating Bob Wooley's 75th birthday.  On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I wish Bob Wooley a  happy 75th birthday.                            ____________________
