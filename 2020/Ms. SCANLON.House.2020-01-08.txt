 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 779 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 779         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 535) to require the Administrator of the       Environmental Protection Agency to designate per- and       polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous substances under the       Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and       Liability Act of 1980. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the       bill and amendments specified in this resolution and shall       not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy       and Commerce. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. In lieu       of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by       the Committee on Energy and Commerce now printed in the bill,       an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 116-45, modified by the       amendment printed in part A of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be considered as       adopted in the House and in the Committee of the Whole. The       bill, as amended, shall be considered as the original bill       for the purpose of further amendment under the five-minute       rule and shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. No       further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in order       except those printed in part B of the report of the Committee       on Rules. Each such further amendment may be offered only in       the order printed in the report, may be offered only by a       Member designated in the report, shall be considered as read,       shall be debatable for the time specified in the report       equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an       opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be       subject to a demand for division of the question in the House       or in the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against       such further amendments are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill, as amended, to the House with such       further amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a structured rule for House Resolution 779, providing for  consideration of H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act of 2019.   The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment by  Chairman Pallone, makes in order 22 amendments, and provides one motion  to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to start the new year and the new  congressional session with our first legislative action being a rule  for a comprehensive, bipartisan bill to address a threat to our  constituents, both across Pennsylvania and across the country.   Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly known as PFAS, have  been manufactured and used in the United States for over 60 years.  These chemicals are found in everyday products like food packaging  materials, cleaning products, nonstick cookware, stain- and water- resistant materials, firefighting foams, and more.   There are thousands of PFAS chemicals, but two of the most common and  most notorious are PFOA and PFOS, substances used to make Teflon and  Scotchgard, respectively.   PFAS are known as forever chemicals. They do not break down, and they  remain in the environment and other living organisms for decades. PFAS  chemicals are made of one of the strongest carbon bonds possible. As a  result, these substances are extremely persistent in the environment  and are able to be absorbed by humans and wildlife.   PFAS have long been linked with various forms of cancer, including  kidney, liver, and pancreatic cancers; weakened immune systems; low  birth weight; infertility; impaired childhood development; and other  diseases.   Not only are these substances resilient and harmful, but they are now  found in the blood of over 99 percent of Americans.   PFAS contaminate our environment in a variety of ways, particularly  through landfills and wastewater runoff sites. Once these chemicals are  introduced into an area, they leach into the soil and groundwater,  becoming immediate threats to surrounding life.   Analysis by the Environmental Working Group found that more than  1,500 drinking water systems in the United States may be contaminated  with PFAS, affecting up to 110 million Americans from drinking water  alone.   In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 17 sites have been identified as  containing PFAS contamination. Some of these sites are water utilities  and civilian airports, but additional sites like waste incinerators  were included as well. People living in close proximity to waste  incinerators already face a host of environmental risk factors from  polluted air and water. Additional contaminants from PFAS adds insult  to injury for these neglected and often economically distressed areas.   The Department of Defense has identified over 400 military sites  across the U.S. that use or were suspected of having used PFAS in  firefighting foam. Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, is home to two of  these former bases where firefighting foam leached into the groundwater  after years of use. These bases are no longer active, but the effects  from PFAS will be felt by residents for generations to come.   My friend and colleague, Congresswoman Madeleine Dean, a founding  member of the PFAS Task Force, helped secure a grant to study the  health effects of PFAS contamination in this area. I commend the work  that she is doing to protect her constituents and to ensure that they  have a water supply that they can rely on for generations to come.   The fact of the matter is that the Federal Government has known about  the dangers presented by PFAS for years. The chemical industry has  known for even longer and, unsurprisingly, has fought tooth and nail  against efforts to regulate their distribution and use.  [[Page H24]]    Despite this, the only action taken against PFAS was in 2006, when  the EPA instituted a voluntary phaseout of PFOA and PFOS instead of  instituting any stronger measures. Recently, the EPA has declined to  promulgate standards on PFAS despite acknowledging the dangers they  present to human and environmental health.   Just as foxes shouldn't guard the henhouse, chemical companies  shouldn't be trusted to regulate themselves. Research on the additional  thousands of PFAS outside of PFOS and PFOA can and should continue, but  thus far, all research has confirmed that PFAS are harmful.   We would not eat food that could potentially cause us harm without  understanding the full range of ramifications first. Why should we put  those risks on our children without first knowing how PFAS will affect  them?   H.R. 535 will provide protections to our communities in the immediate  term and ensure that there are enforceable standards in place for the  long term. This bill would require the EPA to use tools under existing  environmental statutes to require cleanup of sites contaminated with  PFOA and PFOS, set air emission limits, prohibit unsafe incineration of  PFAS, and limit the introduction of new PFAS chemicals into the market.   Further, the PFAS Action Act will limit human exposure to PFAS by  requiring a drinking water standard for PFAS that protects public  health, particularly regarding the health of vulnerable groups like  infants, children, and pregnant women.    Finally, the bill takes the necessary step of designating all PFAS as  hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation, and Liability Act.   I would like to recognize and thank my colleague, Congresswoman  Debbie Dingell, for her hard work and tireless efforts to keep  Americans safe from PFAS, as well as Congressman Fred Upton and the  other members of the Energy and Commerce Committee whose bills were  incorporated into H.R. 535.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the underlying bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a December 5, 2019,  New York Times article, entitled, ``Government Studying Widely Used  Chemicals Linked to Health Issues.''                  [From the New York Times, Dec. 5, 2019]     Government Studying Widely Used Chemicals Linked to Health Issues                              (By Eric Lipton)         Warminster, Pa.--Two decades after concern emerged about a       class of chemicals used in everything from Teflon pans to       firefighting foam, the federal government has started the       first in a series of detailed studies of the impact the       chemicals have had on human health.        The goal is to determine what role the chemicals, known       generally as PFAS, play in a long list of health conditions       including thyroid, kidney, liver, cardiovascular and       autoimmune diseases, among other ailments. The studies will       involve thousands of adults and children in eight communities       nationwide, and the findings will help determine just how       extensive of a cleanup is necessary at sites where       groundwater or drinking water supplies have been       contaminated.        This is hardly an academic matter in communities like       Warminster, a suburb of Philadelphia, where Hope Martindell       Grosse grew up just across the street from the now-defunct       Naval Air Warfare Center. The base is one of about 200       military installations around the country where groundwater       has been contaminated by the chemicals, including at least 24       where drinking water was affected.        Ms. Grosse and several members of her family have had a       series of health problems, including autoimmune disease,       cancer and other unusual conditions, such as a missing set of       adult teeth in both of her daughters.        Her childhood home was just 25 feet from the Navy base and       for decades she and her family consumed water from a well in       their front yard. Even after the house was connected to a       municipal water system, the water coming to the house was       still contaminated because the local supplier realized only       about three years ago that it was also using groundwater       contaminated by PFAS. The utility was then forced to buy       water from outside the area.        Earlier tests of about 200 area residents have already       confirmed high levels of PFAS in the bloodstream of people       who lived near the former Warminster base and a second nearby       military facility, Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base       Willow Grove.        ``My greatest concern is what this means for my children,''       Ms. Grosse said. ``I know my kids have this chemical in       them.''        But what remains unclear is how strong the association is       between PFAS exposure and various health ailments.        It is a question that federal scientists and researchers       hope to answer, at least in part, with this first multisite       health effects study. It will be conducted in New Hampshire,       Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, New Jersey, Massachusetts,       New York and California, in communities where drinking water       is known to have been contaminated.        In total about 8,000 adults and 2,500 children who lived in       areas where drinking water was known to have been       contaminated with PFAS will have blood and urine sampled and       medical histories checked. The initial round of $7 million in       grants to fund the work has already been distributed.  [[Page H26]]         The first study, in the Pease, N.H., area, is underway and       enrolling participants.        Delays in settling on and approving research protocol for       the work in the seven other locations mean that actual tests       on participants will most likely be put off until at least       the end of next year. But researchers at some of those sites       have started to collect historical information on drinking       water contamination.        In most of the locations, the study will not specifically       look for apparent correlations between exposure to PFAS and       cancer, because the sample size is not large enough to       produce statistically significant results, federal officials       said.        But in Pennsylvania, researchers will be gathering data on       hundreds of thousands of cancer cases in the area to see if       there appears to be a high incidence of certain cancers among       those exposed to the contaminated water, said Resa M. Jones,       a Temple University epidemiologist who will be overseeing       this work.        Public concern about the chemicals first emerged in the       late 1990s in communities including Parkersburg, W.Va., which       was home to a DuPont chemical manufacturing plant where one       form of PFAS was made, after a series of illnesses emerged       among area residents and even farm animals.        The discovery of this threat in West Virginia, and the       struggle to get DuPont to cover medical costs, are the       subject of a new movie, called ``Dark Waters.''        Medical studies completed around 2012 in Parkersburg       ultimately confirmed a ``probable link'' between the exposure       to PFAS chemicals and testicular cancer, kidney cancer and       thyroid disease, among other conditions. Animal studies have       also suggested links between exposure and health problems in       humans, federal authorities say.        Since then, certain versions of the chemical--there are       thousands of different formulas--have been removed from the       market, including two that were once widely used in nonstick       cooking pans and stain-resistant clothes. But there remain       concerns that some of the replacement chemicals may cause       some of the same illnesses.        The new research now getting underway--which was authorized       by Congress through the Defense Department after a bipartisan       push led by Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New       Hampshire--will focus on exposures that are occurring outside       any workplace, due to exposure to contaminated drinking       water.        ``This is an attempt to produce some important knowledge       that can be useful not only for a particular community but       more generally across the United States, in a large       population,'' he said.        The Environmental Protection Agency is separately also       moving toward establishing federal cleanup standards for       contaminated areas and also to decide on what the national       safety limit for PFAS-related chemicals in drinking water       should be, questions the agency has been considering for at       least a decade.        Robert A. Bilott, an Ohio lawyer who has spent two decades       pursing litigation against PFAS manufacturers including       DuPont, said the research was a welcome step toward       developing a better understanding of the health consequences       of PFAS. But he said he remained determined to push the       manufacturers to pay for an even larger study that would look       in a more comprehensive way for correlations between PFAS       exposure and cancer.        ``I am glad to see the federal government is stepping in       and recognizing more needs to be done,'' said Mr. Bilott,       whose story is the focus of the ``Dark Waters'' film and who       has also written a book on his two-decade legal fight on the       issue. ``But I don't want it to be a shield against more       comprehensive studies that need to be done.''     Mr. Speaker, what we are discussing is not an abstract  issue, as this article outlines. These forever chemicals are adversely  impacting real people right now, and they can be causing families to  confront health issues like autoimmune disease, cancer, even children  missing their set of adult teeth.   So not only do we need more research, we need strong action now, and  that is why the legislation we are considering here today is so  important.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.  Pingree).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the other gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the distinguished chairman of the Committee  on Ways and Means.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a January 8 letter  from over 20 environmental groups, including Earthjustice, the Center  for Environmental Health, the Sierra Club, and the Union of Concerned  Scientists, all in favor of this legislation.                                                   January 8, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steve Scalise,      Minority Whip,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Minority Leader       McCarthy, Minority Whip Scalise and Members of the U.S. House       of Representatives: On behalf of our millions of members and       supporters, the undersigned non-governmental organizations       write today to urge you to vote YES on H.R. 535, the PFAS       Action Act.        Toxic PFAS chemicals have now been confirmed in the water       of more than 1,400 communities, including nearly 300 military       installations, and studies have linked PFAS to serious health       problems, including cancer. H.R. 535 will build on the       progress made in the National Defense Authorization Act for       FY 2020 by restricting industrial releases of PFAS into our       air and water, setting a drinking water standard for PFOA and       PFOS in tap water, and by kick-starting the process of       cleaning up legacy PFAS contamination by designating PFOA and       PFOS as hazardous substances under the federal Superfund law.        The science is clear: PFAS have been linked to serious       health problems through decades of animal, worker, and human       studies. Unfortunately, EPA has failed to take steps to       restrict air and water releases, reduce PFAS in our tap       water, or clean up the nation's most contaminated sites. H.R.       535 will set clear deadlines requiring EPA to do just that.       Designating PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances, as       proposed by H.R. 535, will not ban PFAS--but will instead       ensure that the most contaminated sites are finally cleaned       up.        We urge you to vote YES on H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act.            Sincerely,          Christine Santillana, Earthjustice; Patrick MacRoy,             Environmental Health Strategy Center; Shaina Kasper,             Toxics Action Center Campaigns; Andrea Braswell, Center             for Environmental Health; Michael Green, Center for             Environmental Health; Laurene Allen, Merrimack Citizens             for Clean Water; Paul and Diane Cotter, Your Turnout             Gear and PFOA; Pamela Kay Miller, Alaska Community             Action on Toxics; Tara Thorntom, Endangered Species             Coalition; Dalal Aboulhosn, Sierra Club; Meghan Boian,             Southern Environmental Law Center; Stel Bailey, Fight             For Zero; Lynn Thorp, Clean Water Action; Colin O'Neil,             Environmental Working Group; John Rumpler, Environment             America; Pamitha Weerasinghe, Union of Concerned             Scientists; Loreen Hackett, #PfoaProjectNY; Sabina             Perez, Office of Senator Perez, 35th Guam Legislature;             Joanne Stanton, Buxmont Coalition for Safer Water;             Glenn Watkins, National Wildlife Federation; Hope             Grosse, Buxmont Coalition for Safer Water.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I reiterate again that this is, in fact, a bipartisan  bill.   Mr. Speaker, ensuring the health and safety of our constituents is  one of the chief responsibilities we have as Members of Congress. The  PFAS Action Act will keep Americans safe by stopping the flow of  harmful chemicals into our environment, our drinking water, and the  products we use every day.   The fight to protect our constituents is ongoing. Science has come a  long way in the last 60 years, and we must use those developments to  better inform and address the concerns of all Americans.   One of the lessons we must take from having this debate today is that  we are all better off by having a strong, responsive, and people- focused EPA. We need an EPA that doesn't treat the American populace  like crash-test dummies for the chemical industry to test their  products on. Asking for forgiveness instead of permission is not an  acceptable tactic when it comes to the health and well-being of our  constituents.   We need an EPA that enforces environmental protections, not one that  lets industry off the hook whenever it isn't in compliance. We need an  EPA that respects hard, indisputable science, not one that willfully  buries its head in the sand to avoid the inevitable.   That is what our constituents want from us, to know that they are not  being put at risk by the decisions we make.   I am proud that this bill will pass the House today. The PFAS Action  Act is a commitment to the American people that this majority will take  a long-overdue step to protect their health and safety.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 779         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, the amendment printed in section 3 shall be in       order as though printed as the last amendment in part B of       the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution if offered by Representative Shimkus of Illinois       or a designee. That amendment shall be debatable for 10       minutes equally divided and controlled by the proponent and       an opponent.        Sec. 3. The amendment referred to in section 2 is as       follows:        Strike section 2 and all that follows and insert the       following:       SEC. 2. NATIONAL PRIMARY DRINKING WATER REGULATIONS FOR PFAS.         Section 1412(b) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C.       300g-1(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(16) Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances.--        ``(A) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of       enactment of this paragraph, the Administrator shall, after       notice and opportunity for public comment, promulgate a       national primary drinking water regulation for perfluoroalkyl       and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which shall, at a minimum,       include standards for--        ``(i) perfluorooctanoic acid (commonly referred to as       `PFOA'); and ``(ii) perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (commonly       referred to as `PFOS').        ``(B) Alternative procedures.--``(i) In General.--Not later       than 1 year after the validation by the Administrator of an       equally effective quality control and testing procedure to       ensure compliance with the national primary drinking water       regulation promulgated under subparagraph (A) to measure the       levels described in clause (ii) or other methods to detect       and monitor perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances in       drinking water, the Administrator shall add the procedure or       method as an alternative to the quality control and testing       procedure described in such national primary drinking water       regulation by publishing the procedure or method in the       Federal Register in accordance with section 1401(1)(D).        ``(ii) Levels described.--The levels referred to in clause       (i) are--        ``(I) the level of a perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl       substance;        ''(II) the total levels of perfluoroalkyl and       polyfluoroalkyl substances; and        ``(III) the total levels of organic fluorine.
