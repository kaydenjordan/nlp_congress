 Mr. Speaker, for nearly a century, America has made a  sacred promise: People who work hard throughout their lives will  benefit from the fruits of their labor.   Last week, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law a  bipartisan budget agreement. It protects Social Security from harmful  Republican-proposed cuts.   That earned benefit brings peace of mind for millions of families,  senior citizens, disabled persons, and children who survive a parent's  premature death.   Social Security insurance is a compact of trust between generations  and  [[Page H2735]]  ensures the safe and secure retirement for tens of millions of  Americans during their golden years. It is an earned benefit.   Congress must continue to protect this pact for our citizenry. That  is why our recently introduced Social Security 2100 Act is one of the  most vital bills before this Congress. It will increase benefits to  current and new beneficiaries, protect retirees against inflation, and  repeal the windfall elimination provision.   America made a promise to workers and guaranteed workers their earned  benefits. Democrats are committed to making good on that promise for  Social Security for generations to come.                            ____________________
