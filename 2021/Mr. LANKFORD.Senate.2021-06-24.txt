 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I often come to this floor to be able  to speak about news of the day, disagreements that we have, ways that  we can solve a problem we have as a nation. Today, I come to tell a  story.   In 1774, an Englishman met Benjamin Franklin. They spent a lot of  time together in conversations, and Franklin convinced this young  sailor and writer and young friend to move to America, to move to his  hometown, to Philadelphia. A few months later, 1774, he did.   Franklin saw something in this young man that no one else saw. That  Englishman who loved freedom and who saw the glaring injustice of the  British Crown, 2 years later, on January 10, 1776, wrote a short  pamphlet that changed the course of history.   The man's name was Thomas Paine, and the short work that he wrote was  called ``Common Sense.'' It was the first publication that declared we  should call for independence for these 13 Colonies. It didn't include  his name because if it included his name, it would have been a certain  death warrant from the King, but it made the case for freedom for each  person, for an elected government rather than a monarchy, and the case  for religious liberty. In short, he made the case for the United States  of America.   He wrote these words:         The cause of America is, in great measure, the cause of all       mankind. Many circumstances have, and will arise, which are       not local, but universal, and through which the principles of       all lovers of mankind are affected, and in the event of       which, their affections are interesting.    He wrote about the rule of law and how that would be different than  living under a monarchy, and he challenged the young colonists to be  able to pursue more.   He wrote:         But where says some is the king of America? I'll tell you       Friend, he reigns above, and doth not make havoc of mankind       like the Royal Brute of Great Britain. Yet that we may not       appear to be defective even in earthly honors, let a day be       solemnly set apart for proclaiming the charter; let it be       brought forth placed on the divine law, the word of God; let       a crown be placed thereon, by which  [[Page S4753]]       the world may know, that so far we may approve of monarchy,       that in America the law is king. For as in absolute       governments the king is law, so in free countries the law       ought to be king.    He wrote:         As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensable duty of       [every] government, to protect all conscientious professors       thereof, and I know of no other business which government       hath to do therewith.        Suspicion is the companion of mean souls. . . .    He wrote and he said:         It affords us a larger field for our Christian kindness.       Were we all one way of thinking, our religious dispositions       would want matter for probation; and on this liberal       principle, I look to the various denominations among us, to       be like children of the same family, differing only, in what       is called, their Christian names.    He shared a lot of great ideals in ``Common Sense.'' He challenged  the colonists to dream of an America that would set the example for the  world.   Thomas Paine's ideas weren't all great, and we didn't accept all of  his ideas. In fact, he wrote a long section in ``Common Sense'' saying  that when we form our own Constitution, we should take these 13  Colonies and we should elect a President and alternate among each  State, so each State would, in turn, have a different President for the  whole group. It is a fairly terrible idea that we never implemented.  But this passion about the law being king, we did; this passion about  religious liberty, we did; this passion that America would be an  example to all mankind, we did.   One hundred fifty thousand copies of ``Common Sense'' were printed.  That is an enormous number for that time period. On that January day  when the first printings of ``Common Sense'' started being passed  around the Colonies, it fanned the flame of that spark of freedom in  the hearts of the colonists.   By June 11, 1776, Congress had appointed a committee of five to draft  the Declaration: John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of  Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, Robert Livingston of New  York, and Robert Sherman of Connecticut--by the way, I think two  redheads in that group.   The Declaration ended with this simple paragraph. We are familiar  with that Declaration. It said:         We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of       America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the       Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our       intentions, do, in the Name and by the Authority of the good       People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That       these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and       Independent States.    It ended with this:         And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm       reliance on the protection of the Divine Providence, we       mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and       our sacred Honor.    And they gave their all. John Hart, one of the signers of the  Declaration, from New Jersey, ended up hiding in the woods that  December of 1776, just a few months later, while the Hessian soldiers  hunted him across the countryside. He died before the war's end.   Richard Stockton, also of New Jersey, wasn't so lucky. He was dragged  from his bed, thrown into prison, and treated like a criminal. His home  was looted, his fortune stripped away.   Thomas Nelson of Virginia: He commanded the militia and served as a  Governor during the Revolution. He had to instruct the artillerymen to  fire at his own house when the British started using it as their  headquarters. Nelson had used his personal credit to raise money for  the cause. The Revolution left him in distress, and he was unable to  ever recover what he had lost.   Thomas Heyward, Arthur Middleton, and Edward Rutledge were three  South Carolina signers who served in their State's militia and were  captured when the British seized Charleston. They spent the rest of the  time in prison. They pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their  sacred honor.   By that December, when all of this was going on to all of these  signers of the Declaration, Thomas Paine wrote again, and this time, he  wrote directly to the patriots serving with George Washington. In the  freezing winter, on December 23, 1776, Thomas Paine wrote these words:         These are the times that try men's souls; the summer       soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink       from the service of [their] country; but he that stands it       now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny,       like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this       consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more       glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too       lightly: It is dearness only that gives every [living] thing       its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its       goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an       article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated.    It is a good thing for us to be able to stop and reflect on these  simple words: What we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly. Sometimes  I am afraid that, as we approach the Fourth of July each year, we will  have forgotten the sacrifices of previous generations. In our time  period and in this wealthy moment in our Nation's history, we seem to  esteem too lightly what was obtained too cheaply, and we forget the  great sacrifices of the past.   Generation after generation of American history has set an example of  how we have worked for a more perfect Union. Generation after  generation has served each other and the children who have come after  them so that they could have a better future. It is our generation's  turn. The generation that I speak of could have never dreamed of the  Capitol that stands on this hill. The generation that I speak of could  have never dreamed of the 50 States that would cover this continent,  but they did dream this, because it is in Thomas Paine's introduction:  ``The cause of America is in great measure the cause of all mankind.''   This Fourth of July, we should recommit ourselves to the cause of  freedom, the future of our Nation, and the service to our children and  the children not yet born. We are still a great nation, conceived in  liberty, born to greatness if we are willing to work and sacrifice and  give for each other. No generation in the history of the world has  inherited more than we have--no generation. We should not receive it  too cheaply or hold it too lightly.   Ironically, as I end my story of an Englishman who became a writer  and the inspiration of a nation, I must tell you the end. Thomas Paine  died a bitter and broken man. He remained a revolutionary in the fight.  He could never stop searching for the next revolution. He went off to  France to support the French Revolution and almost lost his head for  it. He ended up in prison there. He came back to America and determined  that George Washington wasn't as loyal as he was. He spent his last  years writing against President Washington: that he was the real  traitor and that he wasn't strong enough. He ended up dying alone,  isolated, rejecting his faith--and a bitter man.   My fellow Senators and fellow Americans, the war has been won.  Freedom, that gift, has been passed on to us. Let's protect it. Let's  cherish it. Let's pass it on.   Each generation should be passionate about passing that on to the  next generation. That is why, on this Fourth of July, it is not just a  day off; it is not just a day to be at the mall; it is not just a great  day to be at a lake--it is a great day to contemplate how you will  serve our Nation in the days ahead in this generation and how you can  pass on the freedom that we have to our children.   Our Nation still needs people who will build on the foundation of  liberty. We need writers and soldiers and farmers and moms and dads. We  still need people who will run for city council and the school board,  people who will pick up trash in the neighborhood, people who will  march in a protest and then intentionally go love people and work for  the reconciliation of broken relationships. We need people who will  start new businesses, give to nonprofits, get involved in their  churches, and love their neighbors as themselves.   We are free, but as the Bible says in 1 Peter 2, we should live as  free people but not use our freedom as a coverup for evil.   Those of us who have freedom should help others to live in the same  freedom we have and to serve with joy. That is the legacy that was  passed on to us. That is the legacy we should pass down.   I yield the floor.
