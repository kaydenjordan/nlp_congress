 Mr. President, I am so proud to be here with my  colleagues today--Senator Cortez Masto and all of our colleagues and  with our leaders Senator Cardin and Senator Murkowski--on this  bipartisan resolution that is, frankly, long overdue.   You know, there is a sign you often see at rallies for reproductive  rights. A woman my age or older will often be holding it, and it reads  something like this: ``I can't believe we are still fighting for this  crap.'' Now, it usually has a different word on it than ``crap.''   As I stand here on the Senate floor in the Year of Our Lord 2023, I  can't believe we are still fighting for equal  [[Page S1371]]  rights for women under our American Constitution. We are 100 years out  from when the Equal Rights Amendment was first introduced in 1923--a  full century, 100 years--since it was first introduced. And a lot of  things have changed since 1923, for sure. Women are CEOs and  astronauts, professional athletes and chemistry professors, Governors  and a Vice President of the United States. A quarter of the Members of  this Chamber are women--not nearly enough, but we are getting there.  Yet, still, 100 years later, women are not guaranteed equal legal  protections, equal legal rights under our Constitution. That needed to  change in 1923, and it certainly needs to change 100 years later in  2023.   Michigan was ready for change back in 1972. That is when my State  ratified the ERA. A Congresswoman from Michigan helped lead the way.  Congresswoman Martha Griffiths of Detroit was the first woman in  history to serve on the House Ways and Means Committee.   In 1970, she filed a discharge petition to send the legislation to  the full House of Representatives for consideration. It passed, only to  die in the Senate. We have heard that story before. But Representative  Griffiths was undaunted. She introduced an amended version. The House  and Senate both passed it, and it was sent to the States for  ratification in 1972.   Congresswoman Griffiths later served as Michigan's first elected  Lieutenant Governor and became known as the Mother of the ERA.  Congresswoman Griffiths, sadly, didn't live to see her amendment  written into the Constitution.   But there is no doubt we need it today, even more than we did in  1972. Women in this country are watching our reproductive freedoms be  dismantled. The Dobbs decision attempts to ban the abortion pill, and  harsh abortion restrictions in States have left women in this country  with fewer freedoms than our mothers and even our grandmothers enjoyed.   The ERA is really simple. It simply says:         Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or       abridged by the United States or by any state on account of       sex.    Equal rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the  United States or by any State on account of sex. That is it.   And this resolution is equally simple, the one before us. All it  would do is remove an arbitrary deadline that was included when this  was passed in Congress, preventing the ERA from being ratified.   The ERA is simple, but its protections would be profound. It would  protect all people, regardless of sex, from discrimination. It would  defend against the rollback of our fundamental rights and freedoms.   Congresswoman Martha Griffiths, from Michigan, passed it. The States  ratified it. Now we just need to add it to our Constitution. Our  daughters and our granddaughters can't wait another 100 years. They  deserve equality now.   So I hope colleagues would join with us to pass this resolution and  finally ensure all people are equal under our laws.   I yield the floor.
