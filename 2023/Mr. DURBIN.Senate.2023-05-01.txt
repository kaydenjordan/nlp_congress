 Madam President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Anthony Johnstone to a Montana seat on the Ninth Circuit Court of  Appeals. Mr. Johnstone is an accomplished appellate litigator,  academic, and public servant and was unanimously rated ``well  qualified'' by the ABA. He received degrees from Yale University and  the University of Chicago Law School before clerking for Judge Sidney  Thomas, whom he has been nominated to succeed.   Mr. Johnstone began his career in private practice as a commercial  litigator in New York before returning to Montana to pursue a career in  both public service and academia. From 2004 to 2011, Mr. Johnstone  served in the Montana Department of Justice. In recognition of his  legal acumen, he was appointed State solicitor--Montana's top appellate  lawyer--in 2008. In this role, he handled 29 cases on appeal, including  19 as sole or chief counsel of record.   Since 2007, Johnstone has also served as a professor at the  University of Montana Blewett School of Law. He teaches courses on  constitutional law, legislation, the regulatory process, and other  topics. In addition to teaching, he is also a prolific writer and has  authored pieces on federalism, the law of democracy, and issues of  importance to rural communities--including those located in the Ninth  Circuit's jurisdiction.   Mr. Johnstone has earned the trust of leaders throughout the Montana  legal community. With his experience in both legal practice and legal  theory, along with his unwavering commitment to the Constitution and  the rule  [[Page S1436]]  of law, Mr. Johnstone will be an exceptional judge on the Ninth  Circuit.   I strongly support his nomination and urge my colleagues to do the  same.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly), and the Senator from  West Virginia (Mr. Manchin) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, in the Jewish faith, there is a concept  known as Tikkun olam. It refers to our responsibility to heal the world  through good deeds and devotion to others. I want to tell you about a  man who devoted all 92 years of his life to healing our world. His name  was Lowell Sachnoff. He was a man who found joy in life, the law, and  the cause of equal justice for all. And he brought that joy to all of  us who were lucky to count him as a friend.   Lowell passed away last month, peacefully, in his home in Evanston,  IL. And saddened as I am by his loss, I am--above all--grateful that I  got to know him. Lowell was a model of kindness, curiosity, and  integrity. And in the words of his wife Fay, he was ``absolutely  fearless when it came to representing the downtrodden, ignored, and  abused.'' Our world is a better place because of his lifetime of  service.   Lowell's commitment to serving others began where he was born and  raised: on Maxwell Street in Chicago. He grew up in a community of  hard-working, Jewish immigrants during the Depression. And even from a  young age, Lowell had a hunger for healing our broken world. It is only  fitting--Lowell was raised by a family whose own world had been  shattered by hate and persecution. His parents and grandparents were  forced to flee their ancestral homeland of Ukraine because of pogroms  targeting Jews.   As a child, Lowell's grandparents would tell him stories about those  dark days in Ukraine, about the relatives and friends who were tortured  and murdered by the Russian regime, and the terrors of life in a  ``lawless society.'' It was these conversations around the Sachnoff  dinner table that inspired Lowell to become a lawyer--and to wield the  law as an instrument for justice.   As a student at Chicago's Senn High School, Lowell excelled in and  outside of the classroom. He was a star on the swim team--and was even  offered a full academic scholarship at Harvard and, later, Harvard Law.  But before beginning his legal career, Lowell decided to first serve  his country. He enlisted in the military and served as a lieutenant  commander and naval intelligence officer during the Korean war. It was  an experience that led to Lowell discovering one of his many lifelong  passions: the Russian language. At first, he learned Russian as part of  his intelligence responsibilities--but he stuck with it.   In fact, I remember a conversation we had about 10 years ago. Lowell  told me he was still practicing Russian--60 years later--through the  online education platform Coursera. It is just one example of his  boundless love for learning and discovery. And Lowell's curiosity--like  his commitment to equal justice--only grew as the years went on.   After serving in the military, Lowell brought his fight for justice  home. He graduated from Harvard Law, with honors, and soon emerged as a  legal legend and a civil rights icon. Lowell always understood that the  cause of civil rights and human rights never comes to a final verdict.  Those dedicated to freedom and fairness forge new contests and take on  new battles every day.   And for Lowell, the litany of causes began in the 1960s. In his  pursuit of justice, he took on cases that most lawyers would never  touch. One of them was a lawsuit against the Chicago Police officers  who murdered two members of the Black Panther Party while they slept.  One of the victims was Fred Hampton. It was the height of the civil  rights movement, and tensions were even higher. But true to his  fearless nature, Lowell took on the case--and won.   A few years later, Lowell scored another victory for justice. He won  a jury verdict regarding the routine, unlawful strip-searching of women  by Chicago Police. Years after that, he won another historic verdict  protecting the rights of women seeking reproductive healthcare. Time  and again, Lowell fought for equality in every form--racial, gender,  economic, you name it. He made no exceptions--because he was on a  mission to heal the world for everyone.   In 1981, Lowell's firm Sachnoff & Weaver represented a transgender  pilot  [[Page S1438]]  who had been fired because of her gender identity. Today, nearly 40  years later, our Nation still has a long way to go in protecting the  rights of transgender Americans. But with that case, Lowell helped  introduce a legal rationale for enshrining transgender rights into the  Civil Rights Act--which happened decades later.   During our many years of friendship, Lowell never once called me on  behalf of a paying client. Others would speak for them. The one time  Lowell did call me about a case, it involved a man who had no voice in  our system of justice. He was an accused terrorist who had been  imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay for 15 years with no formal charge and no  hope for a trial. Many considered the case a lost cause. Others  considered it too controversial to touch. But Lowell never gave up. He  believed that, even though the road to justice may be long, he had a  responsibility to reach the end of it. So he pushed onward, for years,  with a group of lawyers who shared his belief that Guantanamo was a  ``stain on our justice system.''   Lowell even traveled to Guantanamo Bay six times, when he was in his  80s, to meet with detainees. And eventually, he and his cocounsel  negotiated the release of four men who had been held captive for years.  Lowell poured his whole heart into the case, as he did with every case.  When he saw injustice, in any form, he couldn't help but think of his  family who fled Ukraine. And he couldn't help but act.   Really, there is a simple explanation for Lowell's long record of  legal victories: He not only had a big, generous heart--but a big,  sharp mind to match. In the words of the head of the Illinois ACLU,  Colleen Connell, Lowell was a ``lawyer's lawyer . . . you could only be  impressed [by] how he was able to conceptualize and bring a legal  argument to life.''   And Lowell shared his wisdom and love for the law with everyone who  worked with him. Perhaps his favorite part of leading Sachnoff & Weaver  was mentoring younger litigators. He would take them under his wing and  share whatever legal wisdom he could. These young lawyers became known  as Lowell's ``ducklings,'' a nickname that has stuck even to this day,  when said ducklings are now in their 60s and 70s.   It was while working at Sachnoff & Weaver that Lowell joined forces  with his most powerful ally in the fight for justice: his wife Fay  Clayton. They met while working as lawyers in the same department, and  things remained strictly professional for a few years. But soon enough,  the sparks flew. They fell in love and became quite the power couple,  working together to build a more equitable system of justice for  everyone.   Fay was captivated by the same qualities that so many of Lowell's  friends loved: his zeal for life, learning, and creative expression.  When they first started dating, Lowell would even surprise Fay with  poems he had written for her. And his gift for writing was another of  Lowell's passions that only grew as the years went on.   Lowell and Fay were true believers in the idea that, no matter how  busy life becomes, we should always find time to engage with our  lifelong passions and chase new adventures. And together, that is  exactly what they did--from scuba diving off the coast of Mexico, to  growing vegetables, baking challah, going to jazz and classical music  concerts, and swimming.   Of course, nothing made the two of them happier than sharing their  love for adventure with the children and grandchildren. As one example,  Lowell and Fay made a promise to each one of his grandkids: Pick any  place in the world you want to go, and we will take you. And they made  good on that promise, traveling to Australia, Kenya, Peru, Greece, and  Croatia. It was a true family world tour.   And in honor of Lowell's lifelong love for learning, his children  have paid a fitting, final tribute. They created a writing prize, named  in Lowell's honor, at his alma mater Senn High School. It is a gift  that will support a new generation of changemakers, so they can follow  Lowell's footsteps in the fight for justice.   I mentioned Lowell's love for poetry. One of his favorite poets was  William Butler Yeats. Yeats once observed, ``The world is full of magic  things, patiently waiting for our senses to grow sharper.'' Lowell  lived his life sharpening and fine-tuning his senses to discover the  world's magic things. He did it through the law, through his  relationships, and through his voracious appetite for knowledge. And by  devoting his life to healing our world, he uplifted countless others in  their journey to discover those magic things. He set an example we  would be wise to follow. The world has lost a good man.   Loretta and I join Fay; Lowell's children Scott, Marc, and Kate; his  stepchildren Kim and Suzanne; his grandkids Allie, Sam, Joel, Monica,  and Sasha; and his great-granddaughter Sofia in mourning his loss. We  miss him dearly. And we send our love to you all.                            ____________________
