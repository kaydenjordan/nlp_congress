 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an  amendment to H.R. 1367.   I thank my friend and colleague, the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Health, for introducing this bill to make important reforms to the VA's  hiring and retention systems.   My amendment makes a small, but important, change to clarify a  provision in the bill.   As long as I have served on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, we have  seen and heard that retaining high-quality candidates has been a real  challenge. I can speak from experience on this.   In the greater Los Angeles region, which serves my constituents,  there has been significant turnover of senior leadership at all of our  local facilities, including our community clinic in Oxnard. These  changes and uncertainty have, in my view, been harmful to the quality  of care that our veterans receive.   That is why I am so pleased the bill directs the Comptroller General  to review succession planning at VA medical facilities.   Effective succession planning, understanding what positions are  mission critical, ensuring better training, and closing the skills gap  will help the VA become a healthier organization, and help ensure that  the VA accomplishes its mission--serving our Nation's veterans.   My amendment clarifies that a medical facility includes all VHA  facilities, including medical centers, outpatient clinics, community- based outpatient clinics, and vet centers.   We must ensure each local facility has a strong workforce and a  succession plan for the future. Because without strong leadership, we  cannot provide the high-quality care that veterans have earned and  deserve.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the Chair for  accepting my amendment, and I look forward to our continued bipartisan  work together to provide high-quality care for our veterans.   I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  0945
