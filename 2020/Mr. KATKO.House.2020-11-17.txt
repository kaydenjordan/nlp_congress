 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be the sponsor of H.R. 4358,  the Preliminary Damage Assessment Improvement Act, along with the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham).   Preliminary damage assessments, or PDAs, play a critical role in  assessing and validating the impact of a disaster. PDAs establish a  foundation for further assistance requests and are essential to the  overall disaster relief process.   Inaccurate PDAs can impact the types of Federal Emergency Management  Agency, or FEMA, assistance available to communities following a  disaster.   Although FEMA is currently required to designate officials to support  States and local communities in the PDA process, inconsistencies and  turnovers in staffing can endanger access to critical relief. H.R. 4358  requires FEMA to report on FEMA's role in the PDA process, including  staffing and training.   The bill also directs FEMA to take measures to ensure FEMA teams  involved in damage assessments are appropriately trained and  consistent. Whether FEMA is responding to flooding in my district on  Lake Ontario's southern shore, which happens often,  [[Page H5859]]  or hurricanes in South Carolina's Lowcountry or natural disasters in  any other impacted community nationwide, consistency and dependability  are crucial.    I want to thank the American Flood Coalition for working with  Representative Cunningham and me on this important legislation.   In closing, H.R. 4358 will help communities across the country  recover from disasters by improving the consistency, dependability, and  accuracy in the preliminary damage assessment process for FEMA disaster  relief.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation.
