 Madam Speaker, this House just passed a spending framework  for $3.5 trillion in new government spending. And immediately  following, what is next? A plan for a Federal Government takeover of  elections.   H.R. 4 is focused on overturning the Supreme Court decision in Shelby  County v. Holder and reinstituting Federal power over State election  laws.   Preclearance was established in 1965 because there were blatant  attempts to disenfranchise African Americans. We are not debating that  today. We have made great progress since 1965.   What is the purpose of H.R. 4? H.R. 4 is a Federal power grab. This  bill would gut voter ID laws across the country. The bill would allow  the Biden Department of Justice to veto State voter ID laws.   In my home State of Wisconsin, some said commonsense voter ID laws  would lower turnout. They were wrong. In 2020, Wisconsin had the fourth  highest voter turnout in the country.   This bill would make it harder for States to maintain accurate voter  rolls. Accurate voter rolls are essential for local election officials  to accurately administer elections.   This bill is a Federal overreach. Instead of Federal overreach, let's  get to work and make it easier to vote and hard to cheat.
