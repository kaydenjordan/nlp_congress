 Mr. Speaker, Pursuant to House Resolution 147, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of en bloc No. 1. These 18 amendments  demonstrate the strong and bipartisan support for protecting our  wilderness and our public lands.   The amendments in this package include bipartisan legislation from  Representatives McKinley and Tonko to unify the way National Heritage  Areas are established and managed around the country.   Other amendments would seek to improve the diversity and  representation on our public lands, including the Great Dismal Swamp  NHA, by Representative McEachin; ensuring all Americans have access to  healthy outdoor recreation, especially in urban and low-income cities,  such as the Outdoors for All Act by Representative Barragan; and  promote outdoor recreation and wellness among servicemembers and  veterans, which is pursued by the Brown amendment.   We clarify also our intention regarding wilderness and wildfire with  the inclusion of the Panetta amendment, and we even add some small  number of wilderness, wild and scenic rivers, and mineral withdrawals  with the inclusion of amendments from Representatives Spanberger,  Pingree, and DeFazio, respectively.   The inclusion of these amendments would not only improve the bill but  improve protections for our public lands and environmental justice  communities far beyond the places already covered in Colorado,  California, Washington, and Arizona.   Simply put, this amendment reinforces that our public lands are for  the benefit and enjoyment of all Americans. I urge support for this en  bloc No. 1, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my distinguished  colleague from the State of Colorado (Mr. Crow).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to say that I have great respect  for my colleague, the ranking member, and I know that he is well  intentioned with respect to addressing wildfire issues. I would note,  for my colleague, that we just recently created a Bipartisan Wildfire  Caucus with Representative Curtis to address some of the issues that he  describes.   But, look, with respect to the bill that is before the House today,  there is  [[Page H747]]  simply no question. This bill does not create any further risks from  wildfire, far from it. As I said yesterday, the law as it stands today,  section 4(d) provides for the flexibility, ultimately, for measures to  be taken as may be necessary for the control of insects, disease, and  fire, subject to such conditions as the Secretary of the Interior may  deem desirable.   So, there is flexibility within existing law to address any potential  issues that might arise. For that reason, I would hope that my  colleague's concerns would be alleviated and that he would support this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Spanberger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib), the newest member of our Natural  Resources Committee.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining, if I  might inquire?    Mr. Speaker, I will just simply say that these amendments  are common sense. They have been vetted by the various stakeholders and  constituents in the communities that support the respective amendments  that have been proposed as part of this package, and my hope is that my  colleagues could support them. Several of them are bipartisan, as we  have mentioned, and they go to the heart of this bill, which is  ultimately protecting the most scenic places in our country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say, first, I appreciate the gentleman's  remarks on this amendment. My friend from Utah, I know from our work  together last Congress and this Congress and from our bipartisan work  on the Congressional Wildfire Caucus that the gentleman is sincere in  his intent that he, too, wants to help address the climate crisis and  the threat that it poses to our communities, and I thank him for that.   However, to that end, I would encourage the gentleman and his  colleagues to continue to work with us across the aisle on  opportunities to create clean, green, well-paying jobs for all  Americans. Ultimately, I will be opposing the gentleman's amendment  because I don't believe it is in the best interest of this particular  legislation.   As we have heard over the course of the debate this morning and  yesterday, of course, on the bill, the various areas that are protected  in this bill were included at the request of local communities who want  to see these lands protected for future generations.   One example, perhaps the most salient in my view, is the Thompson  Divide region in my bill, the CORE Act, which has faced years of  pressure to develop certain mineral interests that local stakeholders,  including the ranching community, oppose.   The largest individual withdrawal area in this bill actually  surrounds the Grand Canyon, a region with few identified critical  mineral resources, but one that I believe we can all agree is of  enormous importance to the American public. That importance, that value  of the Grand Canyon, as well as every area included in this bill, is  ultimately why we are here today.   It is why my colleagues have gone through years of painstaking work  developing a consensus with those local communities to identify those  lands of such exceptional value that they believe and the communities  believe should be protected for future generations.   The bottom line is this: We believe that some places should be set  aside permanently from extraction because some landscapes, like the  Grand Canyon, are simply too special to be mined, drilled, or  excavated.   Mr. Speaker, with that, I respectfully oppose the gentleman's  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I wonder if my colleague might engage in  just a brief colloquy so I understand the scope of the amendment. What  is the most common way to assess geothermal or other mineral resources?  I yield to the gentleman from Utah.    The gentleman is correct, I do have an answer. The most  common way is to drill. That is the most common way to assess  geothermal and mineral resources.   With much respect to the gentleman, because, again, I know his intent  is sincere, but this amendment is not simply a study amendment. This  study amendment, ultimately, if it were to succeed, would have the  Interior Department drilling countless wells throughout these  wilderness areas to ultimately ascertain the information that the  distinguished gentleman seeks, and I just don't think that is a prudent  way forward.   I would say to the distinguished ranking member, with respect to the  areas around the Grand Canyon, that the southwest United States, as I  know some of my colleagues are certainly familiar, is littered with  remnants of abandoned uranium mines and mill sites that poison the  water and the air to this day, and those mines have hit Tribal nations  the hardest.   So you can understand why the distinguished chairman of our  committee, Chairman Grijalva, would feel so compelled by local  communities in the State that he represents to move forward with the  Grand Canyon protections that are a part of this important wilderness  package.   Mr. Speaker, while I very much respect my colleague and look forward  to working with him on future proposals, we respectfully oppose this  amendment and would ask for a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 147, I rise to  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to en bloc No.  2.   The amendments in this bloc run the gauntlet of ideological  opposition to wilderness, public lands protections, and our efforts  that respond to the climate crisis. The amendments are not a good-faith  effort to attempt to improve the bill or work with the Democratic  sponsors of the committee. They simply seek to outright reverse or  fundamentally weaken the various designations proposed in this bill.   In many cases, if these amendments were adopted and signed into law,  the result would leave these areas with fewer protections than they  currently have under the status quo.   Now, I heard a lot of wide-ranging arguments against this bill from  the distinguished ranking member, but let me just begin by responding  to two points specifically:   First, with respect to this notion of having local community support,  I would simply say--and I welcome my colleague to come visit my  district in the State of Colorado. I represent a district that is the  size of New Jersey--far bigger than Delaware--10 counties, stretches  all the way to the Wyoming border, Grand County, half of Eagle County,  Summit County. I look forward to taking the ranking member to my  district in Colorado and showing him these incredible places that we  seek to protect, because I believe if he has a chance to visit them, I  may be able to convince him of the same.   I also just say, secondly, with respect to the process complaints, as  I said yesterday, every title of this bill was heard, was marked up,  passed out of committee, and passed this Chamber, on this floor in the  116th Congress--not once, twice.   So I understand the gentleman's desire to have more amendments. I  think it is a bit odd to be arguing that he is unable to amend the bill  when he is literally debating the amendments that he is offering as  they exist today, that we are proceeding to debate in this fashion.   In any event, I will simply say that these amendments, as I said  earlier, are not a good-faith attempt to improve this bill, and for  that reason we would oppose them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stanton).    Mr. Speaker, I would just note for the record with  reference to ``Eastern colleagues,'' I represent the State of Colorado,  my colleague, Representative DeGette, represents the State of Colorado,  the vast majority of the sponsors of this bill represents Western  States. My district is not all that far from the gentlewoman's district  in New Mexico.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Colorado (Ms. DeGette), the dean of our delegation.    Mr. Speaker, I would just say to my colleague: One, I  want to welcome him to the United States Congress, and I thank him for  his thoughtful recitation with respect to the amendment he offered.   But I just want to assure him, for example, with respect to the CORE  Act, my provision of this bill, it has the support of every county in  which a part of the bill is designated. That is to say, in the areas  where there are protections being made in the bill, the counties in  those areas support this bill. And that is why this bill has attracted  such bipartisan support back home in  [[Page H753]]  Colorado and why it has passed the House twice.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to note one thing for the record because there is a  reference from my colleague to amendments that she proceeded to make on  this bill.   There has been a lot of talk about local control and the support of  communities back home. We received communications from various town  commissioners regarding the amendments that my colleague proposed, and  I will just give you a couple of examples of their responses.         To simply classify this as a land grab is deeply       disrespectful to those who have worked long and hard to       gather the facts, negotiate, and compromise. The issues are       too important to let parties divide us.    That was a county commissioner from San Miguel.   A commissioner from Routt County:         The amendments were issued in a way that ignores our system       of local control. They reject the liberty and freedom of       local jurisdictions to express what is right and just within       those jurisdictions.    The communities impacted by the provisions in this bill support the  protections that we are seeking to enact into law. That is why we are  here. So with respect, I would again say we oppose the amendments that  have been submitted in en bloc No. 2.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman  from California (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, again, I have great respect for my colleague, the  ranking member, but what he purports this bill will do is just simply  not the case. I would think that trying to prevent uranium mining in  the Grand Canyon would not be controversial. I would hope that my  colleagues could come to a consensus on that.   As lawmakers, we all know that strong policy requires compromise. It  requires years of input and vigorous debate. I am happy to participate  in this debate, and I appreciate the gentleman's participation.   When we think of some of the most iconic, protected places in the  United States--Yellowstone, Yosemite, the Grand Canyon--it is difficult  to imagine a time when they were not protected, but even those most  treasured places in America underwent criticism from Members of  Congress. The arguments, actually, that we heard today are nearly  identical to those that we were hearing on the floor 100 years ago.   In 1882, Benjamin Harrison, who was then a Senator from Indiana,  introduced a bill to designate land lying on the Colorado River in the  territory of Arizona as a public park. The bill was forwarded to  Interior Secretary Henry Teller, who was a Coloradan, and he opposed  conservation of the site. He told  [[Page H756]]  the Senate that the bill was unnecessary and that the area ``does not  require the creation of a public park to preserve it.''   Congress was unwilling to proceed in the face of opposition from the  executive branch due to the interests of mining, westward territorial  mining, and land use. Harrison pushed on. He reintroduced the bill in  1883, again in 1886.   And in 1903, the great conservationist Teddy Roosevelt visited the  area he had advocated to protect. He declared that it is ``beyond  comparison, beyond description,'' and ``unparalleled.'' ``Let this  great wonder of nature remain as it is now. Do nothing to mar its  grandeur. . . . You cannot improve upon it. But what you can do is keep  it for your children, your children's children, and all who come after  you.''   On February 26--on this very day--in 1919, President Wilson signed  into law the Grand Canyon National Park Act, 101 years ago today.   Mr. Speaker, let's make that choice again. We passed this bill with  bipartisan support. I ask my colleagues to do it again, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
