 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8404, the  Respect for Marriage Act.   Like many Americans, I was deeply disturbed by Justice Thomas'  opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson, which actually named marriage equality as  the next piece of settled case law that he is intent on destroying.   Let's face it, marriage equality is at risk in America, and we must  pass legislation to enshrine the right to marry for same sex and  interracial couples before it is too late.   Early in my career, when I was a State representative, I supported  legislation to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation. I  remember discussing this bill with my late father, who grew up during  the civil rights movement. He was no activist, but he firmly believed  that all Americans should be entitled to equal civil rights.   Just like the Jim Crow laws, which legalized discrimination, that  existed during his lifetime, he believed that our Nation's  discriminatory treatment of LGBTQ Americans would mark a shameful  chapter in our Nation's history.   When the Supreme Court legalized marriage equality, we turned a page  granting equal protection under the law for all Americans, no matter  who they love. But now I fear that future is no longer guaranteed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bill so that marriage equality remains the law of the  land.
