 Mr. Speaker, weeks ago, the Biden administration made  Vice President Kamala Harris the border czar.   The question I have is: Which border?   We learned today that Czar Kamala is traveling to Guatemala. While we  do need cooperation from Guatemala in halting the flow of illegal  entrants from Central America, it defies logic that weeks after her  appointment, Czar Kamala Harris has not visited the very border--our  border--with Mexico that she has been tasked with protecting.   It seems as if the Biden-Harris administration has gone out of its  way to ignore the seriousness of the border crisis it has created. Even  as the number of illegal border crossers and unaccompanied minors  shatter records, Democrats have declared that everything under the sun  is infrastructure except a border wall. In fact, a wall protecting our  border might be the only thing Democrats do not want to throw money at  right now.   To the Biden administration and Czar Kamala: Border security is  national security, and the American people are pleading for you to take  steps to end this crisis you created. It is time to answer their call.                            ____________________
