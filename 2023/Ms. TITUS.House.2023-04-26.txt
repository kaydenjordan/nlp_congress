 Mr. Speaker, on October 1, 2017, my district experienced  the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history after a gunman  opened fire at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas.   Mr. Speaker, 58 lives were lost and two victims have died since then.  The shooter injured thousands, and more than 800 survivors sustained  severe injuries and unimaginable trauma that stays with them the rest  of their lives.   In the years that followed, the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada,  under the leadership of the Honorable Barbara Buckley, became a model  for cities across the country grappling with this same kind of  hardship.   My office took notice, and I pushed for and eventually got $3 million  in Federal funding to help build and develop a Vegas Strong Resiliency  Center to continue serving these victims.   Tennille Pereira, its executive director, was on the Hill today to  accept an award from the Congressional Crime Survivors and Justice  Caucus.   I nominated them for that award because we see the effects of their  work in our community every day--for every survivor persevering through  this lingering trauma and for every grieving family member who has lost  a loved one. This center has helped keep Vegas strong and moving  forward.                            ____________________
