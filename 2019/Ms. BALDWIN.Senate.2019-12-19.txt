 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 6 minutes.    Madam President, I rise today with great pride to  recognize and honor my chief of staff and dear friend Bill Murat, who  will retire at the end of this year after 21 years of working in  Congress.   It is a rare thing in Washington to work side by side with the same  person for more than 20 years.   So on the eve of your retirement, Bill, I want to share a few words  about how much you have meant to me and the countless others you have  encountered during your long and storied career.   Bill Murat is a proud son of Stevens Point, WI. He graduated from  high school and college there, earned his GD from UW Law School and his  MBA from Columbia University.   Civically engaged since his youth, he served as district attorney for  Portage County, WI, prior to his election to the Wisconsin State  Assembly in 1994. It was there that Bill and I developed a friendship  as colleagues in the Wisconsin State Assembly in the 1990s. I found him  to be earnest, hard-working, a brilliant strategist, and lovely  storyteller. He also knew when to add good humor or a note of levity.   I remember fondly one night, during a midnight session of the  assembly, when Bill and I and a few of our Republican colleagues were  on the floor waiting for a vote while many of our colleagues were still  in their respective caucuses trying to hash out an agreement on an  issue. Being a big fan of Broadway, Bill was reflecting on how this  moment felt like a particular song from the musical ``Oklahoma.''  There, on the floor of the Wisconsin State Assembly, while in recess in  the wee hours, on a bipartisan basis, he broke out in song, singing:  ``The farmer and the cowman should be friends.'' Because this is a  speech about Bill Murat, this will not be the last time I mention show  tunes.   After I was elected to the House of Representatives, Bill came to  work with me, first, as my district director and then, starting in  2001, as my chief of staff. Bill's steady hand of leadership has helped  me weather the storms Washington brings and stay focused on what  matters most--the people we serve in Wisconsin.   I remember the days after September 11, 2001. It was chaotic,  weighty, and, frankly, a scary time in Washington and across our  Nation. I had to get back to Wisconsin, but planes were still grounded.  So Bill walked into my office and simply said: ``Need a ride?'' So,  together, we made that 14-hour trip home from Washington, DC, to  Madison, WI, noting the American flags that were hung from nearly every  highway bridge we passed under and considering the gravity of the new  world we were seeing emerge.   Bill has been by my side for the highs and the lows of my time in  Congress. I am so proud of what we have done together, working to do  right by the people of Wisconsin and to pass on to the next generation  a country that is more equal, not less. His generosity of spirit  extends to every constituent in Wisconsin, every colleague in Congress,  and every staffer who has worked for him. His door is always open, and  he has been a mentor to so many people who have worked in the Baldwin  offices over the years.    In fact, I know there are several former staff members of mine who  have Bill to thank for their love of Broadway, since he used to host  ``Better Living through Show Tunes'' as evening staff events. To be  honest, I am still jealous that these show tune nights always happened  after ``wheels up'' and I was headed home to Wisconsin.   On a more serious note, Bill is a fierce advocate and ardent  supporter of our Team Tammy family. He has led by example, encouraging  young people to pursue their passions, doling out career advice to  those who need it and listening to the concerns of others, whether they  are a Senate employee or a Wisconsinite looking for some assistance.   Bill has spent over three decades working on behalf of the great  State of Wisconsin. He and I have accomplished much together. I would  not be here today without him, and I am grateful for his friendship. I  thank him from the bottom of my heart for the years of service, and I  wish him the most fabulous retirement.                                appropriations     I yield the floor.
