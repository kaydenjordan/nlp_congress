 Madam Speaker, I rise today heartbroken by  perpetual tragedy and outraged by perpetual inaction.   On Monday, a school shooting in Nashville left three 9-year-old  students and three adults dead. The next day, when asked about  solutions to the American gun violence epidemic, the majority leader of  the House of Representatives offered his solution: prayers.   Let's be clear, thoughts and prayers don't save a single solitary  life. Yet, after more than 130 mass shootings in less than 3 months,  the Republican Party has still chosen to allow our children to be  murdered in their classrooms.   To be clear, this is a choice. After every mass shooting, Republicans  choose to offer empty thoughts and prayers instead of commonsense  solutions, and then they turn around and cash their NRA checks.   I have spent my entire career in public service and every Sunday in  church. I will never understand how a human being, let alone one  elected to serve others, would willingly endanger the lives of their  children for a little bit of money. Frankly, it makes me sick to my  stomach.    Every American--Republican, Democrat, and Independent--wants to live  in a country where they don't have to fear that dropping off their  child at the bus stop may be the last time they see them alive.   Too many of us, however, accept this dystopian reality. The cycle of  murder, devastation, and inaction has become so commonplace that most  mass shootings don't even make the headlines. Outside of war zones, no  country on Earth so consistently chooses to accept so much death and  terror.   I certainly choose not to accept it. I choose to take necessary  action to curb the scourge of gun violence in our country. I choose to  fight for universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, and  whatever it takes to protect our communities.   I dream of a safer America. I choose to keep fighting until it is no  longer just a dream. Words mean nothing. Action is what we need.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R.  1, the polluters over people act.   This bill is nothing more than a shameless handout to fossil fuel  companies, and it speaks volumes that House Republicans have made it  their number one priority for the 118th Congress.   My colleagues across the aisle have once again chosen to side with  their Big Oil buddies and stand against the American people, our  planet, and our future.   Let me be clear: The last thing that Big Oil needs is another  handout. Last year, we all felt pain at the pump while fossil fuel  companies raked in record profits. When House Democrats voted to crack  down on gas price gouging, Republicans voted ``no.''   With their new majority and this bill, Republicans are letting us  know exactly where their loyalties lie and the lows that they will sink  to in order to appease those special interests. They are even giving  polluters free rein to dump toxic waste on our public lands.   The Republican Party has made it clear that they are happy to poison  our planet if it helps their fossil fuel friends make a quick buck.   Under the polluters over people act, working families will pay the  price, literally. Through taxpayer-funded subsidies and reckless  deregulation, Republicans are rewarding Big Oil for bad behavior, and  this time, they are not even hiding it.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to please oppose this.
