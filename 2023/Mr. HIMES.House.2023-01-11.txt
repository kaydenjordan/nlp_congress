 Mr. Speaker, once again, this morning, thousands of  Americans found themselves in airports staring at delayed and canceled  flights. This comes barely 3 weeks after tens of thousands of  Americans, and many of my own constituents, missed the holidays because  of the catastrophe on the part of the airlines, the airlines that got  billions of dollars in this Chamber from the American people barely 2  years ago. This is how the airlines repay the support that this  institution gave to them so that they could get through COVID.   Now, the private markets will presumably address the failures of  Southwest and other airlines. What happened this morning was a failure  of government. The Notice to Air Missions is a function of the FAA.   I would like to point out that after last week, when we heard  constant cries for cuts to the budget, understand, my friends, cuts to  the budget means that we underinvest in the infrastructure that my  constituents were relying on this morning. As we think about the budget  in the next 2 years, let's remember what happened this morning.                            ____________________
