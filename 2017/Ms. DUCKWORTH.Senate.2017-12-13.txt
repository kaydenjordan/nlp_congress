 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for  all the work he does on behalf of Dreamers throughout the country. His  leadership in this effort is absolutely inspiring.   I am here to speak out in favor of passing a clean Dream Act to  create a pathway to citizenship for young immigrants who enrich our  country and strengthen our economy and national security. The passage  of the Dream Act is critical to the thousands of Dreamers living in  Illinois.   I want to share one young woman's story. This is Christian  Villalobos. Christian traveled from Mexico with her mother and younger  sister because her mother was fleeing an abusive marriage. At only 6  years old, Christian was brought to the United States not knowing a  word of English. She needed to adapt quickly to her new home.   Christian worked hard in school to learn English and made great  efforts to excel in all of her academic subjects. Then, when she was in  the third grade, she was diagnosed with a learning disability, which  might have caused her to become frustrated and to see a decline in her  grades. However, in her own words, she said:         I didn't let that get in the way and I did not let bad       influences in my neighborhood get to me. There, in the back       of my head, there was always a little voice saying,       ``Education is the way to a better life.''    Christian pushed through and finished middle school and high school  as an honor student and, despite her constant hard work and proven  academic record, she faced an unexpected obstacle--adults in her life  who doubted her ability to attain a college education. As she tells it,  many adults in her life simply assumed that an undocumented student  like Christian could not obtain a college education. While these doubts  broke her heart, she was not deterred.   Christian's hard work, grit, and academic merit all earned her  admission to Northern Illinois University where she received a private  scholarship. She also worked multiple retail jobs selling flowers,  shoes, and clothing to fund her education. Although her future was  uncertain, Christian never let up on her academics or her many work  responsibilities to put herself through school.   Finally, in the last few years of her college education, she received  some relief with the implementation of the DACA Program. In 2015, she  became the first person in her family to graduate with a bachelor's  degree.   She had a job offer right after graduation which, as anyone can tell  you, is not an easy feat. Although her DACA work permit expired that  summer, when she had intended to start working full-time, her company  was so invested in having her come on board that they worked with  Christian to ensure that her DACA work permit was renewed. Their  investment was worthwhile. Within the first 2 years at her company,  Christian reached No. 1 in sales nationwide. She is now a branch  manager of her company and consistently one of the top performers in  sales.   Christian also opened doors for other DACA recipients who have joined  her at her company and are also excelling in their roles. She is just  one of thousands of Dreamers who positively contribute to our Nation.   It is evident that our businesses and communities benefit and thrive  from the work ethic and the perseverance Dreamers like Christian  possess. There are no truer American values than to work hard,  accomplish your goals, and to have the ability to fully contribute to  society.   Unfortunately, due to the Trump administration's elimination of DACA,  nearly 800,000 of our young people like Christian are now vulnerable to  deportation. Thousands of young people who participated in the DACA  Program and who are legally in the United States may no longer be able  to serve as doctors, teachers, students, and, yes, even servicemembers  in our military. This decision will also tear families and communities  apart.   I implore my colleagues in the Senate to recognize the contributions  of our DACA recipients throughout the country. I urge my colleagues to  not shortchange the thousands of Dreamers who learn and work alongside  our families and friends. We must do everything we can to make sure the  Dream Act is addressed before the holidays.   I will not turn my back on Dreamers like Christian, and I will fight  to protect DACA recipients as we work to make the Dream Act the law of  the land.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
