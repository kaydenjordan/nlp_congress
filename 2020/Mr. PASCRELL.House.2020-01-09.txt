 Truth matters, Mr. Speaker. Truth matters.   Truth is not Democratic or Republican. Truth is not partisan. It is  the basis of any society that hopes to be and hopes to remain  civilized. And so, when a faction decides that facts are flexible, that  facts are whatever validates their preconceived notions and not what  is, then that nation may as well close shop and turn out the lights.   The Trump administration's justification for military action against  Iran has been inconsistent at best. Donald Trump's speech on January 8,  2020 was a pathetic spectacle. And the Congressional briefing was a  sham, a cavalcade of falsehoods that has been denounced by Democrats  and Republicans alike.   Any rational observer, any fair-minded person can see it. Certainly,  my Republican colleagues know. Which is why some have turned to  audacious, outrageous statements. I have heard them say that dissenting  voices support terrorism simply for asking questions. That those of us  who want to avoid war are traitors.   They have gone so far and have gone so low to blame President Obama  for Iran's recent attack on U.S. forces. Going so far as to lie that  Iran was given over $150 billion after the Joint Comprehensive Plan of  Action was signed.   These are scurrilous lies. Let me repeat that: these accusations are  lies, told by desperate people. Told by people too cowardly to put  their ambitions aside to lift a finger for truth. I'd say they should  be ashamed of themselves, but they are clearly past shame. That ship  has sailed.   In his opus, George Orwell observed that ``The party told you to  reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most  essential command.'' That's an exact blueprint for these lies. Those  propagating these lies may be at war with truth, but I'm not. I still  believe in truth and in fact.   Here is the truth and the fact. The ham-fisted decisions of the Trump  administration will not prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons, but  could hasten that outcome.   Here is the truth. War with Iran will not benefit us. War endangers  our troops, leads to death and misery, and harms our allies.   Here is the fact. Americans do not want another damn war.   War powers belong to Congress, not the President, and it is our job  here to defend our constitutional prerogative. And we did this by  passing a war powers resolution.   I believe in truth. I do not believe in unnecessary war. And I stand  with this House that today made a big statement for both. To correct  the record of lies, I include in the Record this New York Times article  ``References in Address to 2013 Deal Had Holes'' by Linda Qiu from  January 9, 2020.                  [From The New York Times, Jan. 8, 2020]   Fact Check--Trump's Inaccurate Statements About the Conflict With Iran                               (By Linda Qiu)         President Trump, responding during a White House address on       Wednesday to the missile strikes by Iran, assailed the       nuclear agreement reached by his predecessor and praised       American military might. The 10-minute address contained       numerous inaccuracies and claims that lacked evidence. Here's       a fact check.      What Mr. Trump said:        ``Iran's hostilities substantially increased after the       foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were       given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash.''        This is misleading. The agreement reached by Iran, the       United States and a number of other nations to constrain       Tehran's nuclear program did not directly provide American       money to Iran, but it did release about $100 billion in       previously frozen Iranian assets. Much of the amount was tied       up by debt obligations, for example, $20 billion to China for       financing projects in Iran. Estimates for the actual amount       available to Iran range from $35 billion to $65 billion.        A separate $1.7 billion transfer of cash to Iran was to       settle a decades-long dispute and was agreed to in       negotiations that happened parallel to the nuclear deal.       Before the 1979 revolution, Iran's shah had paid $400 million       for American military goods but, after he was overthrown, the       equipment was never delivered. The clerics who seized control       demanded the money back, but the United States refused. The       additional $1.3 billion is interest accumulated over 35       years.        Iran and other parties to the nuclear accord signed an       interim agreement in 2013, but the formal agreement was not       reached until 2015. The White House did not respond when       asked for evidence of increased Iranian ``hostilities.''        It is worth noting that before Mr. Trump withdrew the       United States from the nuclear agreement in 2018, his       administration repeatedly certified that Iran was in       compliance.        Afterward, as his so-called maximum-pressure campaign on       Iran continued, tensions between the United States and Iran       ``escalated significantly,'' according to a recent       Congressional Research Service report. Mr. Trump's claim       blaming the nuclear accord for Iranian aggression rather than       his withdrawal from it is ``almost an inverted reality,''       said Jim Walsh, a research associate at M.I.T.'s Security       Studies Program and an expert on nuclear issues and the       Middle East.        He said that attacks by the four groups supported by Iran       and designated by some governments as terrorist       organizations--Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad       and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General       Command--actually declined after the nuclear deal.        Attacks carried out by these groups decreased from more       than 80 in 2014 to six in 2017, before increasing to more       than 40 in 2018, according to the Global Terrorism Database       maintained by the University of Maryland's National       Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to       Terrorism. And while Iran has been a violent and       destabilizing force across the region, Mr. Trump's assertion       that Tehran had ``created hell'' lacked context in some       cases.        Iranian aid to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in that       country's civil war and Tehran's backing of Houthi rebels in       Yemen both predate the signing of the nuclear agreement,       formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.        ``There's nothing that Iran was doing after J.C.P.O.A. that       it wasn't doing before,'' said Vali R. Nasr, a professor of       Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University and a State       Department official in the Obama administration.        Calling Iran's backing of the Houthi rebels against the       Saudi Arabia-aligned government in Yemen terrorism is       ``devaluing the word to the point where it's meaningless,''       said Anthony Cordesman, an expert on military affairs and the       Middle East at the Center for Strategic and International       Studies.        As for Iran's activities in Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr.       Cordesman said, ``they were more aggressive there because       they were working to attack ISIS--as we were.''      What Mr. Trump said:        ``The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were       paid for with the funds made available by the last       administration.''        This lacks evidence. The White House did not respond when       asked to substantiate this claim, and experts noted there was       no proof that Iranian assets unfrozen by the deal paid for       the missiles.        ``There's a certain fungibility here,'' Mr. Walsh said. If       the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, ``took a       dollar on the street, did that fund the missile attack?'' he       added. ``That's not very useful from an analytical       perspective. Nor is the case that giving them money caused       them to attack the U.S.''        ''We have no indication,'' Mr. Cordesman said, ``whether       these missiles are funded by the money from the J.C.P.O.A.''        The director of national intelligence's annual report on       worldwide threats in 2019 did note that Iran continued to       develop and improve military capabilities including ballistic       missiles, but it did not tie those efforts to the nuclear       deal. Furthermore, the annual reports warned of the same       efforts in 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and before.        Critics of the Iran deal, including Mr. Trump, have long       argued that it was inadequate because it did not address       Iran's ability to develop ballistic missiles. Those       restrictions have instead been established by the United       Nations Security Council resolutions.        The diplomatic accord was an arms deal with a very narrow       aim of curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions, ``not a       nonaggression pact, not a form of a friendship treaty,'' Mr.       Nasr of Johns Hopkins said. ``Whether there could have been       more in the deal, of course. But piling in expectations is       disingenuous.''  [[Page H114]]           What Mr. Trump said:        ``The very defective J.C.P.O.A. expires shortly anyway and       gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout.''        This is exaggerated. The major provisions limiting Iran's       nuclear capabilities last a decade or longer. And the       agreement increased the ``breakout'' period--the time it       would take Iran to produce enough fuel for one weapon--to at       least a year from an estimated two to three months. If the       deal had been left in place and fully adhered to, Iran would       not have been able to achieve nuclear breakout until 2030.        The agreement also prohibits Iran from pursuing nuclear       weapons permanently. ``Iran reaffirms that under no       circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any       nuclear weapons,'' the first paragraph of the deal reads.        The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a vocal       critic of the deal, said it ``largely expires after only 15       years.'' Under the deal's terms, Iran agreed not to use more       than 5,060 centrifuges to enrich uranium--and not to pursue       research and development on centrifuges--for 10 years. Limits       on enrichment levels, facilities and stockpiles last for 15       years, according to a report from the Congressional Research       Service.        Under the terms of the accord, Iran also agreed to convert       a deep underground enrichment facility into a ``technology       center'' that cannot contain nuclear material and where the       number of centrifuges is limited for 15 years. Several       provisions on plutonium, including forbidding the       construction of new heavy water reactors, last for 15 years.        Inspectors are to monitor centrifuges and related       infrastructure for 15 years, verify inventory for 20 years       and monitor uranium mines for 25 years.      What Mr. Trump said:        ``We are now the No. 1 producer of oil and natural gas       anywhere in the world. We are independent, and we do not need       Middle East oil.''        This is misleading. The United States has been the largest       producer of oil and gas in the world since 2013, a trend that       began under the Obama administration thanks in large part to       advances in shale drilling techniques.        The Energy Information Administration projected in January       2019 that the United States will produce more energy than it       imports this year, the first time since 1950. But that is not       the same thing as not importing oil from the Middle East at       all. In 2018, the United States imported more than 1.5       million barrels a day from the Persian Gulf.      What was said:        ``The American military has been completely rebuilt under       my administration at a cost of $2.5 trillion.''        This is exaggerated. The $2.5 trillion figure refers to the       total defense budgets of the past four fiscal years: $606       billion the 2017 fiscal year (which began before Mr. Trump       took office), $671 billion in 2018, $685 billion in 2019 and       $718 billion in 2020. But the amount spent on procurement--      buying and upgrading equipment--was about $562 billion over       that period.        Mr. Trump's use of the phrase ``completely rebuilt'' is       somewhat subjective. Though the Trump administration has       invested in operational readiness over the past few years,       there are signs that the military continues to face       substantial challenges in addressing an array of threats from       around the world.        For example, the military earned a middling grade of       ``marginal'' from the conservative Heritage Foundation's       annual index of strength, based on factors like shortages in       personnel and aging equipment. The think tank noted that       American forces are probably capable of meeting the demands       of a single major regional conflict but ``would be very hard-      pressed to do more and certainly would be ill-equipped to       handle two nearly simultaneous major regional       contingencies.''      What was said:        ``Three months ago, after destroying 100 percent of ISIS       and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of       ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much death.''        This is exaggerated. The Islamic State lost its final       territories in March 2019, ending the physical ``caliphate,''       but the terrorist group has not been destroyed. The recent       confrontation with Iran has halted the United States'       campaign against ISIS. Just this week, Defense Secretary Mark       T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint       Chiefs of Staff, said that the fight against the group was       continuing.        Mr. Trump alluded to the organization's endurance in his       speech when he said: ``ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran. The       destruction of ISIS is good for Iran. And we should work       together on this and other shared priorities.''
