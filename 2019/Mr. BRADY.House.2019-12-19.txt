 Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, yesterday, with impeachment, was a low mark in  partisanship.   Today, we have the opportunity to set a high mark in consensus and  bipartisanship.   Today is a momentous day. We will finally consider the implementing  bill that brings the trade relationship between the U.S., Canada, and  Mexico into the 21st century.   This trade agreement is sorely needed. It has been over 25 years  since we first established this trade relationship through NAFTA. So  much has changed since then.   For one thing, when we passed NAFTA, the phone booths by the Ways and  Means hearing room actually had pay phones in them.   A new 21st century trade agreement will be a force multiplier for  America's already strong economy.   Today marks the day 2 years ago that the House approved the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act for the first time that has transformed America's economy.   Today, President Trump and Ambassador Lighthizer have fought hard and  delivered on their promise for a pro-growth and moderate trade pact.  And because of their outstanding leadership and working closely with  our congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle, we now have a  trade agreement that will deliver historic wins for the economy, and  that is because this trade agreement is all about growth.   USMCA will set the stage for billions more in economic activity. It  creates, for the first time, rules for competing in the digital  economy, to the advantage of America's manufacturers and farmers across  so many sectors. It pries open Canada's market for U.S. farmers and  ranchers to sell American dairy, wheat, chickens, eggs, and turkey. It  improves the competitive position of our manufacturers, our service  companies, and our small businesses. It ends the race to the bottom  created by what had been Mexico's poor labor laws.   The agreement, best of all, is enforceable, allowing us to challenge  violations and to stop countries from blocking these challenges,  holding Mexico and Canada accountable for these new rules.   More jobs. More American customers.   America's innovators will get the tools they need to succeed here as  we compete with countries like China.   Independent experts predict this new agreement will spur over $68  billion in new economic activity.   We are always looking to create more U.S. jobs, and this will create  more than 176,000 jobs here in America, including 76,000 in our auto  sector. That is good news for everyone.   Best of all for the American people, USMCA is a truly bipartisan  agreement.   To Chairman Neal's credit and his remarkable hard work, House  Democrats, including Chairman Blumenauer and my Texas colleague, Henry  Cuellar and many others, worked in good faith with Ranking Member  Buchanan and Ambassador Lighthizer to get on a path to ``yes.''   We are so glad to see so many Republican priorities were retained.   In the agreement before us today, we have labor and environmental  rules that are realistic, they are measurable, they are enforceable.   What is not in this agreement are provisions for which there is no  consensus, like the Paris climate accord.   It is not a perfect agreement. No trade agreements are. We will  continue to work to improve the areas that we think can be improved in  future agreements, but in any event, American workers have a major  victory in the USMCA, and I am proud to support it.   It is a shame that the Speaker held it up for so long. It has been  over a year since President Trump and our North American neighbors  signed the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. It has been over half a  year since Mexico ratified the initial agreement, and they have  undertaken transformational labor reform.   Due to Democrats' misguided obsession with impeachment, they  neglected moving forward on this pro-worker and pro-growth trade  agreement for far too long.   Nonetheless, today I am so encouraged that we are here, finally  moving forward on this new, strengthened  [[Page H12248]]  North American Trade Agreement, because in the end, USMCA will not be a  Republican win or a Democratic win, but a win for the American people,  and a stronger, more prosperous alliance with our North American  trading partners.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Buchanan), the leading Republican on the Trade  Subcommittee, who deserves great credit for this trade agreement.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney), a free-market conservative who  is an outstanding chairman of the Republican Conference.

Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. LaHood), an outstanding member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Rice), an outstanding member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a series of  statements in support of USMCA, including from the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, the Information Technology Industry Council, the Business  Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers, the American  Farm Bureau, who join a host of business, agriculture, technology,  manufacturing, and small business organizations across America that  have been instrumental in getting USMCA across the finish line.                                          U.S. Chamber of Commerce,                                  Congressional & Public Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, December 18, 2019.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports H.R. 5430, the       ``United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)       Implementation Act,'' which would strengthen trade ties that       support millions of American jobs. The Chamber will include       votes on this bill in our annual How They Voted scorecard.        The case for approval of this legislation is strong. First,       it would strengthen U.S. trade ties with Canada and Mexico,       which are by far our most important export markets. More than       12 million American jobs--in sectors from agriculture and       manufacturing to services and technology--depend on trade       with our two North American neighbors. They are also the top       two export destinations for U.S. small and medium-size       businesses, more than 120,000 of which sell their goods and       services to Canada and Mexico. The new pact would guarantee       that virtually all U.S. exports enter these markets tariff-      free.        Second, USMCA would modernize North American trade rules.       When the North American Free Trade Agreement was negotiated a       quarter of a century ago, there was no e-commerce, to give       one example; consequently, the agreement did not address this       sector. While USMCA falls short in several areas--including       in intellectual property, which should not be considered a       template for future agreements--its updated rules on digital       trade, non-tariff barriers, services, and other areas promise       substantial benefits.        Third, USMCA would restore certainty to these vital trade       relationships. Tariffs and the threat of tariffs--applied to       steel and aluminum, autos and auto parts, or applied to       pursue non-trade objectives--have imposed real costs on the       U.S. economy and dampened investment. Enactment of this new       trade agreement would turn the page on this chapter and       afford the business community the confidence it needs to       invest and hire.        Implementation of USMCA would be a boon to U.S. companies       and the workers they employ as they compete in our top two       export markets. We urge the House to approve USMCA       expeditiously.            Sincerely,                                               Suzanne P. Clark,                                                          President,      U.S. Chamber of Commerce.                                   ____         Dear Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy, Majority       Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer: The undersigned       Texas based business leaders and organizations urge your       swift action and support of the United States-Mexico-Canada       Agreement (USMCA). Ratification of USMCA is critically needed       to provide certainty for the many business sectors in Texas       that rely on trade with Canada and Mexico, while in turn       contributing to the U.S. economy.        Texas exports more than any other state to Mexico and is       second only behind Michigan for exports to Canada. More than       950,000 Texas jobs are supported by trade with Mexico and       Canada. In 2018, Texas exported more than $137 billion worth       of products to our North American partners, accounting for 43       percent of Texas' total exports to the world. These are       staggering numbers that will only grow with the       implementation of USMCA.        According to a recent independent International Trade       Commission (ITC) report, USMCA will create more than 176,000       additional jobs and raise annual U.S. gross domestic product       by $68.2 billion. It will increase U.S. exports to Canada by       $19.1 billion and to Mexico by $14.2 billion. It is obvious       USMCA will greatly benefit the Texas economy by spurring job       growth and opening more trade access.        The manufacturing community in Texas heavily relies on       passage of USMCA. In fact, Mexico and Canada purchase half of       Texas' total global manufacturing exports. The Lone Star       State's top exports to Mexico and Canada are petroleum and       coal products, computer equipment, chemicals, motor vehicle       parts, electrical equipment, semiconductors and electric       components, fabricated metal products, plastics, engine,       turbine and power transmission equipment and food and       beverages. These exports totaled more than $120 billion in       2018 and are responsible for more than 114,000 Texas jobs.       Passage of USMCA will help Texas manufacturers be more       competitive and create many more jobs in Texas and the U.S.        USMCA would also create much needed certainty for Texas       farm and ranch families who contribute to the economy and       feed and clothe millions worldwide. Over 60,400 Texas jobs       are supported by exporting agricultural products to Mexico       and Canada. The annual value of Texas' agricultural exports       to our North American neighbors totals more than $7.2       billion. USMCA would only build on these achievements by       breaking down existing trade barriers and opening more market       access for products like beef, dairy, corn, wheat and pork.        USMCA provides Texas with greater access to Canada's dairy,       poultry and egg markets. It would enhance standards for       biotechnology, reduce trade distorting policies, establish       modern sanitary and phytosanitary standards and more.       Combined with other agricultural provisions in USMCA, the ITC       report estimates U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and the       rest of the world would increase by $2.2 billion.        Through updated automotive rules of origin, USMCA       encourages manufacturing and economic growth by requiring       that 75 percent of auto content be produced in North America.       USMCA also drives higher wages by mandating 40-45 percent of       auto content be made by workers earning at least $16 per       hour. These improvements will incentivize billions of dollars       in additional U.S. vehicle and auto parts production while       directly benefiting the Texas automotive industry.        USMCA also includes new provisions to strengthen and fully       enforce environmental and labor obligations. The agreement       requires parties to adopt and maintain in law and practice       labor rights as recognized by the International Labor       Organization. It requires worker representation in collective       bargaining in Mexico, new provisions to take measures to       prohibit the importation of goods produced by forced labor       and to address violence against workers exercising their       labor rights. These provisions make strides in leveling the       playing field for Texas and U.S. workers and businesses.        USMCA also provides a strong framework to support North       American energy trade. It will bolster North American       competitiveness and help lower our reliance on energy imports       from outside the region. It also maintains the free flow of       energy across borders in North America through the continued       zero-tariff treatment of U.S. energy exports to Mexico and       Canada.        In addition, the new agreement will enable U.S. chemical       manufacturers to create a North American model for chemical       regulation while leveraging the highly-integrated, North       American supply chain to reduce costs, boost U.S. exports and       inject new growth and job creation throughout Texas and the       U.S.        Further, Texas pharmaceutical and technology innovators       will enjoy the strongest  [[Page H12257]]       protections for trade secrets contained in any U.S. trade       agreement. USMCA also contains a new digital trade chapter       that will facilitate the cross-border transfer of data and       minimize limitations on where data must be stored.        As you can tell, passage of USMCA is vital to Texas and our       country. We respectfully request that you quickly bring USMCA       up for a vote in Congress and support its final passage.       Hardworking Americans are counting on your leadership on this       important issue.

Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the CEO members of       Business Roundtable, I urge you to vote in favor of H.R.       5430, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement       Implementation Act. Over 12 million American jobs depend on       the $1.4 trillion in trade with Canada and Mexico. Passing       USMCA will modernize a 25-year old agreement with our       neighbors and preserve and strengthen the North American       economy.        USMCA includes many gold-standard provisions, further opens       markets and sets standards that will benefit workers,       businesses and farmers across broad industry sectors. USMCA,       once in effect, will promote the digital economy and trade,       remove key barriers to goods and services trade, promote the       free flow of data for all sectors, enhance trade facilitation       and e-commerce, and support small businesses by cutting red       tape.        No trade agreement is perfect, and we do not support every       individual provision in USMCA. Future agreements should       include stronger intellectual property protections for life-      saving innovations and technologies. Nevertheless, we       strongly believe that USMCA, in its totality, will support       U.S. economic growth, jobs, and innovation.        Business Roundtable appreciates the bipartisan efforts in       Congress to ensure that all USMCA commitments will be fully       enforceable, and we will work with Congress and the       Administration through USMCA implementation to boost North       American competitiveness.        Passing USMCA with broad bipartisan support will also       deepen support for trade policies that help Americans compete       at home and abroad. We urge you to vote Yes on USMCA.            Sincerely,      Tom Linebarger,          Chairman and Chief Executive Office, Cummins Inc. Chair,             Trade and International Committee Business Roundtable.                                   ____                                                                ITI,                                  Promoting Innovation Worldwide,                                  Washington, DC, December 18, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of the       members of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI),       I write to express our strong support for legislation       implementing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (H.R. 5430).       Given the importance of this agreement to the technology       sector, we will consider scoring votes in support of final       passage in our 116th Congressional Voting Guide.        The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) represents a       landmark improvement in our relationships with some of our       most important trading partners from the perspective of the       tech sector, and a key step forward for U.S. leadership in       innovation and digital trade. Notably, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada       Agreement contains first-of-its-kind, cutting-edge digital       trade provisions that recognize the reality of the 21st       century economy and would boost the U.S. economy and its       competitiveness around the world.        American companies of all sizes and across all industries       leverage technology, and can expect to benefit from the       USMCA's digital trade and other tech-focused provisions.       These provisions will promote the seamless flow of data       across borders, allow companies to store data where it makes       the most sense from the perspective of their business and       customers, prevent costly tariffs and taxes on technology       products and services, safeguard source code and algorithms       by prohibiting requirements that companies divulge them as a       condition of doing business, promote acceptance of U.S.-      developed international standards, and create consistency in       testing and certification procedures for tech goods.        We applaud the work and leadership that has gone into       securing the opportunity to move forward with ratification of       the USMCA, and urge you and your colleagues to support the       implementing legislation for the agreement when it comes to       the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                    Jason D. Oxman,                                                 President and CEO.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Comer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Conaway), who has been a longtime leader in agriculture, on  the farm bill, and frankly, we couldn't have gotten this agreement done  without him.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Balderson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), the State that helped win Texas' independence.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), a gentleman who was pro trade and pro USMCA  the moment that he hit Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Hurd), whose district has a long border with Mexico and who  was deeply engaged in the negotiating rounds with Mexico, Canada, and  the U.S., my friend from San Antonio.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. King), a champion of agriculture.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), a leader of ag and autos.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DesJarlais).    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Hagedorn).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my friend, a leader of trade policy in the George  H.W. Bush administration.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), an agriculture leader from the Mount  Rushmore State.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Madam Speaker, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson), a manufacturing champion.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, Texas is made for trade. No State ships or sells more  around the world than the Lone Star State, and especially in my home  region in the Houston area of the Eighth Congressional District of  Texas.   So many of our jobs depend on free and fair trade, almost 1 million  in our State alone. The new USMCA is incredibly vital and incredibly  important for us because our two largest trading partners are our  friend and neighbor, Mexico, and Canada as well.   I want to thank President Trump for bringing this trade agreement to  reality. Like other Presidential candidates, he pledged to renegotiate  NAFTA. Unlike any others, he delivered. He was convinced that we could  rebuild bipartisan trade here in America by insisting on a fair and  level playing field for American workers, and he was exactly right.   Earlier, when he championed tax reform, he did that because every  expert and every other Presidential candidate, including Democrats,  said: manufacturing in America is dead, just give up, it won't come  back.   He believed otherwise, and so did Republicans; and because of our GOP  tax cuts and his balanced regulations, we have created over a half a  million new manufacturing jobs right here in America over the last 2  years.   I want to thank Ambassador Robert Lighthizer for being the architect  of this trade agreement. I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, I was a skeptic  when he said that we can rebuild bipartisan trade and we can fulfill  many of the Democrats' labor and environmental wishes that no other  President had ever delivered. So he proved me wrong.   Working closely with Chairman Neal and others, he, in the original  trade agreement of the USMCA a year ago, produced the most pro-labor  and pro-environmental trade agreement in American history. In the last  few months he has worked closely with Democrats to fine-tune that  agreement so that these issues are enforceable. Republicans support  that enforcement.   I also appreciate the leadership of Chairman Neal, without whom we  would not be here today. And I want to especially thank my trade staff  led by the remarkable Angela Ellard, Josh Snead, David Giordano, and  someone whose last day is with us here, Blake Harden as well.   During my time on the Ways and Means Committee, I have been proud to  help lead the passage of 12 of the trade agreements America has in  place today and two updates of the Trade Promotion Authority that lays  out the trade rules for the White House and Congress to follow. So for  me this is number 13.   I believe in the freedom to trade, and I truly believe it is the  greatest economic freedom we possess. It lays at the heart of our free  enterprise system. As Thomas Jefferson wrote: ``Commerce with other  nations is not only necessary and beneficial to all parties, it is a  right and a duty.''   It is the freedom to buy, sell, and compete anywhere in the world  with as little government interference as possible. It is a freedom  that if we build a better mousetrap, then we can sell it anywhere in  the world; and when someone else builds a better mousetrap, then we  have the freedom to buy it for our family and for our business. That  economic freedom has lifted millions out of poverty and provided  opportunity, prosperity, and peace, not just for ourselves but for the  world.   That is why it was so disappointing the Democrats held up moving  forward on this agreement for so long because every day of delay helped  China, helped Europe, and helped other countries. This was long  overdue.   But the truth of the matter is, we are here today and we have pulled  together in a historic vote. America is made for trade, and with our  new, strong economy--the most competitive economy today in the world-- we need more customers all around the world. That is what this trade  agreement does. It delivers on new customers and delivers on new  prosperity.   I will close with this, Mr. Speaker. On the Ways and Means Committee  I hold a seat formerly held by President George H. W. Bush and former  Chairman Bill Archer. When President Bush signed this agreement in San  Antonio, he said this so many years ago:         This agreement is an achievement of three strong and proud       nations and expresses our confidence in economic freedom and       personal freedom in our people's energy and enterprise.    It is an honor to vote today in support of the States U.S.-Mexico- Canada agreement that embraces and enhances economic and personal  freedom. Members of Congress should take pride in this work that they  have put in to make today's debate on today's trade agreement a  reality.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith), the Republican leader of the Tax  Policy Subcommittee, and I ask unanimous consent that he may control  that time.
