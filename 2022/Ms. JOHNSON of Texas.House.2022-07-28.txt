 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1289,  I call up the bill (H.R. 4346) making appropriations for Legislative  Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022, and for other  purposes, with the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the  Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 4346, the bill now  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I stand before you today to strongly urge support for the CHIPS and  Science Act.   The CHIPS Act and the bipartisan Science, Space, and Technology  Committee provisions that form this package are vital to ensuring a  bold and prosperous future for American science and innovation,  maintaining our international competitiveness, and bolstering our  economic and national security.   These provisions were built with rigorous input from the scientific  community, industry, academia, and other stakeholders on what they need  most to succeed in the 21st century.   This final product is the result of months of bipartisan  negotiations. It is also the result of dedicated efforts and long hours  put in by the committee staff, and I thank each of them for helping us  to get where we are today.                                time  1300    With this legislation, we will bring about solutions for the climate  crisis, enhance our semiconductor research and manufacturing, create  jobs, increase regional innovation, and so much more. We will also take  historic and much-needed action to build a strong and diverse STEM  workforce and ensure that we are able to make use of all the brainpower  and talent we have in our great Nation.   With bipartisan STEM pieces in this bill, we will create a bright  future for all those who want to pursue STEM, no matter their race,  gender, or ZIP Code. We are ushering in a strong future for our premier  scientific agencies with transformational funding at NIST, NSF, and  DOE. We also authorize important activities at NASA and address other  discrete research topics across the government's scientific agencies.   The United States has long been a beacon of excellence in science and  innovation, and it is far past time that we revitalize Federal support  for the  [[Page H7375]]  initiatives that have enabled us to lead.   I am proud of this package, and I am especially proud of the  bipartisan provisions in Division B that began in the Science, Space,  and Technology Committee. I thank Ranking Member Lucas for his  partnership in this effort.   I know that this package does not have everything that everyone  wanted. It doesn't have everything I wanted, but that is the nature of  compromise and a result of urgency of this situation.   We must pass this legislation immediately to ensure that the United  States remains a global leader in science, technology, and innovation  and to bolster our economic and national security.   I urge all Members to put aside politics and support this thoughtful  and balanced bipartisan package.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our distinguished Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our distinguished majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Stansbury).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I have no more requests for time,  and I am prepared to close.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I would simply like to say in closing that when we pass up an  opportunity that we have like today in this bill, where we are looking  out for our scientific enterprise, looking out for our space  exploration and chip manufacturing, which will drive our future, we  simply will be closing the door to our future to turn any of this down.   We cannot be competitive in the world without adequate research and  adequate assistance to keep our research enterprise growing strongly. I  am not willing to give up this opportunity and close the door on my  Nation.   And I simply would ask all the people who possibly can, not to think  about the bill that was passed or going to pass in the Senate  yesterday, or last night, but think about the importance of keeping the  doors and opportunities open for our Nation and having the jobs and  talent right here in the United States.   It is bigger than all of us. We were sent here to look out for our  Nation, and this is a measure that will do that. So I simply plead with  everyone who can possibly see the future, or even dream about the  future, to vote for this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4346, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
