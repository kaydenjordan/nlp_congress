 Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government has fully  reopened, and Federal employees are back to work. While the shutdown is  over, the crisis at the border remains.   I recently toured the southern border in Arizona. Ranchers and Border  Patrol agents told me about the challenges they face because of open  borders. I saw short, weak, barbwire fences that line our border. I  learned more about violent cartels and how they profit from our porous  borders, from human trafficking and the flooding of drugs into our  communities.   Congress has an obligation to secure our border. We must give Border  Patrol agents the tools they need to get their job done. They told me  they need equipment to detect drugs, and more and better body armor.   Border Patrol agents also told me that they need a wall. They know  walls work. Congress should listen to them.   Tomorrow, the conference committee tasked with border security will  meet for the first time. Having seen the border crisis firsthand, I  urge those lawmakers to listen to our Border Patrol agents, fund  meaningful physical barriers, and secure our borders.                            ____________________
