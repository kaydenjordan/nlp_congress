 Mr. Speaker, I take a moment to recognize the  extraordinary accomplishment of Texas-25's high school football teams  this past season. Texas-25 was home to two champions, and I was proud  to see all the hard work pay off on the field.   After a season of early mornings, long hours on the field, and  staying focused in school, these teams showed dedication, strength, and  an unwavering commitment to victory. In Stephenville, the Yellow  Jackets became the 4A Division I Football State Champions after beating  the Austin Jaguars 38-21, marking their sixth Texas State football  title.   The Westlake Chaparrals were named the Class 6A Division II State  champions with a 40-21 win over Denton Guyer, cementing their third- straight State championship and finishing the season undefeated with a  16-0 record.   As these winners prepare for their next endeavors, I wish them the  best of luck for an even brighter and more victorious future. Winning  is good. Go Chaps and go Yellow Jackets. In God we trust.                            ____________________     Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, it was a great game, 13-12. There  were a lot of runs scored. I think this next one coming up is going to  be the gentleman's last one after many years of managing, and we  appreciate what he has done.   He mentioned the charities; the charities were the big winners.  Almost $2 million in charity income was raised from the game. It was a  great night.   It is a huge honor to accept this championship trophy for not only  the team but all of the Republican Conference. Being America's team is  not easy. And we are officially America's team. We are looking forward  to July 28 where we hope everybody returns and we raise more money for  charity.   It is a great honor. We will display this proudly. We look forward to  seeing our opponents again on July 28. We will have Greg Steube ready  to go along with his bat and everybody else we have playing.   God bless all of you, and God bless the great game of baseball.                            ____________________
