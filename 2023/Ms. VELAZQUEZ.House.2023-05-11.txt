 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of this cruel,  extreme, and unworkable policy.   The United States has long been a beacon for those coming from other  countries in search of a better life. The bill before us today will end  the asylum system as we know it and eliminate humanitarian protections  for people coming to the United States.   Many asylum seekers are escaping conditions that we cannot fathom,  yet here we are debating a measure that will subject them to more  cruelty. Cruelty is the point, but cruelty will not fix our broken  immigration system.   This bill will make it nearly impossible to seek asylum at the  border, upend protections for unaccompanied minors, and mandate that  all asylum-seeking families be detained indefinitely, regardless if  they are with children.    Mr. Speaker, these policies will only exacerbate the  extreme suffering occurring at the southern border.   If Republicans really wanted to address this crisis, they would join  Democrats to pass real, comprehensive immigration reform.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this cruel, draconian  bill.
