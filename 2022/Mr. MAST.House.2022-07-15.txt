 As all remarks are supposed to be directed to the Chair,  Madam Speaker, when is a life a life?   Madam Speaker, when is a life a life?   I will open it up for the rest of my colleagues over there. I would  wager none of my colleagues on the other side will tell us when life  begins. I have a $20 bill here. It is not worth as much as it used to  be worth. I will put it down here on the table. Any one of you or your  colleagues wants to speak up and tell us when life begins, it is  sitting here for you.   Madam Speaker, when is a life a life? When does it begin?   That is the most extreme idea to come out of this body, that you  won't acknowledge when a life is a life.    Madam Speaker, point of order.    Madam Speaker, did I address my remarks to you?
