 Mr. Speaker, on November 26, 2019, during the  Thanksgiving holiday, a dock piled with aggregates collapsed into the  Detroit River.   Local and State authorities were slow to communicate with each other,  and misinformation quickly spread. Concerns about polluted drinking  water, even radioactive contamination, caused confusion and concern in  my district. Many of us learned about the collapse from a Canadian  newspaper, which published an article days after the collapse.   Over 2 months later, the site continues to deteriorate. The shoreline  continues to erode, and contaminated soil is still spilling into the  water. More recently, a sinkhole developed at the site, discharging  even more contaminants into the water.   The area's long-serving industrial history was another source of  concern for public health and the environment. During the 1940s and the  1950s, the site produced uranium for the development of the atomic  bomb.   Recently, the site has been leased to companies openly storing toxic  chemicals and piles of aggregates along the water.   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed in the site owner's lack of urgency to  quickly fix this problem. Over 2 months later, aggregate is still  spilling into the water. The owners have failed to address the erosion  and, now, the emerging sinkhole.   Mr. Speaker, I join with the EPA and the Michigan Department of  Environmental, Great Lakes, and Energy, or EGLE, to hold this owner  accountable to the fullest extent possible.                                time  1030    The owner has missed key deadlines to submit cleanup plans and, so  far, their proposals don't even come close to stopping the erosion. If  it is the responsibility of the violators to clean up their mess, how  do we know they will do it properly and efficiently?   I expect our State and Federal agencies to continue to take action to  safeguard our public health. They are continuing to test the  surrounding area for contamination and are regularly updating my office  with test results.   The risks to our public health cannot be dismissed. My constituents  have witnessed how government action can help or hurt our communities.   We cannot forget the Flint water crisis. We witnessed a failure of  government. Just last year, the Detroit Public Schools shut off its  drinking fountains after finding elevated lead and copper. In the last  year, Michigan has led the Nation in active PFAS sites, drawing  national attention to the efforts of these ``forever chemicals'' in our  waters.   We cannot--and I will fight to make sure we do not--repeat the Flint  water crisis. We must learn from our mistakes. This situation demands a  sense of urgency to restore the public's faith in our government to  protect them from being contaminated by water.   This is why I am continuing to monitor the ongoing cleanup and  remediation of the collapsed site. While the latest test results showed  no significant threat to the public health, I will work with the State  to ensure the site's cleanup and urge the State to push for a third- party independent study. We have the right to know that the surrounding  water and the environment is safe from contaminants.   I will also remain in communication to ensure the drinking water in  Michigan and--also with government oversight--that we in America have  safe, clean water, and we must continue the fight for affordable water.   If there is a threat to our public health, the government has a  responsibility to safeguard our constituents from harm.                            ____________________
