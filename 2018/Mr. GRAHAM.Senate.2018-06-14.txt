 Yes. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and  I will object.   My colleague from Utah, who is a very smart man on the Judiciary  Committee, like I am--I don't know if I am smart, but we are on the  same committee--we are actually making progress here.   Just briefly, Senator Cruz has had an amendment that says if someone  is suspected of being part of an enemy force, they will have a hearing  to strip their citizenship, which avoids the problem Senator Lee and I  have. He is trying to combine that with his amendment.   Unfortunately, there is no ability to hold them as an enemy combatant  during that process--and maybe we can work that out later--so I object.
