 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member  for whom I have the utmost respect for. But unfortunately, I rise in  opposition to this bill.   Dr. Carla Hayden, appointed by President Obama, has been on the job  less than a year and deserves the opportunity to complete the IT  modernization of the Copyright Office before this authority is taken  away from her. As ranking member of the Committee on House  Administration, I know that Dr. Hayden has made excellent process in  reforming the Copyright Office, knocking 2 years off the estimated time  to complete its modernization. This bill is a solution in search of a  problem.   This measure not only impedes the progress Dr. Hayden is currently  making but will also undue the strides that have already been made.  Simply put, this bill does nothing to improve the operations of the  Copyright Office.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to stay with Dr. Hayden and vote  ``no'' on this bill.
