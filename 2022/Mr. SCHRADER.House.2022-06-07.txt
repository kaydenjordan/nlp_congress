 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this year's  Water Resources Development Act, which includes funding for several  critical priorities for my State and my district.   I am very proud to share that this bill authorizes funding to help  the city of Newport replace its woefully outdated and dangerous Big  Creek Dam. This dam holds the city's water supply; sits right above the  city; could completely wipe out the city in an earthquake.   Funding is also designated for wastewater treatment and dredging  along the Oregon coast, particularly in our areas that are facing a lot  of issues with the Pacific Ocean.   I really appreciate the opportunity to present on this report and  urge its passage.
