 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 5:15 p.m.  vote start at this time.    Madam President, I rise to recognize Sergeant Chasen  Brown for his selfless demonstration of bravery while providing  lifesaving first aid to victims of senseless violence on the evening of  October 1, 2017, in Las Vegas, NV.   On that day, Sergeant Brown was suddenly and unexpectedly thrust into  a massacre of his fellow citizens. As bullets rained down  indiscriminately from above on innocent concert-goers, Sergeantt Brown  immediately began delivering critical aid to dozens of wounded victims,  saving countless lives while placing his own life in extraordinary  danger.   Bravery, sacrifice, and service to others are not, however, novel  concepts to Sergeant Brown. As a gunner for Charlie Battery, 2nd  Battalion, 222nd Field Artillery, Sergeant Brown has dedicated his  career to serving our country. Today, we are lucky to have his service  in the Utah National Guard, and our State is safer as a result. For his  heroism, Governor Herbert awarded Sergeant Brown with the Utah Medal of  Valor, the highest level of recognition for distinguished service. This  honor is well-deserved, but the greatest reward is the gift of life  that Sergeant Brown protected for the many civilians he saved that  night amid terror and evil.   The great people of the State of Utah and our fellow Americans owe  Sergeant Chasen Brown a debt of gratitude for his extraordinary courage  under unimaginable circumstances. Thank you, Chasen.                            ____________________
