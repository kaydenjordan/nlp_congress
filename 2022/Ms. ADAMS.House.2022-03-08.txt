 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record statements from UNCF,  TMCF, NAFEO, Alabama A&M's President Wims, and the Executive Leadership  Council in support of the resolution.         Washington, DC (February 7, 2022).--Over the past month,       more than two dozen historically Black colleges and       universities (HBCUs) have received terroristic threats in an       apparent attempt to disrupt and, presumably, sow fear in our       campus communities. These attempts to intimidate the HBCU       community reached a peak on Tuesday, Feb. 1--the first day of       Black History Month--when 13 HBCUs were forced to disrupt       their normal operations due to coordinated threats posed to       their respective campuses.        The United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and the Thurgood       Marshall College Fund (TMCF) are pleased that the federal       government has characterized its ongoing investigation into       these threats as ``threats of terror with the utmost       seriousness'' and as acts of domestic terrorism, as announced       during a recent briefing by the Federal Bureau of       Investigations (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security       (DHS). Given the federal government's characterization of       these threats, we anticipate and expect that the Justice       Department will fully prosecute the individuals responsible       for these heinous acts and we look forward to the swift       conclusion of this matter.        Unfortunately, these terrorist acts fall squarely into a       recent trend line documented by the Center for Strategic and       International Studies that reflects a sharp increase in       right-wing extremist attacks and plots in the United States       in recent years. HBCUs, as institutions founded for the       original purpose of educating and uplifting former enslaved       people and their descendants, have been at the forefront of       social and economic justice advocacy for more than 180 years.       Our universities' missions and their historic legacies       naturally put them at odds with the enemies of equality       which, even in the 21st century, makes our institutions and       their students, staff, faculty and administrators an apparent       target for extremism. Notwithstanding these attempts to       terrorize our community, our HBCUs remain unbroken and       unbowed.        The actions of a misguided few will not deter our       institutions from fulfilling their collective mission to       educate our nation's next generation of teachers,       entrepreneurs and leaders. We are hopeful that congressional,       state, community and philanthropic leaders will join with us       and offer the support that is needed for us to offer our       students the sense of security needed as we move forward with       the same sense of resilience we have shown since the founding       of the first HBCU in 1837.        Reflecting on these incidents, we are reminded of the words       of the late Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, which       still are instructive today:        ``I wish I could say that racism and prejudice were only       distant memories. We must dissent from the indifference. We       must dissent from the apathy. We must dissent from       indifference. We must dissent from the apathy. We must       dissent from the fear, the hatred and the mistrust . . . We       must dissent because America can do better, because America       has no choice but to do better.      Dr. Harry L. Williams,        President & CEO, Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF).      Dr. Michael L. Lomax,        President & CEO, United Negro College Fund (UNCF).

RE Bomb Threats on HBCU Campuses, Congressional Resolution           Condemning Violence on HBCU Campuses & Related Matters.      Hon. Alma Adams (NC-12)      Co-Chair, Congressional HBCU Bipartisan Caucus.      Hon. Chris Coons,      CH-Chair, Congressional HBCU Bipartisan Caucus.      Hon. French Hill (AR-02),      Co-Chair, Congressional HBCU Bipartisan Caucus.      Hon. Tim Scott,      CO-Chair, Congressional HBCU Bipartisan Caucus.        Dear Congressional Bipartisan HBCU Caucus Co-Chairs Adams,       Hill, Coons and Scott: I am writing in my capacity as       President & CEO of the National Association for Equal       Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO), which, as you know,       is the nation's only 501 (c) (3) membership and advocacy       association for all HBCUs and PBIs. I am joined by Attorney       John Pierre, Chancellor of the Southern University Law       Center, and Chair of the NAFEO Presidential Policy, Advocacy       & Legal Advisory Board. We are writing to express our       profound gratitude for your leadership of the Congressional       Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, which, along with support from other       congressional leaders, members of the Congressional Black       Caucus, bipartisan support from other Members of Congress,       and leadership from the Administration, yielded more than       $5.8 billion for HBCUs, their students, families, faculty,       staff, infrastructure, and service communities. This       represents a greater federal investment in HBCUs than any       time in the Nation's history. It was a substantial down-      payment on closing the gulf between public and private       investments in HBCUs as compared with their historically       White college and university counterparts, relative to their       missions and student outcomes.        We are writing at this time to let you that our members are       poised to do whatever is required to assist you and your       colleagues in moving the Nation closer toward closing the       HBCU/HWCU funding gap and building a stronger, peaceful,       equitable, just America.        We are concerned that the recent bomb threats on HBCU       campuses, must be taken seriously. Consideration must be       given to Congress requesting that Homeland Security, the FBI,       Department of Justice, and the Department of Education,       repurpose some of their existing funds to provide HBCUs       additional resources, immediately, with which to provide the       training and infrastructure they need to ensure the safety of       their campus community, and their service communities.       Additionally, where, as in the case of Homeland Security, a       federal department or agency is poised to make grant funds       available in the spring, that could be used to better prepare       the campuses for any possible assault with a clear plan,       based on the most promising practices, while moving everyone       on the campuses and in their service communities out of       harm's way, consideration should be given to making the funds       available now.        We believe we must act immediately on the assumption that       the perpetrators may make good on some of the threats       because: (1) The perpetrators of the bomb threats have not       been publicly identified; (2) The institutional targets are       moving; (3) The threats are coming: (a) amid heightened       incendiary racist rhetoric, and unabated race-based assaults;       (b) amid increased state actions to suppress the Black &       Hispanic vote; (c) amid efforts to trammel the First       Amendment rights of professors who want to include in       curricula a comprehensive examination of America's past and       present, including discussions about Blacks in America; (d)       as polls show that many disaffected Whites believe their       plight is due to Blacks in America gaining ``too much,''       although the December jobs reports demonstrate that the       unemployment rate for White people dropped (3.2 percent),       Asian Americans (3.8 percent), and Latino/Hispanic people       (4.9 percent), while the unemployment rate for Blacks       increased from 6.5 percent to 7.1 percent, demonstrating the       entrenched, intractable and growing racial employment gap,       especially for Black women;        In spite of their perception, the Black-White gaps in       education, employment, salaries, wealth, health,       sustainability, and justice persist. (e) The bomb threats on       HBCU campuses coincide with reports documenting the billions       of dollars that HBCUs have been denied to which they are       entitled, highlighting the tremendous disparities between       funds for the historically White land-grant institutions       (1862s) and the historically Black land-grant institutions       (1890s), and the failure of many states to provide the       congressionally mandated one-to-one match funding for 1890       land-grant universities; (f) The bomb threats on HBCU       campuses are occurring as reports indicate the January 6th       Congressional Commission is unearthing information that may       result in exposure of the masterminds.        The HBCU Community thanks you for your leadership in       calling for a Congressional Resolution condemning the bomb       threats against HBCUs and denouncing violence, supporting       peace, tolerance, and ecumenism. The HBCUs have a rich and       cherished history of leading in teaching about civility,       combatting violence by highlighting the oneness of humankind,       respect for our pluralism, and teaching the imperatives of       love, mercy, justice, and for a peaceful coexistence in our       pluralistic nation. We stand ready to engage our members in       educating their Members about the importance of your       resolution especially during such times as these.            With thanksgiving,                                                 Lezli Baskerville,                                                   President & CEO.

Hon. Alma Adams,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Adams: Approximately around 2:30 a.m. on       Monday, January 31, 2022, law enforcement officials at       historic Alabama A&M University received notice that the       campus was the target of a bomb threat and indicating the       quadrants that would be impacted by the device. Thanks to the       immediate actions of our campus police and its continuing       partnership with the Huntsville Police Department and the       Federal Bureau of Investigation, the University received an       ``all clear'' to resume operations prior to the start of the       business day.        While this designation was a relief, the chronicled and       persistent threats on all fronts to historically black       colleges and universities (HBCUs) must be taken seriously.       While representing a small percentage of America's vast       higher learning system, HBCUs' role over more than a century       has been nothing short of phenomenal. Thus, we wholeheartedly       support the resolution led by you and Congressman French Hill       outright condemning these persistent acts of domestic       terrorism. Our HBCUs have proven their merit by making the       American Dream accessible to thousands. We must do everything       in our power to ensure their continued existence.        Thank you for your ongoing leadership and work in Congress       and for your and your colleagues' adamant stand for one of       our nation's greatest resources, our HBCUs.            Sincerely,                                             Daniel K. Wims, Ph.D.,      President.                                   ____     The Executive Leadership Council's Statement in Response to Recent           Threats of Racial Violence at HBCUs Across the Nation         Washington, DC (February 8, 2022)--The right to an       education is one of our nation's greatest freedoms. George       Washington Carver, renowned scientist, and professor at       Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) once said,       ``Education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom       to our people.''        Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are       some of the nation's most enduring symbols of what can be       achieved when a people are determined to prosper. For       decades, HBCU's have faced threats of racial violence. These       threats are violent attempts to keep Black people from       receiving educations that ultimately unlock economic       opportunity in America.        The Executive Leadership Council (ELC) issued the following       statement in response to the recent bomb threats targeted at       HBCUs across the country.        Please see our statement, below:        Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are       essential to the American story.        Since their inception, HBCUs have educated and trained       America's most brilliant Black scholars, doctors, lawyers,       and a myriad of other professionals--from the first Black       Supreme Court Justice of the United States Thurgood Marshall       to Kamala Harris, the first woman elected Vice President of       the United States. HBCUs have made a tremendous impact on       American progress.        However, despite their rich history, HBCUs are historically       underfunded and often subject to threats of racial violence.       The recent bomb threats at HBCU's nationwide are particularly       disturbing. Our students deserve to feel safe on campus.        We applaud the administration's swift response but       recognize that distractions like this only deepen the chasm       between HBCU students and their counterparts at universities       that do not face continuous instructional disruptions. These       threats are as material as they are symbolic and we, the       members of The Executive Leadership Council (ELC), take them       very seriously.        The ELC is the preeminent global membership organization       for Black current and former CEOs, senior executives. and       board members of Fortune 1000 and equivalent companies. We       advocate for advancing Black leadership by increasing the       number of Black corporate CEOs, C-Suite executives, and board       members, as well as building a pipeline for the next       generation of Black corporate leaders. HBCU graduates account       for a significant number of the Black talent pipeline for the       public and private sectors--HBCU students are the nation's       workforce of the future.        If our nation seeks to continue cultivating diverse talent       and reaping the proven results of inclusive leadership--it is       imperative that we prioritize investing in these historic       institutions and the overall safety of their students. We       hope Congress and the Biden-Harris Administration will       continue to support  [[Page H1351]]       thoughtful legislation that serves to protect these       institutions and will work to pass the HBCU Ignite for       Excellence Act, which provides needed federal investment for       these institutions that mean so much to America and her       continued success.     I thank Chairman Scott for his courageous leadership and  support of our schools.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my resolution (H. Con. Res.  70), which condemns the recent despicable, cowardly bomb threats to  more than 30 historically Black colleges and universities. These were  hate crimes, acts of terror.   As a proud two-time HBCU alumna of North Carolina A&T State  University, a retired professor of 40 years at Bennett College in  Greensboro, and now a representative of Johnson C. Smith University in  my district, I know HBCUs can overcome any challenge, but those  challenges should not include terrorism or racism.   The congressional response from my colleagues to these threats has  been robust. We came together to call for swift action from Federal law  enforcement.   The threats were quickly addressed by members of Federal, State, and  local law enforcement. Thanks to the Department of Justice and its  agencies for working swiftly in this regard.   My thanks as well to Chairman Scott, whose leadership has resulted in  more than $6.5 billion in funding to HBCUs, more funding than the last  10 years combined.   Our HBCUs, their faculty, their staff, and especially their students  are strong. They are resilient. They are brilliant paragons of academic  excellence. But they shouldn't have to respond to threats and secure  their campuses on shoestring budgets.   While today's resolution rightly condemns these cowardly acts of  violence against our hallowed institutions, Congress must continue to  respond with action and legislation.   Finally, I want to address the perpetrators of these crimes. I am  praying that the hate that inspired these acts leaves your heart  forever, that you take a moment and imagine yourself in different  circumstances.   Imagine growing up on the ghetto streets of Newark, New Jersey, your  mom cleaning houses to make ends meet. You save every penny to go to  college because the most important people in your life have taught you  the value of education.   You make it to an HBCU, becoming the first member of your family to  go to college. It is a big responsibility. Because HBCUs are special  places, especially for Black Americans, they invest in you. They lift  you up. They help you succeed in ways you never thought possible. They  take you from cleaning houses with your mom to serving in the U.S.  House.   Similar experiences are shared by millions, and that is what you  attacked when you threatened our HBCUs. That is what you deemed worthy  of hate and violence. And that is why Congress must condemn these  actions.   Mr. Speaker, I move that we pass this resolution, and I ask all of my  colleagues to support it.
