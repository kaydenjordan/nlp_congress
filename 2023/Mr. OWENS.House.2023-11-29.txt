 First of all, congratulations to the vice chair.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Protecting Our  Communities from Failure to Secure the Border Act.   Biden's open border policies have led to a historic surge in illegal  border crossings, affecting not only traditional border communities but  every community across the country.   Last year alone, the Customs and Border Patrol reported a record- shattering 2.4 million illegal crossings at our southern border. This  year, a shocking 21,000 pounds of fentanyl were smuggled into our  communities, with a staggering 90 percent seized at U.S. ports of  entry.   These alarming statistics paint a vivid picture. The White House has  failed to enforce our immigration laws, securing the border, and  safeguarding families in Utah and across the Nation from the deadly  influx of fentanyl.   Equally concerning is the President's wrongheaded policy of housing  illegal immigrants in our national parks. This disastrous policy  endangers the safety of local communities and strains resources meant  for families to enjoy safe and wholesome activities on our Federal  lands.   House Republicans are taking a stand against these reckless policies.  This week we will bring to the floor H.R. 5283, the Protecting Our  Communities from Failure to Secure the Border Act. This is crucial  legislation that will prohibit Federal funding from being used to  provide housing for illegal immigrants on any Federal land.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support H.R. 5283 and send a clear message that we are united in our  commitment to protecting our communities and securing our borders.
