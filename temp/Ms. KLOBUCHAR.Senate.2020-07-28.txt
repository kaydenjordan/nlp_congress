 Madam President, today I rise to honor a leader, a  fighter, and a hero: Congressman John Lewis.   A few years ago, I was fortunate enough to travel to Selma, AL, with  Congressman Lewis to commemorate ``Bloody Sunday,'' when the then 25- year-old activist helped to lead 600 people across the Edmund Pettus  Bridge.   At the end of the bridge, the marchers were attacked with billy clubs  and tear gas. Congressman Lewis's skull was fractured. He bore the  scars until the day he died.   And that weekend, 48 years later, the White police chief of  Montgomery handed his police badge to Congressman Lewis and publicly  apologized for the police not protecting him and the Freedom Marchers.   Forty-eight years is a long time for an apology, and it only happened  because Congressman Lewis never quit fighting for progress, for civil  rights, for economic justice, and for voting rights for every single  American.   It was because of that spirit of persistence and resilience that I  will always be in awe of Congressman John Lewis.   He never lost his faith that this country could be better, if only we  put in the work. He never gave up on justice. He never stopped marching  toward freedom.   John Lewis was born to sharecroppers in the Jim Crow South and  dedicated his life to the civil rights movement.   As one of the original 13 Freedom Riders, he took on segregation.  Despite being met by angry mobs, beatings, and arrests, Congressman  Lewis didn't give up.   Wise beyond his years, he was the youngest speaker at the 1963 March  on Washington, which he also helped to organize. His words from that  day have become a rallying cry for all those seeking equality. As  Congressman Lewis explained, ``To those who have said, `Be patient and  wait,' we must say that we cannot be patient. We do not want our  freedom gradually but we want to be free now.''   In 1964, he coordinated efforts for the ``Mississippi Freedom  Summer,'' recruiting college students from around the country,  including Minnesota, to join the movement to register Black voters  across the South.   And still, he was far from done. In 1986, Congressman Lewis became  the second African-American to be elected to Congress from Georgia  since Reconstruction, propelled by the same Black voters he had helped  to empower and mobilize.   Once in Congress, John Lewis never stopped fighting, for voting  rights, for basic human rights like healthcare, and for a more just and  equal America.   There are so many reasons that we will miss him dearly, his  unwavering persistence being just one. But now, it is up to us. To  honor his life and carry on his legacy, we must not quit. So let's pass  the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and let's all try and get  in some good trouble                            ____________________
