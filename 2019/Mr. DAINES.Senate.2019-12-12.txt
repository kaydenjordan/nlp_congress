 Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to MAJ Brad Caton  for his exemplary dedication to duty while serving as a Department of  Defense congressional fellow and a congressional budget liaison for the  Assistant Secretary of the Army, Financial Management and Comptroller.  This month, he will begin his transition to serve as a budgetary  analyst in the Army's Budget Office.   As a native of Libby, MT, Brad was commissioned as an infantry  officer upon graduation from the University of Montana, where he earned  a bachelor's of science degree in business administration. A dedicated  scholar, Brad went on to earn his master of business administration  from the University of Montana and later a master's degree in  legislative affairs from the George Washington University. Brad has  been very successful in his Army career and has served in a broad range  of assignments.   His billets have spanned from serving as an infantry platoon  commander with the 4th Infantry Division with a deployment to Iraq to  assignments managing the Army's financial resources. Brad exemplifies  what it means to be a Montanan with his leadership, perseverance, and  versatility. This was evident during his first assignment as a budget  analyst for U.S. Army Central Command and while he commanded the  Pontiac Recruiting Company in Eastern, MI. Following command, Brad  continued to display his Montana Resolve as the support operations  officer at Camp Carroll, Republic of Korea. Additionally, he was  deployed to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan while serving as the deputy  assistant chief of staff, financial management for the 1st Armored  Division.   In 2017, Brad served as my Department of Defense congressional  fellow. For a year, I had the privilege of working closely with Brad.  He was extremely passionate about serving and representing Montanans.  He consistently went above and beyond his immediate responsibilities to  work in areas outside of the veterans and defense realm. He used his  insight as a Montanan to provide critical local feedback on rural  Montana priorities, including Tribal and energy issues. He was always  thinking of Montana while representing the Department of Defense in my  office. Following his fellowship, Brad transitioned to serve as a  congressional budget liaison for the U.S. Army. In this capacity Brad  arranged and escorted me over to visit the Montana National Guard while  they were deployed to Afghanistan over the holidays. He continued to  work tirelessly with all Members of Congress and their staffs to  accurately articulate the Army's budget positions to the Appropriations  Committees. His professionalism, diligence, and commitment to the  mission are unmatched, and his work both as a fellow and as a liaison  was outstanding and represented the Department of Defense and U.S. Army  to the U.S. Congress well.   The foundation of Brad's military success is his family and his  Montana roots. In fact, Brad bought a house in Red Lodge during his  fellowship which he hopes to retire to 1 day. He is a devoted husband  to his wife, Eryn Beckman of Colstrip, MT, and a committed father to  his children, Isabel, Evan, Pierce, and Audrey. Brad and Eryn's  attitude of service, sacrifice, and care for others permeates every  organization and activity they participate in, and they are truly  examples of servant leaders in the Army and their communities.   Throughout his career, Brad has exemplified what it truly means to be  a Montanan as he positively impacted soldiers, peers, and superiors.  Our country has benefited tremendously from his extraordinary  leadership, judgment, and passion. I join my colleagues today in  honoring his dedication to our Nation and his invaluable service to the  U.S. Congress as an Army congressional liaison.   It has been a genuine pleasure to have worked with MAJ Brad Caton  over the past 3 years. On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my  colleagues today in recognizing and commending Brad for his service to  our country, and we wish him all the best as he continues service in  the U.S. Army.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing the first set of graduates from Anaconda Junior/Senior High  School's Copper Academy, Alyssa Liedle-Caissey and Kai Bauer.   The Anaconda Junior/Senior High School's Copper Academy allows  students to learn at a different pace and in a unique environment which  includes the use of online programs that have visual demonstrations and  explanations for different educational requirements.   Alyssa and Kai both took a chance participating in this program, and  it paid off. They both graduated 6 months early. I am very proud of  these two young Montanans for pushing themselves and showing the  Anaconda community that this new, individualized program allows  students to thrive. Congratulations to Alyssa and Kai on their  graduation from the Copper Academy. I wish them the best of luck as  they transition into the next steps of their lives.                            ____________________
