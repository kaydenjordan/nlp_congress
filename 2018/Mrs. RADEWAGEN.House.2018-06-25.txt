 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 299.   American Samoa is home to a great many veterans, especially on a per  capita basis, as our people enlist at high rates in the U.S. Armed  Forces. On their behalf, I am pleased to support the bipartisan Blue  Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, recognizing the realities faced by  those veterans who served in the region's waters.   On a personal note, my older brother served in the U.S. Navy in the  Gulf of Tonkin and other area waters during Vietnam. This legislation  recognizes the nature of the service of these veterans who did their  duty in wartime. This bill honors their mission and helps keep the  commitments we owe our veterans.
