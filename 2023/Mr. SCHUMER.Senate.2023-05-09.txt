 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 4.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent the mandatory quorum call for  the cloture motion filed today be waived.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I have one request for committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a) of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                       SUBCOMMITTEE ON STRATEGIC FORCES    The Subcommittee on Strategic Forces of the Committee on Armed  Services is authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on  Tuesday, May 9, 2023, at 4:45 p.m., to conduct a hearing.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 346 and that the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the Cantwell substitute  amendment that is at the desk be considered agreed to; that the bill,  as amended, be considered read a third time and passed, and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    A word on what we just did. A few moments ago, the  Senate unanimously passed the NOTAM Improvement Act requiring the FAA  to look into the resiliency of the cyber security of Notice to Air  Missions system, which is critical for alerting pilots of danger when  flying.   Nobody wants a repeat of the chaos and delay we saw at our airports  back this January when FAA's NOTAM system went down.   This legislation will get the FAA to take a hard look under the hood  of NOTAM to ensure it is as safe and reliable and well-protected from  cyber attacks and technical glitches as possible.   I want to thank my colleagues who worked hard on this: Senator  Klobuchar, the lead sponsor; Senator Capito; and Senator Moran for  their work on this legislation. And, of course, I thank Senator  Cantwell, chair of the Commerce Committee, for her good work on this as  well. She gets a lot done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 157.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S1572, May 9, 2023, in the first column, the following  appears:  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 157, submitted  earlier today.      The online Record has been corrected to read:  Mr.  President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of S. Res. 157.    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. President, I further ask unanimous the resolution be  agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 204, which is at the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until  10 a.m., Wednesday, May 10; following the prayer and pledge, the  Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed  expired, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use  later in the day and morning business be closed; that following the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session  to resume consideration of the Gorordo nomination, postcloture, and  that all time be considered expired at 11:30 a.m.; that following the  cloture vote on the Wright-Gallo nomination, the Senate recess until  2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings; that if cloture is  invoked, notwithstanding rule XXII, at 2:30 p.m., the Senate vote on  confirmation of the Wright-Gallo nomination; that upon disposition of  the nomination, the Senate resume consideration of the Shogan  nomination; that there be 10 minutes, equally divided, prior to a vote  on confirmation of the nomination; and that upon disposition of the  Shogan nomination, the Senate resume consideration of the Gupta  nomination and the Senate vote on confirmation at 5:30 p.m.; finally,  that if any nominations are confirmed, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's actions.    For the information of the Senate, there are two  rollcall votes at 11:30, two at 2:30, and one at 5:30 p.m.                            ____________________     If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous order  following the remarks--I am sure they will be excellent--of Senator  Murkowski of Alaska.    If the Senator would yield, I love the Arctic. I have  never been there, but I have seen many films and movies about it. I am  sure her remarks will be excellent, but I must give a speech at the  bipartisan spouses' dinner. So I regret that I will not hear her  remarks directly, but I will scan them in the Record.
