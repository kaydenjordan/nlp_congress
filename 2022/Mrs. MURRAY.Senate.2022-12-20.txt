 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the  life of Robert ``Bobby'' Silverstein, a leader in the disability rights  movement, who passed away on November 17 from complications from  cancer.   Bobby served in a number of roles in the U.S. House of  Representatives and the U.S. Senate, including as staff director and  chief counsel for the Subcommittee on Disability Policy of the Senate  Committee on Labor and Human Resources, now the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions. He drafted, negotiated, and helped pass  landmark bipartisan legislation, including the Americans with  Disabilities Act and critical amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and the Developmental  Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act, improving the lives of  millions of people with disabilities.   Bobby was an effective leader known for building consensus and his  dedication to critical analysis and the basic principle of fairness.  Bobby received dozens of national awards honoring his contributions,  including the Distinguished Services Award of the President of the  United States in 1993. Bobby improved the lives of people with  disabilities by enshrining in Federal law their fundamental rights to  full participation, equal opportunity, independent living, economic  self-sufficiency, education, and employment. He has immeasurably shaped  the disability and civil rights movement for the better, and I join  former chairs of the HELP Committee in recognizing all of his  contributions.   After leaving Congress, Bobby continued to dedicate himself to  disability  [[Page S9625]]  policy and advocacy. His work has and will continue to make life better  for so many people with disabilities and families across the country.  He will be remembered fondly.                            ____________________
