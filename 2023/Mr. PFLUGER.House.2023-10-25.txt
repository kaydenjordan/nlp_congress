 Mr. Speaker, it is great to be back at work, doing the  important work of the House.   Mr. Speaker, the United States stands united in the face of the  horrific, barbaric attacks on our greatest ally in the Middle East-- Israel.   The October 7 attack, nearly 50 years to the day after the Yom Kippur  War, was horrific. More than 1,500-plus people murdered, hundreds more  taken hostage, including American citizens. The brutality is unlike  anything we have seen in modern times. With women and children being  raped and babies beheaded, this cannot be the norm.   Israel has every right to protect themselves, to defend themselves  and their sovereignty. Our country must support Israel's efforts to  protect its citizens and uphold its sovereignty without question.   With misinformation and the horrible pro-Hamas demonstrations across  the world, the U.S. Congress must reaffirm our unwavering support for  Israel. Together, we must work toward a lasting peace that ensures the  security and prosperity of our Jewish friends and Israel.   Let us stand shoulder to shoulder in this pursuit, unwavering in our  commitment to justice, freedom, and the enduring bonds that bind our  nations together. We stand with Israel today and forever.
