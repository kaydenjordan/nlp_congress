 Mr. Speaker, I know the American people are feeling the  effects of higher prices. That is why Congressional Democrats continue  our work to provide relief to America's working families who are  struggling to make ends meet by putting people over politics and  passing the Inflation Reduction Act. This historic life-changing  legislation significantly lowers healthcare costs for America's seniors  by enabling Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and by  capping Medicare out-of-pocket expenses to $2,000 every year.  [[Page H7847]]    The Inflation Reduction Act tackles rising costs and inflation by  ensuring big corporations pay their fair share of taxes which will, in  turn, reduce the national debt. The legislation also makes the largest  investment ever in fighting the climate crisis by investing in clean  and secure energy production and manufacturing, while creating good- paying American jobs for the future.   Congressional Republicans are too busy trying to score political  points rather than working with us to solve today's challenges.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  join us in working for the people.                            ____________________
