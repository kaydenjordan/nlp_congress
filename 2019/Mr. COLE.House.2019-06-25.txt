 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  want to thank my good friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts,  Chairman McGovern, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Madam Speaker, we are here today on two very different pieces of  legislation. Last night at the Rules Committee, I noted that these  unrelated bills have only one thing in common, and that is their place  in the Democratic majority's partisan, going-nowhere agenda.  Unfortunately, I believe today's rule is only going to compound that  recurring problem of the Democrats, frankly, not even trying to work  with Republicans to actually legislate in divided government.   Our first bill today is H.R. 3351, the Financial Services and General  Government Appropriations Act of 2020. This is the 10th of 12  appropriations bills to come to the floor. As we have worked through  these bills, I have raised several concerns that are applicable to this  bill as well.   Like the previous appropriations bills this Congress, H.R. 3351 is  marked to a high allocation figure that has no basis in reality.  Remember, the House and Senate have not agreed to an overall budget for  fiscal year 2020, which the Congressional Budget Act mandates be done  by April 15.                                time  1230    Without a budget agreement, the budget cap numbers contained in the  Budget Control Act will automatically take effect, leading to an 11  percent cut in defense spending and a 9 percent cut in nondefense  spending.   Instead of working with Republicans in the Senate to reach a deal  before marking and reporting funding bills, the majority has, instead,  gone ahead and pushed through their own partisan appropriations bills  that are marked to fake and unrealistic numbers.   The 12 appropriations bills the majority has proposed have several  flaws in common. They reflect the idea that any increase in defense  spending must be matched by an even greater increase in nondefense  spending, which simply isn't a realistic assessment of our national  priorities.   What is worse, these bills actually underfund defense and homeland  security, coming in below the numbers that the President requested in  order to ensure our military can adequately defend our Nation.   The FSGG bill we are considering today contains an 8 percent increase  over fiscal year 2019, which makes little sense when we are  simultaneously underfunding our national security.   Like the previous bills brought by my Democratic friends, the  Financial Services appropriations bill also contains several partisan  provisions that must be removed before a bipartisan, bicameral  agreement can be reached on spending.   The majority has removed longstanding pro-life protections, such as a  rider that prohibits the District of Columbia from using government  funds to provide for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or  health of the mother.   The majority has also cut out a longstanding provision that I  originally sponsored several years ago barring government contractors  from being forced to disclose political campaign contributions. Since I  originally sponsored this provision several years ago, I find it  surprising that the majority would eliminate this provision, which  provides important protections for government contractors and prevents  contracts from being awarded on the basis of contributions.   Of course, there was an opportunity to work through and fix these  problems through the amendment process. But instead of making things  better, the majority has chosen, once again, to leave out minority  voices.   I want to reiterate a point I made the last time I was on the floor  for a rule. During the last Congress, when Republicans were in the  majority, our record shows that we allowed more amendments sponsored  solely by Democrats than we did amendments sponsored solely by  Republicans.   The current majority has a much sorrier record. As of yesterday, of  all amendments made in order this Congress, 67 percent were sponsored  by Democrats, 19 percent by Republicans, and 13 percent were  bipartisan.   Today's rule is right in line with that record. Sixty-seven percent  of the amendments made in order are sponsored by Democrats, 24 percent  by Republicans, and 9 percent are bipartisan.   Madam Speaker, this record of partisanship is a far cry from what the  majority promised at the start of this Congress. There was an  opportunity to move forward with fulfilling the majority's promises  with today's rule. Instead, we see few Republican amendments and many  Democratic amendments, resulting in a final product that will fail to  achieve the bipartisan support needed to become law.   The second bill included in this rule is H.R. 2722, which the  majority is promoting as a bill that provides security for elections.  The reality is that this bill, like its partisan predecessor H.R. 1  that passed the House earlier this Congress, amounts to nothing less  than a complete Federal takeover of elections.   Traditionally, elections are left to the States and local governments  to conduct as they see fit. Localities can respond to local conditions;  election officials can innovate; and elections can be operated in a way  that best suits the unique needs of each community.   H.R. 2722 turns all that on its head. The bill will force all  elections to be conducted using paper ballots, even if the local  officials prefer more advanced technology. It will require costly  recounts with no apparent purpose. It  [[Page H5093]]  will impose significant and wasteful spending on taxpayers.   Instead of affirming States as the laboratories of democracy, when it  comes to elections, H.R. 2722 will impose a one-size-fits-all  regulatory regime directed from Washington on communities across the  country.   Madam Speaker, this state of affairs could and should have been  avoided. Instead of pushing these partisan bills this week, the  majority could have chosen to work with Republicans to craft bipartisan  bills to address all of these problems.   Even if that did not come to pass, the majority at the Rules  Committee still could have worked with the minority to make more  minority amendments in order and give all Members the opportunity to  fix these flawed bills on the floor. That they did not is yet another  indication of where the majority's priorities lie: with pushing  partisan bills to score political points and avoiding the bipartisan  work of actually making law.   There is still a chance to change, Madam Speaker. In order to do so,  the majority needs to decide whether they are here to score political  points or if they are here to make law.   Before I conclude, I would be remiss if I did not highlight what is  missing in today's rule. We should have been considering three bills  today, not two. The missing bill is the supplemental appropriations  bill providing funding for the humanitarian crisis on the southern  border.   Each week, this crisis grows worse. Our facilities for holding new  arrivals, particularly children and vulnerable unaccompanied minors,  are already at the breaking point. Simply put, we need more resources,  and we need them today.   To be fair to the President, he has been asking Congress to do that  since May 1. The failure to brin forward a supplemental appropriations  bill for this purpose is a major failure of governance by the majority.    All of us here, Republicans and Democrats alike, agree that we need  to provide funding for this crisis. Time is wasting while we wait.   Back in 2014, when President Obama asked us for $3.7 billion in  supplemental resources for precisely the same purpose, the House acted  to give him the resources he needed in 24 days. As of today, almost 2  months have gone by with the majority failing to act.   Many of my friends on the other side rightfully express concern that  unaccompanied minors backing up at border stations is not appropriate  nor in the best interests of the children. I couldn't agree more. The  Border Patrol couldn't agree more.   By failing to bring forward a supplemental appropriations bill, the  path the majority is taking us on leads only to this outcome: hurting  the children I know we all want to help.   Congress has given HHS the mandate to care for unaccompanied minors.  Congress now needs to write the check so that HHS can do what Congress  has mandated.   I remind my friends across the aisle that Republicans are ready and  willing to work with them to pass a bipartisan supplemental  appropriations package that provides needed funding for housing, for  the Department of Defense, and especially for children who find  themselves in an unfathomable situation at the border.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to remind my friends that it took them weeks, if not longer,  to even acknowledge there was a crisis at the border. As a matter of  fact, they were accusing the President of manufacturing the crisis a  few weeks ago. Now, fortunately, they have come around to the idea that  hundreds of thousands of people arriving over a 3-month period of time  is a crisis.   Secondly, I want to remind them, they have still yet to act in the  face of the crisis. They have had the ability to pass legislation. The  President asked for it almost 60 days ago. We still haven't seen  anything in terms of legislation reaching this floor.   Madam Speaker, I also want to point out that, frankly, it shouldn't  take this long to respond. We can disagree over a lot of things. And I  have no doubt about the sincerity of my friends when it comes to being  concerned about the well-being of these children; none whatsoever.   But we know that part of this crisis is created because we haven't  given the President the emergency funds he needs to quickly move people  out of facilities where they were never designed to be, into influx  facilities that we are trying to stand up, literally, right now. One of  these is going to be in my district.   We dealt with this, by the way, in 2014. We did it with President  Obama; supported it; gave him the funds he needed; a Republican House,  a Democratic Senate, and the President. He got that money in 24 days.  One of those facilities was set up in my district.   Again, we don't like using military bases in this way; don't approve  of it; but we understand that President Obama faced an emergency  situation, and we gave him the tools and the resources he needed to  deal with that. That needs to happen now.   Frankly, what we are seeing in the House is quite a contrast to the  Senate, which has a bill in the Appropriations Committee that was  reported out 30-1. It is bipartisan. It is a bill the President has  expressed a willingness to sign. We ought to be working with that  vehicle, if my friends can't get something to the floor to deal with  this urgent crisis now.   Madam Speaker, I would also, if I may, like to inform the Chair that  if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to immediately bring up Congressman Davis' Election Security  Assistance Act for consideration under an open rule.   This bill provides targeted and crucially needed resources to State  and local election administrators to help secure America's voting  infrastructure. Unlike the majority's partisan bill that takes over all  election operations and replaces local authority with a one-size-fits- all mandate from Washington, the Republican alternative provides needed  resources without stepping on the toes of State and local election  administrators.   It provides grants to States to update aging and at-risk election  infrastructure; provides security clearances to election officials to  facilitate the sharing of information about threats with frontline  officials; increases resources available to States and local  governments; and provides for hands-on assistance, as needed.   Madam Speaker, we all agree that our elections need to be protected,  and we all agree that more resources and more assets are necessary to  accomplish that goal. But rather than pushing a complicated mandate  from Washington that wastes taxpayer dollars and eliminates the  tradition of State and local control over the election operations, we  can do better by providing resources for security improvements and  reinforcements for local officials with the minimum additional  regulation.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), my good friend, the author of the  legislation in question.    Madam Speaker, to quote my friend, ``give me a break.'' The  last Republican Congress appropriated roughly $300 million for election  security, point 1.   Point 2, we have no evidence anybody hacked any election machines, as  my friend, Mr. Davis pointed out in 2016 or 2018. If you want to  respond to the Russians, you probably ought to respond to what they  did, not to what they didn't do or didn't succeed in doing.   I would actually argue this administration did a lot more than the  last administration. You have got a larger military today, partly  because of what the Russians did. You have a reinvigorated NATO today.  You have a President who actually sent lethal aid to Ukraine today.   You want to get the Russians' attention? That is the way you get it.  When you lay down a red line in Syria, you enforce the red line. This  administration has been a lot tougher on Russia than the last  administration, which, by the way, knew this was going on, did almost  nothing to alert anybody or to stop anybody; and now, are trying to  blame it on the person that was actually involved in the election, our  current President, for their lapse when they were actually in power in  the executive branch.   So this idea that nobody wants to defend our elections is not true.  And, frankly, I will take some offense because I have never said that  the Russians didn't matter, or that our elections weren't serious or  weren't threatened. I used to be a State election board secretary. I  used to sit on the Board of Directors for the election board  secretaries around the country, and the oldest public body that there  is, or the oldest association of public officials there is in this  country; very bipartisan, by the way, extraordinarily well-run. They  don't agree with this bill.   I would just ask every Member to call their local Secretary of State  or election administrator, whatever they have, and go through the bill  and say, did you want to cede this much authority to the Congress of  the United States; or do you think you do a pretty good job of running  your own election?                                time  1300    I know in my State, we do a very good job of running our elections,  and that has been true under Democrats and true under Republicans. I  think that is true around the country.   The other thing is if you want to actually do something before the  2020 election, then whether you like it or not, you are going to have  to do something that is bipartisan, because this will not get through  the Senate and this will not become law, and that makes it a rather  pointless exercise.   Sometimes in the legislative process, you sit down, and in Mr. Davis,  I will tell you, you have a willing partner and a person who has a  reputation in this body that I think is exceptionally bipartisan and  who is working, I think, in good faith on this very problem, and you  work through the problem.   But if it is going to be a partisan my-way-or-the-highway approach-- remember, this is coming under a closed rule, there is not even an  amendment made in order here--then it is not likely to get out of this  Chamber.   So if you are serious about trying to protect the elections, you  would. You may not get everything you want, but  [[Page H5096]]  in divided government, you have to work together to get things done.   That is the problem with almost every major initiative that our  Democratic friends have brought to the floor since they have been in  the majority.   Sorry. The Constitution is pretty clear. The Senate gets to decide  whether or not they are going to accept what we do over here or do  something different. The President has a part in this process.   We had to endure this when we first became the majority. We had a  Republican House, we had a Democratic Senate, we had a Democratic  President.   I don't have any problem with my friends bringing their agenda to the  floor. I applaud them for doing it. They ran on it. It is perfectly  appropriate.   A lot of times we bring that agenda to the floor knowing we can get  it across this Chamber, but we are not going to probably get it all the  way through the process unless we change it some.   What we haven't seen yet is any evidence that the new majority has  any ability to work with the current majority or the current President.  And if that is what they want to do for 18 months, score political  points as opposed to actually legislate something in a compromise  manner, they are free to do that, too, but it is not going to work.   If the aim here is to make our elections more secure, then I wouldn't  bring a bill with a closed rule. I would work with the other side,  knowing that their very concerns are probably going to be similar to  the concerns expressed in the United States Senate and by the President  of the United States.   So, you know, that is an unsolicited piece of personal and political  advice to my friends, but I think if they follow it, they will actually  have some success legislatively and will actually get some things done.   We are going to disagree about a lot of things. The American people  will sort that out in rather short order, about 18 months, but we ought  to try to get the things we can do today done.   This is an area I think we could work together in if we approached it  in a different manner.   I would also hope we could do the same thing on the southern border,  Madam Speaker. That is an impending emergency right now. We are going  to run out of money right now. So let's get that at least taken care of  while we sort out our differences in other areas.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  make a quick point, and then I want to move to my friend from Illinois.   Madam Speaker, I don't argue about constitutional power, but I argue  about process.   Look, I seriously doubt my friends have spent very much time talking  to election board secretaries and election administration officials  around the country. Had they done so, they would have heard, I am sure,  uniformly that they don't want a one-size-fits-all made system from  Washington, D.C. They don't want to throw away equipment that they  think is better than what we are offering them or that they have  already invested millions of dollars in.   They are happy to work with us. They are happy to inform us and  testify. That is not what is happening here.   This is the idea: all wisdom is in this Chamber, evidently, because  it is not going to get through the Senate, it is not going to get  signed by the President. We haven't talked to the people that actually  are the front-line people in defending us in this process, and that is  the folks at the State and the local level.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Illinois.    Madam Speaker, could I inquire, I am prepared to close  whenever my friend is. If he has additional speakers, I will just  reserve.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I would like to begin by just submitting for the  Record the views of the National Disability Rights Network, which  actually came out against this legislation because they believe it will  make it more difficult for people with physical impairments to actually  get to the polls and vote. I know that is not the intention of my  friend on the other side, but that is the effect of one-size-fits-all  voting.  [[Page H5098]]                                                 National Disability                                                  Rights Network,                                                      June 25, 2019.      Hon. Zoe Lofgren,      Chairwoman, House Administration Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Rodney Davis,      Ranking Member, House Administration Committee, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairwoman Lofgren and Ranking Member Davis: The       National Disability Rights Network (NDRN) writes today to       express our concerns with the impact of H.R. 2722, the       Securing America's Federal Election (SAFE) Act, on voters       with disabilities. While improvements have been made to the       legislation as it has moved through the legislative process,       we continue to remain concerned that, taken as a whole, the       bill will negatively impact voters with disabilities.        NDRN is the voluntary membership association for Protection       and Advocacy        (P&A) and Client Assistance Program        (CAP) agencies. The P&A and CAP agencies are a nationwide       network of congressionally mandated, cross disability       organizations operating in every state in the United States,       the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S.       Territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands,       and the US Virgin Islands). There is also a P&A and CAP       affiliated with the Native American Consortium which includes       the Hopi, Navajo, and San Juan Southern Paiute Nations       located in the Four Corners region of the Southwest.        The P&A/CAP Network has the authority to provide legally       based advocacy services and legal representation to all       people with disabilities. P&As and CAPs pursue legal,       administrative, and other appropriate remedies under all       applicable federal and state laws to protect and advocate for       the rights of people with disabilities. Through the       Protection and Advocacy for Voter Access (PAVA) program, P&As       provide advocacy to voters with disabilities on all facets of       the election system. Collectively, the P&A/CAP Network is the       largest provider of legally based advocacy services to people       with disabilities in the United States.        Following a contentious presidential election and       investigation into foreign interference with the electoral       process, the national public discourse on American democracy       has understandably turned to voting security. NDRN believes       that action to protect the security of our votes is necessary       to ensure the health of our electoral system. However, the       need to create accurate and secure elections must be balanced       with protecting access to the vote for all eligible       Americans. Voting systems that rely on an electorate capable       of independently marking and verifying a paper ballot have       become a preferred solution to protecting vote security.       Understandably, if all voters are able to mark their ballots       privately and independently, and visually verify that the       completed paper ballot is correct, elections officials could       routinely audit election results that are verified to have       captured voter intent. Yet, the ability to privately and       independently mark, and visually verify, and then cast a       paper ballot is simply not an option for all voters.        We have three concerns with the latest version of the SAFE       Act. First, by mandating that only voters with disabilities       can use ballot marking devices (BMDs) you are segregating       voters with disabilities away from the entire pool of voters       by making them the only group of people that use a particular       type of voting machine. Federally mandated segregation is       problematic alone. Additionally, this increases the       likelihood that poll workers will not be properly trained on       the machine, the machine not working, and if the one machine       breaks, there will be no alternative option. It will also       saddle poll workers with determining who is ``disabled       enough'' to use the BMD, a decision for which they have no       qualifications or legal right.        Second, by not requiring that the ballot marked with a BMD       be identical to the hand marked ballot, you are removing the       right of the voter with a disability to cast a private       ballot. It is possible that some smaller precincts may only       have one person with a disability that votes, making it       extremely easy to identify how the person voted. But even       where there might be tens or hundreds of people with       disabilities voting, elections personnel should not be able       to look at the ballots and know how people with disabilities       voted.        Third, assuming BMDs fully solved the accessibility issues       around marking a ballot (which they do not for all voters       with a disability) the so called solution continues to ignore       the accessibility issues around verification and the casting       of the ballot, two necessary steps in the voting process.       While some may argue that the BMDs address accessibility,       there is nothing that addresses the ability of a person with       a disability to independently and privately verify and       ultimately cast their ballot. BMDs are not the accessibility       panacea that makes federally mandated paper based voting work       for people with disabilities.        Security of our elections is an issue that is crucial to       the health of our democracy and must not be taken lightly.       Likewise, a private and independent vote is the law of the       land, and an electoral system that knowingly denies the right       to vote to any of its eligible citizens to appease others is       simply not a democracy. NDRN firmly believes that all       Americans, including people with disabilities, want secure,       accurate, and fair elections, but not at the expense of the       right to vote for people with disabilities. The SAFE Act is       an important first step in this national discourse, but the       concerns expressed above must be addressed before this       legislation can become the law of the land.        Thank you for your work on this important topic, and should       you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact       Eric Buehlmann, Deputy Executive Director for Public Policy.            Sincerely,                                                       Curt Decker,                                                Executive Director.     Madam Speaker, my friend is not impressed, and that is a  fair statement, and I don't question my friend ever, but I am not  impressed with legislation that can't become law because it is futile.  We come down here with a lot of sound and fury, but we don't get  anything done.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge opposition to this rule. This rule  will make in order for consideration two bills: H.R. 3351 and H.R.  2722.   The first is a partisan appropriations bill that is marked to an  unrealistic number that does not reflect agreement with Republicans or  the Senate and that includes partisan policy riders that must come out  before this bill can become law.   Not to be outdone, H.R. 2722 is even more partisan, throwing out the  traditional ability of States and localities to manage their own  election procedures and, instead, imposing a one-size-fits-all  regulatory regime direct from Washington, D.C. like H.R. 1 before it,  this bill was produced without Republican input and, instead, reflects  only the partisan motivations of the current majority.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question, ``no'' on the rule, and ``no'' on the underlying measures.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and  I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today on our second rule of the day. This  one is on a supplemental appropriations bill for the southern border.  While the Rules Committee met to consider this bill last night and took  testimony on it, due to some reported revolts in the Democratic Caucus,  we did not actually report this bill out last night.   Instead, we met on this bill at 5:30 this afternoon and reported it  to the floor 10 minutes later, using the same-day authority that  Chairman McGovern has so often referred to as martial law.   Our emergency meeting this afternoon includes several last-minute  changes in the bill that have provided little opportunity for anyone on  either side of the aisle to actually review. Tragically, that is the  story of this bill: last-minute changes made on short notice in an  attempt to push through a partisan agenda at the expense of not only  deliberation and consideration by the House of Representatives but,  more importantly, at the expense of innocent children.    H.R. 3401 is a supplemental appropriations bill providing funding for  the humanitarian crisis on the southern border. When it comes to H.R.  3401, I have good news and bad news.   The good news is that the Democrats finally agree that we need a  supplemental appropriations funding bill for the southern border after  Republicans have been sounding the alarm for months. The fact is, as my  friends know, the President first requested assistance in this matter  on May 1, almost 2 months ago.   A lot of the crisis at the border is because my friends simply didn't  discharge their responsibilities. If you are the guy that is supposed  to pay for the toothpaste and the soap, and you don't, you have some  measure of responsibility when they are not delivered on time.   There is actually some more good news here. There is a real  opportunity  [[Page H5140]]  for us to produce a bipartisan, bicameral bill that can become law.   The bad news is that H.R. 3401 is not that bill. In here, the  majority is once again making no pretense to even pretending to work  with the minority.   H.R. 3401 contains several partisan provisions.   It fails to provide supplemental funding for the Department of  Defense despite the significant resources the military has expended  responding to this crisis.   It includes partisan policy riders that tie the hands of the  administration and fail to provide the flexibility necessary for the  government to adequately address the crisis.   Most notably, this bill was produced without any Republican input at  all.   Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate what I said a moment ago. Both  Republicans and now Democrats agree that there is a need for a  supplemental appropriations bill. Why the majority failed to take  advantage of the opportunity this agreement provides, I don't know.   Until the majority chooses to work with Republicans on this and  produce a bipartisan bill, I fear we will simply be heading down the  exact same path we have trodden so often before in this Congress, with  the House pushing yet another piece of partisan legislation that will  not pass the Senate and will not be signed into law by the President.  That is disappointing, to say the least.   Mr. Speaker, this state of affairs could and should have been  avoided. Instead of pushing three partisan bills this week, the  majority could have chosen to work with Republicans to craft bipartisan  bills to address all three of these problems.   Even if that did not come to pass, the majority at the Rules  Committee could have worked with us to make minority amendments in  order and to give all Members an opportunity to fix these flawed bills  on the floor, or at least be heard. That they did not is merely yet  another indication of where the majority's priorities lie, with pushing  partisan bills to score political points and avoiding doing the hard  work of actually making law.   There is a chance to change this, Mr. Speaker, but in order to do so,  the majority needs to decide whether they are here to score political  points or if they are here to make law.   I remind my friends on the other side, passing a bill that is a  partisan bill through this Chamber won't solve the problem. I  congratulate them on having a vehicle to go to conference. That is a  good thing. But when they get there, they are going to find out they  are going to have to do something they haven't done, frankly,  throughout their tenure in the majority, and that is actually sit down  and compromise with people on the other side of the aisle and work with  the administration.   I hope they prove up to that task because if they don't, we will have  exactly the same result--that is, legislation passing here but not  succeeding in the other Chamber.   That will not solve the crisis on the border. It will exacerbate it.   Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Woodall), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard some pretty harsh words about the  administration's failure to respond. The reality is the administration  asked 2 months ago of our friends who were slow to respond.   The administration warned us of what would happen, and it is  unfolding  [[Page H5142]]  in front of our eyes, and it is unfolding because of the failure of  Democrats in the House to actually take it seriously.   Let's go back to the rhetoric at the time: it is a manufactured  crisis; it is not real; it is all made up.   That turned out to be a bad mistake, and it set us back weeks in this  Chamber getting to where we finally are beginning to get a response.   Frankly, our friends simply couldn't get their act together on this  for a while. I am glad they are beginning to do that now.   But let's also look at a little history, Mr. Speaker.   This problem isn't new. What is new is the slowness to respond. We  faced this very same problem when we were in the majority and President  Obama was in office in 2014. He asked for $3.7 billion. He got it  within 24 days, and he got it without a lot of extraneous conditions  added on it. That is exactly the opposite of the manner in which our  friends on the other side are responding at the last minute. But they  are responding, and for that I give them some credit.   But again, what is new is the slowness of response, the unwillingness  to work with the other Chamber, and the unwillingness to work with the  President to meet an emergency that he warned us was coming 2 months  ago.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional  30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), my good friend and fellow member  of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Arizona an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to briefly yield myself such time  as I may consume to make a quick point.   My friend is saying there is no money for Border Patrol and the  military. Whose custody do you think those children are in for the  first couple of days?   The problems are actually at those facilities. They have not been  identified at Health and Human Services, other than they are just  simply too full because my friends have spent so much time arguing  about this rather than giving the administration the money that it  asked for in a timely fashion, 2 months ago.  [[Page H5144]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), my very good friend, fellow Rules Committee member, and  distinguished doctor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Spano).    I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman from  Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to immediately bring up H.R. 3056, the Border Crisis Supplemental  Appropriations Act of 2019.   Unlike the bill before us today, H.R. 3056 provides all the necessary  funding that the administration has requested to address the  humanitarian crisis on the southern border. The bill provides funding  for the Department of Defense, which has expended significant resources  responding to the crisis. It also provides the funding for refugee and  entrant assistance and for U.S. Customs and Border Protection that the  administration has requested and has told us is necessary to meet the  crisis.   Most notably, this bill does so without adding any of the partisan  riders that plague the majority's version of the supplemental. We can  provide funding to meet this crisis without tying the hands of the  administration and leaving them no wiggle room or flexibility.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Gonzalez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to begin by telling my good friend how much I respect him, how  much I admire him. I know how passionate he is on the issue of the  children. No doubt about that.   I also want to tell my friend that I think, 8 weeks ago, we should  have been acting on this. We were told there wasn't a crisis, and there  wasn't a serious effort on the other side.   Last night, when my friends were struggling to find the votes,  frankly, we could have delivered a lot of votes. Instead, they moved  the bill further to the left to placate the most extreme elements in  their own conference. I think that is going to make to it much harder  to come to a deal eventually with the Senate and with the  administration.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge opposition to this rule. The rule  will make in order consideration of H.R. 3401, a supplemental  appropriations bill that could have been a bipartisan bill. Instead,  the majority chose to make it partisan, failing to fund the national  security elements of the border crisis, including partisan policy  riders that tie the hands of the administration.   Not to be outdone, the majority also pushed through last-minute  changes, using the same-day rule authority that had not been adequately  considered by anyone on either side of the aisle.   Let me just reiterate, for the record, to reinforce the point my  friend Mrs. Lesko made. Look, we got this bill at 4:57. We convened the  Rules Committee at 5:30.   I can read things, but I can't always understand everything, let  alone research everything in 33 minutes. We haven't got a single  opportunity to offer a single amendment to this bill.   That is unfortunate, and I don't think it is a process that is likely  to lead to a successful outcome.   Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by urging my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on the previous question, to vote ``no'' on the rule, to vote  ``no'' on the underlying measure.   Let's go to work on a bipartisan bill. Let's meet all the requests  the administration has asked for, in terms of resources. Give them the  flexibility they need to do the job and recognize this is not a new  problem.   We dealt with it, frankly, pretty successfully when President Obama  was here by giving them the resources and the flexibility they needed.  I am sorry my friends are not extending that same courtesy to the  current President.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
