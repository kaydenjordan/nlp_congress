 Mr. President, I have a motion to commit at the desk,  and I ask that it be reported.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of  debate equally divided.    Mr. President, my amendment would prohibit the Small  Business Administration from providing any assistance including, but  not limited to, Paycheck Protection Program 7(a) loans or other small  business assistance to anyone who has been convicted during the past 15  years of a felony during and in connection with a riot, a civil  disorder, or another declared disaster. Without order, there can be no  justice.    Mr. President, it is a felony for rioting. We shouldn't  be giving them money.
