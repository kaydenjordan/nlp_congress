 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to proudly recognize Lexmark  International, a global leader in printing solutions headquartered in  Lexington, Kentucky, for its development of an innovative program for  training U.S. veterans and soon-to-be-separated Active Duty personnel  with the goal that they can become certified service technicians of  Lexmark printers.   The program, called the Lexmark Printer Service Training Partnership,  is under the auspices of VALORR, the Veterans Association of Lexmark:  Organized to Recognize and Respect.   We all recognize that our veterans bring with them tremendous know- how and a can-do attitude, the ability to step into new fields and  master them quickly. By completing the printer  [[Page H5192]]  service training program, these veterans will be certified to service  Lexmark printers worldwide.   I am proud that my constituents at Lexmark have developed such a  thoughtful program for veterans. I hope my colleagues will join me in  recognizing those companies and organizations going the extra mile for  those who have served our Nation in uniform.                            ____________________
