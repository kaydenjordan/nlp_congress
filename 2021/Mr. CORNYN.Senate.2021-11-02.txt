 Mr. President, in watching from the sidelines and since  we are not directly involved and because the Democrats decided to go it  alone, our Democratic colleagues appear to be playing a game of whack- a-mole to keep their reckless tax-and-spending spree from falling  apart.   After months and months of intra-party negotiating--again, talking  among themselves, not to us--they hit the gas pedal last week when they  knew that President Biden was going to the U.N. Climate Summit in  Glasgow, Scotland, and they wanted to give him something that he could  actually deliver on.   So, last Friday, they finally settled on a framework, but the cracks  quickly began to show. We don't even have a pricetag on this proposal,  but some have estimated its cost at $1.75 trillion--an absolutely  staggering amount of money. The truth is no one knows because the bill  hasn't even been finalized yet, much less scored by congressional  scorekeepers.   Unsurprisingly, yesterday, one of our colleagues, the Senator from  West Virginia, expressed some of his skepticism about the proposal; and  I imagine more are in the wings, wringing their hands in private. After  all, this bill spends trillions of dollars on radical priorities that  are out of step with where most Americans are: expanded healthcare  subsidies; handouts for labor unions; government-funded childcare; and  an all-out attack on American-made, affordable energy.   On Friday, the President touted the $555 billion that this agreement  would put forward to support clean energy efforts, but these, upon  further inspection, are mainly subsidies--taxpayer subsidies--for  corporations and the well-off.   I am reminded of France's yellow jacket protests a few years ago. In  2018, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in  Paris to protest a hike in gas taxes. At the time, President Macron  said the increase was critical to pushing the French people to buy  cleaner vehicles, but for most hard-working families, pricey electric  vehicles simply were not and are not an option. The yellow jackets felt  disenfranchised by the urban elite, saying leaders were talking about  the end of the world while they were worried about the end of the  month.   It sounds pretty familiar. Here in the United States, families are  being pounded by inflation. Prices are going up on everything from  groceries to home appliances. Gas prices alone have gone up 60 percent  from just 1 year ago, and families are doing their best to prepare for  an expensive winter. Energy bills are expected to soar by as much as 54  percent.   Despite the serious financial strain that families are feeling, our  Democratic colleagues are pushing policies that will drive up those  costs even more.   But here is the real kicker: Often under these proposed policies, the  wealthiest of Americans will stand to benefit the most on the backs of  hard-working American families.   One of the most clear-cut examples is the aggressive push toward  subsidizing electric vehicles, which are among the most expensive cars  on the market. Now, with 280 million cars on the road, only 2 percent  of which are electric vehicles, this will not benefit most hard-working  American families. It will benefit those who can afford these expensive  vehicles, and the cherry on top is the up to $12,500 taxpayer subsidy  that will help those wealthy Americans buy these expensive vehicles  that are out of reach for most hard-working families.   It doesn't matter if the vehicle is completely or substantially made  in China, for example, or if the buyer makes hundreds of thousands of  dollars a year--they are still eligible for the tax credit. The most  generous benefit is reserved for vehicles built in--you guessed it-- union shops. We know the labor unions are among some of the biggest  supporters of our friends on the other side of the aisle, and they are  set to receive their reward. Buyers could receive up to a $12,500 tax  credit for purchasing an electric vehicle from a union shop.   I have nothing against union shops. I support people who choose to be  part of a labor union, but this idea that taxpayers should have to  underwrite a benefit that goes exclusively to one part of the electric  car business, to me, is offensive, and it is just unjustified.   I haven't seen any evidence either that union-made electric vehicles  are somehow more green than their nonunion-made competitors', but those  companies are certain to gain financial benefits because of these  generous taxpayer-funded handouts. Wealthy Americans and Big Labor win;  hard-working American families not so much.   Then there is a long list of government handouts to make homes more  energy efficient. Similar to those electric vehicles, the high cost of  retrofitting a home makes it infeasible for most families--certainly,  the middle-class families. Outfitting a home with solar panels will  cost you well over $10,000; and, of course, the bigger the house, the  more the cost.   The Biden administration is, once again, happy to let taxpayers  subsidize these expenditures. The Democrats' proposals include billions  of dollars in rebates and grants to help cover the cost of retrofitting  homes, even for the well-to-do, who will be the ones who will primarily  be able to afford, even with these subsidies, this sort of retrofit.   At the end of the day, the family with the means to spend thousands  of dollars on these products will spend less on their monthly  electricity bill, which I assume is the point, but everybody else will  pay more in taxes without having the benefit of a lower electricity  bill. If our colleagues on the other side of the aisle get their way,  monthly electricity prices are likely to increase for everyone else.   As I mentioned, gas prices are up significantly from last year. If  you filled up your pickup truck a year ago, today you will find out  that you will spend about $33 more for each tank of gas that you pump.  And energy prices for homes this winter are expected to go up as much  as 54 percent.   These are incredible numbers. This is what happens when you throw so  much money at limited goods and services--prices go up; inflation goes  up. It is a silent tax on people who must pay for these goods and  services and have nowhere else to turn.   With this as a backdrop, our Democratic colleagues have proposed to  raise taxes on energy companies and drive those prices even higher.  Now, only in a fantasy world can you impose greater costs through tax  increases on a business and not have them transferred directly to the  consumers who buy these goods and services. They are going to be passed  along to the people who pay for these goods and services.   This bill will include a new methane tax, which would require oil and  gas producers to pay hefty fees if they emit more methane than the  government allows.   Natural gas accounts for 40 percent of our electricity--double the  amount as renewable sources. Hitting those companies with a methane fee  and other proposed tax hikes isn't going to change the fact that we  need natural gas to keep the lights on.   By the way, we need natural gas in order to produce the electricity  that you use to charge your electric vehicle.   As we hope to move to cleaner forms of energy--obviously, coal being  the one that most of us believe emits the most emissions--moving to  natural gas just makes sense, and as a matter of fact, the United  States has reduced our emissions, not by banning access to any  particular energy source but by producing more natural gas.   If we need an example of what a natural gas shortage in America would  look like, just take a look at Europe. The supply shortage has caused  electricity prices in Europe to skyrocket, plus the fact that they have  banned the use of coal and even nuclear power, which is emissions-free.  But after the Fukushima nuclear meltdown and the  [[Page S7588]]  tsunami that followed, Europe basically decided to hang up on any  additional nuclear production. So natural gas prices, which are going  to sustain the greatest demand, will go up about 600 percent. Since the  start of the year, they have. The situation is so dire that utility  companies have switched from natural gas and now begin to burn coal and  fuel oil because they simply don't have access to enough natural gas.   This is the problem with the push to quickly move away from fossil  fuels before we are ready to transition into other types of energy  sources and when you punish the producers of that affordable energy.   Renewables, as laudable as they are--and in Texas, we are an ``all of  the above'' State. We produce more electricity from wind turbines than  any other State in the Nation. But renewables don't come close to  generating enough energy to power our world.   If the United States and our allies scale back production to pursue  arbitrary emission benchmarks, that leaves the world turning to  countries like Russia and organizations like OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia,  to provide that energy. So it is no wonder that Russia is a no-show at  the U.N. climate summit. They are actually the ones that will stand to  benefit the most if other countries eliminate fossil fuels from their  fuel mix because other countries around the world will have no choice  but to buy more and more Russian energy.   In his remarks yesterday, President Biden said we should view the  current price volatility as a call to action rather than a reason to  back off our clean energy goals. Well, I disagree. Families are being  pummeled by high prices across the board. We don't need to increase  that burden by driving up costs or potentially adding an energy crisis  to the mix.   As I said, Texas has always been a proud supporter of the ``all of  the above'' energy strategy. We are often recognized for the might of  our oil and gas sector. But a lot of folks don't know, as I said, that  Texas is a leader in wind energy. Well, we produce about one-quarter of  all the wind energy in the United States. If we were a country, we  would be the fifth-largest wind energy producer in the world. We don't  plan on stopping there. We are also making serious strides in energy  innovation through cutting-edge carbon capture and storage projects.   Texas is proof positive that we can strike a balance between  conservation, productivity, and economic power, and you can embrace  low-emission energy sources without hammering the middle class. But  those are not the types of proposals we see from the tax-and-spending  spree bill now pending before the House of Representatives. This bill  would simply drive up costs for hard-working American families, hurt  our energy independence, and benefit our adversaries.   This may impress President Biden's peers in Glasgow, but it is sure  to fall flat with the American people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
