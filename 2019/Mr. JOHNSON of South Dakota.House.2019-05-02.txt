 Mr. Speaker, in 1961, South Dakota's Ben  Reifel became our Nation's first Lakota Indian in Congress.   He grew up dirt poor in a log cabin in rural Todd County. He dropped  out after eighth grade but later graduated from South Dakota State and  from Harvard.   Ben Reifel was respected in this Chamber. That gentleman was  respected in Indian Country. You see, throughout his career at the  Bureau of Indian Affairs and for a decade here in Congress, he worked  tirelessly to further economic opportunity for American Indians. Ben  Reifel celebrated education, hard work, and self-determination.   Yesterday, I filed a bill asking that Ben Reifel's name be placed on  the Mission Post Office. It is my hope that young American Indian boys  and girls will see that name and realize that great American leaders  have come, and will come again, from that place.                            ____________________
