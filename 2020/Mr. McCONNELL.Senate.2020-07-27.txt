 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Today, as we speak, the U.S. Congress confers a rare  and high honor on a national hero who richly deserves it. Our  distinguished late colleague, Congressman John Lewis, is lying in state  in the Rotunda.   I had the honor to speak at this afternoon's ceremony--how amazing to  reflect on John's incredible American life. It began deep in the  segregated South, ran through lunch counters in Nashville, jail cells  in Mississippi, across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, up the steps of the  Lincoln Memorial, and brought him to the halls of Congress.   He made heroic contributions to our Nation's march toward racial  justice. He also brought an unforgettable example of moral urgency,  respect, and love to Washington that left an impact on everyone he met.  His example will be missed here in the Capitol. He will be remembered  forever by a grateful Nation because, as far as I am concerned, it is  not really the rest of us in Congress who are conveying an honor upon  John Lewis today, not this time. Rather, it is John who is bringing  greater honor to us, to this Capitol, with his presence, one final  time.                            ____________________     Madam President, COVID-19 has killed nearly 150,000  Americans. It has caused massive layoffs on a historic scale and left  17 million people out of work. It has thrown the lives and the  trajectories of our Nation's children and young adults into  uncertainty.   Our Nation stands now at an important crossroads in this battle.  American families' historic sacrifices brought our medical system  through  [[Page S4492]]  the springtime intact. The very early stages of our economic recovery  have been promising and our Nation needs to continue to proceed with a  smart and safe reopening.   At the same time, the virus is still with us. It is still spreading,  and it does not care about our fragile economic progress or our  frustration with restrictions, or anything else, besides infecting as  many people as possible.   So we have one foot in the pandemic and one foot in the recovery. The  American people need more help. They need it to be comprehensive, and  they need it to be carefully tailored to these crossroads.   That is what this Senate majority has assembled, and that is what  Chairmen Alexander, Blunt, Collins, Graham, Grassley, Rubio, and  Shelby, and Senators Cornyn and Romney are introducing today. They will  be coming to the floor shortly to introduce their components.   Together, their bills make up the HEALS Act--health, economic  assistance, liability protection, and schools--health, economic  assistance, liability protection, and schools.   Just like in March, with the CARES Act, Senate Republicans have  authored another bold framework to help our Nation. Now we need our  Democratic colleagues to reprise their part as well. They need to put  aside the partisan stonewalling we saw on police reform and rediscover  the spirit of urgency that got the CARES Act across the finish line,  and quickly join us around the negotiating table.   It will take bipartisan cooperation to make the HEALS Act into law  for the American people. The Senate will not waste time with pointless  partisanship. There is a reason why even Speaker Pelosi and Leader  Schumer themselves have publicly downplayed the multitrillion-dollar  socialist manifesto they published a few weeks back and have suggested  the real, serious discussion would begin when Republicans released our  outline.   We have produced a tailored and targeted draft that will cut right to  the heart of three distinct crises facing our country--getting kids  back in school, getting workers back to work, and winning the  healthcare fight against the virus--kids, jobs, and healthcare.   First, our Nation's kids. Chairmen Alexander, Blunt, and Shelby will  be introducing a sweeping package to help schools and universities  reopen safely. We are talking about more than $100 billion--more for an  education fund than House Democrats put aside in a bill that spent  multiple trillions. There are policies to help childcare providers and  schools have the flexibility they need to function.   Second, jobs. Since our Nation has one foot in the pandemic and one  foot in the recovery, our economic policies have to acknowledge both  sides of that coin. Chairman Grassley will introduce another round of  direct checks for households at the same amount as before, with even  more support for families who care for vulnerable adult dependents.   Chairmen Collins and Rubio have designed a sequel to their historic  PPP to help prevent more layoffs of American workers.   Republicans want to continue a Federal supplement to State  unemployment insurance. In fact, we will propose a weekly dollar amount  that is eight times what Democrats put in place when they controlled  the White House and Congress during the great recession. But we have to  do it in a way that does not slow down reopening.   We are also going to help this country pivot into recovery. The  American people don't just want relief; they want opportunity so long  as the reopenings can be safe. So Chairman Grassley will walk through  strong economic incentives to boost worker retention, get Americans  rehired, and help small businesses buy the PPE, testing, and supplies  that will protect employees and customers alike.   Senator Romney has legislation to help a future Congress ensure our  critical national trust funds remain strong.   In looking to our long-term jobs future, there is no question this  pandemic has America and our allies reexamining our degree of  dependence on China. Chairman Graham is introducing a package of  legislation that will incentivize PPE manufacturing right here at home.  It will ensure that our efforts to rebuild our national stockpile of  protective gear actually benefit American workers instead of just  stimulating China, and it will bring a heightened focus to other key  concerns, such as high-tech semiconductor manufacturing, critical  minerals, and intellectual property theft so that the lessons of this  pandemic do not go unlearned.   Finally, healthcare. Chairmen Alexander, Grassley, and others I have  already named have legislation to keep America on offense against this  virus for diagnostics, treatments, vaccines, hospitals and healthcare  workers, and protecting seniors who rely on Medicare from premium  spikes. Our legislation supports all of it at continued historic  levels.   In tying kids, jobs, and healthcare all together, Senator Cornyn has  authored strong legal liability protections so that nurses, doctors,  charities, school districts, colleges, and employers can spend their  next months actually reopening rather than fighting for their lives  against frivolous lawsuits. We will preserve accountability in the  event of gross negligence or intentional misconduct, but we are not  going to let trial lawyers throw a party on the backs of the frontline  workers and institutions that have fought this new enemy on the  frontlines.   Health, economic assistance, liability, and schools--another historic  package for the next phase of this historic national fight.   To make a law, bipartisan talks need to come next. So there is one  big question facing the country right now: Which version of our  distinguished Democratic colleagues are the American people about to  get? Are we going to get the Democratic Party we got in March, when our  colleagues met us in good-faith negotiations and worked with us to turn  our framework into a bipartisan product--the Democrats who helped us  pass the largest rescue package in American history without one  dissenting vote--or will the country get the Democratic Party we saw in  June, when our colleagues refused to suggest amendments or improvements  to Senator Tim Scott's police reform bill and chose to block the issue  altogether?   Their actions last month left some observers wondering whether the  Democrats had made this cynical choice to give up on bipartisan  legislation altogether right through November, whether the Democrats  had determined that strengthening our Nation with bipartisan action  might hurt their political odds and, therefore, it might suit their  fortunes better if pain and chaos simply continued. I hope that is  completely off base. I know our Democratic colleagues know this crisis  is still urgent. I know they know American families need more help.   I hope this strong proposal will occasion a real response, not  partisan cheap shots, not the predictable, tired, old rhetoric as  though these were ordinary times and the Nation could afford ordinary  politics. We cannot have a Senate minority decide in June it is done  legislating until November. The pandemic is not finished. The economic  pain is not finished, so Congress cannot be finished either.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
