 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the  Senate's version of the tax reform bill because this bill will hurt the  central coast in California.   By fully repealing the State and local tax deduction, 177,000  households in my district that deduct an average of $23,000 each year  will be hurt.   By repealing the student loan interest deduction, low- and middle- income students in my district will find college further out of reach  and will be hurt.   By allowing individual tax cuts to expire on people earning less than  $75,000, over 140,000 households in my district will see their taxes go  up and they will be hurt.   Now, with confirmation that the tax cuts will not pay for themselves  but will add over $1 trillion to our debt, this tax reform bill will be  a tax burden bill not only for my constituents in my district, but for  all of our constituents in our Nation. Worse, this bill will hurt  [[Page H9588]]  not only my two daughters, but all of our sons and daughters.   That is why I oppose the Senate bill, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.                            ____________________
