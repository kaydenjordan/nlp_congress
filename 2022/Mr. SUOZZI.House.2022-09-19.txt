 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for giving me the  opportunity to speak in support of H.R. 1433, the reauthorization of  the Helen Keller National Center for Youths and Adults Who Are Deaf- Blind in our country.   Let me start by thanking not only the chairman but Congressman Pocan  and all of my colleagues who, on a bipartisan basis, have shown  overwhelming support for this legislation and the national center.   The Helen Keller National Center for the Deaf-Blind, located in my  district, is the only center of its type anywhere in the Nation. People  from all over the country travel to the center for help, and they have  regional support centers, as well.   In my first 2 weeks in office, back in 2017, I visited the Helen  Keller National Center for the first time. I heard stories from people  whose lives were changed and whose families' lives were changed because  of the miracles that were brought into their lives by this exceptional  national treasure.   People's lives have been changed dramatically because of the work of  this center supported by this Congress for 55 years, since 1967. We  need to continue to support the center.   I thank my colleagues for the great work that they have done in  supporting it and continuing to increase its funding year after year.  Let us keep working together on a bipartisan basis to serve the people  of our country, especially this vulnerable population. Imagine what it  would be like to be deaf and blind.    This is truly a national treasure, and I thank my colleagues for  their support.
