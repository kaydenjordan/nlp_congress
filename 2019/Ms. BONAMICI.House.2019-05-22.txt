 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise today to offer an amendment to  H.R. 1500, the Consumers First Act.   I thank Chairwoman Waters and my colleagues for their leadership in  restoring essential functions of the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau, which this administration so recklessly rolled back.   During my years of work as a consumer protection attorney, I learned  firsthand how strong consumer protection laws help to keep Americans  financially secure. This administration's efforts to weaken the CFPB  have harmed millions of people across the country, including young  consumers and student borrowers.   I commend my colleagues for including in the original bill the  restoration of the CFPB's Office of Students and Young Consumers, which  this administration closed last year. Shutting down this office  diminished the CFPB's mission and weakened its enforcement  capabilities.   Before its closure, this office returned more than $750 million to  students and student loan borrowers through actions against  unscrupulous student loan servicers. They also helped more than 60,000  borrowers who submitted complaints about the student loan industry to  the CFPB.   Notably, in January of 2017, the CFPB and the Office of Students and  Young Consumers stood up to the Nation's largest student loan servicer,  Navient, for misallocating payments and improperly steering borrowers  away from income-based repayment plans.   The amendment I am offering today with my colleague, Congressman  Harley Rouda, would build on this office's critical role in protecting  young consumer students and student loan borrowers. This amendment  would require the Assistant Director and Student Loan Ombudsman of the  newly restored Office of Students and Young Consumers to issue an  annual report to Congress on risks to young consumers and student  borrowers.   Specifically, this report would analyze complaints that were  submitted to the CFPB in the previous year by young consumers and  student borrowers and offer an independent evaluation of the risks to  this population as a result of policies and practices in the consumer  financial products and services marketplace. This report will help us  understand the risks that our young consumers and borrowers face, and  it will help inform the work of Congress on how to best fight back  against those who seek to prey on our Nation's young people.   I ask my colleagues to support this important amendment that will  help students, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman for his  bipartisan support. This is an issue that we all hear about from our  constituents.   As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I know that we are  working hard on affordable higher education; but, in the meantime, we  need to make sure that we are aware of the problems that so many  student loan borrowers have. This amendment will help us get the  information through a report, and I appreciate that this will help us  inform our approach here in Congress, as well as get a better  understanding of the practices of student loan services.                                time  1445    Again, I thank the gentleman for his bipartisan support, I thank  Chairwoman Waters for her support of the amendment, I urge all of my  colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
