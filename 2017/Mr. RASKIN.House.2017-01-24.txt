 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 7.   A few days ago, millions of Americans made history by marching for  freedom and equality against an administration that keeps threatening  to grab women by their privacy rights. H.R. 7 now tries to make it  impossible for millions of women, like my constituents in Maryland, to  have an abortion, even when their health is at stake and even to the  point of manipulating the tax laws to force private insurers in the ACA  not to offer complete coverage.   Here in Washington, D.C., the only capital of a democracy on Earth  where residents are denied voting representation in their national  legislature, this extreme legislation constitutes a special assault on  liberty. The hundreds of thousands of taxpaying citizens living in D.C.  have decided, like the people of Maryland, to offer Medicaid funding  for poor women to have complete coverage. This legislation strips this  modicum of democracy away in the District of Columbia, combining a  cavalier attack on democracy with a vicious attack on health care.   If a foreign repressive power like Russia tried to deny women in our  Capital City complete medical coverage, we would consider it an act of  aggression against the United States. As a Representative from  Maryland, the Free State, I reject this outrageous attempt to deprive  women of their constitutionally protected choices, and as the next-door  neighbor of the good people of Washington, D.C., I reject this brutal  attack on democracy and health care.
