 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the discharge  petition that was signed by me today on this floor, as well as 189  total Members of this House, and a special thank you to Representative  Ann Wagner and Whip   Steve Scalise for their great work on this issue.   This discharge petition is to force consideration of the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act, known  [[Page H2975]]  as H.R. 962, which so far has been blocked by the majority in this  House.   I am willing to bet most Americans assume that doctors and nurses  would do everything they can to help a baby who has somehow  miraculously survived an abortion. You would be surprised and saddened  to know that that is not always the case.   In 2002, Congress recognized the simple fact that an infant who  survives an abortion is, indeed, a person. So why is there still no  legal protection for those newborn babies who have been born alive  after a failed abortion attempt?   It is past time to hold abortion providers accountable for ensuring  the best possible care for any newborn baby regardless of whether that  baby happens to survive an abortion. We must vote to protect the  sanctity of newborns, and I hope the American people will call their  Member of Congress and have them sign on to this discharge petition and  support this act.                            ____________________
