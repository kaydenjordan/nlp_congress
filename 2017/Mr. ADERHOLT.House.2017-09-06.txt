 Mr. Chairman, it is my distinct honor to bring the  fiscal year 2018 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies bill before you today as part of  the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act.   I do want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen for his commitment to the  annual appropriations process. Under his steadfast leadership, the  House is scheduled to vote on all 12 appropriations bills, which is an  extraordinary achievement.   I would also like to thank Ranking Member Lowey and Ranking Member  Bishop for their cooperative spirit. Mr. Bishop is the new ranking  member for the Agriculture Subcommittee, and I have enjoyed working  with him over the past several months as we have moved forward to try  to help rural America and rural communities.   The Agriculture Appropriations bill responsibly targets funds to  national programs that provide the most benefit to the American people  and to the United States economy. The bill received bipartisan support  throughout the process, even though much of the funding and policies  reflect a conservative policy.   The overall total for both discretionary and mandatory spending in  the bill equals $144.9 billion. That is $4.1 billion above the  President's request and $8.6 billion below the FY17 enacted level. The  bill includes $20 billion in discretionary budget authority, which is  $1.1 billion below the FY17 enacted level when adjusting for the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The mandatory funds in this bill  support USDA's farm production, conservation, crop insurance, and  nutrition programs.   I would like to thank all the Members who have submitted requests and  gave input as we have moved forward and crafted this legislation.  Knowing what programs Members are interested in has helped us direct  funding to support rural communities across the country and also combat  animal and plant pests and disease threats, promote U.S. agricultural  exports, support food safety and medical product safety, provide U.S.  commodities to those in need overseas, and address the critical needs  of research.    We protected our most vulnerable populations in this bill by  providing funding for all of USDA's nutrition programs at levels that  ensure all eligible participants will receive the nutrition assistance  that they need. We made sure that the farm loan programs will meet  current estimates of demand during the current economic downturn in  several areas of the farm economy.   Furthermore, the bill provides $5.2 billion to the Food and Drug  Administration, including the preservation of nearly $2.8 billion in  discretionary resources to assist the FDA in protecting and promoting  public health. The bill continues to support the food safety activities  associated with the Food Safety Modernization Act and provides $60  million in new funds to the 21st Century Cures Act.   In closing, I would like to especially thank the staff on the  Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, my personal staff, the  minority staff, and Mr. Bishop's staff.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate, again, the bipartisan  cooperation that went into crafting this bill. It is very important.   Mr. Chair, I would ask my colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.  Young) for the purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, I am very sympathetic to the gentleman  from Iowa's concerns regarding the reduction in the bill's mandatory  energy programs in the farm bill, in particular, the Rural Energy for  America Program.   The gentleman from Iowa is indeed a valued member of our  subcommittee, and he was very instrumental in developing many parts of  the overall bill, and I appreciate his input greatly.   A number of factors went into our decision for which programs to  reduce in order to achieve the $1.1 billion reduction in the bill's  funding level over this last year.   As I did mention, as he noted, in our full committee markup, I  committed to working with the gentleman from Iowa to see where we could  find alternative offsets, and we will continue to do that as we move  forward. So I thank the gentleman for bringing this to our attention  again here on the floor of the House.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 500, as the  designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen, I offer amendments en bloc.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 6, 2017, on page H7035, the following appeared:  Mr.  Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 500, as the designee of  Chairman Frelinghuysen, I offer    ========================= END NOTE =========================    [[Page H7036]]     Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the executive order on National Ocean Policy  is an Obama administration policy. It lacks clear statutory authority.  Instead of streamlining Federal management, it potentially adds layers  of additional bureaucracy and Federal overreach.   The National Ocean Policy has the potential to harm both terrestrial  and marine economic values by affecting sectors such as agriculture,  fishing, construction, manufacturing, oil, gas, and renewable energy,  among others.   This body has taken the position in the past to pause the  implementation of the executive order on the National Ocean Policy as  this uncertainty continues around the meaning of the policy, how will  we implement it, and the unintended consequences.   The policy was developed unilaterally by the prior administration  without involving or consulting with Congress.   Additionally, the Natural Resources Committee has expressed concern  about the policy, as did a letter signed by over 80 groups supporting  the provision in the underlying bill. We are not saying that ocean  policy in general does not make sense or is something that we could not  support.   My home State of Alabama is a coastal State. All I am saying is that  I think we need to revisit this policy, take a bottom-up approach by  working with stakeholders, and have something work its way through  Congress.   Working to resolve ocean management challenges should be nonpartisan  and something that this Congress could achieve; therefore, I oppose the  amendment and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. I  agree, it appears that the Grain Inspection, Packers & Stockyards  Administration, known as GIPSA, is not currently implementing a  provision from the 2015 Grain Standards Act Reauthorization.   Despite the efforts of my colleagues to try and work with the USDA to  correct this interpretation, the agency continues down a path of  unravelling a longstanding agreement that has allowed a designated  official grain inspector to carry out inspections in another geographic  area.   I hope this amendment sends a clear message to the Department that  they are not following congressional intent, and they should reverse  course.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his continuous work on this  issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise to support the gentleman's amendment.  Each year, the Federal Government requires Davis-Bacon provisions on  all sorts of constructions--as has already been mentioned, roads,  bridges, dams, buildings, and the taxpayers pay more. You do the math.  According to a recent study, Davis-Bacon inflates costs by 22 percent  for construction costs. These added expenses come at a time when our  Nation is nearly broke.    Therefore, I think it is time to put the taxpayers first, and I  encourage my fellow Members to support this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. I  believe that schools should have more  [[Page H7041]]  local control in operating their meal programs, including the  establishment of the price a family must pay for the meal. School meal  prices differ from one community to the next, and they take into  account local food and local labor costs and what families are willing  and able to pay. I think it is always best to let the local schools  make those decisions.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the gentlewoman's  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment, which has gained bipartisan support in our full committee. I  am very sympathetic to the gentleman's concerns, and I trust his  judgment an his experience as, currently, the only pharmacist that is  serving in the House of Representatives.    This bill language is similar to the language in our House report.  While the underlying bill did not go as far as limiting funds to be  spent on the finalization, implementation, or enforcement of the  proposed memorandum of  [[Page H7042]]  understanding between the FDA and the States, our committee report  language is conditional in that the FDA should not finalize the  proposed rule if it fails to distinguish between distribution and  dispensing a compounded product to a specific patient.   Dispensing is not defined in the Drug Quality and Security Act, and  the FDA should not unilaterally take it upon themselves to start  regulating the practice of pharmacy since this function is regulated by  the State Boards of Pharmacy under the laws of the State legislatures.  Therefore, I support the intent of this amendment until FDA clarifies  its policy, and I recommend the amendment's approval.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment here. I support what the gentleman is doing with this  amendment. I also appreciate his willingness to make a slight change to  the amendment in order to maintain support from staff in embassies  across the world that help USDA staff open markets to U.S. goods.   With that being said, I would like to urge my colleagues to support  his amendment.
