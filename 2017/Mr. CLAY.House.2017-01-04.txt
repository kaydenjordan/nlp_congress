 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act builds upon two existing laws that  came through the Oversight and Government Reform Committee: the  Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010 and the  DATA Act, which was signed into law in 2014.                                time  1245    The Obama administration launched the performance.gov Web site to  implement the GPRA Modernization Act, and this bill would enhance the  information available through that Web site.   The bill would require the Office of Management and Budget to make  available on a central Web site an inventory of all Federal agency  programs that have a budget authority of more than $1 million.   I thank Representative Walberg for making changes to help address  those concerns in the version of the bill before us today. It is  important that we continue to work together to ensure the bill will  work as intended.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank my long-time friend Representative Duncan and Ranking Member  Cummings for sponsoring this bill. Representative Duncan first  sponsored a bill to improve Presidential libraries 17 years ago. I hope  we can now, finally, get this important legislation enacted.   The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act would make the process  for building Presidential libraries more transparent. Presidential  libraries have become increasingly more expensive as they have evolved  into multipurpose centers. The George W. Bush Presidential Center cost  an estimated $250 million to build, and President Bush raised,  approximately, $500 million for the building and an endowment for his  library, museum, and institute.   Under current law, there is no requirement to disclose the identities  of those who donate to a Presidential library and to a President while  he is still in office. He is able to raise an unlimited amount of  private donations. Requiring the disclosures of donors would help  prevent the trading of political favors in exchange for donations.   This bill would require organizations that raise money to build  Presidential libraries to disclose the identity of any individual who  donates more than $200. The National Archives and Records  Administration would then be required to post the donation information  online. The bill would also create criminal penalties for individuals  who report false information on donations and for fundraising  organizations that omit donation information.    As was mentioned earlier, a group of 15 good government  organizations, including CREW and the Sunlight Foundation, sent a  letter that urged the House to support this bill. Here is what they  wrote:         Under the current opaque system, Presidents raise funds       privately to establish their Presidential libraries.        These efforts, which often begin long before they leave       office, are unregulated and undisclosed, creating       opportunities for--or the appearance of--influence peddling.       Improved transparency would help reduce the appearance of       impropriety and help deter any inappropriate behavior.    This bill was approved, without opposition, by the Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform, and it passed the House last year  without opposition. I urge every Member of this body to support this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I just urge  this body to adopt the legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me begin by thanking the chairman for his understanding and his  support of this legislation. I certainly appreciate it, and I am sure  it will make the Federal Government run more efficiently.   I rise in strong support of the Federal Advisory Committee Act  Amendments. I have introduced this bill in previous Congresses, and it  passed the House last year without opposition.   The FACA was originally enacted in 1972. It is intended to ensure  that committees that provide advice to Federal agencies and the  President operate with transparency.   Advisory committees provide the government with recommendations on a  wide range of issues. For example, the EPA relies on the expertise of  the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee to provide technical advice  on setting national air quality standards.   The bill we are considering today would strengthen FACA to make  Federal advisory committees more transparent and to make agencies more  accountable in how they select and use these committees. Agencies  currently can avoid the requirements of FACA by conducting advisory  committee business through subcommittees. This bill makes it clear that  FACA applies to subcommittees as well as parent committees.   The bill also clarifies that a committee set up by a contractor is  subject to FACA if it is formed under direction of the President or an  agency.   Under FACA, agencies would be required to disclose how advisory  members are chosen, whether they have financial conflicts of interest  if they are appointed to provide their own expertise, and who they work  for if they are representing a specific interest.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I hope the Senate will  take it up quickly and send it to the President.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), a colleague, friend, and cohort on the  Oversight and Government Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Virginia an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I would urge  the House to adopt this legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   GAO provides an invaluable aid to Congress in conducting our  constitutional duty to oversee and evaluate the executive branch. To do  its job effectively, GAO needs timely access to agency documents,  materials, and other information.   The bill before us would ensure GAO's access to the National  Directory of New Hires, a valuable database of wage and employment  information. Access to this database would assist GAO in its improper  payment and fraud work, as well as its evaluation of programs in which  eligibility is means tested. The bill would also explicitly provide GAO  with standing to pursue litigation if an entity in the executive branch  improperly denies the GAO access to information.   Mr. Speaker, similar bills have passed the House by wide margins in a  number of previous Congresses. These are needed reforms. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of this bipartisan bill which reauthorizes the  Office of Special Counsel. The OSC serves as a safe harbor for Federal  whistleblowers to disclose wrongdoing. OSC also works to protect  Federal employees and applicants for Federal employment from prohibited  personnel practices.   The bill would make clear that OSC is entitled to access agency  information in its investigations. This bill would also allow OSC to  hold agencies more accountable from whistleblower retaliation. Under  this bill, if any agency substantiates a whistleblower disclosure from  OSC but fails to take a recommended corrective action, the agency must  explain why it failed to take the action.   This legislation would strengthen the tools available to OSC for  addressing and correcting retaliation and discrimination in the Federal  workplace. It is more important than ever for the Office of Special  Counsel to have the tools it needs to protect the Federal workforce.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), who is the ranking member of the Government  Operations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I would just  urge the body to adopt the legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time.
