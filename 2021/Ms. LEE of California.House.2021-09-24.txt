 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 3755. As co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus, I am a proud original  cosponsor. I thank my good friend and Congresswoman, Judy Chu, for her  persistent leadership, also Chairman Pallone and the Speaker for  bringing it to the floor.   Madam Speaker, make no mistake, people deserve the freedom to control  their own bodies, lives, and futures. We must protect the right to  access abortion and to ensure that it is available and affordable.   Now, I remember the days of back alley, unsafe abortions. We cannot,  and we will not, go back to those days.   Passing this bill would provide a critical safeguard against attacks  on reproductive freedom and ensure that abortions are accessible and  available for all, which means also low-income women and people of  color. This is our body. It is our choice.
