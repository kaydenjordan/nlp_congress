 Mr. President, as the late Senator John McCain once  wrote, ``We are a country with a conscience. We have long believed  moral concerns must be an essential part of our foreign policy, not a  departure from it.'' He believed, as I do, that human rights and the  rule of law are the cornerstones of a just and free society.   More than any President before him, however, President Trump has  shirked our Nation's values. This is especially true in his engagement  abroad; across the globe, President Trump has embraced autocrats and  derided our democratic allies.   The Kingdom of Bahrain is no exception to this disturbing trend. Just  2 months into his tenure, President Trump lifted all human rights  conditions on a multibillion dollar sale of American fighter jets to  Bahrain, imposed by President Obama. President Trump has attached no  human rights conditions to any successive arms sale to Bahrain,  including the arms identified in S.J. Res. 65.   The message President Trump has sent is clear: Bahrain has a green  light to act with total impunity against its citizens. The Trump  administration's decision coincided with an intensified government  campaign against civil society and peaceful political opposition. In  its 2017 Human Rights Report, the State Department cited Bahrain's  unlawful killings by security forces, arbitrary arrest and detention of  civilians, restrictions on freedom of expression, arbitrary citizenship  revocation, and limits on Shia political participation, among a litany  of other abuses by the state.   I recognize that, in every relationship, the United States must  carefully weigh our national security interests. Bahrain is an  important strategic partner and hosts our Navy's Fifth Fleet. The arms  identified in S.J. Res. 65 are intended for Bahrain's territorial  defense, which I support. However, I reject the notion, supported by  this President, that our values and our interests are at odds. Our  values, our willingness to consider the human costs of our actions, are  what make the United States and what keep the United States  exceptional. President Trump should not have abandoned human rights  conditions in our arms sales to Bahrain, which is why I voted against  the motion to table S.J. Res. 65.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, USU, as the  Nation's first ``National Stop the Bleed Campus.''   USU is located in Bethesda, MD and is one of our Nation's greatest  treasures. As our country's only Federal health sciences university,  USU educates, trains, and prepares uniformed health professionals,  scientists, and leaders to support the readiness of our Armed Forces.  USU is a global leader in state-of-the-art research in traumatic brain  injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, precision medicine,  rehabilitation and prosthetics, emerging infectious diseases, tropical  medicine, and cancer, and its researchers generate high-impact  militarily relevant discoveries and products to protect the health of  our Forces and strengthen the national health security of the United  States.   USU is leading efforts in a nation-wide ``Stop the Bleed'' campaign,  launched by the White House on October 6, 2015. This initiative  involves several agencies, Federal and private entities, public health  groups, and medical societies working collaboratively to educate and  empower our citizens on how to stop life-threatening hemorrhage after  traumatic injuries, such as car crashes, acts of violence, and natural  disasters. Today trauma is the leading cause of death in the U.S. for  people between the ages of 1-40. Hemorrhaging, in particular, accounts  for almost 40 percent of deaths in the first 24 hours after a traumatic  injury.   ``Stop the Bleed'' aims to teach our citizens how to save lives from  major traumatic events, just as a bystander would know how to use CPR  to save someone in cardiac arrest. Through this campaign, the goal is  to ensure that the general public knows the ``Stop the Bleed'' phrase  and logo and has access to effective personal and public bleeding  control kits that will allow even an untrained person to effectively  apply a tourniquet just by learning on the spot.   ``Stop the Bleed'' directly translates important lessons learned on  the battlefield to benefit the American public and is based on a decade  of research by the U.S. military. As our country faced a record number  of vascular trauma and extremity injuries from high-velocity gunshot  wounds and explosive devices during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,  the U.S. military began to quickly reassess and revamp its tactical  combat casualty care. They began to equip troops with individual first  aid kits containing tourniquets and newly-developed hemostatic  dressings to control severe blood loss. Simultaneously, they revamped  training to educate both our medical and nonmedical forces, emphasizing  the importance of immediate recognition and control of blood loss with  these newly designed tool kits. These efforts paid off. Military  studies demonstrated that immediate control of severe blood loss, in  fact, saved many lives on the battlefield.   With this knowledge, the military joined forces with members of the  Hartford Consensus, a committee formed in the wake of the tragic Sandy  Hook school shooting. Together, they worked to push these vital lessons  out to the public. That effort led to the White House's launching the  ``Stop the Bleed'' campaign.   As part of this initiative, USU sent teams of its staff and students  out into the community to educate the public on how to ``Stop the  Bleed.'' Their researchers have published studies looking at the  layperson's ability to apply tourniquets and measuring which tactics  are most effective for teaching the public how to apply tourniquets.  They are conducting a study looking at the usability of several types  of dressing to control severe blood loss in the hope of determining  which would be easiest for the lay person to apply. USU researchers  have found that the layperson will know what to do to ``Stop the  Bleed'' about 50 percent of the time with ``just-in-time'' training,  learning on the spot. If they have just 15 minutes of web-based  training, combined with ``just-in-time training,'' the success rate for  applying tourniquets rises to 75 percent.   USU researchers have taken the lead in this initiative and developed  a mobile ``Stop the Bleed'' app for the public to use for education on  how to stop severe blood loss and for emergency reference in case of a  traumatic event that results in life-threatening bleeding. They have  developed a website, https://stopthebleed.usuhs.edu, with information  and resources aimed at bystander education and saving lives. In  [[Page S7046]]  addition, the university has installed ``Stop the Bleed'' kits  throughout every floor on its campus, both in Bethesda and local  satellite offices, and its regional offices in San Antonio, TX, and San  Diego, CA. These kits contain tourniquets, instructions on how to apply  them, and other lifesaving tools needed in an emergency.   Because of their ongoing efforts to educate our Nation's citizens  about this lifesaving initiative, I would like to recognize USU as our  Nation's first ``National Stop the Bleed Campus,'' to encourage others  across the country to follow in their footsteps and, ultimately,  continue to improve national preparedness in response to traumatic  events.   Thank you.                            ____________________
