 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Mr.  Johnson, for yielding and for organizing this.   Madam Speaker, I sat here and listened to all of these people talk  about Luke Letlow, and I don't know who they are talking about.   Luke was a redneck. There is this iconic picture of Luke where he is  wearing this hat, and it says: ``Start Fire.'' The only thing that  comes to mind is this is parent material, right?   Luke was a good ol' boy, and I know, in many instances, that term is  associated with negativity. That is not Luke. Luke was a force for  good, and he did that before the Navy even coined that term.   I have known him for 15, 20 years. We staffed together up here in  Congress. We worked together in the Governor's office in Louisiana.  Luke was always a workhorse, always, not a show horse.   Madam Speaker, Luke was a public servant. He wasn't a politician. He  had a heart for the public. He had a heart for fixing things, and he  was good at it. Luke brought folks together, and he got things done.   There wasn't a prejudiced or discriminatory bone in his body.  Everybody was a friend. Everybody Luke met, he looked you in the eye,  he gave you that little grin, which was a little bit cockeyed, and he  truly wanted to know you.   He truly wanted to get to know people, to find out what you were  about. He loved finding out about the background or history of people,  their ancestry, their relatives, where they were from, what they did,  what they cared about.   Madam Speaker, the people in the Fifth District of Louisiana saw that  as well. There are 24 parishes that comprise the Fifth District, and  Luke won 23 of those, 23 of them in the election. This district, his  predecessor used to brag, and Luke serving as the chief of staff to  Congressman Ralph Abraham used to brag, has more acres of row crops  than any other district in Congress. This wasn't an urban area. This  wasn't New York City or even New Orleans. This was a rural area. Madam  Speaker, these were the people that Luke had a heart for.   I have never in my life been as excited as I was to have a colleague  like Luke. Years and years ago, I told him, I said: ``Luke, look, if  Doc, if Ralph Abraham, ever steps down, you have to run. You have to do  it.''   There are a lot of people up here that are good. Luke would have been  great.   Madam Speaker, you look at this place, you watch the network TV, the  news, and you wonder why in the world anyone would want to come to do  this. You have really got to question people's sanity, looking at how  dysfunctional, how partisan, how divisive this place is.   One of the previous speakers hit it on the head when they said Luke  is exactly what we need. He is exactly what we need here. I will say it  again: Luke is a workhorse, not a show horse. He brings people  together. He doesn't care about your race, your ethnicity. He doesn't  care about your political party. What he cares about is doing things  right.   Luke's dream was to find a good life partner, and knowing him when he  was a little younger, I think many of us thought that was a pretty  lofty goal for Luke. But, man, he nailed it. He did. Julia, his  partner, his life partner, his spouse, his wife, is just amazing, and  Luke was just so excited, so giddy, about that relationship.   Luke's dream was to be a good son, and he is. He is a great son. He  is a great brother.   Before I leave you all with the wrong impression, I should have  clarified that his dad actually started the volunteer fire department  in Start, S-t-a-r-t, where he was from. I didn't mean to suggest that  he was a pyro. He was a good son.   Luke's dream was to be a Member of Congress, and he did that, too. He  won the election. His dream was to be a good father to Jeremiah and the  apple of his eye, Jacqueline. He loves them, absolutely loves them.   And his dream was to be a good Christian. Look, all of us are  sinners, but Luke was a difference-maker.   He didn't run for Congress for the name recognition, for the ego, or  for the popularity. He did this, he ran, to represent the  underrepresented, to stand up for these small communities, like Start,  Louisiana, and the people of these small communities so they would have  a voice, so they would be represented.   I will never in my life forget when we were at the burial, following  the hearse to the burial ceremony, seeing that hearse driving and the  water tower of Start right there in the background, and this just  ominous sky. All I could think about is Luke doing what was right and  wanting to be here because he really cared. He did. It was so genuine.   Madam Speaker, people often talk about term limits, and term limits  make a lot of sense. There are some people that should be term-limited  after they have been in Congress for about 2 months, and there are some  people that should be term-limited after 40 years. Luke was one of  those people who should be here forever because you couldn't change his  genuine heart and care for the people and doing what is right.                                time  2000    So, Madam Speaker, I want to thank, again, my friend from Louisiana  for organizing this. It was absolutely well deserved. Filling the void  Ralph Abraham's retirement created was a big void, but, certainly, Luke  was absolutely up for that task. He was going to do an amazing job.   To Julia, to Jeremiah, to Jacqueline: Luke is looking down at us from  heaven right now probably playing Xbox or PlayStation, and he is  looking over this place. He is looking over this family. What Louisiana  lost was heaven's gain.   God bless you, brother.
