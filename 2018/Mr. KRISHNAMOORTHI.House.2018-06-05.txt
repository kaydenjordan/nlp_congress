 Mr. Speaker, in our increasingly competitive  world, a 4-year college may not be for everyone, but a postsecondary  education has to be.   As we address this reality, it is vital that we recognize the vital  role of career and technical education. That is why I am proud to have  served as the Democratic lead on the Strengthening Career and Technical  Education for the 21st Century Act and to have worked with my  colleagues from both parties throughout this process.   Our bill will bring the Carl D. Perkins grant program into the 21st  century by increasing funding and bringing educators and business  leaders together to develop curricula to prepare students for in-demand  fields.   The House passed this bill unanimously last year, and now I want to  encourage the Senate to take up this legislation. Through investing in  our citizens and our economy, this bill will help families across the  country join and stay in the middle class.                            ____________________
