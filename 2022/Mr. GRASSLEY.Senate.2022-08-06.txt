 Madam President, this body has a long record of coming  together to improve healthcare for Americans.   In 2003, when I was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, we  worked in a bipartisan manner to establish the Medicare Part D benefit.  More recently, I have worked with my colleagues on the Finance  Committee on oversight and investigations to hold EpiPen manufacturers  accountable that were misusing taxpayer dollars and insulin  manufacturers and PBMs accountable that were unfairly increasing the  list price of insulin. We can work together and meaningfully improve  healthcare.   This Congress, I have worked with my Democratic colleagues to pass  five of my bills out of committee in a bipartisan way. These bills will  lower drug prices, create more competition, while holding Big Pharma  and PBMs accountable. Unfortunately, the leader hasn't brought any of  these bills up for a vote, even though they would easily pass the U.S.  Senate.   But this hasn't stopped me from trying to find other ways to help  bring down the cost of medications.   In 2019, as Finance Committee chairman, I began a bipartisan  committee process with the ranking member from Oregon to lower the  costs of prescription drugs. That bill is entitled the ``Prescription  Drug Pricing Reduction Act.''   We held three committee hearings to learn from policymakers and  advocates, while also holding Big Pharma and PBMs accountable. We held  a committee markup, where the bill passed 19 to 9 on a bipartisan  basis. We continued to hold additional negotiations to make  improvements in the bill, even after it got out of committee. It  contained stuff that I like. It also contained stuff I didn't like, but  that is the way we do bipartisan legislating.   Today, it is still the only comprehensive prescription drug bill that  can garner more than 60 votes on the Senate floor.   I recently outlined on the floor the bill's details in case the  majority party has forgotten. I won't restate every part of my July 20  speech, but here are some of the bill's key highlights:   One, it lowers costs for seniors by $72 billion and saves the  taxpayers $95 billion.   Two, it establishes an out-of-pocket cap, eliminates the doughnut  hole, and redesigns Medicare Part D.   Three, it ends taxpayer subsidies to Big Pharma by capping price  increases of Medicare Part B and D drugs at inflation.   Four, it establishes accountability and transparency in the  pharmaceutical industry.   Five, and most important in this body, the bill is bipartisan.   Now, believe it or not, a bipartisan bill limiting pharmaceutical  increases is possible. Compare this to what the majority has offered  us. Their partisan bill includes more reckless spending and tax  increases. Their partisan bill reduces the number of new cures and  treatments. Their partisan bill fails to enact any bipartisan  accountability for Big Pharma and, in particular, for PBMs.   Even while the majority party has decided to pursue a purely partisan  bill in secret over the past 20 months, I have continued to meet with  Democrats and Republicans to advance a bipartisan and negotiated bill.  I would prefer a bipartisan bill to pass the U.S. Senate.   We could still pass the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act. My  colleagues know it. Several of them have thanked me publicly on my  bipartisan work to lower prescription drug prices. Sadly, the majority  party has chosen a different route.   They have chosen a bill that contains zero--zero--PBM accountability.  It gives middlemen a pass. They have chosen a bill that contains none  of the 25 accountability and transparency provisions that had  bipartisan consensus in my bill.   Finally, one last thing I would like to address about my colleagues'  reckless tax and spending. I have heard some of my colleagues on the  other side say this bill's prescription drug provision is what I have  described today as Grassley-Wyden. This is untrue. This is a reckless  tax-and-spending bill. It is not bipartisan, and no reporter should  accept or repeat that notion.   I oppose the partisan bill because it is a long list of reckless tax  increases and spending. It is not the bipartisan prescription drug bill  that passed out of the Finance Committee 19 to 9.   I will file the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act as an  amendment today. We could strike and replace this reckless tax-and- spending spree with comprehensive drug pricing reform that could garner  more than 60 votes and lower drug prices while holding Big Pharma and  PBMs accountable.   We could actually enact meaningful accountability and transparency in  the pharmaceutical industry. I will file that amendment as well. We  could pursue PBM transparency and accountability, and I will file that  amendment as well.   I have said throughout this Congress that I will work with anyone who  wants to pass the bipartisan-negotiated Prescription Drug Pricing  Reduction Act.   To continue on the bill today, the Democrats' most recent reckless  tax-and-spending spree suffers from some serious policy whiplash. Just  last week, all but one Democrat voted to provide nearly $80 billion in  subsidies to some of the largest and most profitable corporations in  the world. The goal then was to make America a more favorable business  environment to attract investments from a critical industry.   But mere hours later, they unveiled a huge tax hike on domestic  manufacturing. Democrats tried to justify this 180-degree policy turn  by claiming their tax hike is necessary to make corporations ``pay  their fair share.'' However, this claim is laughable, given the so- called CHIPS+ bill nearly all Democrats enthusiastically supported last  week. As I pointed out at that time, the CHIPS+ bill ensures many  large, very profitable semiconductor manufacturers will pay zero tax or  even receive payments from the IRS exceeding any tax liability.   Yet Senator Sanders was the only Democrat to express any concern  about these profitable companies paying nothing in taxes.   Under the Democrats' so-called book minimum tax, large, profitable  corporations favored by Democrats can still escape paying any Federal  tax. While they claim their reckless tax-and-spending bill will ensure  companies pay their fair share, they include carve-outs and expanded  subsidies for their favorite industries.   For example, business tax credits are carved out from Democrats' book  minimum tax, including a myriad of souped-up green energy tax breaks.  [[Page S4066]]  This is despite the fact that research by the liberal Institute on  Taxation and Economic Policy confirms these credits are a significant  reason why seemingly profitable companies pay little or no tax.   The Democrats' bill not only carves out certain tax credits, it  doubles down with $270 billion in corporate tax subsidies in the name  of their Green New Deal agenda. Along with a new provision that allows  green energy developers to sell their credits to others, a host of  businesses and industries will be able to use this new loophole to pay  little or no tax. This could include financial institutions, private  equity firms, tech firms, and wealthy private investors.   Democrats' message to the business community is very clear: If you  are a large, Democrat-aligned green industry, you have nothing to worry  about; paying your ``fair share'' of taxes is optional. But if you are  a domestic textile or electronics manufacturer, prepare to be taxed  into submission.   This mindset is especially concerning given our increasingly fragile  economy. Late last week, we learned our economy contracted for the  second straight quarter, indicating, as we know, we are in a recession.  The last thing businesses and families need right now are tax hikes and  a rash of poorly vetted policies creating even more confusion and  uncertainty in the economy. Nonpartisan analyses by the Joint Committee  on Taxation and outside groups show this is exactly what Democrats are  offering.   During the election, Democrats promised not to raise taxes on anyone  earning less than $400,000, but the Joint Committee on Taxation  confirms their proposal does exactly the opposite. For 2023 alone,  Democrats propose a $17 billion tax hike on families and individuals  making less than $200,000.   While Democrats' tax hikes hit Americans of all incomes, their  proposed benefits are targeted at a privileged few, like helping  wealthy Americans purchase $80,000 electric SUVs. According to the  Joint Committee on Taxation, the original version of their bill had a  whopping $155 billion tax hike on domestic manufacturing stemming from  their so-called book minimum tax.   The National Association of Manufacturers estimated that this tax  hike would cost more than 200,000 jobs, reduce labor income by $17  billion, and reduce GDP by nearly $70 billion.   Now, I understand Senator Sinema has since secured changes to the  book minimum tax that may lessen the burden on domestic manufacturers.  However, even if we assume all the relief secured by Senator Sinema  accrues to manufacturers, the best-case scenario is manufacturers will  still see a $100-billion-plus tax hit.   Democrats' inflation act still throws blue-collar workers overboard  for their Green New Deal. The Democrats' war on manufacturing is mind- boggling. Members of both parties have stressed a need to reshore  manufacturing to address supply chain disruptions and delink from China  for national security reasons. Saddling manufacturers with a giant tax  bill will hurt, not help, our efforts. Targeting manufacturers for tax  hikes makes even less sense in the face of our surging inflation.   Democrat tax hikes will curtail investments necessary to increase the  supply of goods needed to meet consumer demand. This mismatch between  supply and demand is what is actually driving our inflation. The  potential harm to our economy is underscored by Penn Wharton's analysis  of the Democrats' reckless tax-and-spending spree. They called out the  novelty and uncertainty surrounding Democrats' book minimum tax saying  more work is needed to understand its impact on capital market  efficiency and the economy.   Penn Wharton's analysis also shows Democrats' proposals will do  nothing to bring down inflation and are more likely to make inflation  worse in the near term. Essentially, Democrats are gambling on untested  and unproven policies while our economy is in a recession, real wages  are falling, and inflation is soaring.   The truth is, Democrats' reckless tax-and-spending spree is bad for  jobs, bad for the economy, and won't do anything to address what Iowans  care about the most: the rising cost of inflation.   I urge my Democrats to rethink your approach. Stop gambling with our  Nation's economy.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this body has a long record of coming  together to improve healthcare for Americans. In 2003, we worked in a  bipartisan manner to establish the Medicare Part D benefit. More  recently, I have worked with my Finance Committee colleagues on  oversight investigations to hold: EpiPen manufacturers accountable who  were misusing taxpayer dollars, insulin manufacturers and PBMs  accountable who were unfairly increasing the list price of insulin, and  our organ donation system accountable and investigate its troubling  underperformance.   We can work together and meaningfully improve healthcare. This  Congress, I have worked with my Democrat colleagues to introduce eight  bills to lower drug costs. In the past year alone, we have passed five  of my bills out of committee on a bipartisan basis. They will lower  drug prices and create more competition while holding Big Pharma and  PBMs accountable. Unfortunately, the leader hasn't brought any of these  bills up for a vote, even though they would easily pass the Senate. But  this hasn't stopped me from trying to find other ways to help bring  down the cost of medications.

The bill is called the Prescription Drug Pricing  Reduction Act. We held three committee hearings to learn from  policymakers and advocates while also holding Big Pharma and PBMs  accountable. We held a committee mark-up where the bill passed 19 to 9,  on a bipartisan basis. We continued to hold additional negotiations to  make improvements to the bill. It contained stuff I liked and didn't  like. But that is bipartisan legislation. Today, it is still the only  comprehensive prescription drug bill that can garner more than 60 votes  on the Senate floor.   I recently outlined on the floor the bill's details in case the  majority party has forgotten. I won't restate every part of my July 20  speech, but here are some of my bill's key measures: No. 1, it lowers  costs for seniors by $72 billion and saves taxpayers $95 billion. No.  2, it establishes an out-of-pocket cap, eliminates the donut hole, and  redesigns Medicare Part D. No. 3, it ends taxpayer subsidies to Big  Pharma by capping price increases of Medicare Part B and D drugs at  inflation. No. 4, it establishes accountability and transparency in the  pharmaceutical industry. No. 5, and the bill is bipartisan. Believe it  or not, a bipartisan bill limiting pharmaceutical increases is  possible. Compare this to what the majority has offered: Their partisan  bill includes more reckless spending and tax increases. Their partisan  bill reduces the number of new cures and treatments. Their partisan  bill fails to enact any bipartisan accountability for Big Pharma and  PBMs.   Even while the majority party has decided to pursue a purely partisan  bill in secret over the past 20 months, I have continued to meet with  Democrats and Republicans to advance my bipartisan and negotiated bill.  I have met or spoken with: President Biden and White House staff,  Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, HHS Secretary Becerra, House Democrats  who wanted a bipartisan bill, Problem Solvers Caucus Health Care  Working Group, Congressman Welch, Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers,  Democrat Senators Sinema and Carper, and others.   I wanted a bipartisan bill to pass this Senate. We could still pass  the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act. My colleagues know it.  Several of them have thanked me publicly on my bipartisan work to lower  prescription drug prices. Sadly, they have chosen a different route.  They have chosen a bill that contains zero PBM accountability. It gives  middlemen a pass. They have chosen a bill that contains none of the 25  accountability and transparency provisions that had bipartisan  consensus in my bill. This includes ending DIR clawbacks that are  hurting patients pocketbooks and small/independent pharmacies; ending  ``spread pricing'' in Medicaid that is drive up taxpayer costs;  requiring sunshine on PBMs through financial audits, so we knows the  true net cost of a drug; requiring sunshine on excessive drug  [[Page S4168]]  price increases and launch price of new high-cost drugs. None of these  bipartisan accountability and transparency provisions--and more--are  included in their bill.   Finally, one last thing I would like to address about my colleagues'  reckless tax and spending bill: I have heard some of my colleagues on  the other side say this bill's prescription drug provision is Grassley- Wyden. That is untrue. This is a reckless tax and spending bill. It is  not bipartisan, and no reporter should accept or repeat that notion. I  oppose the partisan bill because it is a long list of reckless tax  increases and spending. This is not the bipartisan prescription drug  bill that passed out of the Finance Committee 19 to 9.   I have filed the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act as an  amendment today. We could strike and replace this reckless tax and  spending spree with comprehensive drug pricing reform that could garner  more than 60 votes and lower drug prices while holding Big Pharma and  PBMs accountable. We could actually enact meaningful accountability and  transparency in the pharmaceutical industry. I have filed that  amendment, too. We could pursue PBM transparency and accountability. I  have filed that amendment, too.   I have said throughout this Congress, I will work with anyone who  wants to pass the bipartisan and negotiated Prescription Drug Pricing  Reduction Act.    I ask to call up amendment No. 5421, and I ask that it  be reported by number.    It is 4:50 a.m., and I want all the people who thought  that inflation was going to be transitory to understand that it is  persistent, and that persistence of inflation has hurt the Tax Code  that tries to help middle-class America.   So my amendment fixes this by providing inflation relief to the  middle class by increasing family and education tax provisions to  account for Biden inflation.   Moreover, the bill includes important savings incentives that will  enable middle-class Americans to save tax-free, ensuring that they  aren't taxed on phantom income resulting from inflation.   So I urge my Members to support this. Particularly when you have in  this Tax Code things that benefit the rich who can afford Teslas for  $80,000, you can surely do something for middle-class America.    Do I have some time left?    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I have long fought to protect victims  of violent crime. Victims of sexual assault, especially children who  are victimized by sexual predators, must be safeguarded. I have worked  to ensure the Violence Against Women Act is funded. I steered through  the Senate and into law the Survivor's Bill of Rights in the States  Act. And I have introduced the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to  support victims of human trafficking. I have fought and will continue  to fight for victims of violent crime.   When I was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I convened  the first congressional hearing on protecting young athletes from  sexual abuse. I conducted aggressive oversight into the U.S. Olympic  Committee's response following the scandal involving disgraced Olympic  physician Larry Nassar. And I worked to ensure that the Protecting  Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act became law, which requires  instructors, coaches, and others who work with young athletes to report  cases of child sexual abuse to the authorities. But more needs to be  done.   I continue to press the Department of Justice for more answers on the  FBI's handling of the Nassar case and why Nassar wasn't federally  charged for his heinous physical abuse against our Olympic gymnasts. My  oversight in this area has brought to the surface more information  about how our legal system fails victims of abuse, especially children.  Our outdated laws aren't keeping pace with how predators develop new  tricks and use new technology.   Children are a gift, but they are vulnerable. They must be  protected--not taken advantage of. As a father and a grandfather, the  safety and welfare of the next generation is a deeply personal issue to  me.   Today, I am pleased to announce that I, along with Senator Ossoff, am  introducing the Preventing Child Sexual Abuse Act. We are confident  this bill will make children--both at home and around the world--safer  from the predators who want to sexually abuse them.   I have worked extensively with the Department of Justice's Child  Exploitation and Obscenity Section to get their feedback and hear about  what legislative tools they need to protect children. I look forward to  continuing this partnership with them as we improve this legislation.   Victims and advocacy groups focused on this issue endorse this bill,  including: U.S. Olympic medalist Tasha Schwikert, the Army of  Survivors, the National and International Centers for Missing and  Exploited Children, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, Stop  Child Predators, Rights4Girls, the Keep Kids Safe Movement, the  National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys, and the Iowa  County Attorneys Association. I appreciate their contributions and  suggestions in improving this bill and their tireless efforts to keep  children safe from the scourge of this kind of abuse.   This bill gives prosecutors more tools in their toolbox to get child  abusers away from children. One of the sections in my bill will now  make it possible for Federal prosecutors to charge the likes of Larry  Nassar with a Federal crime for his abuse of our gymnasts. Another  section ensures that Americans who travel abroad under the guise of  business or charitable work to abuse children will be held accountable.  The final section of this bill modernizes our understanding of child  sexual abuse in the digital age.   I wish legislation like this wasn't necessary, but it is. We have to  crack down on violent crime against children, and we shouldn't wait  another minute to act. I look forward to working with my fellow  Senators to pass this legislation quickly and keep our children safe  from predators.                            ____________________
