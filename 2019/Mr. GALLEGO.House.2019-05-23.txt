 Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for my colleagues when I say  that we all loved Jerry. How could you not love Jerry?   Her spirit and unwavering optimism and her love for our State and our  party made her the quintessential Arizonan. She lived to 104 years old,  and she really lived. She lived in a way that set an example for all of  us. She made every day count.   Her life spanned some of the momentous times in our Nation's history:  the Great Depression, the fight for women's suffrage, World War II, and  the civil rights movement.   In 1914, when Jerry was born, women did not have the right to vote.  Who could have thought then that a century later Jerry would announce  our State's delegates on the floor of the 2016 Democratic National  Convention for the first major-party female Presidential nominee in our  Nation's history. It was an honor to stand by her side that day, and it  is a moment I will never forget.   In her 104 years, Jerry saw our State and our country through some  tough times, but she never lost hope, she never lost optimism, and her  commitment to bringing about the change she believed in never wavered.  [[Page H4153]]    Her son Jim recalled that her biggest lesson was: No matter what is  going on at that time, as long as you keep hope, you keep believing  things will change, and you are doing you best to help change, it will  change.   Those words guided Jerry's life. Those words have inspired me and  should inspire us all as we keep fighting for the things we believe in.   We will miss you, Jerry.
