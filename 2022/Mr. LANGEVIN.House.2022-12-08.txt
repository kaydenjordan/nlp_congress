 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this year's National  Defense Authorization Act.   I want to begin by thanking Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Rogers,  and Ranking Member Banks for their leadership on this critical  legislation.   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Cyber, Innovative Technologies,  and Information Systems, I am proud of all of the work that we have  done in this year's bill, from cyber, to research and development, to  artificial intelligence, as well as our efforts to combat climate  change, including shifting towards developing sustainable alternative  aviation fuels. It is this subcommittee, in particular, that works to  deliver cutting-edge technologies into the hands of the warfighter. For  the past 22 years, it has been my job to ensure that our troops never  enter a fair fight.   As I prepare to depart from Congress at the end of this year, I will  always cherish the opportunity I have had to work across the aisle to  provide for our national defense. I thank my colleagues and staff,  without whom many of these accomplishments would not be possible. But  most of all, I would like to thank each and every servicemember and  civilian who has dedicated their life to the U.S. military and  protecting our way of life.   To honor their sacrifice, I urge all of my colleagues to support the  NDAA.
