 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in the 2020 elections, Americans chose  an evenly-divided Senate--half Republican, half Democrat. Evenly  divided. Since the Vice President is able to break a tie when it comes  to specifically organizing the Senate, Democrats have the majority.   Now some Democrats want to lower the threshold for all the votes so  that to pass anything, all they would need to do in case of a tie vote  would have the Vice President be the tiebreaker. That is the way that a  majority works. When there is a tie and the Vice President is in one  party, they get to break the tie in that direction, of course.   What we need to make sure of, though, is that there is fairness in  the process. The traditions and how this institution works are that we  have a filibuster. Sixty votes is how legislation is passed.   We know that the press and sometimes folks in Congress say it is hard  to pass a law. Well, it is not supposed to be easy. It takes  discussion. It takes negotiation. It brings people together. That is  the idea of needing 60 votes--to bring people together to get a  bipartisan consensus so that all the voices are heard; that there is a  majority, and the minority voice is heard, and it forces us to find  common ground.   Frankly, I think there is too little of finding common ground in  Washington already. The last thing America needs is even more  divisiveness. This is a big, diverse country. We don't need 50 percent  of the country plus one to run roughshod over all the others. That is  why our Founders were so careful to protect the rights of the minority.  That is why they created the Bill of Rights, why they created the  electoral college, and why they created the U.S. Senate. The Founding  Fathers didn't want the Senate to be a copy of the House. We are  intended to be a check on the House.   There is a story that President Washington compared the Senate to a  saucer used to cool down a cup of tea. President Madison compared it to  a fence. We are not supposed to be a smaller version of the House of  Representatives. The Senate is supposed to cool things down. We are  supposed to think things through. We are supposed to stop bad ideas and  stop the House from moving too fast. Changing the rules of the Senate  would make that impossible.   Lowering the bar to 50 votes could also be a blatant power grab,  which is 50 votes and the Vice President. The Democrats could even add  States to the Union--specifically States that would elect more  Democrats to the Senate. It would give them even more Senate seats,  could even give them a permanent majority in the Senate.   With 50 votes plus the Vice President, Democrats could also pack the  Supreme Court with liberal activist judges--judges who legislate from  the bench, not judges who apply the law as written. That would give  them a permanent majority both in the Senate and on the Court.   With a single rule change, one branch of government, one Chamber of  Congress, could be under permanent Democratic control. It is no  surprise that it is tempting to Senate Democrats and that the far-left  branch of that party is demanding that occur.   You remember that when President Trump was in office, Republicans had  a chance to do exactly the same thing. In fact, former President Trump  repeatedly asked us and told us that we should do just that. In one  particularly memorable example, he tweeted: ``The U.S. Senate should  switch to 51 votes.'' He said: ``Dems would do it, no doubt.'' More  than 30 different times, President Trump asked that Republicans end the  filibuster. We didn't. We stuck to the intentions of our Founding  Fathers. We protected the rights of the minority, and we put country  before party.   If Democrats won't stop the power grab for the good of the country,  then they should at least do it for their own good.   Democrats have had 50 votes and the Vice President for only a few  days. In fact, when Democrats were in the minority, 33 Democratic  Senators said they didn't want to change the rules. They signed a  letter, and that letter called for the preservation of the rights of  the minority. Twenty-seven of those Democrats are still Members of the  Senate today. One of those Democrats is now the Vice President of the  United States, Vice President Kamala Harris.   Even President Biden called the idea of eliminating the filibuster  ``a very dangerous move.'' The White House Press Secretary told us last  week President Biden still opposes changing the rules.   If Democrats go down this road and break the rules of the Senate,  they are doing more than just hurting the institution; they are  admitting their ideas don't have broad bipartisan support. Think about  that. If the Democratic agenda had the support of the American people,  then they wouldn't need to change the rules. If Democrats could find  bipartisan support to pass their tax increases, they would leave the  rules alone. If Democrats could find bipartisan support to pass the  Green New Deal and higher energy costs that come with it, they would  leave the rules alone. If they could restrict gun ownership, they would  leave the rules alone. They can't, and they know they can't. They know  the American people have looked at their progressive agenda and said:  No, thank you.   President Biden's inaugural address last week talked a lot about  unity. He said that ``with unity we can do great things.'' I agree.   I ask my Democratic colleagues if they agree with the President's  inaugural address, or do they really think  [[Page S147]]  that they want to make the U.S. Senate more partisan, more divided. Do  they really want to take power away from individual Senators and give  it to whoever has 50 votes and the tiebreaker at the moment? If it is  hard for Democrats to pass laws, then they should try talking with us.  Propose bipartisan solutions to our Nation's challenges. Persuade your  colleagues. Make progress together.   As my friend, former Senator Lamar Alexander, said in his farewell  address just a month ago--he said: ``We don't need a change of rules.  The Senate needs a change of behavior.''   I urge my Democratic colleagues to reject this blatant power grab.  Stop this rush to take more and more power. Come to the center. Reach  across the aisle. Find common ground.   Senate Republicans are ready to work together to help the American  people, to get people back to work, to get our kids safely back to  school so they don't fall further behind, and to get the virus behind  us. Join us. Let's work together. Let's do what is right for the people  we serve.   I yield the floor                            ____________________
