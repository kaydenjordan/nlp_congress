 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of a  President who carried out his oath of office.   I am afraid the reason we are here today, again, is out of pure  opposition to this President, and not the serious national security  issues at hand.   Make no mistake; terrorist Soleimani is responsible for the deaths of  hundreds of Americans, including those that my friend and colleague,  Ralph Abraham, just read. Hundreds of Americans; and he was plotting to  kill many more.   The President used his full legal authority to take defensive action  and eliminate this brutal terrorist. The world is safer today because  of it.   In times like these, we need to come together as a country and stand  behind our men and women in uniform. Whoever occupies the White House  should have the ability to direct and address threats and prevent  American bloodshed.   Just 48 hours ago, Iran attacked U.S. military personnel; and yet, we  are hastily voting on this partisan resolution that will weaken  national security.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this political show  resolution.
