 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 682 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 682         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (S. 139) to       implement the use of Rapid DNA instruments to inform       decisions about pretrial release or detention and their       conditions, to solve and prevent violent crimes and other       crimes, to exonerate the innocent, to prevent DNA analysis       backlogs, and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. An amendment in the       nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 115-53 shall be considered as adopted. The       bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to       final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour       of debate, with 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence and 20 minutes equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on the Judiciary; (2) the further amendment printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution, if offered by the Member designated in the       report, which shall be in order without intervention of any       point of order, shall be considered as read, shall be       separately debatable for the time specified in the report       equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an       opponent, and shall not be subject to a demand for division       of the question; and (3) one motion to commit with or without       instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on House Resolution 682, currently under  consideration.  [[Page H104]]     Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward  this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for  consideration of S. 139, the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, with 40 minutes equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the House  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and 20 minutes equally  divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee.   The rule also provides for a motion to recommit.   Additionally, the rule makes in order an amendment offered by Mr.  Amash, representing ideas from Members of both sides of the aisle.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee received testimony from numerous  members, including Intelligence Committee Chairman Nunes and Ranking  Member Schiff. We also heard from Judiciary Committee Ranking Member  Nadler, Congressman Farenthold, Congressman Amash, Congresswoman  Lofgren, and also Congressman Poe.   In addition to the vigorous debate on this legislation before the  Rules Committee, both the Judiciary Committee and Intelligence  Committee held markups on legislation to reauthorize section 702 of the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.   Today we have the opportunity to pass an important piece of  legislation that will enhance our national security and strengthen  protections of Americans' privacy.   Mr. Speaker, I publicly thank Chairman Goodlatte and Chairman Nunes  for their important work on this legislation. As a result of their  efforts, the legislation we will consider today will protect the  privacy rights of individual Americans without hindering the  intelligence community's ability to gain valuable intelligence about  the schemes and identities of our enemies.   Our government's most fundamental responsibilities are to defend the  American people from harm and to protect their liberties. The value  that we place on these duties is reflected by the fact that they are  enshrined in the preamble to the Constitution.   To provide for our common defense, the dedicated men and women of the  intelligence community work tirelessly to defeat the efforts of our  foreign adversaries, whether they are terrorists, hostile foreign  states, or nuclear proliferators.   Our Constitution tasks each branch of government--legislative,  executive, and judicial--with constantly working to protect the liberty  of every American.   With the bill provided for by this rule, the Chamber will be  considering legislation that will help us better achieve both. The FISA  Amendments Reauthorization Act will extend the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act, or FISA, Title VII for 6 years while increasing  oversight of its implementation at every level and providing more  robust privacy protections for Americans.   Section 702 of FISA has proven to be an invaluable tool for  collecting foreign intelligence and providing insight into the plans  and intentions of our enemies. It is one of the National Security  Administration's most important operational authorities.   It permits the government to conduct targeted surveillance of foreign  persons located outside the United States, with the compelled  assistance of electronic communication service providers, to acquire  foreign intelligence information.   Mr. Speaker, this program's importance to national security cannot be  overstated. While many of the examples of its successes are classified  in nature, I can tell you here today that it has helped protect the  homeland and the American people.   One declassified example that I can share with Members concerns the  story of Hajji Iman, who rose through the ranks of ISIS, eventually  becoming the terrorist organization's second in command.   For more than 2 years, the intelligence community searched for Iman.  During that period, the NSA used their section 702 programs to target  his communications and his close associates. Their resourcefulness,  together with these 702 resources, eventually led them to him.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman was a terrorist. He was a murderer. Mr.  Speaker, Mr. Iman was killed by U.S. special forces on March 24, 2016,  during an attempt to apprehend him.   We may not see every victory that the 702 program delivers on behalf  of innocent Americans, but these initiatives help protect Americans  every day.   Let us pause to note, however, that with the broad authority granted  by a program like 702 to collect foreign intelligence information to  fight our foreign enemies, it must come with expansive safeguards  against abuse of that authority and expansive oversight of its use.   To ensure that the authorities under section 702 do not come into  conflict with the liberty and privacy interests of the American people,  the FISA Amendments Act expands substantially on the already extensive  safeguard.   Mr. Speaker, as I have said, each branch of government is responsible  for protecting the liberties of the American people. In the executive  branch, there are extensive internal controls that require agency heads  and the Attorney General to review and approve of actions under 702.  Additionally, the inspector general for the intelligence community and  the Department of Justice are tasked with comprehensive review of this  program's implementation.    Mandatory internal procedures known as targeting and minimization  procedures also govern the collection, use, and dissemination of  information, and they are in place at each agency that uses FISA  section 702.   The FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act expands upon the internal  protections by requiring each agency to also adopt querying procedures  to control how each agency searches its database for 702-acquired  communications.   This brings me to the judicial branch. Under current law, the  targeting and minimization procedures must be approved annually by the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, of FISC, which is made up of a  rotating group of Article III judges.   The FISC, with the aid of amicus curiae briefs and technical experts,  engages in exhaustive review and consideration of section 702's  implementation for compliance with the Constitution and the law.   This legislation will enhance the FISC's considerations of privacy  issues by providing the FISC with the authority to compensate amicus  briefs and technical experts.   Finally, there is Congress, where we come to. The Committee on the  Judiciary and the Committee on Intelligence have conducted multiple  oversight hearings and meetings in both classified and unclassified  settings. Numerous insights came from those hearings, and the  legislation that will be considered under today's rule reflects them  well. The bill makes a number of improvements that will enhance the  congressional oversight in coming years.   But, Mr. Speaker, it is time to remember one more group that remains  critical to protecting Americans' liberties: American men and women  themselves.   This legislation will improve transparency and public oversight of  FISA section 702 by requiring the Director of National Intelligence and  the Attorney General to conduct a declassification review and publicly  release the FISA section 702 minimization procedures every year.   Mr. Speaker, the most important reform contained in this legislation  constitutes the most substantial reform to the program since its  inception.   Under this legislation, the FBI will be required, when conducting a  criminal investigation of a U.S. person, to obtain a warrant from the  FISC prior to accessing the content of the communications that were  acquired using 702.   Section 702 information is collected for the purpose of foreign  intelligence operations, and this critical new requirement forecloses  the possibility that FBI agents investigating Americans for traditional  crimes would be able to use 702 information in such domestic  investigations.   In addition to the numerous safeguards currently in place and added  by this legislation, Americans are guaranteed their right of privacy by  the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  [[Page H105]]    I took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, and the oath  guides every action I take in this Chamber. The FISA Amendments  Reauthorization Act ensures that the Fourth Amendment rights of  Americans are upheld and includes additional safeguards on top of  constitutionally guaranteed rights.   Mr. Speaker, we have reviewed the importance of the FISA Amendments  Reauthorization Act in stopping terrorist attacks and protecting the  American people, but this point bears repeating: this program allows  the government to obtain the communication of foreigners outside the  United States, including foreign terrorist threats, in support of the  counterterrorism efforts worldwide. It has allowed us to respond to  threats to our country.   Now let me tell you a little bit about what the 702 program is not.  It is not a bulk collection of data. It cannot be used to target  Americans and it cannot be used to target individuals located inside  the United States.   Mr. Speaker, the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act is an example of  what Congress can accomplish when we work together to find solutions to  our Nation's weightiest challenges.   Mr. Speaker, before I close my opening, I also will acknowledge that  there is a lot of difference of opinion, as there should be, on this  bill. But at the end of the day, progress has been made, protections  have been implemented, and the security of our country must be taken  into account. That is why this bill needs to pass and any amendments  that were brought forward need to fail.   We need to push this forward and begin the process in continuing to  protect our private citizens' personal responsibilities and liberties,  but also, at the same time, making sure that our intelligence  communities and those entrusted with the sacred duty of protecting this  country have the tools they need to do that. Anything else would be  less than what we should be here.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), a fellow member of the  Judiciary Committee and former chair of that committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I yield to my next speaker, there are a couple of  things to clarify here.   This is an urgent matter. Although the gentlewoman spoke of this in  the sense that the existing orders would stay in place, she fails to  mention, and others have failed to talk about, that any new orders or  even currently existing orders are being enforced by the intelligence  community, which is set under that sort of pale of direction that they  want.   So I guess if you are satisfied protecting the country with existing  orders and existing threats that lasted yesterday, but I will guarantee  you somebody else woke up this morning wanting to do us harm. I want  the intelligence community to be able to address that in a way that is  prudent and proper, which is what I feel like is happening here.   The other issue here is, and I want to make this very clear, there  are strong opinions, and I respect the gentlewoman from California  immensely, I have relayed and have had similar concerns that she has  had over the process and I have voted with her several times to move  forward, but we have moved forward, and there are, I believe,  protections in this bill.   So when we also talk about, as we go forward, and there is going to  be a lot of passionate rhetoric, who is looking out for whom and  reminding us of our oaths, I took the oath here, just as the  gentlewoman did, when we started this new session, but I also took  another oath in the United States Air Force and also served in Iraq and  also serve in that time since currently in the military, and we have  that oath as well.   I will not take a backseat to anyone who can consciously disagree  about where we are. This is a good bill. This is something that I would  love to see in different ways changed, but this is the arc of where we  are now in protecting our country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms.  Cheney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from California attempting  to clarify.   Again, I stand by my statement. The simple fact is, it is the  statement it will not go dark, but the issue is we go further here in  the collection happening, but how we use that and how we deal with that  in a national security context, there is an interesting issue here, and  there is an issue that could keep us from doing what we need to do.   Again, this is the debate that we can have, this is the debate that  we need to have on this floor, but there is a difference of opinion  here. In this instance, I think with the pervasive efforts put in  place, I believe that this program is one worth keeping.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Fitzpatrick), a former FBI special agent.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Just real briefly, I think one of the issues here is this discussion  of riddled with loopholes and riddled with anybody. It is just a  reminder that agencies not already defined in this cannot just do  random searches of this database. This is something that we have just-- again, let's just push back on the facts of the case.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask how much  time is remaining on both sides, and then also inquire of my good  friend from Florida if he has any more speakers.    Does the gentleman from Florida have any more  speakers?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Florida, my cohort on the  Rules Committee, but I will just also say I appreciate his advice. But  also, as a reminder back to my friend from Florida, we have spent time  talking about things that matter and things that were messed up.   In fact, we spent a lot of time in this House and passed a healthcare  bill because people in my district called me regularly over the  holiday, as the new year approached, saying: We can't get insurance, or  the insurance that I am provided, no doctor will accept.   We have spent time on that. I believe that is real.   We spent time in this body over the past few years working on a bill  called Dodd-Frank that, in my district, decimated community banks and  made lending harder and made businesses have more trouble trying to  hire people to put them to meaningful work. Yes, we are spending time  on things that were not well thought out.   Tax reform was well thought out and is helping Americans in all  districts, including my friend's, and I believe we will continue to  hear more about that as the day progresses.   But today, again, as many times, we are focused on a bill that has  serious debate. It has the reality of some that can take and look at  one thing and see a difference, and I agree with my friends on that.  But that is why we are having this debate. That is why there will be an  amendment on this bill that I oppose and that others will. Some will  support it.   But I tell you one that does not support it: the current  administration does not support the amendment. The current  administration supports the bill, and the relevant committees that have  worked on this bill support the underlying bill.   Number two, one of the issues that we have talked about today and one  of the things we have to be very careful of is going back to something  that was supported by both parties, and that is the recommendations of  the 9/11 Commission report that said that we have to take seriously the  foreign--I respect greatly my friend, former speaker on our side, who  disagrees with this bill, but this is about foreign surveillance. This  is the foreign part of this, and we have got to make sure that we have  that capability.   Really, this bill--if you continue, and especially looking at the  amendment and where others want to go--would build walls that led to  the very problems that we expressed before 9/11.   Then there is this last case that continually comes up, and it was  about the ``about collection,'' which is no longer being done and  practiced. It has been said: Well, we are just codifying it, and they  can bring it back willy-nilly.   Let's remind ourselves of what actually has to happen. They have to  actually decide that, one, they can, and they have to bring it to the  FISC, the court. Oh, wait. Hold on here a second. Let's think about  what just happened here. They have to bring it back to the very court  that said: Oh, we have got a concern about this and why they have  suspended it.   But, Mr. Speaker, let's also talk about why this even occurred, to  start with, with the court. It was because the agencies, the  intelligence communities, self-reported an issue that they needed to  look at. It was not hidden. It was self-reported to the court. This is  the protections built into this legislation.   Now, we can debate whether they go far enough or they are not enough  or they are properly billed. This is sort of like a debate that needs  to happen.   But be careful where we go here, to let the American people be led to  believe that things that are happening are not really happening. Do not  let it be led to believe that there are not things in place set up by  even friends who have spoken today, maybe even against this, that were  put in place to  [[Page H111]]  protect the personal rights of our citizens.   Let's never forget that the end result of this is keeping our Nation  safe while balancing the privacy concerns of our own citizens, which is  never outside of my thoughts and discussions.   For years, the five years that I have been in this body and worked on  the Judiciary Committee, we have pushed this envelope, pushing it for  protection while, at the same time, balancing our national security  needs. I will never say, for the most part, that there is a perfect  bill ever to hit this floor. I would think that my friend would  probably agree with me on that.   So you have to find the balance and ask: What is the aim of the bill?  What is it doing? And how did it go about.   I believe this strikes that balance.   You can have disagreement, but at the end of the day, my question to  you is: Is your push to make something better willing to turn out the  lights or go dark on watching those who wish to do us harm?   Don't bank on the fact that the intelligence community will just  continue on under what has been happening and not look at what could  happen, even as we are in this Chamber debating this bill. I want them  to be able to see clearly the threats to this country. I want them to  use the processes in place to protect American citizens in this  process, which they are doing, which, by the way, was highlighted by  the fact of the self-report that led to the unbalanced collection being  stopped.                                time  1545    But I never would want to put the security of this country in doubt  when they cannot look or they are on shaky legal ground of what they  can and cannot do to protect us. This goes back to a time in our  country's history where we have technology--it was just said recently-- that is changing. I want them to have the ability to continue this  process under the supervision of a plan that is put in place. Where  those need to be adjusted, they can be adjusted.   Are there other needs that need to be addressed? Yes, there are. The  Intelligence Committee chairman and I have spoken on those already. The  Judiciary Committee, also, is looking into these. But at this point in  time, this bill is one that I believe strikes the balance that is  critical for our intelligence and law enforcement communities to have  the tools they need to do their jobs, for our civil liberties and right  to privacy, fundamental to our identity as Americans. I believe the  underlying bill strikes that proper balance.   As we go forward, these are the debates, Mr. Speaker, we need to have  in this Chamber. At the end of the day, it is about getting the bill  and the process right so that we can achieve the aims that need to be  achieved.   As we move forward, I would say this is what happened, this is how we  work, and, for now, I believe this is the proper way to go about it. I  look forward to supporting this rule and the underlying bill to protect  our Nation, the American people, and also to preserve our civil  liberties.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
