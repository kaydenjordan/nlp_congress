 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2668, the  Consumer Protection and Recovery Act, and I am going to urge quick  passage of this legislation.   H.R. 2668 would restore the Federal Trade Commission's authority  under section 13(b) to go after those who have stolen money from  consumers and enable the agency to get this money back to the  consumers.   Restoring this authority is in line with bipartisan FTC leadership  requests, congressional intent, and over 40 years of practice.   And restoring this authority is especially important for  congressional districts like mine where many are struggling to pay the  rent and put food on the table.   Prior to the Supreme Court decision, the FTC had used this essential  authority to return more than $11 billion to consumers who had fallen  victim to unfair, deceptive, and fraudulent practices; and that is just  since 2016.   The FTC currently has pending before it investigations that could  result in returning $2 billion to consumers if this is restored.   Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has made the need for this  legislation even more urgent. During the pandemic, we have seen a rise  in scams that prey on consumers' fears and financial insecurities.   Consumers who have been defrauded deserve to get their money back. We  owe it to them to move quickly and pass H.R. 2668.   I thank Representative Cardenas for his hard work and leadership on  this legislation and Chairwoman Schakowsky and Chairman Pallone for  moving this piece of legislation today. I also thank the Democratic  staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee for all their hard  work on this bill.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation.
