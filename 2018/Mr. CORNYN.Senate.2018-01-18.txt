Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader  clarifying for us what this is all about, and actually I have to thank  the Democratic leader for clarifying that this is really about the  issue of illegal immigration. That is the reason there has been no  agreement on spending caps, because our friends across the aisle don't  want to agree on spending caps because they want to use everything else  as leverage in order to get an outcome on this dispute over illegal  immigration.   As the majority leader pointed out, this isn't so much about what is  in the bill as what they said should be in the bill because I presume  our colleagues are for the 6-year reauthorization of the Children's  Health Insurance Program, which was voted almost unanimously out on a  bipartisan basis in the Senate Finance Committee. The matter of  veterans that the Democratic leader mentioned--well, veterans are going  to be hurt by what they have done or will do tomorrow, I presume, in  defeating this 1-month continuing resolution.   I find it rather disingenuous to say we are against this short-term  continuing resolution because we want another short-term continuing  resolution, guaranteeing that there will yet again be another short- term resolution. Once the spending caps are agreed to, it is going to  take a couple of weeks for the bill to be put together so we can  actually vote on it. So our colleagues across the aisle who say they  want another 3- or 4-day continuing resolution, that guarantees yet  another continuing resolution, and all of this is really camouflage to  hide their true intention--as the majority leader pointed out--trying  to force a decision where there is yet not consensus and a willingness  of the President to support it on the issue of Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals. That deadline for people who can no longer re-sign  up is March 5. In the meantime, nobody is in any jeopardy, none of the  690,000 young people who were brought here as children are in any kind  of jeopardy, and we are having discussions on a daily basis. We had one  today with Senator Durbin. Steny Hoyer, the Democratic whip; the  majority leader in the House, Kevin McCarthy; and I again met with the  White House and Department of Homeland Security to try to make some  progress, and I think there was the beginning of some real progress  toward a resolution.   I find it disingenuous to try to claim that we are killing this 1- month CR,  [[Page S308]]  continuing resolution, because we don't want to hurt the military. This  damages the military because it creates further chaos and uncertainty  when it comes to a long-term spending deal because our military has  been underfunded for way too long. Why? Because our Democratic  colleagues will not agree to fund our national defense until we agree  to raise spending on nondefense matters. So it strikes me as very odd  that you would say you are voting against this continuing resolution  because you are against continuing resolutions only to guarantee that  we will have at least two more and then to claim it is about something  else, when really it is about the matter of illegal immigration.
