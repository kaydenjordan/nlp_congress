 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose  the billionaires' budget. That is exactly what the Republican budget  is. 79.7 percent of it goes to the richest 1 percent.   On top of that, who pays for it? The middle class and working class  families of my district. Some 50 million Americans will be paying more  in taxes, not less, as a result of this tax plan.   Now, I have nothing against the billionaires that my friends on the  other side are so eager to help. I just don't think the working class  and middle class families of my district should be paying for their tax  cuts.   We should instead have a budget that focuses on building the middle  class out, on lifting up those who have been working for the last 15  years and not getting a pay increase. This budget does absolutely  nothing for those families, zero.   On top of all of this, it adds $1.5 trillion to our national debt. It  is wrong. It does not do anything to help the great American middle  class, and it must be rejected.
