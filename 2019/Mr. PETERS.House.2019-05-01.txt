 Mr. Chairman, President Trump has made clear what climate  action he doesn't like. He doesn't like the Paris Agreement, which  contemplated that every nation in the world would set a target to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions.   He doesn't like the Clean Power Plan, which encouraged each State to  create its own strategy to lower greenhouse gas emissions. And he  doesn't like the CAFE standards that required automakers to lower  emissions from cars and trucks.   Now, last month, the President's own EPA administrator came to the  Energy and Commerce Committee, and he testified, and he agreed that  climate change is happening, and that it is driven largely by human  activity.   So the question is, what climate action does President Trump support?  And that is the point of the Climate Action Now Act, which simply  invites the President to tell us his strategy.   Now, there are many options, many bipartisan options, many mentioned  by my colleague from Oregon, Mr. Walden. These are increasing research  into energy storage technologies, pricing carbon, incentivizing more  renewable energy, requiring or incentivizing energy efficiency, easing  regulation for developing renewables, developing carbon capture and  negative emissions technology, or investing in resiliency and more.   And we don't even need the President to draft new ideas. We have got  existing bills from the last Congress and from this Congress we have  assembled into The Climate Playbook, which you can find right on my  Congressional website.   Mr. President, we get that you don't like President Obama's climate  action ideas. Now tell us your climate action plans.   I encourage each of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to join  me in making that request to President Trump by supporting and passing  H.R. 9. Congress has a Climate Playbook.   Mr. President, tell us yours.
