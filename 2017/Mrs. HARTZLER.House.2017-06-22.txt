 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of  today's legislation to advance our country's career and technical  education programs. These programs help students learn the skills  needed to be competitive and set our young people on the path to  success.   I have visited with our manufacturers regularly, and they have  repeatedly told me that more skilled workers are needed.   As a former vocational teacher, I have seen firsthand the fulfillment  a student can find from getting real-world training in a useful skill,  and I am encouraged by the positive steps this bill takes to address  this skill shortfall.   There are many paths to success, and the Strengthening Career and  Technical Education for the 21st Century Act helps us pave the way for  a high-skilled workforce of Americans to have successful, fulfilling  careers.                            ____________________
