 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and add extraneous material on H.R. 2339, the Protecting  American Lungs and Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 866, I call  up the bill (H.R. 2339) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic  Act with respect to the sale and marketing of tobacco products, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of H.R. 2339. This  bill provides a comprehensive approach to address the youth tobacco  epidemic that has unfolded before our eyes in recent years.   The numbers are disturbing. About 6.2 million American middle and  high school students used some type of tobacco product last year, and  one in every three high school students have used a tobacco product in  the last 30 days. These numbers should alarm us all, especially as we  have worked so hard and invested so much to ensure the next generation  doesn't face the same type of tobacco-related disease and death as  those that have preceded them.   It is clear the tobacco industry has employed the same tactics that  they have used for decades to hook young people on new versions of  their products in order to generate new customers that will be addicted  for life. E-cigarette manufacturers like Juul have used slick product  designs, glossy advisements, and sweet flavors to appeal to kids. The  rapid rise of products like these have reversed the progress we have  made in slowing youth tobacco use.   In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that e- cigarette use by high school students has increased by 78 percent  between 2017  [[Page H1263]]  and 2018. Young people have said that kid-friendly flavors like bubble  gum, chocolate, cotton candy, and mango are the driving force behind  why they say they began using e-cigarettes in the first place.   There is also evidence that kids perceive flavored tobacco products  to be less harmful than nonflavored alternatives. And flavors mask the  harshness and flavor of the tobacco, causing young and adult smokers to  smoke more, not less.   But e-cigarettes are not the only contributor to the youth tobacco  epidemic. Research has shown that menthol-flavored cigarettes have  contributed to the increased number of young people smoking. In 2019,  nearly half of middle and high school students who were currently  smoking used menthol cigarettes.   Congressional action is necessary today because President Trump broke  his promise to clear the market of flavored e-cigarettes. The  administration's proposal created giant loopholes, leaving a myriad of  disposable and open tank e-cigarette systems on the market that  continue to attract kids, as well as menthol-flavored products.   While it is important for us to increase the minimum age to purchase  tobacco products from age 18 to 21, which we did, the surge in youth  tobacco usage cannot be reversed just by increasing the age alone. In  order to fully combat this crisis, we need a multipronged approach that  tackles all of the reasons and ways that kids are using these products,  and H.R. 2339 is the solution that we need.   This bill prohibits all flavors that are so popular among kids. It  updates and extends existing marketing and advertising restrictions for  combustible tobacco products to all tobacco products, including e- cigarettes. It restricts the purchase of most tobacco products to only  face-to-face settings and makes it explicitly unlawful to market,  advertise, or promote any e-cigarette product to individuals under the  age of 21. It also invests $2 billion in Federal resources in cessation  support prevention in medically underserved populations, including  racial and ethnic minorities, supplying tobacco cessation therapies and  counseling in community health centers, and funding new strategies for  cessation of menthol tobacco products.   We are proud to have the support of more than 100 organizations,  including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the American Lung  Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Heart  Association, the American Cancer Society, the NAACP, and the National  Medical Association.   Madam Speaker, we have to take decisive action in order to prevent  losing the next generation of our kids to a lifetime of nicotine  addiction. We have to pass this bill, and I urge all of my colleagues  to join us in supporting the legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Clarke), the vice chair of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), who chairs our Consumer Protection and  Commerce Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I want to say that Ms. Pelosi has been so  much out front on trying to move this bill and always thinks of herself  as a mom or, as she says, a grandmother first, and that is why she so  cares about the children.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi), our Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz), a member of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Eshoo), who chairs our Health Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California  an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rush), who is the chairman of our Energy Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Kelly), who is a member of our committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire about the amount of time  remaining on both sides.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close the Committee on  Energy and Commerce's portion, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I respect the ranking member, but I have to say this:  The notion that somehow the Trump administration is doing anything  significant to deal with this youth vaping epidemic or tobacco epidemic  is simply not the case. They are weak-kneed proposals that are not  going to do anything significant.   The problem that we have and what this bill is trying to address is  this: The tobacco companies know that vaping or e-cigarettes are  basically exempted from most of the restrictions that exist now for  regular cigarettes. So what do they do? They go and advertise these  products on TV. They try to convince young people and adults that  vaping and e-cigarettes are a cessation device, which is simply not  true.   The CDC says they are not cessation devices. They hook people; they  addict people; they contain large amounts of nicotine.   The flavors that they promote--whether it be menthol, mango, whatever  it is--make the kids and adults think that these are not tobacco  products or that these are not products that contain nicotine.   Then what do the kids do? Sure, we have legislation now, a statute  that says you can't sell these products to kids under 21, but they go  online. They buy them online. They don't need an ID for that. Or they  get some adult to go to the store and buy the e-cigarettes or  cigarettes for them.   So, we need this legislation. We need to say that e-cigarettes are  deemed a tobacco product. They come under the same restrictions for  advertising and warnings as regular cigarettes. We need to ban online  sales so that kids cannot go online and buy these things without having  an ID. We need to ban flavors across-the-board because that is what  masks the nicotine and makes people think it is okay, that somehow  these are cessation devices, or even that if you smoke a menthol or  mango cigarette, somehow that does not contain nicotine and does not  become addictive.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to please vote for this  legislation. Vote for the kids. It is that important.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                    Request to Add Cosponsors to H.R. 2339     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to add  Congressman  Michael San Nicolas, the Delegate from Guam, and  Congressman   Greg Stanton of Arizona, to be added as cosponsors of the  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from New  York for yielding me this time.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following letters of  support for H.R. 2339:   First, a letter from 76 leading public health organizations; second,  a letter from the NAACP; third, a letter from the National Medical  Association; and fourth, a letter from public health organizations  specifically supporting the menthol prohibition.                                                  February 4, 2020.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: We are writing to express our strong       support for H.R. 2339, the Reversing the Youth Tobacco       Epidemic Act of 2019. This legislation will address the       current youth e-cigarette epidemic that is undermining the       progress made in reducing youth tobacco use.        Use of e-cigarettes by youth has escalated rapidly in       recent years, placing a new generation at risk of nicotine       addiction and tobacco use. Between 2017 and 2019, e-cigarette       use more than doubled among high school students (from 11.7%       to 27.5%) and tripled among middle school students (from 3.3%       to 10.5%). More than 5.3 million middle and high school       students used e-cigarettes in 2019, an alarming increase of       more than 3 million in two years. Use of other tobacco       products, including cigarettes, cigars and hookah, is also a       serious problem. Tobacco use remains the leading preventable       cause of death in the United States and is responsible for       approximately $170 billion in health care costs each year.        The Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act provides a       much-needed response to this serious public health problem.       Its prohibition on flavored tobacco products, including       flavored e-cigarettes, flavored cigars, and menthol       cigarettes, is needed to stop tobacco companies from       targeting and addicting kids with enticing flavors, such as       gummy bear and cotton candy. Flavors mask the harsh taste of       tobacco and make it easier for kids to start to use a tobacco       product and to become addicted.  [[Page H1281]]         The bill's prohibition on flavored e-cigarettes is all the       more important because the Administration's recently released       policy on flavored e-cigarettes will leave thousands of       flavored e-liquids and devices on the market. Flavors are a       key reason for widespread youth use of e-cigarettes. Ninety-      seven percent of current youth e-cigarette users have used a       flavored e-cigarette in the past month, and seven out of ten       said they used e-cigarettes ``because they come in flavors I       like.''        The bill's prohibition on menthol cigarettes, flavored       cigars, and other flavored tobacco products will also help       protect kids and public health. More than half of youth       smokers--and seven in ten African American youth smokers--      smoke menthol cigarettes. As a result of decades of pervasive       tobacco industry marketing, 85 percent of African-American       smokers smoke menthol cigarettes, and menthol is a likely       contributor to the higher rates of tobacco-caused death and       disease experienced by African Americans. A 2013 Food and       Drug Administration (FDA) analysis concluded that menthol       cigarettes increase youth initiation, increase nicotine       addiction, and make it harder for smokers to quit. Cigars are       also available in a wide variety of flavors that make them       more attractive to kids. More than one million high school       students smoke cigars.        In addition to its prohibition on flavored tobacco       products, the Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act       includes a number of other provisions that will help to       reduce youth use of e-cigarettes and use of other tobacco       products, including prohibiting online sales of most tobacco       products, addressing inappropriate marketing and advertising,       and ensuring that FDA will promptly implement the graphic       health warnings on cigarette packs and advertising that are       required under the 2009 Tobacco Control Act.        Youth use of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products is a       problem that will not resolve itself. It will require action       by Congress. The Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act       provides the comprehensive response that is needed. We urge       you to support this important legislation when it comes to       the House floor.

Re NAACP Support for H.R. 2339, the ``Reversing the Youth           Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019''.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's       oldest, largest and most widely-recognized grassroots-based       civil rights organization, I would like to thank you for your       leadership in introducing H.R. 2339, the ``Reversing the       Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019.'' Nearly all tobacco use       begins during youth and young adulthood--which is a crucial       period for the development of the human brain. Your       legislation would help put a stop to tobacco use by including       a ban on all characterizing flavors of tobacco products,       which are often created to appeal to the younger market.        As was noted in our 2016 NAACP resolution, ``Support State       and Local Restrictions on the Sale of Flavored Tobacco       Products,'' ``the tobacco industry has a well-documented       history of developing and marketing brands targeted to       African Americans and their youth'' and further that ``the       tobacco industry manipulated the manufacturing of cigarettes       to ensure the uptake and continued use of tobacco, especially       by AfricanAmerican young people and other vulnerable       populations for many years.'' Your legislation makes clear       that the proliferation of slick new products purposefully       designed to appeal to young people to get them addicted to       nicotine and tobacco should not, and will not, be tolerated.        The use of tobacco and nicotine has evolved since that       first Surgeon General's report. A quick Google search will       lead you to an array of products online, including       cigarettes, cigars, smoking pipes, and the most recent       addition--e-cigarettes. These e-cigarettes are now available       in many flavors and studies show that flavor choices like       mint, candy, fruit, or chocolate draw the interest of teens       in middle school and high school. Unfortunately, while       combustible cigarette use among teens has declined over the       past two decades, there is a widespread--and false--      perception that e-cigarettes are safe.        This false belief threatens any progress we have made in       combatting this controllable public health threat. Recent       data shows that over 3.6 million youth used e-cigarettes in       2018, making this product the most commonly used tobacco       product on the market.        Flavored e-cigarettes have driven the youth epidemic, and       more than half of youth smokers--including seven out of ten       African-American youth smokers--smoke menthol cigarettes, so       it's time to take these products off the market once and for       all. States and cities are standing up and taking action, and       we believe our federal government should do the same.        Thank you again for your leadership on this important       issue, and for your concern for the health and well-being of       future generations.            Sincerely,      Hilary O. Shelton,        Director, NAACP Washington Bureau & Senior Vice President       for Policy and Advocacy.                                   ____                                     National Medical Association,                                  Silver Spring, MD, April 16, 2019.        NMA Applauds the Introduction of Legislation to Ban the       Sale of All Flavored Tobacco Products, including Menthol       Cigarettes and Flavored Cigars        The National Medical Association strongly supports the       Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019 legislation       introduced today. This would prohibit the sale of all       flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes and       flavored cigars. We applaud Representative Frank Pallone (D-      NJ) for introducing the bill and taking this important step       forward.        As the collective voice of African-American physicians, we       know that banning menthol cigarettes will save lives in our       community. Smoking-related illnesses are the number one cause       of death in the African-American community and approximately       45,000 African Americans die each year from smoking-related       diseases. Further, more than 85 percent of African-American       smokers use menthol cigarettes. According to a 2013 report by       the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), when compared to       non-mentholated cigarette use, the ``cooling and anesthetic       properties'' of mentholated cigarette use increases smoking       initiation and the likelihood of becoming addicted in       children and adults and decreases success in quitting       smoking.        As reported by the Surgeon General in a 1994 report by the       U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 90 percent of       smokers first started smoking by age 18. Also, as reported by       B. K. Ambrose in a 2015 article of The Journal of the       American Medical Association (JAMA), a majority of the youth       ages 12-17 first tried flavored tobacco products and that       flavoring was the leading reason for their tobacco use.        For years the tobacco industry has aggressively promoted       menthol cigarettes and other flavored tobacco products in       African-American communities. Taking action to ban menthol       cigarettes is long overdue and the NMA requests that Congress       move swiftly to take up this bill and save lives. To that       end, increased funding should be earmarked to increase       smoking-cessation initiatives  [[Page H1282]]       and increased promotion of same in African American       communities. Our support of this legislation is for the       betterment of the public health.        The National Medical Association is the collective voice of       African American physicians and the leading force for parity       and justice in medicine. The NMA is the oldest organization       of African American professionals in America representing the       over 50,000 African American physicians and the patients we       serve in the United States and its territories.                                    Niva Lubin-Johnson, M.D., FACP,      President.                                   ____                                                   October 16, 2019.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Committee on Energy & Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy & Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Walden: We write       in support of prohibiting menthol cigarettes, which is a key       part of the Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act (H.R.       2339). There is overwhelming scientific evidence that menthol       cigarettes have had a profound adverse effect on public       health. Removing them from the market would drive down       tobacco use and the death and disease it causes, particularly       among youth and African Americans.        Menthol cigarettes are popular with youth. Over half of       youth smokers--and seven in ten African American youth       smokers--smoke menthol cigarettes. Menthol cools and numbs       the throat and reduces the harshness of tobacco, making it       easier and more appealing for youth to start smoking. In       2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a       report finding that menthol cigarettes lead to increased       smoking initiation among youth and young adults, greater       addiction, and decreased success in quitting smoking. An FDA       scientific advisory committee concluded, ``Removal of menthol       cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health       in the United States.''        Smoking-related illnesses are the number-one cause of death       in the African American community and claim the lives of       approximately 45,000 African Americans each year. Menthol       cigarettes are a major reason why. Eighty-five percent of all       African American smokers smoke menthol cigarettes, which is a       direct result of a decades-long marketing campaign by the       tobacco industry aimed at the African American community.       African Americans generally have higher levels of nicotine       dependence as a consequence of their preference for       mentholated cigarettes.        Estimates of the harm menthol cigarettes cause to African       Americans are alarming. The FDA advisory committee found that       the marketing and availability of menthol cigarettes       increases the overall prevalence of smoking and reduces       smoking cessation among African Americans. In 2011, it       estimated that by 2020, 4,700 excess deaths in the African-      American community will be attributable to menthol       cigarettes, and over 460,000 African Americans will have       started smoking because of menthol cigarettes.        Our organizations fully support the menthol prohibition in       the Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act. It will protect       public health and save lives. We look forward to working with       you to advance this bill.

Madam Speaker, supporters have emphasized that this bill  is urgently needed to combat the youth e-cigarette epidemic that is  getting worse every day and is being driven by flavored products. I am  proud of the broad coalition of support that this legislation has  engendered, and I agree with these organizations that the time is now  to ensure we protect our kids and the next generation.   Madam Speaker, if we don't pass this bill today, all of the gains we  have made in the past to prevent tobacco use and nicotine addiction  will simply be wiped out--will be wiped out.   I urge my colleagues, support this legislation. This is the best  thing we can do to prevent this youth epidemic.
