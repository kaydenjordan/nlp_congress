 Mr. President, first of all, I agree with my friend  wholeheartedly. We are asking for a repair. It doesn't make any sense  at all to go down the path of repealing until we make an effort to make  this better and protect the people who are depending on us. With that,  let's see what happens. We are all willing to sit down and work on both  sides of the aisle to help improve it.                             Opioid Abuse Crisis     Mr. President, I rise today because of the crisis we  have with the country's opiate addictions--prescription drugs--in the  Presiding Officer's wonderful State of Alaska, the State of West  Virginia, and every other State in the Union.   West Virginia has the highest drug overdose death rate in the Nation  due to prescription drug abuse. Just in 2016, West Virginia reported  818 overdose deaths, which is 4 times the number that occurred in 2001  and is a nearly 13-percent increase just from 2015, when it was about  607. More than 700 West Virginians died from an opioid overdose last  year, and 42,000 people in West Virginia, including 4,000 youth, sought  treatment for illegal drug use, but they failed to receive it. There is  no place for them to go.   The Presiding Officer and I have spoken about this, and I appreciate  his willingness and openness to look at how we cure that. I have a bill  called the LifeBOAT Act, which the Presiding Officer has been so  graciously looking at. It is something that I believe would give us the  funding mechanism, and it won't be a hardship. It also gives exemptions  for people who have chronic pain from cancer and all the chronic  illnesses that are out there. Basically, the opiate drugs that are sold  on a day-to-day basis by the millions and millions--it is a one-penny  revenue source, one penny per milligram. That would give us the funding  mechanism we need in order to continue to have expanded services for  addiction.   I have been involved in public service for quite some time, and 20  years ago, I would have thought anybody who has fooled with drugs,  whether legal prescription or illicit drugs--it would be a criminal act  and they should go to jail for it. Well, we have put people in jail for  consumption for the last 20 years, and it hasn't cured one. So I have  come to the conclusion, basically, in looking and talking to the  experts, after we have had two decades of evaluating this, that it is  an illness, and an illness needs treatment. We don't have the treatment  centers, so we are letting people go untreated, and that is basically  sinful in this country.   There are 2.1 million Americans who abuse or are dependent on  opioids--2.1 million. I think to get the scope of how bad the situation  is, and this epidemic, when you think about how over 200,000 people  have died since 2000--200,000--any other catastrophic cause of death in  this country would be of pandemic proportions, and we would do whatever  it costs in order to get the National Institutes of Health to find a  cure. We would. But with this, we kind of sit back idly.   According to the CDC, three out of four new heroin users abused  prescription opiates before moving to heroin. It is a segue for people  to move right into tougher, stronger, powerful drugs.   Heroin use has more than doubled among young adults ages 18 to 25 in  the past decade, and 45 percent of the people who used heroin were also  addicted to prescription opiate painkillers. Between 2009 and 2013,  only 22 percent of Americans suffering from opioid addiction  participated in any form of addiction treatment.   Think about the enormity of this epidemic. The United States of  America, our great country, makes up only about 4.6 percent of the  world's population; yet we consume 80 percent of all opiates produced  and consumed in the world. How did it happen? The Presiding Officer and  I grew up in a time when this wasn't prevalent, but how did it happen?   I will tell you one thing: We have to cure it. It is ravaging and  destroying every part of this great country. We are taking so many  productive people out of the workforce because they are addicted. If  you talk to your police and law enforcement anywhere in this country,  they will tell you that 80 to 90 percent of all of the calls they make  in the form of justice are due to opiate or drug use. It is horrible  what it is costing us in real time, in real dollars, in real people's  lives.   There is another bill I have out there, too, and I call it last  chance. It really deals with this. If we know we have a problem--we  have people whom we don't have in the workforce because three things  keep you out of the workforce: You are either addicted or convicted or  lack of skills. You have an addiction; you have been convicted of a  crime, so you have a record; or you have a lack of skills or a  combination of the three.   I can tell you that the addiction and conviction usually go hand in  hand. People who are addicted often have a larceny or maybe even a  felony on their record, and it is so hard for them to get back into the  workforce. If you get them in a treatment center, there is no carrot to  say: Stick with this because you are going to be clean.   It takes a lot of fortitude for a person to stay with the program  when they have such an addiction and a craving. But if they know that  at the end of that 1 year in a treatment center, there is a chance for  them to expunge their record if it wasn't a violent crime, if it wasn't  a sexual crime--but it was probably grand larceny, because usually they  will steal from their family, and then once the family gets tough with  them, they will steal from any type of extended family, and then they  will steal from the neighborhood or anywhere they can get the money to  support their habit.   What my bill says is that after 1 year in a certified treatment  program, they complete another year of mentoring, helping other people  get off and stay off and maybe not start, then they are able to, with  their sponsors--people who say: Yes, they have completed this program;  yes, they have mentored for 1 year--they can go before the arresting  officers and the sentencing judge to see if they can get that expunged  to give  [[Page S1904]]  them a clean start. It is the Clean Start Act. I call it last chance,  but officially it is called the Clean Start Act. It is one way to get  this workforce in America producing again because if not, the only  thing they have waiting for them is a minimum wage job, and the skill  sets most of them have are going to go unused and unproductive. So  these are things we are working on.   When you look at the misuse and abuse of opiates and what it costs  our country, think about this. This was in 2013, the last figures I  have--an estimated $78.5 billion in lost productivity, medical costs,  and criminal justice cost. In 2013, it cost our country $78.5 billion.  So we are paying for it. It is like ``Pay me now or pay me later.'' We  are paying for it.   That one penny on every milligram of opiates that are produced and  consumed in this country would raise about $1.5 to $2 billion a year. I  would hope it would raise none, but it would raise that much because of  the amount of consumption we have. We consume 80 percent of all of the  world's opiates. With that, we can start creating treatment centers and  curing people.   For the past year, I have been coming to the Senate floor to read  letters from West Virginians and those struggling all throughout our  country with opioid abuse. They all mention how hard it is to get  themselves or their loved ones into treatment. Sometimes it takes  months, and sometimes it never happens. Most of the time, it never  happens. This problem stems from a lack of a system to help those who  are looking for help. We need permanent funding. We talked about that.  That is why I introduced the LifeBOAT Act.   Today I am going to read a letter from a mother from West Virginia-- she is no different from a mother from Alaska, I can assure you--who  lost her daughter to drug abuse after she struggled to get her into  treatment facilities she desperately needed. This is Leigh Ann Wilson's  story.         On behalf of the families who have lost their children to       addiction, I ask that any health law reforms contain a       serious effort to ensure effective addiction treatment for       all who need it, whatever it takes.        Just yesterday, the Boston Globe published a special report       about my daughter, Taylor Leigh Wilson.    Leigh Ann's daughter is named Taylor Leigh Wilson.         My youngest child was one of West Virginia's promising       young people, a former Girl Scout, Cabell Midland High School       graduate and Marshall student who wanted to turn her love of       books into a career as a librarian. But drugs destroyed her       life despite her willingness, and months of effort, to get       treatment.        Taylor's overdose was the first--    You have to listen to this because you are just not going to believe  what happened in Huntington, WV, on this day.         Taylor's overdose was the first of 28 that would be       reported in Huntington in the span of five hours on Aug. 15,       2016. The horror of that afternoon made national news. Then       the reporters left. Our nightmare, though, was just       beginning.        Taylor and I would spend the next 41 days trying to get       help. We drove door to door in search of inpatient treatment       beds to isolate her from the heroin world. All we found were       waiting lists; out-of-state centers that wouldn't take West       Virginia Medicaid; and doctors who discouraged Taylor from       inpatient treatment, saying she could do without it.        Then Taylor put her name on Prestera's waiting list for       Suboxone, a drug proven to reduce withdrawal symptoms. No one       told her how long she might have to wait. Though evidence       suggests that the combination of counseling and prescription       drugs to reduce cravings can be very effective, our lawmakers       have restricted the availability of this medication.        On September 28, 2016, Prestera Center called to inform me       that Taylor had been accepted into the Suboxone program.    That was September 28, and, as I told you, this overdose happened on  August 15.         On September 28, Prestera Center called to inform me that       Taylor had been accepted in the suboxone program. I had to       tell her that she had overdosed and died 3 days before. The       next February I got a call from Prestera Pinecrest following       up on Taylor's application for recovery housing and to see if       she was still interested.        Before she passed away, Taylor herself told the Boston       Globe reporter that the real story that needs to be told is       why there are no treatment beds when our state has a crisis       epidemic.    Your State, my State--almost every State in America has this.         Why must it be so hard to get addiction treatment in a       state with the nation's highest drug death rate--818 deaths       last year, most of them from [legal prescription drugs]?    Think about how this epidemic has gotten to this proportion. We have  a drug that is put on the market by the FDA. This is an organization, a  Federal agency, that is supposed to make sure that we have for  consumption a safety net built into it. So the FDA gives their stamp of  approval: This is a product that can be used, and it should be of help.  Then it goes to the DEA to find out who is allowed to dispense it  without any type of education or any type of work to make sure that  there is competency in our doctors who are prescribing it--or I might  say overprescribing it. Then it goes to the doctor, who is the most  trusted person outside of our family, who says: This is going to help  you. This is good for you. This is what we are talking about--what is  killing West Virginians and Americans every day.   If you need heart surgery, you have insurance providers around the  State that would compete for your care. That is what she is saying.  There is someone there; for any other treatment or any other need for  treatment of any illness, we can find help, but not for this.   This has been such a silent killer that I know--and my family  included. Everyone I talk to--anybody I talk to knows somebody in their  immediate family or extended family or a close family friend. All of  our young interns here know the same. They know people. But we keep it  quiet; especially if it's in our family, we keep quiet because it is  embarrassing. We don't want anybody to know that we have failed as a  family structure. Something fell apart for this to happen. Why would  someone have to turn to drugs when they have a loving, caring family?  We just don't understand, so we keep quiet about it.   It isn't a Democrat or Republican or liberal or conservative cause.  This is a killer that has no boundaries; it attacks everybody. That is  what I am saying. When you see a mother who is doing everything she can  to get her daughter somewhere just to save her life and can't get her  in--we are talking about this one penny: What is a one-penny tax, Joe?  I can't vote for any new taxes.   I am not asking you to vote for a tax. I am asking you to look any of  your constituents in the eye and say: We have a program that is  lifesaving for you or your family member. God forbid if you ever need  it, but we have it.   We don't hesitate to put taxes on cigarettes. We didn't hesitate.  Everybody voted for taxes on cigarettes. Everybody has voted for taxes  on alcohol. I am asking for one penny--one penny to save thousands and  thousands of lives in America. I guarantee that there will not be one  person to vote against it--a Republican or Democrat who would not vote  for something that is going to put permanent funding for treatment  centers in the most needed areas in America and saves people's lives.         There aren't enough resources to accommodate the addiction       problem in the heroin capital of the United States, Taylor       [herself told] a reporter. If no one changes it this whole       city will go under.    Let me tell you what this city of Huntington is doing right now. I  met with them last week when I was home. They are going to have a  center of excellence starting with Marshall University, the city of  Huntington, Calvert County, and the entire organization. All the  policymakers are working together because this is something they are  fighting every day. This center of excellence is built around this. We  know we have a problem. We have people overdosing. We are trying to  save lives. We are trying to get them clean, and we are trying to get  them back into the workforce.   The center of excellence is going to start at conception for a mother  who may be using and conceives a child. How do we get her clean? How  does she have a healthy baby versus a drug-addicted baby?   We have Lily's Place down there, and what they are doing in neonatal  care is unbelievable. They are trying to get this baby weaned off the  addiction that the mother passed on in her pregnancy. Then we want to  make sure that mother goes back home with the baby in a clean home  because, if not, the cycle will continue. This is what the center of  excellence is going to do.  [[Page S1905]]    The success we think we are going to have, starting at ground zero in  Huntington, WV, will be able to be shared all over the country because  they are going to take a holistic approach. You just can't say: I am  going to treat the addict. I am going to treat the cause. It goes  further than that. These children are being born to a drug-infested  mother and a father or a person who is paternal or into a family that  is still drug-infested. It does nothing but perpetuate the cycle. This  is what we have to stop if we want to save the country.    Here is what I tell children, and I will tell all of our young  interns. I go to schools and talk every day. I tell them that there is  not another country that will take on the United States of America  militarily. No one compares with the greatest military that the world  has ever known, that history has ever recorded, the United States of  America. It is not going to happen. Nobody can take on this great  economy of ours--the greatest economy in the world, $19 trillion,  almost $20 trillion GDP. The closest economy we have next to us is  China, with an economy that is about half of ours, $10.5 to $11  trillion. Then it drops off the scale with Japan and then Russia.  Russia is at $2.5 to $3 trillion. No one compares to the United States  of America for the economy and military might we have as a superpower-- the only superpower left in the world, the United States of America. We  are the hope of the world, the United States of America.   I tell them: They don't think they have to fight you. They don't have  to take over our economy. They think we will give it to them. They  think we will give it to them because we have a lack of skill sets. Our  education attainment is not as high as what they are doing, and our  addiction problem means we will not be clean enough to be able to  perform. They will just sit back and wait because time is on their  side. They can sit back and wait for us to turn it all over. And you  might be the last generation that lives in our country as the only  superpower, the United States of America. God, I hope that doesn't  happen, but we have to fight this. We just can't continue to keep  talking about it.   We have a good piece of legislation. Think about this: I introduced  this bill a year ago--introduced it to honor Jessie Grubb and her mom  and dad. Her dad served in the State legislature with me. We have been  friends for a long time. Jessie was 30 years old. She was a promising  young girl. She got sexually molested when she was in college. She came  home, hid it from them, was depressed, got started on--they gave her  some pain pills, some drug suppressants so she could cope with it. She  got addicted. She overdosed a few times. She was trying to cure--she  was 30 years old. She had gone to Michigan. She was in treatment. She  had been clean for 6 months. She was a runner, an athlete. She was  doing her first marathon.   She had a hip injury, and she went to the hospital. When she went to  the hospital, her mom and dad went up there. So here was the mom, the  dad, and the girl; they went to admissions. She said: I want you all to  know, I am so proud that I am a recovering addict, and I am 6 months  clean. I want to make sure you all know that. The parents reiterated  it.   She goes into this, and there are no laws--nothing. They ask her all  different types of questions: Are you allergic to penicillin--whatever  it may be? They make sure that her chart is marked right, so that  another attending physician or another attending nurse or the night  shift or whatever looks and sees that they can't do that because it  says she is allergic to that or they shouldn't give her this because of  her condition.   She goes in and she gets treated and she has an infection. They want  to treat the infection, so they put a port in to treat the infection  because that is how she would be treated with that.   The discharging physician did not know she was a recovering addict.  He saw a healthy young lady with an injury and knew that she was going  to have pain, so he prescribed her some pain medication. He prescribed  her 50 OxyContin on the afternoon she was discharged, and she overdosed  and died by 1 in the morning.   Jessie's Law basically says that if the guardian or parent and if the  patient both come in and identify their problem and they want you to  mark their charts accordingly, that should be done. Pretty simple,  right?   Let me tell you what has happened. For 1 year it has been stalled  because of HIPAA privacy laws. All this was going on; 1 year was up,  and I called David. They had written me a letter that said: Do you  think anything will ever happen?   So we went back again and started working on it. Here's what we did  to change it. I said: David, we are going to have to take the parents  or guardians off of it. If the patient themself asks for that, freely  and willingly asks for that, we think that will pass muster, and all  the different interest groups out there that are so concerned will  basically accept that.   So we have that piece of legislation called Jessie's Law. God forbid,  if someone has a constituent or a loved one and it is not known, they  can lose that child, just like that.   These are all things that we are dealing with after the effects of  addiction. Huntington, WV, and Marshall University are going to take on  an effort that I think is heroic: How do we start from the beginning,  conception, and make sure that child doesn't grow up to be an addict,  make sure that family can get clean enough, and make sure they can be  given the responsibility to care for that child so that they can grow  up not in an addicted environment? That is what we are trying to do. We  are at ground zero.   I am hopeful for this great country and this new generation that we  are counting on that they can keep themselves clean and still continue  to be the hope of the world, and they truly are.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
