 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor the  life and legacy of a truly great Hoosier who dedicated his life to  making the world a better and safer place for generations to come.  Senator Richard Lugar passed away over the weekend, with his dear  family by his side, at the age of 78.   The Richard G. Lugar Plaza in Indianapolis is just one tribute to the  truly great statesman and public servant role model he was to so many  people, including to myself. He served our Navy proudly. He was the  mayor of Indianapolis and the longest tenured Member of Congress from  Indiana.   He worked brilliantly and in a bipartisan fashion not only on  security issues but also compassionately on those issues that impacted  Americans every day, including food security both at home and around  the globe, education for young people, energy independence, and free  trade. He skillfully navigated foreign policy matters and earned a  Medal of Freedom for successfully convincing the former Soviet Union to  dismantle their weapons at the end of the Cold War.   No matter the topic at hand, he always made time for the next  generation, to teach and inspire young Hoosiers to serve their country  and to remind all of us that we have more in common as Americans than  we do differences.   We will miss his wisdom and his gentle smile dearly, but his legacy  will endure for generations to come.                            ____________________
