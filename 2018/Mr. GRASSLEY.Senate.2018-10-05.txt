 Madam President, would you inform me of the amount of  time I have to speak.    I thank the Acting President pro tempore.   Madam President, 100 days ago, Justice Kennedy announced his  retirement from the Supreme Court. Shortly thereafter, on July 9, the  President announced the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as  the newest Justice.   Judge Kavanaugh has spent 25 years of his career in public service.  He spent the last 12 years on the DC Circuit--considered the second  most important Federal court in the country. His record there has been  extremely impressive because the Supreme Court adopted a position  advanced in Judge Kavanaugh's opinions no fewer than a dozen times.   Judge Kavanaugh is also a pillar of his community and in the legal  profession. He serves underprivileged communities, coaches girls'  basketball, and is a lector at his church. He has shown a deep  commitment to preparing young lawyers for their careers. He has been a  law professor at three prestigious law schools and a mentor to dozens  of judicial law clerks.   This should have been a respectable and dignified confirmation  process. In a previous era, this highly qualified nominee would have  received unanimous support in the Senate. Before leftwing, outside  groups and Democratic leaders had him in their sights, Judge Kavanaugh  possessed an impeccable reputation and was held in high esteem by the  bench and the bar alike. Even the American Bar Association, which the  Democrats say is their gold standard for judges, gave him its unanimous  ``well-qualified'' rating.   What leftwing groups and their Democratic allies have done to Judge  Kavanaugh is nothing short of monstrous. I saw what they did to Robert  Bork. I saw what they did to Clarence Thomas. That was nothing compared  to what we have witnessed in the last 3 months. The conduct of  leftwing, dark money groups and their allies in this body has shamed us  all.   The fix was in from the very beginning. Before the ink was even dry  on the nomination, the minority leader announced he would oppose Judge  Kavanaugh's nomination with everything he had. Even before he knew the  President's nominee, the minority leader said he was opposed to all 25  [[Page S6560]]  well-qualified potential nominees listed by this President. One member  of my committee said those who would vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh  would be ``complicit in evil.'' Another member of the committee  revealed the endgame when she suggested that Senate Democrats could  hold the vacancy open for 2 years if they defeated Judge Kavanaugh and  took control of the Senate in these midterm elections.   I oversaw the most transparent confirmation process in Senate history  based on the fact of the more than 500,000 pages of judicial writings,  publications, and documents from Judge Kavanaugh's executive branch  service. This is on top of the 307 judicial opinions he authored.  Despite the Democrats' efforts to bury the committee in even more  paperwork, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a timely, 4-day hearing  on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination last month. Judge Kavanaugh testified  for more than 32 hours over the course of 3 days. Judge Kavanaugh  showed the Nation exactly why he deserves to be on the Supreme Court-- because of his qualifications.   Judge Kavanaugh's antagonizers couldn't land a punch on him during  his 3 days of testimony. Even when they made false or misleading  arguments, they couldn't touch him. Some of my colleagues accused Judge  Kavanaugh of committing perjury. For that false claim, the Washington  Post Fact Checker awarded my colleague three Pinocchios. Another  colleague claimed Judge Kavanaugh described contraceptives as  ``abortion-inducing'' drugs. The video my colleague shared on the  internet was doctored to omit the fact that Judge Kavanaugh was  describing the plaintiffs' claims in a case that he had decided and not  his own views. My colleague was awarded four Pinocchios. Those, of  course, are the most Pinocchios you can get.   Yet they still had one big card to play, which they had kept way up  their sleeves for a month--actually, for 45 days, I think. In July, the  ranking member received a letter from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford,  alleging that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school 36  years ago. Instead of referring Dr. Ford to the FBI or sharing these  allegations with her colleagues--either of which would have respected  and preserved Dr. Ford's confidentiality and is what Dr. Ford  requested--the ranking member referred Dr. Ford to Democratic-activist  attorneys who were closely tied to the Clintons. The ranking member  shamefully sat on these allegations for nearly 7 weeks, only to reveal  them at the eleventh hour, when it appeared that Judge Kavanaugh was  headed toward confirmation because he was so qualified.   The ranking member had numerous opportunities to raise these  allegations with Judge Kavanaugh personally. I will give you six  examples.   She could have discussed them with Judge Kavanaugh during their  private meeting on August 20--a meeting which took place after her  staff had sent Dr. Ford to Democratic lawyers--or shared them with 64  of her Senate colleagues who had also met with him individually; the  ranking member's staff could have raised them with Judge Kavanaugh  during a background investigation followup call in late August;  Senators could have asked Judge Kavanaugh about the allegations during  his 32 hours of testimony over the course of 3 days; Judiciary  Committee members could have asked Judge Kavanaugh about this in the  closed session of the hearing, which the ranking member didn't attend.  The closed session is the appropriate place to bring up issues about  which confidentiality is supposed to be respected, and there were no  questions about these allegations among the 1,300 written questions  that had been sent to Judge Kavanaugh after the hearing. This amounts  to more written questions being submitted to this nominee after a  hearing than to all Supreme Court nominees combined.   Keeping the July 30 letter secret deprived Senators of having all the  facts they needed to have about this nomination.   It was not until September 13--July 30 to September 13, nearly 7  weeks after the ranking member received these allegations and on the  eve of the confirmation vote--that the ranking member referred them to  the FBI. Then, somehow, they were leaked to the press. It was not until  those news reports on September 16 that I even learned of Dr. Ford's  identity. This is an outrage. The political motives behind the  Democrats' actions should be obvious to everyone.   Dr. Ford requested the opportunity to tell her story to the Senate  Judiciary Committee. After a lot of foot-dragging by Dr. Ford's  attorneys, they finally agreed to a public hearing. As promised, I  provided a safe, comfortable, and dignified forum for Dr. Ford as well  as for Judge Kavanaugh. Dr. Ford was sincere in her testimony, as was  Judge Kavanaugh, who emphatically denied the allegations.   It is true that confirmation hearings aren't a trial, but trials have  rules based on commonsense notions of fairness and due process, not the  other way around. It is a fundamental aspect of fairness and a  fundamental aspect of due process that the accuser have the burden of  proving allegations. Judge Kavanaugh was publicly accused of a crime,  and his reputation and livelihood were at stake. So it was only fair  that his accuser have the burden of proof. The consensus is, the burden  was not met.   Ultimately, the existing evidence, including the statements of the  three alleged eyewitnesses named by Dr. Ford, refuted Dr. Ford's  version of the facts. Our investigative nominations counsel, Rachel  Mitchell, who has nearly 25 years of experience in advocating for  sexual assault victims and in investigating sex crimes, concluded there  was a lack of specificity and simply too many inconsistencies in Dr.  Ford's allegations to establish that Judge Kavanaugh committed sexual  assault even under the lowest standard of proof.   She concluded:         A ``he said, she said'' case is incredibly difficult to       prove. But this case is even weaker than that. Dr. Ford       identified other witnesses to the event, and those witnesses       either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them.       For the reasons discussed below, I do not think that a       reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the       evidence before the Committee. Nor do I believe this evidence       is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance-of-the-evidence       standard.    We have thoroughly investigated Judge Kavanaugh's background.   In addition to the prior six FBI full-field background investigations  with the interviews of nearly 150 people who have known Judge Kavanaugh  his entire life, the committee also separately and thoroughly  investigated every credible allegation we received. Our more than 20  committee staff members have worked night and day over the last many  weeks in tracking down virtually all leads, and at the request of  undecided members, the FBI reopened Judge Kavanaugh's background  investigation for another week.   The FBI interviewed 10 more people related to the latest credible  sexual assault allegations, and the FBI confirmed what the Senate  investigators already concluded, which is this: There is nothing in the  supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already  know.   These uncorroborated accusations have been unequivocally and  repeatedly rejected by Judge Kavanaugh, and neither the Judiciary  Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to  any of the allegations. There also is no contemporaneous evidence.   This investigation found no hint of misconduct, and the same is true  of six prior FBI investigations conducted during Judge Kavanaugh's 25  years of public service. Nothing an investigator, including career FBI  special agents, does could ever be good enough to satisfy the  Democratic leadership in Washington, who staked out opposition to Judge  Kavanaugh before he was even nominated.   There is simply no reason, then, to deny Judge Kavanaugh a seat on  the Supreme Court on the basis of the evidence presented to us. The  Democratic strategy used against Judge Kavanaugh has made one thing  clear: They will never be satisfied, no matter how fair and thorough  the process is.   Thirty-one years after the Senate Democrats' treatment of Robert  Bork, their playbook remains the same. For the leftwing, advice and  consent has become search and destroy, a demolition derby.   I am pleased to support Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation. I am sorry  for what the whole family has gone through the last several weeks. We  [[Page S6561]]  should all admire Kavanaugh's willingness to serve his country, despite  the way he has been treated. It would be a travesty if the Senate did  not confirm the most qualified nominee in our Nation's history.   The multitude of allegations against him have proved to be false.  They have also proved that no discussion of his qualifications have  shown he wasn't qualified. We had a campaign of distraction from his  outstanding qualifications, a campaign of destruction of this fine  individual.   What we have learned is the resistance that has existed since the day  after the November 2016 election is centered right here on Capitol  Hill. They have encouraged mob rule.   When you hear about things like ``Get in their face; bother people at  every restaurant where you can find a Cabinet Member''--these are  coming from public servants who ought to set an example of civility in  American society, and it has been made worse by what has happened to  Judge Kavanaugh.   I hope we can say no to mob rule by voting to confirm Judge  Kavanaugh.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, before I speak, I ask unanimous consent  that following my remarks and those of Senators Schumer and McConnell,  all postcloture time be considered expired on this nomination.    Mr. President, I come one final time in support of  Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation to serve as Associate Justice of the  United States Supreme Court.   Democratic leaders did everything in their power to make Judge  Kavanaugh's confirmation about anything except his judicial record and  his outstanding academic qualifications. The Democratic leaders  promised to oppose Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation from day one and use  every play in the book to accomplish that goal.   Even though the Senate had access to more of Judge Kavanaugh's  records than we have had for any other Supreme Court nominee,  Democratic leaders tried to bury the Judiciary Committee in mountains  of irrelevant paperwork.   When routine process arguments failed, they resorted to outright  character assassination of the judge. Their smear campaign featured  baseless allegations of perjury and claims that, as a teenager, he  participated in gang rapes of women.   I have been around long enough to see ugly leftwing smear campaigns  against Supreme Court nominees, but this was beyond the pale--even  beyond Judge Thomas and Anita Hill, and I was there.   I am encouraged that most of my colleagues had the courage to stand  against the politics of personal destruction. Ignored in the media  circus that the Democratic leaders created was Judge Kavanaugh's  extraordinary record as a judge and also as a citizen.   I have said from the day the President announced Judge Kavanaugh's  nomination on July 9 that Judge Kavanaugh is quite possibly the most  qualified person ever nominated to the Supreme Court. He has spent 25  years of his career at the highest levels of government, including the  last 12 years as a judge on the second most important Federal court.   Judge Kavanaugh's record on the DC Circuit has been outstandingly  remarkable. On a court containing some of the brightest legal minds,  Judge Kavanaugh has set himself apart. The Supreme Court, in at least  12 separate cases, adopted positions advanced in Judge Kavanaugh's  lower court opinions.   As the liberal law professor, Amar, wrote in the New York Times:         Good appellate judges faithfully follow the Supreme Court;       great ones influence and help steer it. Several of Judge       Kavanaugh's most important ideas and arguments . . . have       found their way into the Supreme Court opinions.    Judge Kavanaugh will not only bring his keen intellect and deep  knowledge of the law to the Supreme Court; he will bring some other  very important judicial characteristics as well. First among these is a  proper understanding of the role of a judge in our constitutional  system. He knows that a judge should interpret and apply law as  written, not how he wishes it were written. As we all know, it is  Congress's job to write the laws, not judges'.   He has explained in numerous cases that the fundamental goal of the  separation of powers under our constitutional system is the protection  of individual liberty. He has interpreted the  [[Page S6695]]  Constitution according to text, history, and tradition, not his own  personal views. That is exactly the type of a person we need on the  Supreme Court.   Judge Kavanaugh has also demonstrated judicial independence and  courage. In the 2 years after he was appointed to the DC Circuit by  President George W. Bush, he ruled against Bush administration agencies  on 23 cases. So don't let anybody tell you that he is obligated to  President Trump. We can expect that Justice Kavanaugh will be beholden  to no one and nothing except the Constitution.   Judge Kavanaugh also has a well-earned reputation for collegiality.  He has an excellent relationship with all of his colleagues on the DC  Circuit, and his judicial record demonstrates the same.   Indeed, Judge Kavanaugh was in the majority in 97 percent of the  cases that he participated in on that DC Circuit. His Democratic- appointed colleagues were as likely to join majority opinions written  by Judge Kavanaugh as his Republican-appointed colleagues were. He will  bridge the divide on the Supreme Court.   Judge Kavanaugh has also shown a dedication to public service, to  mentorship, and to diversity. He spent all but 3 years of his legal  career in public service. Judge Kavanaugh is a proven mentor to law  students and young lawyers.   Judge Kavanaugh has taught courses at Harvard Law School and other  top law schools for many years. The Senate Judiciary Committee received  a letter in support of his confirmation from these former students.  They wrote:         We may have differing views on political issues surrounding       the confirmation process, but we all agree on one thing:       Judge Kavanaugh is a rigorous thinker, a devoted teacher, and       a gracious person.    Federal judges also play a very important role in mentoring the next  generation of lawyers by hiring law clerks. Judge Kavanaugh has clearly  taken seriously this mentorship role. His former law clerks submitted a  letter to this committee strongly supporting his confirmation.   I quote from that letter:         It was a tremendous stroke of luck to work for and be       mentored by a person of his strength of character, generosity       of spirit, intellectual capacity, and unwavering care for his       family, friends, colleagues, and us, his law clerks.    One of the areas in which Judge Kavanaugh has had a particular impact  is in his commitment to diversity. More than half of his law clerks  have been female. When confirmed to the Supreme Court, his class of law  clerks will be all female--for the first time in the history of the  Supreme Court.   Judge Kavanaugh's female law clerks sent the committee a letter,  which reads:         We know all too well that women in the workplace still face       challenges, inequality, and even harassment. Among other       things, women do not enjoy a representative share of       prestigious clerkships or high-profile legal positions, but       this committee and the American public more broadly should be       aware of the important work Judge Kavanaugh has done to       remedy those disparities. In our view, the judge has been one       of the strongest advocates in the Federal judiciary for women       lawyers.    As I think about history, it leads me to this: The confirmation of  Judge Kavanaugh is particularly meaningful to me. Thirty-one years ago,  leftwing groups and their Senate allies fired the opening shots in the  judicial confirmation wars. They engaged, at that time, in  unprecedented character assassinations against President Reagan's  nominee, Judge Robert Bork.   Since then, they have only escalated this war--slandering several  Republican nominees to the Supreme Court and expanding their tactics to  lower court nominees. So then, as history tells us, more than three  decades later, leftwing groups and their Democratic allies in this body  went back to the very same playbook. They tried the very same character  assassination tactics against the person nominated to the very same  seat that Judge Robert Bork was supposed to fill.   They succeeded 31 years ago, but, this time, they failed. So I look  forward to voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh this afternoon and to  greeting him as ``Justice Kavanaugh'' the next time I see him.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   (Disturbance in the Visitors' Gallery.)   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Sergeant at Arms will restore order in the  Senate.   The clerk will call the roll.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber  desiring to vote?
