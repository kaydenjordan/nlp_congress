 Madam President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Jacobs Lumber Company, Inc., in Kamiah as  the Idaho Small Business of the Month for January 2022.   Jacobs Lumber Company is a full-service lumber and hardware store  that provides housing and construction services in a one-stop shop.  Founder and owner Keith Jacobs has long had a hand in Kamiah's lumber  industry. At 14 years old, Keith began his career at Kamiah's Bi-Rite  Lumber Company, where he worked until it was sold in 1993. After a few  years working out of State, Keith returned home to Kamiah and founded  Jacobs Lumber Co. in 1997.   Jacobs Lumber Company is renowned for a deep commitment to its  customers and community. The business sources products from local  loggers and fellow small businesses throughout the region, ensuring its  customers have the best quality products. Keith attributes much of his  company's success to the relationships they have cultivated with their  customers. This hometown-driven approach to business has helped build  communities and welcome newcomers to our great State.   The Jacobs family is also committed to giving back to its patrons. In  March 2021, the company was honored as the first recipient of the  Kamiah School District's Community Business Award. Jacobs Lumber  Company maintains a strong tradition of supporting Kamiah schools,  athletic programs, and camps. Jacobs has passed along his commitment to  service and community, hard work, and charity to his own children.  Today, Keith co-owns the company with his son, Slade, promising to  serve the people of Kamiah for generations to come.   Congratulations to Keith, his family, and all of the employees of  Jacobs Lumber Company, Inc. on being selected as the Idaho Small  Business of the Month for January 2022. You make our great state proud,  and I look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
