 Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friend, Chairman Jordan,  yielding to me. I thank my friend, Representative Ann Wagner, for  introducing this important bill again--no better person than a mama and  a grandmama--and she does a good job at both of those.   Madam Speaker, babies deserve a chance to live. They deserve a chance  at life no matter their age or their circumstance. The Constitution  says that people have a right to life. The science says babies are  people.   The Democrats have been pushing, trust the science. Follow the  science. Trust the science. Follow the science, the last 2 years. Yet,  we are denying the science, Madam Speaker.   When I was a little boy, I was asking my mama--we were talking about  abortion and we were talking about babies being born that were maybe  disabled or had some other anomaly, and I said: Mama, what would we do  if one of those babies was born and I was the father of one of those  little babies?   And she said: Honey, we would love that baby just a little more.   Madam Speaker, we need to love those babies just a little more and  not murder them.
