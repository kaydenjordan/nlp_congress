 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the  University of South Carolina Board of Trustees selecting Dr. Michael  Amiridis as the new university president. As established by Dr. Harris  Pastides, he continues the importance of Greek heritage so meaningful  for the people of South Carolina.   Having previously spent over 20 years on the USC campus, President  Amiridis returns from the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he  has been chancellor. As President Amiridis is already familiar with the  university community, I am confident that the school, branch campuses,  and students will benefit from his appreciation of the extraordinary  Gamecock traditions.   Shortly after being selected, President Amiridis said, ``Through  academics, research, and its vibrant culture, the university system is  critically important to the people of South Carolina and to the State's  future. I feel privileged to be able to lead this great institution.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the safe haven in Afghanistan to America.                            ____________________
