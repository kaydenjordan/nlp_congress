 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special  Order.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friends  for joining us on the floor tonight at this late hour. It has been a  long day on Capitol Hill, but there are things that need to be said  here.   It is December again, and of course that means that we are in the  homestretch of a new Congress, this Congress, the 117th. The  homestretch of any Congress, as we know, is when the threat of bad  legislating is at its most pronounced. We have certainly seen all that  here this week.    Government appropriations have been taken hostage by Democrats who  want to spend even more. They seem to have forgotten about the  trillions of dollars that have already been spent earlier this year.   The NDAA has been taken hostage just today by Democrats who think the  right to vote is under some sort of secret threat. I guess they didn't  pay attention to the massive voter turnout in Georgia just yesterday.   Here tonight, they rushed through a rule to codify same-sex marriage  and create a private right of action that will vilify and supercharge  attacks on people of faith.   Madam Speaker, this lame duck session is doing serious and lasting  harm to our Republic, and I guess it is a fitting end to this--what  really has been a disastrous Congress overall under Democrat rule. We  have with trillions upon trillions in government spending, sending  inflation for all American families soaring.   We have had votes on immensely consequential, complex, thousand-plus- page bills, handed to us just hours before those votes. We have had  Members dial into congressional hearings from their bedrooms and  basements and even while on vacation in Europe--proxy voting.  Thankfully, this is all about to come to an end, mercifully in less  than a month.   The American people have spoken and the American people have given  Republicans control of this body to provide accountability and produce  results.   Madam Speaker, this is a legislative body and it is high time for  this body to get back to the work that we are supposed to be doing for  the American people. Come January, that is exactly what we intend to  do.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining us here today to  talk about all of it.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great State of  Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. That is  so well said. There are so many issues to cover.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Madam Speaker, I thank the doctor for  highlighting that. It is such an important issue, and just one more  example of so much that has gone wrong here.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Burchett).    Madam Speaker, I really do have the honor  to yield next to a friend and colleague who will be retiring at the end  of this Congress.   Since 2005, he has represented the dozen counties stretching nearly  120 miles down Texas' eastern border with Louisiana. I represent one of  his neighboring districts over that border; and in our region and, in  fact, I can say nationwide, Congressman Louie Gohmert is a household  name.   Prior to his election to Congress 9 terms ago, he served as a  district judge in Texas, and Chief Justice of the Twelfth Court of  Appeals of Texas. He is also a captain in the U.S. Army. He served our  Nation bravely.   Judge Gohmert has been a bold defender of America's founding  principles his entire life and career; and whether he is leading a  debate in our House Judiciary Committee, or in the Natural Resources  Committee, or setting the example for all of us with his tireless  advocacy here on this House floor, Louie Gohmert has been a consummate  servant for the people and for our great Nation.   Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Texas (Mr. Gohmert), my friend and my colleague.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for his  comments. He has been a great example for that, and that was a fitting  end to a long career and a lot of hours here on this floor articulating  the truth and standing for America's founding principles.   Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), another good friend, colleague, and a  patriot.                        Recognizing A. Keith McDonald     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  fitting into the hour and honoring Mayor Keith McDonald. He sounds like  a faithful public servant and one I wish I had the pleasure of knowing.  We commend him on his long public service, and it is fitting that we do  that on the night that we are bidding farewell soon to our friend and  colleague, Congressman Louie Gohmert, as well.   These are the kind of faithful public servants that the Founding  Fathers had in mind, that they would serve selflessly for a long tenure  and give themselves to their community.   Madam Speaker, I know the clock has wound up and I am out of time,  and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
