 Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Ukrainian Caucus, I rise  to strongly condemn Russia's dangerous assault on Ukrainian ships in  the Kerch Strait. Russia's blockade of Ukrainian ports should alarm the  world.   As Russian dictator Vladimir Putin attempts to tighten his bloody,  illegitimate grip on the Crimean peninsula and his ill will on the  people of Ukraine, the free world cannot sit back and watch.   Crimea and its surrounding waters belong to the people of Ukraine. No  amount of propaganda can cover Russia's egregious human rights record  in Crimea, including the illegitimate detainment of Oleg Sentsov.   We stand shoulder to shoulder with the international community and  our NATO allies in our unshakeable commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty  and freedom. We stand in steadfast solidarity with the Ukrainian  people. Russia must understand that its actions have consequences.   We must not hesitate to work with our European allies to increase  sanctions on Putin's cronies to punish this continued, flagrant  aggression. We demand that Russia withdraw from Crimea and Eastern  Ukraine.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, tomorrow President Trump will claim victory  as the United States, Canadian, and Mexican officials gather to sign a  replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement. But let us  make no mistake, this is far from a finished deal.   Congress has the final say on trade. From where we stand today, what  has been called NAFTA 2.0 still requires work to reach standards  acceptable to the American people and American workers and companies.   How can any President claim this victory the same week General Motors  announces the idling of five North American facilities, and as it cuts  15,000 living-wage jobs, including one in Lordstown, Ohio, not even  counting the thousands and thousands more jobs that will be lost in the  automotive parts sector in our country. What an affront to every  promise President Trump has made American manufacturing towns.   Ohio's trade message to our Nation is as loud and clear as it always  has been. The job outsourcing destruction due to the original NAFTA  deal, which passed a quarter century ago, over my great objection on  this floor, continues to reverberate across our State and Nation.   Now, we just saw at Lordstown, another, at that plant, 1,600 General  Motors jobs, and upwards of 5,000 total job losses when the auto  suppliers are counted at just that one facility.   Following the original NAFTA's implementation, town after town lost  good jobs with good wages and benefits.   How many times must America's towns and workers bear witness to  NAFTA's vast U.S. job outsourcing and wage drag? How many more?   Millions have suffered firsthand as dire predictions actualized and  the false promises of NAFTA job creation failed to materialize.  Instead, they personally experienced the great sucking sound of job  outsourcing, just what we said here on this floor back in the early  1990s.   Whether GM's decision was at all influenced by NAFTA 2.0 is  irrelevant. American trade deals have far too long allowed corporate  America to run rampant over America's workers as they seek out the  penny-wage laborers who can't afford to buy what they make.   I have a couple of charts here that I want to bring to the floor to  describe what has been happening across this continent now for a  quarter century, and what is upsetting the American people.   Millions of U.S. jobs have been obliterated year after year, as  replacement workers toil and work in unsafe sweatshops and maquiladoras  south of the border exposed to unimaginable toxins.   The original NAFTA was supposed to create trade surpluses for the  United States. It was supposed to create job growth in the United  States. And you know what has happened? Exactly the reverse.  [[Page H9732]]    These are the numbers just for the year of 2016. You can see how big  the trade deficit is with Mexico, nearly $70 billion and with Canada,  $8 billion. Now, that is up fourfold since back in the early nineties,  before NAFTA was passed, when we already had a small trade deficit with  those countries, but it has just exploded.   The original NAFTA fueled massive migration on the Mexican side from  their countryside to our Nation as millions upon millions of small  farmers' livelihoods were extinguished in Mexico. Mexico's white corn  industry was decimated.   Why do you think people fled to the United States? If you were  hungry, and you had nothing, and you lived in desperation, well, you  might do the same. What a humanitarian tragedy has been occurring for  over a quarter century. And yet, policymakers in the United States and  Mexico close their eyes to the human tragedy.   Trade with our closest neighbors is never simply a zero-sum game.  There have been lots of losers. In fact, our country's been a loser.   Yeah, there are some pockets of transportation jobs down at the  border. Anybody would expect that. But overall, a net loser.   And guess what? Under the Trump administration, the red ink is  growing.   In the nearly 3 decades since NAFTA's original passage, we have not  even had 1 year of balanced trade accounts, which is the true measure  of whether a trade agreement is successful or not.   So we look at the Trump trade figures here, going across the months,  and you look at the red line. Every month the trade deficit grows,  including with Mexico and Canada; not even 1 year of balanced trade  accounts, and the numbers are getting worse.   NAFTA provided vivid evidence of a severely-flawed trade agreement  that failed America's workers and communities as plant after plant  shuts down. And you know, the sad tragedy is, at Lordstown, the third  shift was gone a couple of years ago. But as the second shift left this  week, they were told by the GM officials in the plant, these jobs are  going to Mexico.   Beyond just the NAFTA deficit, all our global trade deficits have  ballooned under this administration's erratic trade and tariff agenda.  It makes no sense.   General Motors says that one of the reasons they are moving the jobs  to Mexico is because of the cost of the Trump tariffs, and that they  have had to pay several billion dollars more for steel that goes into  making these vehicles.   Well, you know, in this wake, a modern NAFTA agreement to correct all  of the injustices associated with continental trade is long overdue. I  have eagerly anticipated the release of specific text in this NAFTA 2.0  and strategic agenda from the administration on how President Trump  plans to bring jobs back to America. He actually promised that in all  the towns that have just gotten these pink slips. He said it in  Youngstown. He told the people in Warren, Michigan, that they never  had to worry if they voted for him; that they would never have a plant  close down.    Well, guess what? General Motors is closing down the transmission  facility in Warren, Michigan.   Thus far, both the trade deficit and the job outsourcing continue to,  as the expression goes, go south. These numbers are going to get much  worse for the workers and communities in our country.   And the workers in Mexico, since NAFTA's passage, guess what? Their  wages are going down. What kind of a system is this?   Anything short of specifics in this redone agreement that will  clearly improve job prospects for Americans will fall short of Trump's  promises.   Mr. Speaker, this is too important a moment to hang America's economy  on faulty assumptions. We, in Congress, not I, but some in Congress,  fell for NAFTA in 1994. We can't let it happen again.   The signing of text tomorrow leaves with us a lot of work yet to  complete. Let Congress do its job.   Has this administration answered the question of whether the job  outsourcing bonanza that has taken hold since NAFTA's passage in 1994  has truly been addressed?   It is hard to believe that will be the case, given the current news  about General Motors; and that is not the only company moving jobs out  of this country.   Have strong labor standards been included in NAFTA 2.0 subject to  swift and certain enforcement? No.   Will corporate interests retain the means to outsource American jobs,  to take advantage of rock-bottom Mexican wages? Yeah, they will.   Will we protect the rights of Americans to know what is in the food  they are feeding their families, or will trade facilitation hold  priority over food safety?   Congress has to ask, will Americans have access to affordable  prescription drugs made in Mexico, or will the new NAFTA further rig  the system to delay access to more affordable and safe generic drugs  and biosimilars?   Globally, will we work to open closed and controlled markets?   Will we equalize the negative impact of the value-added tax in our  trade agreement? There is nothing in this on that.   Will tax policy stop favoring outsourcing? No, actually the Trump tax  bill favored more outsourcing.   Democrats look forward to holding hearings and oversight of how these  questions will truly impact all of America and America's workers and  communities. We have called on this administration to work with us to  reach necessary and substantive achievements.   There is a new administration taking power in Mexico itself. We need  to listen and work with them.   Any new North American trade agreement must raise wages and create a  level playing field across the board. The American people are not  interested in staged production signing ceremonies. They want a NAFTA  deal that is fixed and that will create good-paying jobs in America  with benefits you can depend upon and heal the economic injustices  suffered for the past 3 decades as people are exploited by institutions  more powerful than themselves.   And if America is going to be the leader of the free world, she has  to be the leader in free trade agreements that are fair and offer the  opportunity of rising living standards for all people, not harming  people, but helping people.   Trade is not just about goods, it is about people. We have to put  people first. We have to put people at the top of the agenda. We have  to put workers at the top of the agenda and treat them for their true  worth, and not any longer allow trade deals like NAFTA to hollow them  out, to hollow their communities out, and to hollow America out.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
