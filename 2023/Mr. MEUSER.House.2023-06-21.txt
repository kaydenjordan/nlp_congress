 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of Ways and Means, my  good friend from Missouri, very much for having this important debate  for the CHOICE Arrangement Act.   Mr. Chairman, this bill does nothing more than expand the association  health plans. Businesses want to have current coverage that exists  today. They can keep it. President Trump years back enacted an  expansion of association health plans which greatly benefited the  farmers in my district and the small businesses in my district to find  plans that suited them.   They used the power of their numbers to reduce costs 29 percent. We  have better coverage, preferable to the entities, at lower costs. If  they like their current coverage, they can keep it. It sounds way too  logical, apparently, for this body. There is no logical reason to  oppose H.R. 3799 other than for special interests or political  motivation.
