 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   The motto of my home State of South Carolina is ``Dum spiro spero.''  That is a Latin phrase for: ``While I breathe, I hope.''   Today, as the House prepares to vote on the historic George Floyd  Justice and Policing Act, those words take on a new meaning and a very  special meaning for me. In this moment, the haunting words of this  legislation's namesake, ``I can't breathe,'' echo in the streets daily.   In Mr. Floyd's case, his breath was literally being snuffed out as he  cried out for his dead mother. But for so many Blacks in our country  today, ``I can't breathe'' is just another way of saying, ``I have no  hope.''   Today, this august body is going to pass a piece of legislation that  will begin the process of restoring hope, hope to many whose ancestors  fought for centuries to be included in the Nation's vision of liberty  and justice for all.   This legislation gives us an opportunity to live up to what Alexis de  Tocqueville observed about America's greatness. He wrote:         America is not great because it is more enlightened than       any other nation, but rather because it has always been able       to repair its faults.    Today, we are seeking to repair some faults in our policing system, a  policing system whose foundation was built upon two pillars of  experiences, one by a group of Americans who came to America of their  own free will in search of freedom, the other by a group of Americans  who came to America against their will and were enslaved for 244 years.   Vestiges of that system are still evident in today's law enforcement  culture. Chokeholds on Black arrestees, no-knock entries into Black  residences, militarized police forces in Black communities, and  qualified immunity are all intended to preserve rather than serve,  intended to protect perpetrators of excessive use of force rather than  improve conditions and communities.   Today, House Democrats and, I hope, some of our Republican colleagues  will say by their votes that enough is enough, that it is time to apply  the greatness of America equitably and to all our citizens.   But we cannot stop here. Recent occurrences have exposed and shone a  spotlight on inequities in our healthcare system, inadequacies in our  educational system, and inappropriateness in our electoral system.  Liberty and justice for all remains a deferred dream for far too many.   Job losses, challenges in healthcare, eviction threats--people are  trying to catch their breath. If they can't breathe, they can't hope.   As a proud South Carolinian, I believe in and try to live by that  principle: ``While I breathe, I hope.'' With the passage of the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act, we will all breathe a little freer and  gain a little more hope.
