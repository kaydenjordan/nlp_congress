 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Dr. Frank M.  Barker, Jr., who passed away on December 27, 2021. Dr. Barker was a  humble man of great faith who lived his life in faithful service to his  savior, Jesus Christ: loving and serving others, giving to those in  need, and sharing the good news that God sent His only Son to Earth to  save those who could not save themselves.   A lifelong resident of Birmingham, Alabama, Dr. Barker was a graduate  of Ramsey High School in 1949, a graduate of Auburn University with a  degree in engineering, and a lifelong Auburn Tiger fan. He served his  country as a jet fighter pilot in the U.S. Navy, including service  during the Korean war.   After attending seminary, Dr. Barker founded Briarwood Presbyterian  Church in Birmingham, leading a congregation that was committed to  reaching the world for Christ. Through his leadership, Dr. Barker  played an important role in the formation of the Presbyterian Church in  America, a denomination that remains committed to the inerrancy and  authority of Holy Scripture.   I know that Dr. Barker's life and legacy will continue to be an  inspiration to others and a model for living a life of generosity and  faithfulness.                            ____________________
