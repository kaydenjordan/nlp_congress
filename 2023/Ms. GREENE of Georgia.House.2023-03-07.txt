 Mr. Speaker, today I announce that I am  reintroducing my bill, the Protect Children's Innocence Act. This bill  will stop gender-affirming care on children. It will protect children  from the heinous and evil ideology that is grooming kids and making a  profit off of horrific surgeries that mutilate their genitals, give  them life-altering medications like puberty blockers, hormone therapy  that will have permanent damage to their bodies for the rest of their  lives before these kids are even grown up, before they have graduated  from high school, before they are old enough to vote, before they are  old enough to get a tattoo--ink on their own skin--before they are old  enough to join the military, before they are old enough to make adult  decisions.   This is an important bill that Congress must pass.   My bill will charge any person who knowingly performs gender- affirming care on a minor with a Class C felony. It will prohibit all  taxpayer-funded gender-affirming care. It will prohibit institutions of  higher education from providing instruction on gender-affirming care.   There is nothing affirming about lying to children that they can  change  [[Page H1120]]  their gender because you cannot change your gender.   My bill will deem aliens who are determined to have performed gender- affirming care on a minor as ineligible to receive visas or be admitted  into the United States.   We need to take a strong stand in the United States of America that  we do not abuse our children or sexualize them in any way.   This is an important bill that must be passed, and I will give you  some examples.   In 2021, there was a father in Texas who lost custody of his twin 7- year-old sons because he attempted to stop one of the boys from  transitioning his gender. The mother began transitioning the boy when  he was only 2 years old and then tried to enroll him in a pediatric  gender clinic at age 5. This child, this young boy, needs to be  protected, and his father has the rights to do it. They didn't give him  his rights.   Last summer, Boston Children's Hospital released videos promoting  gender dysphoria and offering sterilization, castration, and mutilation  of children. These videos not only explained its genital mutilation  surgeries, but they were also promoting these surgeries to kids and  their parents. By the way, this is for profit.   Also, just recently, Jamie Reed, who worked at one of more than 100  pediatric gender clinics across the United States, publicly came out to  discuss the atrocities happening to children at these gender clinics.   When a female takes testosterone, the profound and permanent effects  of the hormone can be seen in a matter of months. Voices drop, beards  sprout, body fat is redistributed, sexual interest explodes, aggression  increases, and mood can be unpredictable. One of the side effects  includes sterility.   As a matter of fact, after only 4 to 5 years of taking testosterone,  there have been many young women under the age of 18 that have had to  have hysterectomies because of the damage done inside of them.   Even more horrific is the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom,  signed a bill into law to provide refuge for trans kids and their  families. This bill will protect trans kids and their families that  flee to California from States like Alabama, Texas, or Idaho, or any  other State criminalizing the parents of trans kids for allowing them  to receive gender-affirming care.   My bill will protect these children and stop a State like California  and the monsters and the groomers and the child predators in that State  that look to damage them before they ever grow up.   There are many States that are working hard to protect kids, but we  don't have enough States doing it. That is why it is the responsibility  of Republicans in Congress to protect children.   This is imperative.   We know what the left is trying to do, and we should have listened to  them when they told us. Remember the San Francisco men's choir actually  singing a song announcing that they are coming for our children? That  is a threat that we should not ignore.   We have had enough with drag queen shows in elementary schools and  middle schools and high schools. We have had enough of drag queens  gyrating in front of children in the public square.   These groomers and child predators must be stopped because they are  sexualizing children for profit in a multibillion-dollar medical  industry that looks to grow and grow. Something must be done to protect  the sacred identity of children because God made children and God made  all of us, male and female, in His image, and God doesn't make  mistakes.   I urge every single Republican and all Members of Congress to  cosponsor my bill. We must get it passed. This isn't just a Republican  issue. This is an issue across the board. All voters agree.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I announce that I am introducing  a House Resolution to designate antifa as a domestic terrorist  organization.   America has had enough of these terrorists.   Just this past weekend, antifa-affiliated rioters set fire to the  future Atlanta police training facility by attacking it, an organized  attack that is all captured on video. Molotov cocktails and other  destructive items, fireworks were fired at police officers, and the  construction site was set on fire causing much damage.   There were over 30 people arrested.   Now, here is the issue: only two of them were actually from Georgia.  The rest of them were from other places in the country, and several of  them were from other countries like France and Canada. One of them  happened to be an  [[Page H1123]]  attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center. That is disgraceful.   This all comes on the heels of antifa terrorizing Americans for years  now.   Never forget in the summer of 2020, antifa caused over $2 billion in  damage; setting fires to cities, businesses, attacking police officers,  and killing people. Yet over 95 percent of those arrested had their  charges dropped.                            ____________________
