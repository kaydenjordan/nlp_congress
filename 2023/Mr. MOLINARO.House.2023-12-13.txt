 Mr. Chair, I am proud to cosponsor the Whole Milk for  Healthy Kids Act, and I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.   After over 10 years of schools having to comply with a nonsensical  ban, I am excited to work on this bill to provide full-favor, nutrient- dense milk to kids once again. Parents and physicians have known the  benefits of milk for generations. Nearly 70 percent of milk consumed at  home is whole or 2 percent because it actually tastes good. It is  packed with vitamins, and, most importantly, kids actually love it. I  know my four do.   Full-fat milk gives parents alternatives to soda that their kids  actually want to drink, but kids have been barred--strangely barred-- from having their favorite milk choices in schools.   The result has been a decline in milk consumption in schools, and  when kids are drinking less milk, they are losing out on nutrients that  are critical for their healthy development.   Milk is the top source of protein, calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D  for kids. It provides seven of the 14 nutrients the American Academy of  Pediatrics recommends for brain development.   The bottom line is that limiting milk in schools reduces consumption  of essential nutrients, pushes kids towards sugary alternatives, and  has led to less healthy kids.   As the Representative for hundreds of family-owned dairy farms in New  York, and as a parent to four kids, I have one special interest: the  health standard of the kids growing up in our communities.   I am excited to take this long overdue action to repeal a ridiculous  ban. I am grateful to Chairman Thompson for his leadership to get the  full-fat milk back in schools.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bipartisan  bill.
