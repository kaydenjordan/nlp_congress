 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed  to finish my remarks prior to the vote.    Mr. President, just a few weeks ago right here, Congress  passed a continuing resolution to fund the government through December  20. At that time, few if any of us predicted that we would pass all 12  appropriations bills in such a small window of time. Yet today we are  poised to do just that in a few minutes.   Bipartisan cooperation has made this possible. Chairwoman Lowey and  Ranking Member Granger on the House side and my friend Vice Chairman  Leahy and I on the Senate side worked together to change things. I  believe that the four of us have shown once again that, if given the  opportunity, we will find a bipartisan path forward to get the job  done. It is very important that we do this.   I would be remiss right now if I did not recognize all members of the  Appropriations Committees, Democrats and Republicans, committees on  both sides of the aisle and the Capitol, our subcommittee chairs, our  ranking members in particulars, and, of course, our staff. We would not  be here without their diligence and willingness to work night and day  with very little sleep.   I thank the leaders on both sides, Senator McConnell and Senator  Schumer.   I especially want to take a moment here to acknowledge the role  played by the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Mnuchin, in these  negotiations on behalf of the administration. Together, everybody  negotiated the budget agreement that paved the way for these bills, and  they helped guide them down the stretch. Secretary Mnuchin in  particular has been a voice of reason and a driving force in our  ability to get to yes, and we should be grateful for that.   I believe these bills are good bills that my colleagues can be proud  to support. I do not have time here today to go into all the  particulars of such a complex piece of legislation, but I want to hit a  few high points as I see them. First--always first to me--is America's  military, our national security, the security of our Nation. Defense  spending here has increased by $22 billion over the previous year. Our  men and women in uniform will receive the largest pay increase in 10  years at 3.1 percent, which they deserve. Our veterans can rest assured  that they will get the healthcare they earned and deserve through the  funding of the VA MISSION Act. These are victories for America and for  the American people.    Turning to Homeland Security, which is very important, as well,  $1.375 billion is provided for the border wall system, and the  President will have some greater flexibility on where he can build  along the southern border. Not only that, but the President retains  critical transfer authorities that will allow him to devote additional  resources to border security and immigration enforcement. Again, the  objective here and, I believe, the outcome is to make America strong.   The last thing that I will mention before wrapping up is that these  bills will maintain all legacy policy riders to protect life and the  Second Amendment. These provisions have long been foundational to the  strength of America and I am proud to assure my colleagues that we can  carry them forward.   All in all, these bills accommodate countless Members' priorities on  both sides of the aisle. I want to thank all of my colleagues, again,  for the input they provided at the outset of this process.   I also want to take a moment to thank my chief of staff and the staff  director of the Appropriations Committee, Shannon Hines, and her staff  for all the work they have done, as well as Senator Leahy's staff,  working together. As we approach the finish line, I ask for their  support. As the clock winds down, let's come together and do what  seemed so unlikely just a month ago--to fund the entire Federal  Government before the Christmas break.   Before I yield the floor, I want to quickly thank, again, all of the  staff for their hard work and dedication to make this happen today.  Without them, it wouldn't happen and we know this. They have worked  tirelessly on our behalf and on behalf of the American people, and we  should all be grateful for their efforts.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion     Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of  consideration of the message to accompany H.R. 1865, and I ask for the  yeas and nays.
