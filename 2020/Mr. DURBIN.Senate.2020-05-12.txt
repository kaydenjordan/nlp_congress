 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, there was a meeting last week--a  telephone conference call--of the leaders of a dozen major nations  around the world. It was a meeting to discuss something we are all  thinking about, the answer to the question everyone in America asks  every day: How will this end? When will this end? In this telephone  conference, leaders from other nations talked about the ending that  most of us envision--the discovery of a safe and effective vaccine that  can protect people around the world from the scourge of this  coronavirus.   I am not sure when that vaccine will be discovered--the sooner the  better--but the big question we need to ask ourselves at this point is,  Where will it be discovered, and what benefit will it provide for the  United States?   You see, there was one major nation that boycotted this international  telephone conference about discovering a vaccine. It was the United  States. President Trump decided not to participate with the leaders of  nations from around the world in this global conversation about finding  a safe and effective vaccine to fight coronavirus. I am not sure what  his motive was. But we know that at least 94 other vaccines are being  explored and worked on in nations around the world--in England, for  example, and in Germany and so many other countries. They are looking  for the same safe and effective vaccine as we in the United States are  looking for.   I have great faith and confidence in the men and women in medical  research in the United States and the production facilities in our  country, but I am not so proud or so vain as to believe that no other  country could find that safe and effective vaccine. And if they did-- and if they did--would we hesitate for a moment to turn to a country  and say that the United States wants to be part of producing that  vaccine and receiving that vaccine for the people who live here?   Why would the President of the United States decide we are going to  boycott that conference, stay away from it? Oh, I am sure he has a  dozen reasons, but they don't seem very convincing to me. We should be  at the table wherever there is a serious, credible effort to discover a  vaccine. The United States should be participating.   They were trying to raise $8 billion. That is a lot of money, but  remember, we are dealing with an effort to rescue our economy from  coronavirus, which is now in the range of $2.8 trillion. They are  asking the participants to put in money. Norway said it would pledge $1  billion--Norway. The European Union said it would pledge $1 billion  toward this global vaccine effort. The United States should have been  at that table. We should be all in for any credible effort to find this  vaccine as quickly as possible. I have introduced a resolution calling  on the administration to reverse its position and to join in this  effort.    I want to commend Bill and Melinda Gates, who participated in that  telephone conference and pledged millions of dollars of their own funds  on behalf of the United States. Thank you to the Gates family for  caring.   Now, Mr. President, you should join them.   This morning, the Republican leader came to the floor to talk about  the problems and challenges that we face and the fact that there is  another bill that is going to be offered publicly this week by Speaker  Nancy Pelosi--the next in a succession of legislation that we have  considered over the last several weeks.   We have seen dramatic investments in unemployment insurance for a  record number of unemployed people in this country. We have seen  dramatic investments in the small businesses of America, to give them a  fighting chance to reopen and to prosper in the future. I have joined  in all of these on a bipartisan basis, and I will continue to.   I don't know the specifics of Speaker Pelosi's proposal. Senator  McConnell came to the floor and warned us not to think big and not to  think about transformational things. Then, of course, he went back to  his time-honored course about the question of liability.   Senator McConnell has come to the floor repeatedly--repeatedly--and  said that before he would consider another COVID-19 rescue bill, he  would need to see what he calls a redline honored when it comes to  immunity from lawsuits.   What is being proposed by Speaker Pelosi when it comes to State and  local governments is really an affirmation of what has been said by  every one of us when it comes to our first responders, the police, the  firefighters, the paramedics, the healthcare workers, and the teachers.  What she says in the bill is that they have been hit and been hit hard  at the State and local government levels by this COVID-19. She is  proposing, as I understand it, a substantial commitment to help those  units of government that have truly been hurt by this coronavirus. What  she is asking for, really, is whether or not all of our speeches about  healthcare workers, police, first responders, firefighters, and  teachers are really credible and whether, in fact, we will come up with  the resources that are needed.   Senator McConnell has said that he will not support that legislation  unless--as he calls it--his redline of liability immunity is honored.  What he is saying is that he refuses to fund our police, firefighters,  paramedics, and teachers unless we provide guaranteed business immunity  for corporations. This is, sadly, an invitation for irresponsible  corporations and businesses to cut corners when it comes to protecting  workers and those customers and such who would be threatened by  coronavirus.   The McConnell redline threat would result in more people being  infected by the coronavirus and more people getting sick. That is not  what we want. There is a better way. We should be talking about how to  do this properly.   This afternoon there will be a hearing before the Senate Judiciary  Committee. One of the witnesses being called by the Republicans is a  man named Kevin Smartt. He is the chief executive officer and president  of Kwik Chek food stores in Bonham, TX. He is testifying on behalf of  the National Association of Convenience Stores on this question of  liability.   I read his statement this morning in preparation for the hearing, and  I commend it to my colleagues because I want them to listen carefully  to what Mr. Smartt says he believes businesses need. Here is what he  says. He talks about his own company Kwik Chek.         Kwik Chek's first priority is the safety of our employees       and customers. Beginning in early March, we adjusted our       daily protocols to mitigate the spread of the virus. This was       a challenge--    Listen to what Mr. Smartt says--       because the guidance provided by the CDC, the Occupational       Safety and Health Administration, as well as State and local       governments, often conflicted with one another in addition to       being vague and difficult to follow. Yet despite many       uncertainties, including the constantly fluctuating public       health guidelines, we began to adjust to the pandemic.    Mr. Smartt is not saying that businesses don't have a responsibility  here. He is accepting that responsibility to create a safe environment  for workers and customers, but he is saying to us: When are you going  to establish the standards? Why do you keep changing the standards?   Here we are with Senator McConnell threatening to derail the next  rescue  [[Page S2361]]  bill for police, firefighters, and teachers across America, unless  there is guaranteed immunity from lawsuits, and here is one of the  leading companies, the No. 1 primary witness of the Republicans in the  Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, saying to the Federal and  governments: Establish standards, reasonable standards, for us to live  up to when it comes to conducting business, and we will do it.   I think that is a reasonable request by his business. Why aren't we  doing it? Why hasn't OSHA established standards for the safety of  workers?   One of our other witnesses here is this gentleman who is the head of  the United Food and Commercial Workers, Marc Perrone. I have a special  fondness for this union because when I was a college kid, I spent 12  months working in a slaughterhouse in East St. Louis, IL, and it was  this union that I belonged to back in those days   It was tough, dirty, and dangerous work. I look to it as an important  chapter in my life, when I saw how real people go to work every day and  many times risk their safety and their health in doing it.   Marc Perrone tells us there are literally thousands of his meat  processing workers who have been affected by this virus and 95 of his  members who have died as a result of it. What he is looking for--what  we are looking for--is for those companies to establish standards of  safety for their workers so that they can go back to work in this  important business.   Some are doing just that. I commend them. Some are working with the  union to find safe ways to test their workers and to bring them back to  a job site that is safe for them to work in. But they don't have a  national standard to live up to. We haven't established a national  standard, as we should. Whether through OSHA or through CDC, we ought  to establish standards for businesses across this country to live up  to. I believe many--Mr. Smartt with Kwik Chek and Marc Perrone with the  United Food and Commercial Workers--would applaud that. They would say:  At least we know what social distancing standards are to be used in the  workplace. At least we know what protective equipment is required in  the workplace to protect our employees. At least we know going into  this exactly what the standards are that we need to live up to.   Senator McConnell's approach is immunity from lawsuits; don't  establish any standards and don't hold anybody to any standards at all.  That is wrong. The net result of that is that more people would be in  danger, more people would be infected, and more people would die. That  is not the right approach.   What we need to do is to make certain that when this is all said and  done, we have a smart approach to this; that a business that is  conscientious, cares for its customers, and cares for its workers has  standards to live by and that they can meet reasonable standards that  have been thought through from a public health viewpoint.   It is no wonder that there is uncertainty when you look at the  situation today. The Centers for Disease Control suggests voluntary  standards, suggestions. The White House accepts some, publishes some,  scoffs at others, and ignores others. There is just no clear message to  businesses and people across America on what the standards of safety  will be.   So I would say that this hearing this afternoon is important to hear  from Mr. Smartt and his willingness to look for standards that he can  live by, and to hear from Marc Perrone about the dangers to his workers  across the workplace. And don't believe for a minute that this caravan  of lawsuits threat that we hear over and over tells the whole story.   When you take a look at the lawsuits that have been filed, it is not  just the so-called caravan of trial lawyers that are coming in and  jumping on this. There are businesses suing businesses. There are lots  of lawsuits that have little or nothing to do with personal injury.  There are also lawsuits involving workers' compensation.   Senator McConnell's suggestion is that we overturn the State laws  that give workers the right to recover in the workplace if their  injuries and or their health is impaired because of the COVID-19 virus.  What a terrible outcome that would be to walk away from decades of  established protection for workers in every State in the Union, for  Senator McConnell's so-called redline threat when it comes to the COVID  virus No. 4 bill that Speaker Pelosi is proposing.   There is a reasonable answer here. We can say to these businesses  across America: Join us in the fight. Let's stand together. You protect  your workers, you protect your customers, and we will stand by you. We  will establish a reasonable standard of conduct for you, which will  protect you from frivolous lawsuits. But to take the approach by  Senator McConnell, saying that we just are going to guarantee immunity  from lawsuits, is exactly the wrong thing to do. We need a standard of  safety that businesses can be proud of, that workers can respect, and  that customers can count on so that they can go into places, do their  business, buy the products, and know that there is a standard of good  health that is being established for everyone.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the  Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from Washington  (Mrs. Murray), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator  from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the  Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from Washington  (Mrs. Murray), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator  from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the  Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from Washington  (Mrs. Murray), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator  from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Americans owe a great debt of gratitude  to the healthcare heroes on the frontlines of the fight against the  COVID-19 pandemic. Today, I would like to spend a few minutes talking  about one special group of healthcare workers: immigrants.   Consider this: 1 in 6 healthcare and social service workers--3.1  million out of 18.7 million--are immigrants. These immigrants are  playing a critical role in the battle against the pandemic, yet our  broken immigration system does not allow many of them to fulfill their  dreams of becoming part of America's future.   I have come to the floor today to tell a story of one of our  immigrant health heroes, and I will continue to highlight these stories  in the coming weeks. I am also inviting my colleagues from across the  Nation to come tell their own stories on social media or on the floor  with #ImmigrantHealthHeroes, shown on this chart.   Thousands of immigrant health workers are suffering because of a  serious problem in our immigration system: It is the green card  backlog. This backlog puts them and their families at risk of losing  their immigration status, and it hinders their ability to participate  in the fight against COVID-19. Under our current laws, there are not  nearly enough immigrant visas, also known as green cards, available  each year. As a result, immigrants are struck in crippling backlogs not  just for years but for decades.   Close to 5 million future Americans are in line waiting for green  cards. Hundreds of thousands of them are already working in the United  States on temporary visas, while many more are waiting abroad,  separated from their American families. Only 226,000 family green cards  and 140,000 employment green cards are available each year. The  backlogs are really hard on these families who are caught in this  immigration limbo. For example, children in many of these families age  out and face deportation as their parents are waiting in line for their  green cards.   The green card backlog includes thousands of doctors--medical  doctors--who are currently working in our country on a temporary basis.  These doctors face many restrictions due to their temporary status,  such as not being able to volunteer at hospitals in COVID-19 hotspots  where they are so desperately needed.   The solution to the green card backlog is clear: Increase the number.  In 2013, I joined a group of four Republicans and four Democrats who  authored a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill. The bill  passed the Senate with a strong vote, 68-3, and it would have  eliminated the green card backlog.   Last year, I introduced the RELIEF Act, legislation based on the 2013  comprehensive immigration reform bill that would clear the backlog for  all immigrants waiting in line for green cards within 5 years. I will  keep fighting to help all immigrants who are stuck in this backlog.   Last week, I joined with my colleagues, Republican Senators David  Perdue of Georgia, Todd Young of Indiana, and John Cornyn of Texas and  Democratic Senators Chris Coons of Delaware and Pat Leahy of Vermont to  introduce legislation to quickly address the plight of immigrant  doctors and nurses who are stuck in this green card backlog. This  backlog poses a significant risk to our ability to effectively respond  to this pandemic. Our bill, the Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act, is  a temporary stopgap bill that will strengthen our healthcare workforce  and improve healthcare access for Americans in the midst of this  crisis.   Our bill would recapture 25,000 unused immigrant visas for nurses and  15,000 unused visas for doctors. These are visas that Congress  previously authorized, but we never used. Our bill would quickly  allocate these visas to doctors and nurses who can help us today in the  fight against COVID-19.   It is important to note that our bill requires employers to attest  that any immigrant from overseas who receives these visas will not  displace an American worker. We want to ensure that all beneficiaries  of this bill complement our American healthcare workforce. As Congress  begins to work on the next legislation to address this pandemic, I will  push for the Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act to be included.   Today, I want to tell you the story of one immigrant healthcare  worker who is stuck in this green card backlog and would benefit from  the act I just described.   This is Dr. Ram Sanjeev Alur. Dr. Alur was born in India. As a child,  he survived a bout with meningitis, a disease that is often fatal. This  experience inspired him to become a doctor. He went to medical school  in India, then trained in internal medicine in the United Kingdom. Dr.  Alur came to the United States in 2007 for medical residency training.  In 2011, he began working as an internist and hospitalist in the Marion  Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Marion, IL. Dr. Alur has led the  emergency room inpatient unit for the last 3 years, and now, he is on  the frontlines of the pandemic as a member of his hospital's COVID-19  response team.   Dr. Alur lives in Marion with his wife and three kids. Their ages are  12, 8, and 6. He sent me a letter, but listen to what he said about his  life in southern Illinois living in Marion:         I consider the opportunity to work at the VA medical center       as a blessing. To serve the veterans is an honor,       responsibility and satisfaction that enhances anyone's life.       I found my calling and hope to spend the rest of my career       and raise my family here. I would like to see my children       blossom in this community and grow into successful,       responsible citizens.    Unfortunately, Dr. Alur is one of thousands of doctors stuck in this  green card backlog. He has been forced to renew his temporary visa four  times  [[Page S2384]]  since he started working serving our veterans at the Marion VA  facility. He has been approved for a green card but will have to wait  decades--decades--because of the backlog of people just like him,  waiting for their green cards.   In the meantime, Dr. Alur's oldest daughter would age out--she is 12  now--but she would age out and be forced to leave the country before he  is legally entitled to become a citizen of this country. Think of that  heartbreaking situation, breaking up this man's family because he has  been approved for a visa but has to wait to make sure he meets the  quota in each year, and he will end up waiting for decades.   In the midst of this pandemic, Dr. Alur's immigration status puts him  at a great risk. If, God forbid--God forbid--he contracts COVID-19 and  becomes disabled or dies, his family would lose their immigration  status and be forced to leave the United States. Tell me that is fair,  that this man who is serving our veterans and has waited patiently to  become a citizen of United States and be part of our future, should he  get sick or die, his family would be deported.    Here is what he said to me about this:         The pandemic shook our family. Being a temporary worker on       a visa never stared us in the face more. This lack of       protection is every frontline immigrant doctor's nightmare.    Dr. Alur's temporary immigration status also prevents him from  working part-time in a COVID-19 hotspot like Chicago. Here is what he  said:         It is depressing to watch the medical system, stretched       while the pandemic takes its toll, and not be able to help or       participate. It is like a soldier sitting out a battle,       player sitting out a game, fireman sitting out a house fire.    His family's plight led Dr. Alur to start Physicians for American  Health Care Access, a nonprofit organization to advocate for doctors  serving underserved communities who are stuck in this green card  backlog.   I can tell you, in southern Illinois, we are desperate for good  doctors. We need them not just at Marion VA, but we need more  specialists around the entire region. This is a rural area of our  State, small-town area, and they need these specialists more than ever.   How we can take a good man like this, who is willing to serve our  veterans and do more in this COVID-19 epidemic, and tell him he is not  welcome to be a citizen of this country, I just do not understand.   When I heard Dr. Alur's story, it inspired me to work with my  colleagues on a bipartisan basis to introduce this law that I  mentioned, the Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act. Under our bill, Dr.  Alur and thousands like him could receive their green cards. They and  their families would get the permanent immigration status that they  deserve and be able to use their skills to serve in the frontlines of  the pandemic if they are needed--and they are.   I hope that, even in these divided times, we can come together in  Congress to quickly aid these immigrant healthcare heroes.                            ____________________     Madam President, in this season of great mourning, last  Monday, America lost a man who tried for years--during some of our  darkest moments--to comfort our grief-stricken Nation.   His name was Greg Zanis, but he was known as ``The Cross Man.'' One  month ago, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Last Friday, Mr.  Zanis, his wife Sue, and their grown children watched from inside the  Zanis family home in Aurora, IL, as a parade of neighbors drove past to  show their love and respect for Greg.   This caravan of caring stretched for a mile and included more than  320 cars, trucks, SUVs, and motorcycles. It was a fitting tribute to a  quiet man whose compassion and sacrifice helped ease the grief of  countless Americans over the last 25 years.   You may never have heard his name before, but chances are you may  have seen his work. After the Columbine High School massacre in 1999  and nearly every mass shooting and natural disaster since then, Greg  Zanis crafted wooden memorials to honor the fallen. Over nearly 20  years, he made and personally delivered some 27,000 handmade memorials  to communities across America. Most were crosses, but he also crafted  wooden Stars of David and crescent moons to honor the fallen.   He drove to Sandy Hook, CT, after 26 children and educators were  murdered in that grade school. He drove to Florida to honor the victims  of the Pulse Nightclub shooting and returned a heartbreaking short time  later after the Parkland High School mass shooting. He drove to Las  Vegas after 58 people were killed at a music festival; to the First  Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, TX, after 26 worshippers were  killed; to Pittsburgh, PA, to honor the 11 worshippers killed at the  Tree of Life Synagogue.   Greg Zanis considered his work a ministry, and it cost him  financially and emotionally. He was a master carpenter who gave up much  of the work he did otherwise to make and deliver these memorials. When  he heard of a mass shooting or a deadly natural disaster, he loaded up  his truck with crosses and drove, sometimes leaving in the middle of  the night so he could get there as quickly as possible. One friend said  that Mr. Zanis often wasn't sure, when he left home, how he would get  the gas money to get back to Aurora. Somehow, he always did.   He was in Aurora a little over a year ago, February 2019, when the  epidemic of mass shootings came to his hometown. Five workers were  killed, five police officers wounded at a mass shooting at a warehouse.  The tragedy hit Mr. Zanis hard. As he told a reporter for the New York  Times, he could drive away from all the other tragedies, but he said,  ``I'm not going to be able to get away from this one.''   His ministry didn't take him only to places of mass suffering and  death; he also made crosses for individuals. He made 700 crosses  carried down Michigan Avenue in Chicago to honor those who died in that  great city in 1 year.   He made his first cross in 1996 to honor his father-in-law, who had  been murdered in a shooting. He learned from that experience that  transforming wood into symbols of faith helped to make grief more  bearable. That is the gift that he tried to share with others.   The mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso last September shook him  deeply. Among the 22 killed and 23 wounded were little children  shopping for school supplies with their parents. Between the heat of  the south Texas sun and the enormity of their losses, Mr. Zanis  struggled to make enough crosses. He decided, after that, that he had  to retire from his ministry. He was 69 years old. A few months later,  his cancer was diagnosed.   In this time, when so many of the usual customs of grieving must be  suspended, may we all find some consolation and inspiration in the  extraordinary, ordinary man who helped to ease the grief of so many.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
