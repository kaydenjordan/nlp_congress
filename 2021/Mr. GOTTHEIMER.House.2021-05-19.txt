 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, as a member of the  Committee on Homeland Security, in strong support of H.R. 3233,  Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Katko's bill to form a bipartisan,  independent commission to investigate the January 6 domestic terrorism  attack on the United States Capitol.   On January 6, the world witnessed an attempted insurrection against  our government to overturn the will of the American people. I know that  because I was right here in this House Chamber that day as doors were  barricaded and Members and staff were forced to evacuate. The mob that  stormed our Capitol, resulting in the death of a Capitol police  officer, tore down the American flag and desecrated the seat of our  democracy. These lawless thugs, led by members of extremist groups like  the Oath Keepers, and Proud Boys, and Stop the Steal, attempted an  insurrection. In the end, they failed. We gathered back together here,  uncowed, and the electoral college was certified.   Mr. Speaker, but true healing cannot come without a serious  investigation and real accountability. I am very proud that last night,  the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, 29 Democrats and 29 Republicans,  came together to endorse this legislation, putting aside politics to  get to the bottom of what happened that day.   This bipartisan commission, modeled on the 9/11 Commission, will  undertake an investigation into the facts and what caused the attack.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will help us deter further would-be  extremists, and provide the law enforcement homeland security community  with the tools needed to protect the Capitol and our country from  future attacks.   I thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Katko for their  extraordinary leadership and months of hard work together on the bill,  the way governing should occur.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  join in support of securing and protecting the very foundation of our  democracy.
