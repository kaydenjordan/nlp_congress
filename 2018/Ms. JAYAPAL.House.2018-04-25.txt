 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am opposed.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I make this motion today in order to ensure that the  millions of Americans who rely on public power can continue receiving  affordable power. President Trump, in his latest budget, has proposed  charging millions of Americans more for their electricity.   The President wants to charge Americans what he calls market-based  rates, which means that millions of Americans who rely on public power  will pay more than what they pay now. This proposal has rightly  provoked bipartisan opposition, and I hope my Republican colleagues  will join me in rejecting this ill-advised proposal which will result  in higher bills for millions of our constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I should also add that the underlying bill is based on a  false premise that rates can be lowered by shirking our  responsibilities to protect our environment, restore our salmon  populations, and follow the law. After all, restoring our region's  salmon populations will reduce our costs in the long run.   This underlying bill takes us in the wrong direction, and it is  important to include some context on this complicated issue.   Starting in the 1930s, the Federal Government began the construction  of 31 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River. These dams which make  up the Federal Columbia River Power System, or the FCRPS, provide  public power throughout the Pacific Northwest.   However, it has become clear that they have operated in ways that  pose serious threats to our region's salmon runs and violate our  environmental laws. Several courts, including the Ninth Circuit Court  of Appeals and the Oregon U.S. District Court, have ruled as such. The  courts ordered a new biological opinion, as well as a NEPA review, in  order to bring the plans in alignment with Federal law.   Rather than letting this critical process continue, H.R. 3144 aims to  circumvent our court system and the law by blocking legally ordered  salmon protection measures. Congress should not be in the business of  closing the door on legal and regulatory review processes simply  because some Members don't like them.   Some claim that the court process will make it more expensive for  ratepayers due to decisions like the one to increase spill over the  dams, which this bill would illegally block. This process, which is  meant to release additional water over the tops of the dams to ensure  that juvenile salmon can migrate out, is a critical step in increasing  salmon recovery rates. It is currently up for debate whether or not  ratepayers will see an increase of any sort in the costs in the short  term, but the long-term benefits of changes like this one are  indisputable.   The 13 species of steelhead and salmon that are threatened by these  dams are crucial to our region, and our fishing industry relies on them  for its survival.   In 2011, Mr. Speaker, 34,500 jobs were provided by a healthy sport  fishing industry which contributed more than $3.8 billion to the  economy in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. And according to a recent  poll in Washington State, a strong majority of voters are actually  willing to pay up to $7 a month in additional costs in order to save  our wild salmon and improve water quality because they know how  incredibly important it is to all of our economies and our communities.   Whether or not the increase spill will raise costs, that is not  clear, but what is clear is that conserving these critical populations  is a priority for the people in the Pacific Northwest.   The irony, Mr. Speaker, is that H.R. 3144 will ultimately cost our  ratepayers  [[Page H3559]]  even more money in the long term. Protecting our salmon populations is  100 percent necessary. It is our obligation under the Endangered  Species Act. So simply closing our eyes and hoping this all goes away  is not an option.   Additionally, the Native peoples of the Pacific Northwest have the  undeniable treaty rights to catch these salmon and steelhead at  accustomed places, meaning that these populations have to be  maintained. We can't continue to fail to uphold our end of this deal,  and this bill will move us further away from where we need to be.   This issue has been addressed, and the review process mandated by the  courts is doing just that. By denying the opportunity to implement the  necessary science-based changes required to bring the FCRPS in line  with Federal law, H.R. 3144 will cost ratepayers more down the line.  Restoring the salmon population will be incredibly expensive, and  gutting fisheries protections and kicking the can down the road does  not serve our ratepayers well.   We must move forward with the ongoing biological opinion review and  the NEPA process, but we also have to ensure that we are continuing to  be mindful of our ratepayers in the region. This bill will ultimately  cost ratepayers more, not less.   Mr. Speaker, it is possible to find a solution that works.   I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
