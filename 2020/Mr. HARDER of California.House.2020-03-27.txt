 Mr. Speaker, we have two obligations in  responding to this pandemic: first, to move quickly and urgently; and  second, to put science and health ahead of partisan politics. Neither  of those two things happened, but this bill is a step forward.   It helps all the workers who have lost their jobs. It helps the  businesses that are struggling with customers not showing up and  staying home, and it helps the frontline nurses, doctors, and first  responders who need more equipment.    There is more to do. As soon as we pass this bill, we need to keep  working to make sure that we are expanding paid leave, expanding access  to healthcare, and making sure that we continue to protect each and  every person who is out there as a first responder.   Until then, I want to thank my friends from both sides of the aisle  who are for working to get this done, and I urge us to pass it as soon  as possible.
