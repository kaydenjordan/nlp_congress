 Mr. Speaker, I just returned from a trip to Ukraine with  my colleague, Representative Spartz, last night. We were invited by  Ukrainian officials to see firsthand their immediate needs.   The destruction and loss of life was heartbreaking. Everywhere we  went, we saw the evidence of Putin's war crimes. One stop we made was  at a residential building in Odesa that had been hit by Russian  missiles the day before. A grandmother, her daughter, and her  daughter's baby were killed in that same apartment. They were among 18  other innocent victims killed in the attacks.   Yet, in the face of such evil actions, the Ukrainian spirit remains  strong. To aid their fight for freedom, more must be done by both the  United States and the international community. Advanced weaponry,  humanitarian supplies, and much more can and should be ramped up.   The Ukrainians are brave people, and they will win the war against  Russia's invasion if they have the tools and the resources to do so in  hand.   God bless Ukraine.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 336 and, once again,  call on the Russian Government to release American citizen, Paul  Whelan. I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Haley Stevens, for her  undying leadership in fighting this travesty--and it is a travesty.   It has now been over 3 years since Paul Whelan--a marine veteran, a  Michigan resident, and, most importantly, an American citizen--was  imprisoned in Russia without proper evidence or a fair trial. It was a  sham trial; that is the messaging Paul wanted to convey to the world as  an unjust Russian judicial system handed out a ridiculous sentence.  Throughout his detainment, he has also been denied access to proper  medical treatment, despite a sharp decline in his health.   Just this week, I returned from Ukraine where Russian atrocities have  been on display to the entire world. Make no mistake about that. We saw  heartbreaking devastation that has impacted so many lives. But  tragically, Vladimir Putin's barbaric behavior is not new. He has no  concern for even the most basic of human rights.    Today, the House must send an unequivocal message to the Kremlin: It  is time to end the maltreatment of Paul Whelan.   We just learned the good news that Trevor Reed, another American  detained in Russia, was released from prison. We are calling for Paul  to be next.   I want to close with a message to Paul's dear parents, Rosemary and  Ed, who live in my district in Manchester, Michigan; and to Paul's  siblings, Elizabeth, David, and Andrew. I know this has been an  incredibly trying time for your family. I admire your resolve in the  face of adversity. I grieve with you. I pray for you. And I continue to  stand with you.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for Paul Whelan to come home to Michigan.
