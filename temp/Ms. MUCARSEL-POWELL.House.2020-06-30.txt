 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for this  transformational bill. I stand in strong support of the Moving Forward  Act.   I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, people in south Florida are so tired  of being stuck in traffic for hours and dealing with terrible public  transit options. This is one of the top concerns that I get from my  constituents.   What they have asked for is rail, better buses, and a reasonable  commute to and from work. This bill would make investments to make that  a reality and create good-paying jobs.   South Florida also needs a solution to climate change and to know  that their roads, bridges, and streets will be able to withstand sea  level rise. This bill does just that.   This is a transformational bill. It is what people from South Dade to  Florida City have been waiting for.   I have fought to include funding for energy-efficient wastewater  infrastructure projects that reduce our environmental footprint and  monthly bills for families.   This also includes one of the bills that I introduced, the Shovel- Ready Restoration Grants for Coastlines and Fisheries Act, which  creates jobs for fisheries and tourism-dependent communities hit by the  COVID-19 pandemic. It protects our coastal communities from sea level  rise and stronger and more frequent storms.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
