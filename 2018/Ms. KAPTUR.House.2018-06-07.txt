 Mr. Chairman, I wish to thank the ranking member from New  York, Nita Lowey, for yielding me this time and for the wonderful work  she has done on 12 bills, and this is but the first.   I also want to thank the chair of the full committee, Congressman  Frelinghuysen, whose service has been so meritorious. We miss his  service on the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies  Committee directly, but he has moved up to greater things.   I also thank Chairman Simpson and the members of our fine  subcommittee and our staff on our side of the aisle, Jaime Shimek and  T.J. Loudermilk, and on the majority side, Angie Giancarlo, for their  hard work on this bill under rushed circumstances.   I value the hard work that all of you have put into this bill and the  dispatch with which Chair Simpson has moved through the process,  including with great cordiality.   Our bill contributes to ensuring the critical availability of energy  and waterway improvements for domestic stability and national security,  not just for today but for the tomorrows to come.   Energy is the power that flows and drives our economy and courses  through our Nation. Sometimes people even forget it is there binding  our country together at the community level, connecting our Nation from  coast to coast, and ensuring our superior defense posture globally.   Our Nation has made enormous strides in increasing our energy  independence by developing a broad portfolio of power sources, with no  bill more important than this one in reaching the strategic goal of  energy independence for America's independence.   But it is not yet time to declare mission accomplished. Today, the  price of oil is on the rise again, standing 50 percent higher than it  was 1 year ago, due at least in part to unrest across our globe.   It is no secret that every time in recent history--and I am talking  40, 50 years--that fuel prices exceed $4 per gallon our Nation sinks  into deep recession. Actually, energy can become a tourniquet that  throttles economic growth, and rising fuel prices means our Nation  could be headed there again.   So we must not lose sight of the ultimate goal of energy independence  for American independence. Largely, thanks to the bipartisan budget  agreement, the chairman has been able to provide increased funding  levels to that end across much of our bill.   Turning to the water and waterway elements in our bill, all essential  to human life, our bill significantly increases funding for the Army  Corps of Engineers to ensure continued forward progress in all regions  of our country across all project areas, including navigation and  environmental restoration. All projects are job creators and benefit  future economic growth and environmental improvement.   I am grateful for the chairman's continued partnership to address the  Asian carp threat to our freshwater Great Lakes ecosystem, as well as  for funding to keep our Great Lakes ports open to shippers, which drive  economic investment in the Great Lakes region.   And, unfortunately, while the chair has been generous in the funding  of most programs, the bill cuts over $400 million in funding from this  year's levels for next year for some of the highest priorities to those  of us on this side of the aisle.   Let me enumerate them: energy efficiency and renewable energy, where  America is making great strides and nations like China seek to blunt  our lead; transformational science driven by the highest level of  research in our country, the advanced research and energy we call ARPA- E; and, finally, in the third important area of nuclear  nonproliferation.   Those accounts should not be cut. They all exist within the  Department of Energy budget.                                time  1545    These programs invest in new horizons to move our country and economy  forward through innovation, creating jobs along the way. Think about  this: Nearly 3.2 million Americans now work in clean energy industries  alone. Those are jobs that didn't exist 35 years ago. Energy means  jobs, and new energy systems means economic growth.   I remain troubled by the continued unsustainable spending in the  Department of Energy's weapons program. Instead of working to rein in  costs, just over a month ago, the administration submitted a budget  amendment to begin work on a new, low-yield ballistic missile, as  proposed in the Nuclear Posture Review. I remain unconvinced this new  capability will actually improve our nuclear deterrent.    We owe it to the American people to have a full  discussion and debate before wandering down a path to new varieties of  nuclear weapons, including security, cost, and schedule.   The bill, again, includes several unnecessary and controversial  policy riders, everything related to the Waters of the United States to  new language legislating an ongoing court case in the northwest. I ask  my colleagues to vote no when I offer an amendment to eliminate all of  them.   One of our biggest concerns is the damage this bill does to other  bills. It is like musical chairs: if we succeed with our bill, then the  11 bills that follow may not have sufficient funding.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for leading us to this point. We  are very proud to be the first bill on the floor this year, 2018, in  the appropriations process.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of my fellow Great  Lakes colleague's amendment and thank him for raising the issue.   I think the Great Lakes have finally arrived at the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers. As the gentleman knows and as I have made clear to the  Corps, our Great Lakes Members and myself are very supportive of the  proposal for a Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study.   The study will take an inclusive view of how to make our coastline  more resilient, with an eye toward using more sustainable, green, or  natural infrastructure to reduce runoff, mitigate erosion and flooding,  and protect property. This approach will ultimately save money as the  Corps looks to fulfill its mission in the face of changing  environmental hazards.   And I have to say, over my many years of service, we finally have at  the Corps not just civil engineers, we have environmental engineers. We  have raised a new generation of Americans who understand the  relationship between structures and the environment. It is a new day at  the Corps, and nobody welcomes it more than this Member.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentleman for offering this amendment,  and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to strongly support Congresswoman  Tsongas' amendment.   In our country today, there are 12 wind projects in various stages of  development, spanning 10 States off the east, west, and Texas coasts  and, of course, in the Great Lakes as well. These offshore projects  alone represent over 5,000 megawatts of potential offshore development.  We don't have a kilowatt to waste.   These projects can create thousands of manufacturing, construction,  and supply-chain jobs across our country and drive billions of dollars  of local economic investment.   We know we will need workers to do these clean energy jobs. And I can  guarantee you those towers are very high. So I definitely support  funding for training activities in this regard for the future.   The Department of Energy already has workforce training grants for  solar, and, therefore, I would very much wish to carry over that effort  as well to the Wind Power Technologies Office.   Mr. Chairman, I congratulate the gentlewoman for offering this  important amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Ranking Member Lowey, I  move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to point out that, if one  looks at the fine print in our bill, the account, actually, for fossil  is increased by over $50 million over the current year. That is a  pretty healthy increase.   We are not really cutting anything in that bill if we take the funds  that you are offering here. Fossil will still see a $30 million  increase over this year. It isn't being cut to the bones or anything  like that. In fact, we are adding flesh to the bones of the fossil  accounts.   I think it is important to support the Beyer-Eshoo-Esty proposal here  in this amendment because we are creating the future with ARPA-E.  Nobody knows what ARPA-E means in the average neighborhood of our  country. It really is not just the moonshot; it is the Mars-shot. It is  the highest level of energy research we do.   When I saw Members from Massachusetts down on the floor here a little  earlier, I thought to myself: When I saw the Russian tanker come in  last year with natural gas because parts of the East Coast couldn't  heat their homes in the wintertime, I have to tell you, I am worried.  Every American should be worried.   We should be developing energy on many fronts. An all-of-the-above  strategy is exactly what this country should be doing. We shouldn't be  peeling away funds for the highest level of research that we do in our  Nation.   Truly, ARPA-E helps us become a global leader. It is transformational  in what it does. It is a model for others to imitate. It is smart, it  is agile, it is fast-acting, it is nonbureaucratic, and it is bold-- qualities that both Republicans and Democrats like.   Last year, actually, many Republican officials and business leaders,  including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said ARPA-E is a blueprint for  smart Federal investments that boost our global competitiveness. And  surely it does, because I can remember a time when America was not  running its way to energy independence. It was, in fact, completely  dependent on imported sources of energy.   ARPA-E has been nothing short of remarkable. One hundred and thirty- six projects have attracted over $2.6 billion in private sector follow- on funding. I repeat: private sector.   While I do support fossil--and Ohio is a State right now where we  have a lot of coal, we have a lot of natural gas. We even have some oil  being brought up with the natural gas. I support all that. But we know  one thing about  [[Page H4936]]  that: it is finite. It is not going to be there for future generations.   ARPA-E leads us into a new future, and this amendment moves us in the  proper direction.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the Beyer-Eshoo-Esty  amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I rise to support my good colleague,  Congressman Keating, and his amendment dealing with spent nuclear fuel.   We need a solution all across our country to spent nuclear fuel  stored on dozens and dozens of sites across our country.   We thought we had a solution. $14 billion has been invested in the  Yucca Mountain facility, and yet because of opposition from those who  were not consulted in Nevada before that site was constructed, our  Nation has been at a standstill. So I want to compliment the gentleman  from Massachusetts for bringing up this issue.   Northern Ohio, a vast region that I and other Ohio Members represent,  has more than one nuclear power plant that is faced with spent nuclear  fuel onsite.   We know that the Department of Energy is doing tremendous work in  this arena, very fine work, but we simply can't continue to just keep  talking about this. We actually have to begin to store fuel in a much  safer way.   This amendment would build on the work that DOE has been doing to  continue to invest in such a critically important area as spent nuclear  fuel and its permanent storage.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the Keating amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and rise to  strongly oppose the Gosar amendment to completely eliminate the ARPA-E  advanced energy research program, which helps propel our Nation forward  as a global leader.   I could just say to the gentleman from Arizona, for some of the firms  [[Page H4940]]  that have contacted me, the Chinese are hacking into their intellectual  property every week as they struggle to maintain a global lead in new  energy technologies.   Yes, ARPA-E is a pioneering program. It was designed to be that way.  Yes, it is high risk. Yes, it is high end, so much so that the private  sector won't do what ARPA-E is conducting. The research is so high in  science that most companies in this country can't even touch it. And,  frankly, I don't want the Chinese designing our future.   They are actually doing research before the private market can drive  it forward with a commercial product.   I would like to point out that, in 2011, an American Enterprise  Institute-Brookings Institution breakthrough study called for ARPA-E to  be funded at $1.5 billion, annually, because of other countries around  the world beginning to do research in a way that was competing with our  own.   The American Energy Innovation Council, a panel of many of the  Nation's top business leaders, including Bill Gates, have called for  ARPA-E to be funded at $1 billion a year. And last year, Republican  officials--oil and energy executives, business leaders, including the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce--told Congress, ARPA-E is a blueprint `` . . .  that boost our competitiveness by keeping America at the forefront of  global energy technology research.''   These are some of the best people in our country. We ought to be  listening to them. We are their representatives. As the program focused  on new possibilities, new patents, ARPA-E has been nothing short of  remarkable, with 136 projects attracting nearly $3 billion in private  sector follow-on funding.   They won't do the research, but they will take what we have invested  and really do something in the marketplace with it; but beyond just the  marketplace, something that might have something to do with our  defense, for example, something to do with our national security-- inventing the future.   And yet we have come to expect this administration, they want to  eliminate funding, and some of their allies here in the Congress want  to eliminate funding. You eliminate the future if you do that. You  really do eliminate the future.   So I rise and strongly oppose this amendment. Mr. Chair, I encourage  my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Gosar amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Congresswoman Lee, my colleague on  the Appropriations Committee, for offering this very important  amendment, and I rise in support of it.   Please let me remind my colleagues who may not agree with our  position that if this particular proposal for developing a low-yield  nuclear weapon were so important, why was it not included in the  administration's initial budget submission to us?   The process by which this has been handled for a nuclear weapon--if  this were a conventional, then maybe there is a little room there for  maneuver. But in terms of a nuclear weapon, it has many consequences  beyond the weapon itself, including the understanding of our allies and  including many of the treaties that are currently in place.   I was actually shocked when the Secretary of Energy and many people  from the Department of Energy came before our committee and they could  not answer any questions on this. The nuclear security agency, when  they came up before our committee, at that point this had not been  proposed. It came in late; it was thrown over the transom. And I think  the manner in which this has been handled is actually terrible.   We have the most capable and sophisticated nuclear arsenal in the  world. It is credible enough to deter and respond to any threat right  now. We have what we need.   But if we are to alter the combination of weapons that we have in our  arsenal, then, for heaven's sake, why not come up under regular order?  [[Page H4943]]    We owe it to the American people and to our allies to have a full  discussion and debate and assess how others will react to what we are  doing and what we need to respond to. This may not be the most perfect  response. And we don't want to wander down a path to a variety of  nuclear weapons without the kind of debate on deterrence, on security,  on cost, on schedule, and on relation to existing systems that we have  in place in our own country or others.   So I really think the manner in which this was handled was absolutely  awful. For something that deals with nuclear weapons, this Congress  deserves more respect, the American people deserve more respect, and  the world community deserves more respect. We are not saying we will  never support this, but this is not the time to support this.   I think the Congresswoman has proposed the proper amendment, and that  is to strike the low-yield missile at this point.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman Connolly for yielding  me his last minute and rise in support of this very important amendment  to move $97 million to the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation account.   Without question, we are going to undergo modernization of our entire  nuclear stockpile in this country. We are going to spend well over a  trillion dollars.   In addition to that, we have had discussions this afternoon and  debate about this new low-yield nuclear weapon, which many people have  misgivings about in view of the way it has been handled in committee  here.   There is no more important time in terms of the world, when we look  at many unstable regimes that hold nuclear weapons within their stock,  for us to have the most capable people with the most technical  expertise to advise, not just people here in the United States, but our  friends and allies abroad and international organizations concerned  about nuclear proliferation.   So the gentleman's amendment increases our ability, doesn't harm our  ability, to monitor and verify arms control agreements and prevent  other countries from acquiring nuclear weapons.   I support the amendment. I think it makes sense with what we are  doing with our own arsenal and what is happening globally. It makes  ultimate sense that we should never cut these accounts.    Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for  yielding, and I rise in opposition to this amendment, not completely  understanding what it is the gentleman is objecting to.   I know that you have an individual about whom you are upset. The  gentleman is from the State of Arizona.   Am I correct?    The State of the gentleman is under this Western Area  Power Authority. We don't have that sort of power umbrella in our  region of the country. I have read all about the fights in the West  among all these Western States, a dozen and a half Western States:  Arizona fights with California; California fights with Washington;  Washington fights--it is unbelievable. So I am a little reluctant as a  non-Westerner to believe anybody until we get a proper tribunal to  assess whether what you are saying is correct or not. For all I know,  this man put some power in another State that hurt Arizona. I don't  know.   I look at the controversies out there, and I just think that this  amendment targets one person and reduces their salary to one dollar  without any trial, without any tribunal. It sort of reminds me of the  way in which the gentleman's side of the aisle handled the firing of  the chaplain and then, because we finally tried to get some justice  here, he was brought on.   Mr. Chair, you don't do this to people. We have a judicial process in  this country, and you have to go through the proper channels. I think  we have to focus on fair ways in which to adjudicate if, in fact, there  is something going on out there. I really question whether what is  really going on here is a fight between Arizona and adjoining States.    I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   I would just say, you know, there used to be an old expression. They  asked Jesse James, ``Why do you rob banks.'' He said, ``That is where  the money is.''   So I think about the situation we face in our country today. I am not  willing to take the money out of this budget, which I consider critical  to America's security at home and abroad, and meanwhile, in other fora,  to give trillions of dollars to the top 1 percent in this country who  aren't really interested in what we are doing here much, don't  appreciate it sometimes. I am not willing to leave off the hook the  Wall Street bankers that took us into the 2008 recession, not a single  one went to jail.   It is interesting where the gentlewoman is looking for money. One of  the reasons I chose to be on this subcommittee is I am sick of going to  war for energy. Too many people from my region have died.   I think part of America's solution is becoming energy independent and  being able to conduct war where we have to. This bill allows us to do  that for the sake of the Republic.   I think the gentlewoman has a good intention to try to balance the  budget. I think she is looking at the wrong end of the telescope.    Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to thank Congresswoman  Jackson Lee for yielding and for the incredible work she does  representing the Gulf region in its fullness.   I understand, through her and through my own studies, the damage done  by Hurricane Harvey and the need for studies such as these to advance  flood control projects to mitigate future damage. I think she has been  such an articulate spokeswoman, reminding us that times are changing  and we have to pay attention to coastal communities.   I have to also mention that there are funds in the supplemental bill  we passed earlier this year for purposes such as these, and we have  plussed up the Army Corps budget in this particular bill. So I think  that will serve Texas very well.   And the gentlewoman mentioned the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. We  are all deeply concerned.   So I thank my colleague for offering this amendment. I thank her for  her great leadership and urge all of our colleagues to support her  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment, though  I think he intends it well.   I want to inform him that the Department of Energy has said it does  not have plans to purchase additional heavy water from Iran. So I think  this amendment is really irrelevant.   Frankly, I would rather that the United States take whatever Iran has  rather than letting them sell it to Russia or somebody else. But the  Department of Energy has clearly said they don't have plans to purchase  additional heavy water from Iran.   And so the gentleman's amendment is unnecessary, and I urge my  colleagues to oppose it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  the time.   I just wanted to say, the gentleman who is offering this amendment, I  oppose the amendment, and you and I view the world very differently.   I view the Government of the United States as a bulwark for social  and economic stability in this country. If I look at why we have a  deficit going back, one of the reasons is oil wars.   This department is one of the most important departments in the  country to lead us to energy independence as a country. I don't think  we should do what you are asking us to do here. If we look at our trade  deficit, we haven't had balanced trade accounts since the mid-1970s.   Adding trillions of dollars to our trade deficit every year is making  it harder to fund Social Security and Medicare, programs that are  essential to social stability in this country. If we look at the 2008  crash and the trillions of dollars that cost us as a country, nobody on  Wall Street went to jail.   It is interesting to me where people want to pick away, pick away,  pick away when you look at the big money, the moneys for war, the money  for paying for imported goods as opposed to producing here at home, the  causes of what happened in 2008, and there was no justice that was  given to the Republic.   So, to me, energy independence is critical, if you look at the  trillions we have added to the deficit because of war. So we look at  the country through different ends of the telescope, I think, and I  urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   I really think the result of your amendment will be less investment  in the Republic, less investment in water resource infrastructure and  energy development, and less investments that create good jobs and have  substantial returns on investments such as modernizing our ports and  all of the infrastructure that helps us to achieve social and economic  stability in this country, which isn't easy to do.   So I thank my colleagues for listening, and I would urge opposition  to this amendment.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Nolan) for yielding me the time.   Talk about working hard, you are here at 9 o'clock in Washington and  the day started very early.   I thank the gentleman for being here and defending the Great Lakes. I  support his amendment. I personally represent about 200 miles of Lake  Erie's  [[Page H4957]]  coast, the shallowest and most abundant of the Great Lakes. We know  what zebra mussels are and quagga mussels. We also know about aquatic  plants like phragmites that are just invading and causing all kinds of  problems along our shores.   The Aquatic Nuisance Species Research Program works on other species  in other parts of the country, so I thank the gentleman for being a  champion of the Great Lakes and a champion of so many important causes.   We know that in our Great Lakes we have about a $6 billion fishery  that we are trying to protect, but these quagga and zebra mussels are  spreading rapidly. The gentleman is right. It is just an explosion.  There is no other way to explain it. They came in in ballast water. We  tried to adopt ballast water regulations so it has to be dumped when it  is further up the Saint Lawrence Seaway before those ships come down.  It didn't happen, so now we have this to contend with.   We are trying to keep these invasive species out of our lakes. We are  threatened by the Asian carp. We are trying to fish those out  temporarily while we try to find a more genetically impactful solution.   I want to thank the gentleman for transferring $1 million from the  Corps' operation and maintenance account to increase the Corps' Aquatic  Nuisance Species Research Program. I commend the gentleman for that and  thank him for working so late into the night.   Your constituents are lucky Congressman Nolan is here.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, essentially, the LaMalfa amendment would  prohibit funds from being used to enforce the criteria for abandoned  prior converted cropland. Currently, if land categorized as prior  converted cropland has not been used for agricultural purposes for 5  consecutive years, if the owner of that land wanted to fill or dredge  it, they would need to get a section 404 permit from the Corps, and  those are generally wetlands.   So this amendment would basically create a ``once exempted from  having to get a Section 404 permit, always exempted'' standard,  overturning 35 years of Federal policy.   The amendment makes a significant change to the Clean Water Act  regulations, one that deserves thoughtful consideration. Under current  law and regulation, activities that convert wetlands that occur as a  part of existing ongoing farming, ranching, and silviculture activities  do not require section 404 wetlands permits.   Let me repeat that for my colleagues. The Clean Water Act explicitly  exempts certain activities from regulation, including normal  agricultural activities like plowing fields, planting and harvesting  crops, and maintaining irrigation and drainage ditches.   The gentleman from California wants to go further than the exemptions  already in the law and in the underlying bill. In his view, wetlands  should be able to be filled, even when prior converted farmland has had  no action or indication of actual agricultural use for 5 consecutive  years; that is, there has been no cropping, no management, no  maintenance activities related to agricultural production.   I say to my dear colleague from California, it is hard to understand  how prior cropland wouldn't be abandoned if none of the activities of  farming are performed there for 5 consecutive years.   I would also like to point out that this specific regulation has been  on the books for 35 years; yet this amendment would overturn at least  35 years of policy to create a ``once exempted, always exempted''  standard for any land that was ever used as farmland.   Now, let me tell you, additionally, why this concerns me. According  to the Ohio--my home State--Environmental Protection Agency, since the  late 18th century, 90 percent of Ohio's wetland resources have been  destroyed or degraded through draining, filling, or other modification.  Because of the valuable functions the remaining wetlands perform,  including filtration to adjoining lakes and streams, it is imperative  to ensure that all impacts to wetlands are properly mitigated.   Wetlands help filter impurities from water. Sediment settles out the  runoff, and contaminants bind to plant surfaces in wetlands, resulting  in improved water quality. Wetlands perform other valuable functions,  including reducing flood flow and shoreline erosion control.   In Ohio, we also depend upon our wetlands as a haven for rare and  endangered plants, and one-third of all the endangered species depend  on wetlands for survival; and many wetlands are important fish spawning  and nursery areas, as well as nesting, resting, and feeding areas for  waterfowl.    So we should make certain that any changes we make to wetlands policy  that may result in the destruction of these important ecological areas  are evaluated carefully and that we not overturn decades-old policy  lightly.   It is for these reasons that I must respectfully oppose the  amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do so as well.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I have to oppose my good friend Mr. Gohmert on  this amendment.   The gentleman actually wants to prohibit funds from being used to  implement any activities regarding the social costs of carbon. And this  amendment tells the Department of Energy to ignore the latest  meteorological data and changes dealing with weather science. And the  amendment denies that carbon pollution is harmful. According to this  amendment, the cost of carbon pollution is zero.   I remember my first trip to New York City after I graduated from  college. Thank goodness it has changed. I had a pink blouse on. By the  time I finished the first afternoon, it was so full of gray spots I  hardly recognized it. And I didn't know what it was. Well, it was  carbon. It was fallout from the chimneys and so forth in New York City.   So we know that carbon has impacts. This amendment is tantamount to  saying that weather changes and climate change have no cost and no one  will get hurt. Well, that simply isn't true. Tell that to citizens in  Puerto Rico who lost businesses, homes, and loved ones after Hurricane  Maria, that there is no cost from weather changes.   Last year's devastating hurricane season resulted in Puerto Ricans  still without power 9 months later, almost 5,000 lives lost, and almost  200,000 people displaced from their homes.   House Republicans can vote for this amendment, they can try to block  the Department of Energy from recognizing the damage caused by climate  changes, but they can't overturn the laws of nature.   I am amazed in my part of the country how much water is coming down  now, spring rains at such fierce levels. The way they come, it is very  different from when I was first growing up there.   So, in the National Climate Assessment, our Nation's leading climate  scientists reiterated what we have known for years: Climate change is  real, evidenced by the climate-related indicators we have observed,  including longer seasons, extreme droughts, and sea level rise.   The amendment tells the Department to ignore these scientific  findings. That is irresponsible and a blatant disregard to the well- being and security of our great Nation, not just now but into the  future.   The truth is that unchecked climate change would have catastrophic  impacts here in the United States and across the globe. They are  already starting.   Those who are less fortunate will face the heaviest impact. I  remember going down to New Orleans and seeing the Ninth Ward. The  poorest people in New Orleans lived in the Ninth Ward, and it was the  most dangerous place to live.  [[Page H4969]]    While claiming that climate change has no cost, House Republicans and  the Trump administration seem to be arguing that they are the champions  of the working class, decrying the critical EPA safeguards and their  alleged impacts on working-class Americans and their access to  healthcare.   It is amazing to look at maps of where trees exist. Many times in  cities across this country, where the poorest people live there are no  trees. And there is a direct relationship between asthma, the lack of  oxygen, and trees.   So you don't have to pay attention to the science, but it is pretty  clear.   I think it is outrageous that the opposition party has the nerve to  pose as the defenders of working-class Americans because, actually, you  have a pretty poor record of defending those who are the poorest,  ranging from dropping food stamps, to the GOP tax scam selling out  Medicare and Medicaid to pay for corporate tax breaks, to Republican  Governors deciding not to approve the expansion of Medicaid under the  Affordable Care Act and now trying to get rid of people on insurance  who have preexisting conditions, to failing to quickly provide funding  resources and the necessary leadership to help the victims of last  fall's hurricanes.   The evidence is all out there if anybody cares to look. But to hear  you tell the story, the only way to protect the health of America's  workers and their children is to weaken longstanding public health  protections.   To say we should allow polluters to pollute more? That is nonsense.  More air and water pollution won't make our Nation's citizens any  healthier. More toxic pollution certainly isn't the answer. And the  answer certainly isn't pretending that climate change won't have real  costs to all Americans.   I was interested to hear tonight some of our colleagues from New  Mexico telling about how very, very dry New Mexico is, with one of the  shortest snowfalls in history.   So it is time to stop denying the science and accept reality: Climate  change is occurring, it is caused by humans, and it is already causing  serious damage.   We are at the beginning of a new hurricane season, and now is not the  time to pretend that extreme weather events, rising seas, and more  frequent storms do not have a cost.   Before the Trump administration abandoned common sense, the social  cost of carbon was a very conservative calculation. The full costs of a  rapidly changing climate are almost certainly significantly higher, but  the social cost of carbon is a much, much better estimate than assuming  the costs are zero.   Unfortunately, that is what this amendment would require the  government to assume: zero harm and zero cost from carbon pollution and  climate change.   So I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. Pretending climate  change doesn't exist won't make it go away.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
