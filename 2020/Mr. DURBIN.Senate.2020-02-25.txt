 Madam President, I would like to note that this morning  at 8 a.m., an unusual meeting took place in this Capitol Building. It  was in the area of the building that is reserved for top-secret  classified briefings. All Members of the Senate were invited. The issue  at that briefing was the coronavirus.   I sat through the major part of that briefing before I had to leave  for another meeting. There wasn't anything in there that should have  been classified or top secret. If there were ever a time when we need  to be open, honest, and complete in telling the whole story to the  American people, it is this moment when we face the coronavirus, which  started, we believe, in China and is now spreading across the world.   I back up what the Democratic leader said earlier because the request  was made at this meeting for some $2 billion in the United States to  respond to this coronavirus threat. When we questioned  the administration as to why that number and what they were going to do  with it, the answers were limited. In fact, when it came to the source  of the money, they had no answer at all.    Remember, this is an administration which has consistently asked to  cut the funding for the Centers for Disease Control. It has been a low  priority of the Trump administration until we faced this threat, and  now they have suddenly awakened. It turns out that even in the next  fiscal year, which begins on October 1, the Trump administration has  asked to cut the money for the Centers for Disease Control again.   You ask yourself, who is in charge over there? Who is making the  basic decisions? Well, it could be the person who has decided that  every available dollar needs to be put into a wall on the Mexican  border.   Think of this for a moment: Ten billion dollars currently sits in an  account for the building of this wall--unspent. They can't spend it.  Yet the President recently asked for $3.8 billion more for building his  almighty wall--which I thought Mexico was going to pay for--and now  comes at the last minute asking for some $2 billion for the  coronavirus.   As one Senator said in the meeting this morning, when it comes down  to it, if our business is to protect the American people, isn't the  highest priority to stop the spread of this virus in the United States?  Of course it is, and that is why it should be a higher priority. No  wall is going to stop that virus from coming into the United States.  The President ought to wake up to that reality.   When you look at the efforts that are being made here in the United  States and around the world, we can and should do more. I support this  request for a dramatic increase in funding for this purpose now--now,  before it spreads across the United States, which God forbid it ever  does. We don't want it to. We want to make sure we have done everything  in our power to stop it, and that means empowering those in charge with  the knowledge, with the expertise, and with the authority to protect  our families. First and foremost, protect American families. That is a  much higher priority than any campaign promise this President made  about a wall on our southern border.   I support the effort by Senator Schumer asking for some top doc or  some individual with management authority, management experience, and  the knowledge of the public health threat we face with this  coronavirus, to be put in charge to coordinate the myriad agencies that  will be touched by this campaign to protect America. Now is the time to  do it. The time to do it--at least now, but it should have been much  earlier, with more money dedicated to this purpose rather than cutting  back on these key agencies.    I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator  from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator  from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator  from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, later this afternoon, we are going to  have two votes on motions to proceed. They are procedural votes to go  forward on two pieces of legislation relative to the issue of abortion.  Those of us in public life know full well that this is a very  controversial issue. There are people who feel very strongly on one  side and very strongly on the other.   These votes this afternoon will not resolve that conflict. They don't  try to. What the Republican majority under Senator McConnell has  decided to do is to bring back for a vote two items we already voted  on. We know the outcome. We can virtually predict within one or two  votes what it is going to be.   At the end of the day, Republicans will turn to a special interest  group and say: We told you we could call this every year. We did it.   We will have Members who will vote their conscience on both sides of  the aisle, but the net result of that is not going to be to change  anything for the better in the United States, when it comes to the  issues that challenge us.   What I would like to do is to come to this floor with a radical idea.  I have an idea how we can come together, regardless of our position on  that issue, and do something constructive for this country. Let me tell  you what I have in mind. The United States currently ranks 32 out of 35  industrial nations when it comes to infant mortality. That is right--32  out of 35 when it comes to the survival of babies in the United States  once born.   A 2018 report published in Health Affairs by Global Health  characterized the United States of America as ``the most dangerous of  wealthy nations for a child to be born into.'' What they found was that  U.S. babies--babies born in the United States--are three times as  likely to die of premature birth and more than twice as likely to die  of SIDS than babies in comparably rich countries. Every year, more than  [[Page S1130]]  23,000 infants die in the United States, largely due to factors that in  many cases could have been prevented: low birth weight, maternal health  complications, prematurity.   Babies of color are particularly at risk. Black infants are twice as  likely to die in America as White infants, a disparity that is greater  than it was in the year 1850 in this country.   We are not only losing babies, we are losing mothers, as well. Listen  to this statistic. The United States is one of only 13 countries in the  world where the rate of maternal mortality--mothers dying during the  birth process, related to pregnancy or childbirth, for up to a year  postpartum--is worse than it was 25 years ago. We haven't moved  forward. We have moved backward when it comes to mothers surviving  child birth.   Nationwide, more than 700 women die every year as a result of  pregnancy and more than 70,000 suffer near-fatal complications. More  than 660 percent of these deaths are preventable.   Sadly, much like with babies, the tragedy of maternal mortality is  even more pronounced when you look at communities of color. In the  United States of America, women of color are three to four times more  likely than White women to die as a result of pregnancy. If you think  it has something to do with poverty and wealth--that is what I  thought--there is no correlation. The only correlation is race.   In my State of Illinois, I am sorry to report that if you are an  African-American woman, you are six times more likely than a White  woman to die in childbirth. That is why Congressional Representative  Robin Kelly, in the House, and my colleague Senator Tammy Duckworth and  I, in the Senate, have joined in introducing the MOMMA's Act.   First and foremost, more than anything, this bill would expand the  length of time that a new mother can keep her Medicaid health coverage.  Currently, Medicaid only has to cover women for 2 months after  the child is born. Our bill would expand that to a full year. The  Medicaid Program pays for 50 percent of all births nationwide--44  percent in Illinois. It is a big part of the treatment of women who are  giving birth to children. This program is vital for new moms and  babies, and it makes no sense that a new mom's health coverage is  terminated 2 months after she has given birth. Why don't we stick with  her so she can live? Why don't we do something affirmative to say that  we are committed to mothers and children on a bipartisan basis,  regardless of our position on any other issue?    The MOMMA's Act would also provide access to doulas, as well as  improve implicit bias and cultural competency training among healthcare  providers. Too often Black women are ignored or not taken seriously by  healthcare providers. Doulas can help provide education advocacy and  support for women whose voices today are being ignored. Our bill would  establish national obstetric emergency protocols and ensure  dissemination of the best practices for healthcare providers dealing  with moms and babies. Finally, it would help to standardize maternal  and infant health data collection reporting so we have a better idea of  what is happening and why.   Our bill is supported by the American Medical Association, Families  USA, the March of Dimes, the American College of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and the Black  Mamas Matter Alliance. Our bill is supported by these and many other  public health and provider organizations because it would save the  lives and improve the lives of moms and babies.   We can debate the issue of abortion back and forth all day. We know  how the votes are going to turn out, and we know nothing is going to  occur. Why don't we come together on something bipartisan that says we  are all dedicated to reducing the incidence of infant mortality and  maternal mortality in this country? Isn't that one thing we can agree  on? That is my challenge to this Senate Chamber.   Leader McConnell has made it clear that he has no intention of  allowing the Senate to debate and pass legislation that will actually  help families in need. I hope he is wrong. Instead, he wants us only to  vote on controversial judicial nominees and politically charged anti- choice legislation that has no chance of passing. If he is serious  about wanting to save the lives of babies and their mothers, I hope  that he will make an exception for the MOMMA's Act.   I would like to make a unanimous consent request.   I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be discharged from  further consideration of S. 916, the Mothers and Offspring Mortality  and Morbidity Awareness Act, also known as the MOMMA's Act; that the  Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Reserving the right to object.    I do not question the sincerity of my colleague. I know  you come to this issue with a sincere heart. I don't question that at  all. What I am saying to you is that you and I could spend the rest of  this day and the next on this floor debating the issue of abortion, and  we are not going to resolve it--not in this Chamber, not in this  country.   What I am asking you to do is look beyond the current issues that are  coming to the floor this afternoon and try to find some common ground-- Republicans and Democrats--on the issue of maternal mortality.   You have to be shocked, as I am, to read these numbers about the  babies and mothers who are dying, particularly babies and mothers of  color. If we can do something as a nation to show we truly do care  about this, even though we have differences on this issue of abortion,  wouldn't that be a breakthrough for this Chamber? I think the people  across this country would applaud us and say: They finally did  something. They finally came to an agreement.   What I propose is the MOMMA's Act, which is a good bill and is one  that I think should pass. The Senator has proposed an alternative. Here  is an idea. Listen to this radical idea: What if we bring the MOMMA's  Act to the floor and agree that we will debate an amendment--any  amendment one would want to offer? Do you know what it would be? It  would be like the U.S. Senate. It would be the Senate. Think of it. The  Senator as a Republican and I as a Democrat would actually be debating  an issue that would make a difference in America. We would be putting  our best ideas up for a vote on the Senate floor. How about that for a  motion?   We are not going to get anywhere with the Senator's proposal this  afternoon, because we have passed it before. We know the outcome. We  know the final vote. I would say the Senator's alternative proposal,  which was once offered by Senator Grassley on the floor when I tried  this before, is just inadequate. The resources aren't there to deal  with the scope and gravity of the problem.   So why don't we do this? Why don't we act like Senators? Why don't we  do something on a bipartisan basis and bring an issue to the floor that  truly counts and that people care about? It would be a breakthrough. It  might make a headline. It might even make a tweet somewhere. This is  not the way to do it--that it is the Senator's way or my way.   What I would suggest to the Senator, though, is to bring it to the  floor and to join me in doing it on a bipartisan basis. Appeal to  Senator McConnell to finally let the Senate be the Senate. The Senator  knows we have people who come to the Galleries here who look down at  these desks and say: You know, I think there used to be Senators who  sat at those desks who actually legislated, who actually debated, who  actually had amendments. Last year, under Senator McConnell, we had 22  amendments on the floor of the Senate. Why not more than 22?   That is it. We are not talking about anything else. If the Senator  truly wants to join me on this floor in a bipartisan debate on this  issue of infant and maternal mortality, let's do it. For the time  being, I have to object to what the Senator has proposed. Please, I  didn't question the Senator's sincerity in bringing up this issue, and  I hope he won't question mine in suggesting we ought to be the Senate  and debate this issue.   I object.    Madam President, infanticide should be a crime, and it  is. That is what the Senator from Nebraska will not concede. He thinks  he has come up with a novel idea--that you shouldn't be able to kill a  baby with impunity in America. It is not novel. It has been in Federal  law for over a decade, and it is in State laws all across the United  States. If one has any doubt about it, be prepared to write down a  name--the name of Kermit Gosnell. Thirteen years ago, I believe it was,  this physician was convicted of infanticide. He is now serving life  without parole, plus 30 years. To argue that the Senator has some novel  idea that infanticide should be a crime and that we don't cover it now  under the law is just not accurate, and it is not factual. That is why  I think the Senator's bill is unnecessary.   This bill is necessary. Mothers are dying and babies are dying, and  we can do something about it. It doesn't matter whether one goes to a  pro-life or to a pro-choice rally; we all agree that this is something  we can do on a bipartisan basis.

Madam President, when one looks at a largely unified and  democratic Europe, today it is easy to forget just how different it was  in Eastern Europe not that long ago. For half a century, millions lived  under the tyranny and repression of the Soviet Union.   But in the late 1980s, things began to change, particularly in the  Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Who can forget when 2  million people joined hands across these three nations to form the 420- mile Baltic Chain of Freedom in August 1989? And not long after in  February of the following year, Lithuania held its first free elections  since World War II, voting for the country's first postwar non- Communist government. Immediately thereafter, the new Parliament voted  to make Lithuania the first occupied Soviet republic to declare  independence. Lithuania's bold move was followed later that year by  Latvia and Estonia. These brave efforts culminated a year later in  February 1991, when the Lithuania people overwhelmingly voted for  independence--a historic move recognized by the US and Soviet Union  that same year.   My first visit to Lithuania was nearly 40 years ago, but my ties  reach back even further. One hundred years ago, my grandmother left her  village of Jubarkas with her three small children to join my  grandfather in America. In her arms, she carried a 2-year-old toddler-- my mother, Ona Kutkaite.   Hidden in my grandmother's baggage was a small Catholic prayer book,  printed in Vilnius in 1863, the last year before printing in Lithuanian  was outlawed by the czars. That prayer book--the last, cherished relic  of my family's life in their beautiful and ancient home--escaped the  czars and was kept safe with our family in America during the brutal  Soviet occupation. When I had the honor of addressing the Seimas of the  Republic of Lithuania on the 20th anniversary of independence, I was  proud to bring that prayer book home to a free Lithuania. Those brave  Lithuanians 30 years ago--including my friend Vytautus Landsbergis, who  served as Lithuanian's first post-independence head of state--led the  country to a prosperous and democratic future.   Lithuania today is a vital member of the European Union, NATO, and  the community of democracies. It held the presidency of the European  Union earlier this decade and is a leading voice on the continent for  standing up to Russia, defending Ukraine, and upholding key democratic  values. And as it faces renewed threats from Russia, I have been a  strong supporter of strengthening NATO operations and defenses in the  Baltic nations. A few years ago, I visited the Lithuanian town of  Rukla, where U.S. and German forces were rotating through as part of  the European Reassurance Initiative aimed at keeping the Baltic safe.   As the cochair of the Senate Baltic Caucus, I will be introducing a  resolution in the weeks ahead reaffirming this security cooperation and  recognizing Lithuania's great achievements around its 30th anniversary  of independence.   In February 1990, when I came to Lithuania as part of an American  delegation to observe the historic elections, my friends took me inside  the Seimas to show me the arsenal of the Lithuanian freedom fighters.  In the corner stood a handful of old rifles--no  [[Page S1143]]  match for the Soviet war machine. But Lithuanians were armed with  stronger weapons--faith, courage, and a burning desire to reclaim their  independence. Because of the sacrifices of so many patriots, known and  unknown, we can proudly and without fear proclaim here today on the  30th anniversary of these historic events: Laisva Lietuva. Free  Lithuania. Now and always.   So let us use this historic anniversary to recommit to our continued  support for our Baltic allies through economic and security cooperation  and to reaffirm America's commitment to NATO and the enduring  transatlantic alliance. Doing so will help ensure the next 30 years of  the longstanding U.S.-Baltic friendship are equally strong and  fruitful.                            ____________________     Madam President, Florence Hayden Towne dedicated her  book, ``Neighbor: Stories of Neighborhood House Work in a Great City,''  to the Erie Neighborhood House. She wrote, it ``brought new hope and  courage and a new way of life these whom we call `neighbors.' ''  Throughout its 150-year history, the Erie House has consistently  improved the lives of low-income, immigrant families in Chicago. Though  the people, challenges, and times may have changed, the Erie House's  mission has remained firm. Immigrant families have always found Erie  House to be a place that empowers them and helps creates a more engaged  community. Today, we celebrate the great work of Erie House and  congratulate its staff and supporters on the 150th anniversary.   Erie Neighborhood House began as Holland Presbyterian Church on the  corner of North Noble Street and West Erie Street in 1870. The  congregation offered several programs, including kindergarten and  Sunday school, to the new families arriving from Dutch, Scandinavian,  and German countries to the West Chicago neighborhood. The congregation  moved to 1347 West Erie Street and changed its name to Erie Chapel in  1886. In 1893, Erie Kindergarten became one of the 20 flagship programs  in Chicago's Free Kindergarten Association initiative and expanded  youth programs to include choirs for children and adults and industrial  classes.   As the neighborhood immigrant population changed to include Catholic  countries like Poland and Italy, Erie Chapel renamed itself the Erie  Chapel Institute and continued to serve the community and advance the  settlement house tradition. In 1936, the staff rechristened the 1347  building with a new name, the Erie Neighborhood House.   Erie Neighborhood House continued to meet the challenges of the time.  In 1942, with the Second World War raging, Erie House began providing  daycare services since many men were deployed overseas and many women  had entered the workforce. In February 1945, Reverend Douglas Cedarleaf  marched with members of Erie House to protest the treatment of the  Strongs, a Black family that had recently moved into a White community  and faced violence from their neighbors.   In 1957, volunteer physicians at Northwestern Memorial and Erie  Neighborhood House founded the Erie Family Health Center to provide a  variety of primary care, case management, and dental services to low- income, underinsured, and uninsured Chicagoans. Now, every year, nearly  38,000 patients receive high-quality healthcare at the center,  regardless of their ability to pay.   With the crisis in housing growing in the late 1960s, Erie House  founded the Bickerdike Redevelopment Corporation to create affordable  housing opportunities for members of the community. Since its founding,  Bickerdike has developed more than 2,000 affordable homes for families.   Today, the West Town and Little Village neighborhoods are primarily  Latino, and Erie Neighborhood House is helping people with the tools  they need to build a foundation for greater well-being. Erie House has  hosted me several times and has been an important ally in working  toward comprehensive immigration reform and supporting Dreamers,  providing legal consultation and representing people in immigration and  asylum cases.   The blueprint created 150 years ago has evolved, but that mission has  remained constant. Today, Erie House helps 18,000 people all across the  city of Chicago annually. Young people and adults attend mentoring  programs and learn about career opportunities. Families experiencing  violence can find counseling. Erie House remains an essential ally as  we work toward a just, inclusive society where we accept our new  neighbors and help them achieve their potential.   Congratulations to Erie Neighborhood House on 150 years of good work,  giving people hope and courage.
