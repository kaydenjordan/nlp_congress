 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Yes, I  am a member of the Rules Committee. I am also a member of the Committee  on Energy and Commerce.   The Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee has under their  jurisdiction the Office of Refugee Resettlement.   So, the Department of Health and Human Services is tasked with caring  for unaccompanied children who are transferred from Customs and Border  Protection at their processing centers. I have seen this firsthand on  many trips to the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement shelters.   HHS personnel work hard. They provide quality, compassionate care to  children who cross the border without legal status.   These facilities have security to protect the children inside, but a  child who wants to leave may request to be returned to their home  country, and they may do so with on-site social work.   In my experience, all shelters I have visited are designed  appropriately for the ages of the children who are occupying them. If  an older teen decides, of their own volition, that they need to leave,  they are neither detained nor restrained.   So, it bothers me when I hear these facilities referred to as  detainment centers or child prisons. Office of Refugee Resettlement are  shelters to protect these children while they are awaiting placement in  homes in this country.   And I do need to add one other thing. This is a closed rule. It is a  shame we are doing it as a closed rule. I offered an amendment up in  the Rules Committee a few moments ago to reimburse the State of Texas  for the $800 million that Governor Abbott has felt is required to send  down to the border for border security.    Governor Perry did it in his administration.   This is an ongoing problem for the State of Texas. This is work that  should be done by the United States Federal Government, and the State  has to take up and expend those dollars. That is wrong, and it needs to  change.
