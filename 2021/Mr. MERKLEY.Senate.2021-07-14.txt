 Mr. President, this is a critical time for America. It  is a moment in which the actions we take or don't take will affect the  very design of our government for generations to come.   Our Founders had a vision that we all are created equal. In our  initial Constitution, it wasn't fully manifested, but we have worked  through several hundred years to come to that point that we recognize  that every American should be able to participate in the direction of  their country. We had some key moments in that national debate.   I was always fascinated that when my father was born in 1919, women  couldn't vote in America. We had all kinds of other barriers for  communities of color--for Black Americans, for Native Americans--and  those barriers we struck down time after time after time.   Then we came to 1965, and we said there are still so many ways that  communities are trying to keep every citizen from participating in  voting, and we are going to make sure that ends from this point  forward.   President Johnson said that the power of the vote is the most  significant tool ever developed to strike down injustice. It is a  powerful tool. It is really the beating heart of our Republic, that  ballot box, the ability to say: This is what I like, and this is what I  don't like. This is who I like, and this is who I don't think will  carry the policies I believe in.    At its heart, this is a vision of power flowing up from the people,  not down from the powerful, but here is the problem: The powerful don't  like that vision of America, so they have many, many strategies  designed to try to override that founding vision of participation. They  have legions of lawyers, and they have legions of lobbyists. There are  three drug lobbyists for every single Member of Congress. They  [[Page S4896]]  have the ability to fund mass media campaigns to try to change the way  that issues are framed. They have the ability to participate with dark  money in elections that manifests itself in those endless attack ads  you see on social media and on television.   They have all of these abilities, but the thing they really fear is  the ballot box, and right now in America, they are going after the  ballot box. We have to decide if we are going to defend it or not. That  is the challenge that faces us, and it is a challenge that shouldn't be  that difficult because every single one of us in this Chamber took an  oath to the Constitution. The Constitution lays out the power, the  vision of government of, by, and for the people. It starts off in the  Constitution ``we the people,'' not ``we the powerful''--``we the  people.''   This assault has now spread to 18 States and 35 new, restrictive  voting laws. These laws attack the ability to vote, and they are  targeting Black Americans, communities of color, poor Americans, and  college students. They make it harder to register. They make it easier  to purge voters off the voting rolls. You can't vote if you are not on  a voting roll. They attack early voting. They attack vote by mail. They  attack curbside voting. They make it hard to drop off your ballot. They  make it hard for people with disabilities to fill out their ballots.   In some cases, they are creating a strategy of voter intimidation by  allowing poll watchers to essentially hover over you as you vote and  challenge your legitimacy to vote. They have even decided, in some  cases, to make it so that, if you are in line to vote and it is a hot  day, nobody can give you a drink of water. All of these strategies are  about biasing America in its process so the powerful will run this  place rather than the people.   I would love to hear a Senator come to this floor and defend these  attacks on the right to vote because, if you are not defending the  right to vote, you are not defending the Constitution, and every one of  us took an oath to that Constitution.   We also have a challenge with the courts. It is the Supreme Court  that said that it is OK to have hundreds of millions of dollars of dark  money--and nobody knows where it came from--in our elections. Now, if  you or I donate $100 to someone, it has to be disclosed. Everyone knows  I made that donation. Yet if a powerful corporation or a billionaire  puts $1 million or $100 million into an election, he can do it and  remain in complete secrecy. That is why it is called dark money, and  that is what the Court unleashed with its Citizens United decision.   Then the Court said: That is not enough. We are going to go after  voting rights by undermining the 1965 Voting Rights Act, even though  this Chamber has reauthorized that act on a bipartisan basis time after  time after time.   First, the Court said in Shelby County v. Holder that preclearance no  longer applies. So a State that had been routinely attempting to block  citizens from voting no longer had to have new changes in its voting  laws precleared to make sure it did not have a prejudicial effect  against a targeted group of voters. Within days, chambers in this  country were plotting about how to stop people from voting. The Supreme  Court was maybe just so idealistic that they said nobody would ever do  this again in America and that no chamber would ever do this in  America. If that were right, if that were their thought, they were  wrong because, within days, those plots unfolded.   Then we have the most recent Supreme Court decision of Brnovich v.  DNC, and Alito says that making voting inconvenient doesn't make access  unequal. Well, let's just explain to this Justice, who apparently knows  nothing about how voting really works, that when you make it  inconvenient for a targeted group, you make access unequal. It is  exactly the intent of these laws to make access unequal. Elena Kagan,  in her dissent, said of the equal chance to participate in our  democracy--referring to the 1965 Voting Rights Act--that this law, of  all laws, should never be diminished by this Court.   Section 2 is the most recent section attacked by the Supreme Court,  and it bars procedures that result in the denial or abridgement of the  right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of one's  race or color. Well, one of the issues was from Arizona. It was a  situation wherein you had no easy places to drop off your ballot in  large Native American reservations. So by banning the ability of people  to collect ballots and drop them off, you essentially make it  extraordinarily difficult for this targeted community to vote, and that  was the intent. That was the intent.   Now, this law, section 2, didn't say anything about intent. It said  the result. It didn't say it had to be a denial. It said an  abridgement--in other words, an infringement--on the ability to cast a  ballot, but Alito doesn't care. The majority on the Supreme Court  doesn't care about defending the right to vote, the pulsating heart of  our Republic.   So where does that leave us? It leaves us as the critical factor to  defend the Constitution. The Supreme Court won't do it. The States are  undermining it. It is our responsibility--our responsibility--to set  out those basic standards that defend the ability of every American to  vote. That is why I am here on the floor tonight, talking about the For  the People Act.    It is called S. 1. Why? Because defending the right to vote is our  No. 1 responsibility. That is the challenge we face, and if we fail in  this challenge, then across this country, in State after State after  State, communities are being targeted to make it hard for them to vote,  and it will be harder for them to vote. It will change the outcome, and  it will destroy the idea of equal representation. We cannot let that  happen.   Today, I met with members of the Texas Legislature. They have come  here in order to stop the Texas House of Representatives from passing  these types of laws that are targeted at stopping specific groups from  voting.   What are the types of laws that are being considered by the Texas  Legislature right now? One is they don't like the idea of Christian  communities voting on Sundays and getting in buses to go to the polls  together. They call it Souls to the Polls. So they said: Do you know  what? It will be against the law for more than three of you to get in a  car and drive together to the polls. Are you kidding me? Has anybody  heard of the right of association? Are any Senators here caring about  defending the right of association in our Constitution?   Can you imagine something so diabolical as to say: ``All three of you  can get in a car but not four,'' and ``Do you know why? Because we want  to stop you from using vans or buses to go vote''? That is crazy. It is  as crazy as the Georgia effort to stop people from passing out water in  long voter lines.   What else is the Texas Legislature trying to do?   It is infringing on overnight voting, voting for people who have long  hours, who are working during the day. Overnight voting really made the  ballot accessible.   They are attacking drive-through voting. They are attacking online  registration. They are attacking assistance to disabled Americans. They  are making it easier to purge voters off the lists of voters, the  registration lists.   They even have in that bill stopping election workers from sending  out absentee ballot applications. Is it a crime to be able to help your  fellow citizen apply for a ballot? Yes, if Texas passes that law.   They are also engaged in a process of voter intimidation by allowing  partisan poll watchers to freely intimidate voters. That is wrong on so  many levels. Intimidation is something that has a long history in our  country. It is a very racist history. I remember one of the stories  after the Civil War. You had a situation wherein you formed a group of  horses surrounding a ballot poll place to prevent Black Americans from  being able to get to the polls to vote.   There are all kinds of other voter intimidation strategies. They were  racist strategies. These efforts to stop Black Americans from voting  are racist strategies. It is simply, simply wrong, and we have the  responsibility to end these practices. The effort to silence the voices  of the American people, to stop them from having a say through their  votes, is just fundamental to the vision of a government of, by, and  for the people.   Citizens wonder why it is they are hearing that billionaires don't  pay any taxes and that some of the most profitable corporations in  America don't pay  [[Page S4897]]  any taxes. Well, it goes back to the many advantages the wealthy have  in influencing the outcomes. Those reams of liars, those platoons of  lobbyists, those media campaigns, that dark money, and now the effort  to block the ballot box, that is how afraid the powerful are that the  voice of the people will say: Invest in American families rather than  tax breaks for billionaires. Tackle healthcare and housing and  education. Create living-wage jobs rather than new tax cuts for the  already wealthy and influential.   What we have is a battle between the powerful and privileged holding  onto their lever of power, trembling at the idea that American voters  can get to the polls and determine to block it. They are afraid that,  if voters can get to the polls, they might elect people who are  fighting for Main Street rather than Wall Street. They are afraid they  might invest--those elected individuals--in quality, affordable  healthcare--and healthcare should be a right, not a privilege--that we  might invest in housing because there is a tremendous housing shortage  across America and that we might invest in education because education  is the path to success in our complex society.   So how do we address this? We pass S. 1, the For the People Act. We  do it by following the example of men and women who sat in this Chamber  half a century ago and used their power to pass the 1965 Voting Rights  Act to give every American a full opportunity to vote.   Once again, this more than half a century later, we are called upon  to fight to defend our Constitution, to defend the ``we the people''  vision and ensure that every American can freely and fairly cast a  ballot.   This bill sets out basic national standards for how elections are  conducted in accordance with the constitutional power specifically  stated for Congress to be able to so set such standards to ensure that  every American has equal freedom to vote, equal opportunity regardless  of who they are, the color of their skin, or where they live. It  ensures this access by protecting vote-by-mail, early voting, and  fairness on ballot drop boxes.   Why are early voting and vote-by-mail so scary to the powerful? Here  is why. On election day, there are so many ways to stop people from  voting. First of all, you reduce the number of precincts in the  communities you don't want to vote, so there are fewer places to vote.  Then you put them in places where there is no parking. That makes it  harder. Then you reduce the number of precinct workers in those  locations, so there are really long lines. You have heard about those  lines--3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours. Then you tell  people you can't even give people a glass of water to those who are  waiting in those lines. Then you intimidate people by allowing partisan  poll watchers to hover over people while they vote or one single person  to challenge the legitimacy of the right to vote of every single person  who walks in that door, because that is another one of the bills that  is being passed in State after State.   Election day can be easily manipulated, and there are even more ways  to do it. One is--and this happens--you send out false information  about what day is election day. You send out texts that say: So sorry  you missed the election last Tuesday. Hope you make it to the polls  next time.   So people think they missed the vote. They are, like, well, I thought  it was next Tuesday, but I got this text, so it was last Tuesday.   You put out false information about where the voting location is. You  proceed to make sure you change the location from the previous time so  people get confused about where to go and vote in the wrong precinct,  and then you make it illegal for their vote to be counted if they voted  in the wrong precinct.   Election day is easy to manipulate. The antidote is early voting and  vote-by-mail, and that is why the powerful are attacking early voting  and vote-by-mail.   Now, my State, Oregon, was the first State to adopt vote-by-mail. It  did so when we had a Republican house and a Republican senate in my  State. Utah was a major early State to do vote-by-mail. It is  considered a red State, a Republican State. This isn't blue or red.  This is American. This is our Constitution.   A second thing that the For the People Act does is stop billionaires  from buying elections with dark money. You know, no matter if you poll  Republicans, Independents, or Democrats, they all believe billionaires  shouldn't be able to buy elections with dark money. They know that if a  billionaire can create the equivalent of a stadium sound system that  drowns out the voice of the people, that that is just wrong.   Think about how Americans thought of those early debates in the town  square. Everyone got their chance to stand up and have their say. You  didn't allow someone to erect a big sound system to drown out the  people you didn't want to speak. No. Give everyone--that is kind of the  heart, isn't it, of our First Amendment? Free speech. Everyone should  be able to have their voice heard and not be drowned out by  advertisements by anonymous billionaires buying elections.   The third thing this act does is it ends partisan gerrymandering. It  creates independent Commissions--equal numbers of Republicans,  Democrats, Independents--and therefore fights for the vision of equal  representation.   Now, I have heard some folks salivating over increased  gerrymandering, hoping to influence that other institution down the  hall, saying: Hey, we have an extra 15 votes we shouldn't have right  now. Let's get 25 with increased gerrymandering.   Well, it is just wrong to attack the principle of equal  representation. You don't have equal representation if the system is  rigged so that politicians choose their voters rather than voters  choosing their politicians.   The fourth thing the For the People Act does, it takes on ethics  reforms and targets corruption. Again, whether you ask Democrats,  Republicans, or Independents, they want the corruption out of our  system. They want to ensure that public officials serve the public, not  some private cause or serve themselves; that we are going to do the  people's business, not the business of some outside billionaire or some  outside corporation.   These principles are widely supported across the country. The people  sometimes say: Why don't you have any Republican sponsors on this bill?  Why don't Republicans support this bill?   Across this Nation, Republicans overwhelmingly support these four  principles in this bill. It is incredibly bipartisan. But not here in  this Chamber because here is where the powerful speak, and the minority  leader has said: I am going to lock down my Senators from supporting  these efforts to defend our Constitution.   I would be embarrassed--I would be embarrassed if a leader of a  caucus said it is going to lock me down to prevent me from defending  the Constitution. I would be more than embarrassed; I would be alarmed.  I would be outraged, as should every Member of this body across the  aisle--should be outraged that they are being told they are locked down  from defending the Constitution.   Next month, America will celebrate the 56th anniversary of the 1965  Voting Rights Act, the most powerful, significant advancement this  Nation has ever made to realize that ``we the people'' vision of  America.   Lyndon Johnson called August 6, 1965--the day he signed that law--``a  triumph for freedom as huge as any victory that has ever been won on  any battlefield.'' He said: ``The heart of the act is plain. Wherever,  by clear and objective standards, States and counties use regulations,  or laws, or tests to deny the right to vote, then they will be struck  down.''   Well, that is our job, to do what President Johnson thought was  accomplished when he signed the Voting Rights Act--to strike down  regulations, laws, or tests designed to deny the right to vote to  targeted groups of Americans across this country. So let's do our job.  Put this bill on the floor, and get it passed.
