 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from  California for yielding and for being such a great leader in helping  those impacted by the devastating California wildfires.   The numbers are devastating. Nearly 2 million acres burned. Upwards  of $3.5 billion in damage, 8,500 individual fires, 98 civilians killed,  6 firefighters killed, and over 11,000 homes destroyed.   With climate change only making things worse, we must help California  rebuild because this is just the beginning. Rainstorms will now further  ravage communities, causing mudslides and flooding.   The amendment I have offered with Representative Thompson begins that  rebuilding process by increasing funding for the community development  fund by $50 million, specifically for those communities that were  hardest hit in the previous year.   Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for his work on this.
