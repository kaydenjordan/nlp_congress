 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Nevada for yielding.   He was my chairman, my colleague, and my friend: the late great  Elijah Cummings.   I not only had the good fortune of serving with Chairman Cummings, I  also was blessed to get to know him well over the years. He was a  powerful and passionate advocate for the city of Baltimore, which he  loved so dearly.   I want to say that thousands of my constituents back in St. Louis  have posted messages of condolence for Chairman Cummings' family. One  of the most moving messages simply said this:   One of the nicest things that can be said about a man is that we  believed him.   And that is the truth. Chairman Cummings fearlessly spoke truth to  power, not to defeat an opponent, but to challenge us, to lift up this  institution, and to give the American people a government that is as  good and decent as they are.   I think the true measure of what Elijah Cummings meant to us was  that, early last Thursday, when word of his untimely death began to  spread, there were as many Republican tears as Democratic tears  mourning the passing of this very good man in the spirit of compassion  and reconciliation the Lord has endowed within each of us if we have  the wisdom to seek it.   I want to extend my deepest sympathy to Chairman Cummings' family,  and I want them to know that I share their grief. I have lost a  brother, an American hero, and a true leader of this House.
