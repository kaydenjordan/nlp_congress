 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole) for yielding me the time.    Mr. Speaker, for the past 2 months, Americans have shown resilience,  grit, and patience. The viral and economic data project that we now can  begin a safe, soft reopening of our economy. President Trump's  inclusionary, data-based leadership in this fight is helping to protect  both lives and livelihoods.   Congress has also responded effectively in mitigating the effects of  this public health and economic emergency. I am extremely disappointed,  however, that this House Democrat bill was drafted with not only no  Republican input, but no input from the American people.   Where is the investment for transportation and infrastructure?   Where is the funding to get our children back to school or to support  small businesses to open their businesses safely?   Today, President Trump announced Operation Warp Speed to develop a  vaccine for this virus. Where is this House's investment towards  finding a cure?   Instead, this partisan wish list allows illegal immigrants to receive  stimulus checks, removes local control of elections, and somehow  cannabis is mentioned 68 times.   What in the world cannabis has to do with this crisis, I don't know.   This is another bill going nowhere. The American people deserve  better, especially now.
