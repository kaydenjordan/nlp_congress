 Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Department of Energy and the FBI  have affirmed that the COVID pandemic most likely originated from a  leak of the SARS-CoV-2 from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.   The deadly COVID virus was unleashed on American soil in 2020, yet it  took 3 years and a new majority in Congress to finally start  investigating the malign influence of the barbaric Chinese Communist  Party.   COVID was not the CCP's only flagrant and unsparing attempt to  infiltrate American sovereignty. Earlier this year, spy balloons  floated along the United States and gathered intelligence from  sensitive U.S. military sites.   Just last month, two CCP spies were arrested, and 36 CCP police  officers were charged with operating an illegal and secret police  station in New York City--the two alleged CCP spies only to be quickly  granted bail and released from custody.   In 2020, leaked CCP member data confirmed that U.S. companies such as  Boeing, Qualcomm, and Pfizer had employed dozens of CCP members in  their Chinese facilities.   Rightfully so, Americans are infuriated, blaming ivory towers in  Washington, D.C., and Wall Street for being slow to the punch and  handing our fragile dominion over to globalists.   We ought to do better. We ought to protect Americans, and we ought to  preserve democracy.   This is why I am unapologetically pushing back on the CCP and calling  on the House Judiciary Committee, the DOJ, and the Select Subcommittee  on the Weaponization of the Federal Government to investigate CCP  infiltration into the U.S. Government and do all they can to free Miles  Guo.   In 2017, the CCP's most prominent critic, Miles Guo, claimed  political asylum in the United States, alleging persecution by the CCP.  He has been here for about 6 years. Just last month, Guo was arrested  and denied bail for being pronounced a flight risk.   In this case, the charges against Miles Guo are simply a part of an  organized campaign of political persecution brought against him by the  CCP.   As a matter of fact, in November 2018, George Higginbotham, a senior  official at the DOJ, pleaded guilty to his active role in this illegal  campaign. He admitted to accepting $41 million from the CCP and meeting  with the Vice Minister of Public Security of China to advance the  removal of Guo from the United States.   It is with great dismay but complete confidence that I say that the  weaponization of the United States' prosecutorial system is spinning  further out of control, and it is time we take a stand.   It shows when we have a national crime crisis falling by the wayside  because politically motivated campaigns designed for nothing other than  retribution on political agitators keep getting in the way of our  leading law enforcement officials who refuse to prioritize the American  people.   With each passing year, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the  CCP is accomplishing its goal of insidiously infiltrating the United  States.   All the while, perpetrators, the real threat to the American people,  are let out on the streets, and harmless political targets remain  behind bars with justice denied.   Mr. Speaker, I speak for every American when I say we are done  tucking our tails and being at the losing end of every tradeoff with  the CCP.   They take our jobs, use our technology, and steal our intellectual  property. In turn, we got robbed, spied on, and deadly viruses.   Enough is enough. Free Miles Guo.                            ____________________
