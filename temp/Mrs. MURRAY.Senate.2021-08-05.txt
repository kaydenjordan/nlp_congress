 Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in  saying I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of my great friend  Richard Trumka.   To say Rich was a champion for workers is really an understatement.  He dedicated his life to fighting to secure and strengthen workers'  rights. Everyone who knew Rich knew just how deeply committed he was to  that mission. He understood how hard people in this country work for  their families. He understood the dignity of work. He grew up  understanding it. His grandfather was a coal miner, his father was a  coal miner, and so was he.   It is because he knew how hard people across the country work that he  was driven to work so hard himself, to hold Washington accountable and  make sure our country was looking out for working families.   For decades, Rich led the charge in creating a country that treats  all workers with the dignity and respect they deserve and where every  worker had the right to join a union, including by fighting to root out  systemic inequities and racism in this country.   Rich once said:         There's no evil that's inflicted more pain and more       suffering than racism and it's something we in the labor       movement have a special responsibility to challenge.    He worked to live up to that challenge and to push others as well,  and this country is better because of it.   I have worked with Rich for years and seen firsthand how hard he  fought every day to make sure workers had a seat at the table on  healthcare, education, taxes, climate change. Whatever the issue, you  could expect to hear from Rich because of how those issues affected  working people.   I will always remember working together to develop and draft the PRO  Act, which embodied our vision to give workers and their families a  fair shot in this country--something Rich not only fought for every  day, but, in my mind, will always be remembered for on this floor, in  the halls, and all across our country.   If you didn't hear him in a meeting, you would hear him over the  bullhorn soon enough because he was as comfortable on a picket line as  he was in a  [[Page S5917]]  boardroom or in the Halls of Congress, if not more comfortable, which  is why, even as Rich shaped national policy conversations and led one  of the Nation's biggest unions in the country through some of the most  trying times in its history, including a recession and a pandemic, his  legacy stretches far beyond his legislative accomplishments and beyond  his leadership of the AFL-CIO, and it will stretch onward still as we  continue his lifetime work of fighting for our workers. That is how we  can honor Rich's legacy.   Rich may have been a recognizable face on television, especially with  his mustache; he may have met with Presidents regularly; he may have  changed the history of our Nation for the better; but perhaps the most  remarkable thing is, even at his tallest, he never talked down to  people. Even at his biggest, he fought for the small. Even after all  that he accomplished, he never stopped fighting to do more, which is  why we must not either.   My heart goes out to his wife Barbara and his son Rich Junior during  this tragic time.   I yield the floor.
