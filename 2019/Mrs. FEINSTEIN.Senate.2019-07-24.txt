 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Even  Playing Field Act of 2019. This legislation is an important step  forward in ensuring that women in sports are treated with the respect  and dignity they deserve.   Female athletes, coaches, and trainers are consistently paid less  than their male counterparts, subjected to subpar working conditions,  and receive substantially less investment in their athletic programs.  Simply put, the same opportunities and resources provided to men's  teams are not provided  [[Page S5065]]  to women's teams. The inequities in women's sports recently came to  light in a gender discrimination lawsuit filed by the U.S. Women's  National Soccer Team against the U.S. Soccer Federation.   Although the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team consistently  outperforms the Men's Team--having won four FIFA Women's World Cup  titles and four Olympic gold medals--the lawsuit alleges that the  Women's Team is paid an average of 38 cents on the dollar compared to  the men.   The gender pay gap isn't limited to players, either. Jill Ellis, the  coach of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team, is paid less than half  of what the Men's Team coaches are paid. This is despite the fact that  the Men's Team failed to even qualify for the last World Cup.   Unfortunately, the disparate treatment of women in sports is not  limited to pay. Megan Rapinoe, a captain of the U.S. Women's National  Soccer Team, said in a recent interview with CNN: ``It's really more  about the investment in the game. Is the investment equal? We're  talking marketing dollars and branding, investment in the youth,  investment in the players, investment in the coaching staff. I don't  think that that's there. I don't think that that's ever been there.''   It is clear that we must do more to promote and protect women in  sports. This legislation is a step towards that goal by making critical  updates to the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act.   First, the bill would require the U.S. Olympic Committee to provide  female athletes with wages, investment and working conditions equal to  their male counterparts.   Second, the bill would clarify that national governing bodies for  amateur sports must provide investment, working conditions, wages and  other compensation for amateur athletes, coaches, trainers, managers,  administrators and officials that is free from discrimination on the  basis of race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin.   Third, the bill would further clarify that national governing bodies  for amateur sports must provide equitable support and encouragement for  participation by women in sports, including investment, working  conditions, wages, and other compensation.   Finally, the bill would mandate that national governing bodies submit  regular reports to Congress on their compensation practices by race and  gender. I hope my colleagues will consider and support this  legislation.   I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Bennet, Mr.          Blumenthal, Mr. Booker, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Coons, Ms. Duckworth,          Mrs. Gillibrand, Ms. Harris, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Hirono, Mr.          King, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Markey, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Menendez, Mr.          Murphy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schatz, Ms. Smith, Mr.          Udall, Mr. Van Hollen, and Ms. Warren):   S. 2257.
