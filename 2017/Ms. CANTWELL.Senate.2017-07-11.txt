 Mr. President, I have joined my colleague in coming to  the floor to talk about how we need to make progress on healthcare and  make sure that we don't pull healthcare out from millions of Americans.  I thank the Senator from Illinois for talking about his constituents.  Like the Senator from Illinois, I was at home this past July recess  talking to my constituents, and I heard many of them talk about their  individual healthcare needs and their concerns about what is happening  in Washington.   I met a young woman who told me about her daughter who was born  prematurely and weighed less than 2 pounds. Her daughter required  specialized, expensive treatment as a newborn. She was concerned that  if we keep moving ahead with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, she  and her husband would be overwhelmed with crushing hospital debt if, in  fact, we hadn't covered preexisting conditions. She is one of millions  of Americans who are scared that they are going to lose their health  insurance under the proposal that is being talked about, that has been  talked about for the last several weeks, and from what we can tell-- because, obviously, there is a lot of secrecy--may still include  details about reducing coverage for those who have access to care  through Medicaid.   I have come to the floor tonight to talk about the latest idea  because I think one of the things that is clear--and probably why the  Senate majority leader said that he wanted, basically, to cancel the  first 2 weeks of the August recess--is that my colleagues don't want to  go home and talk about the proposal that was brought before them. In  fact, they are now trying to bring up a new proposal, thinking that,  again, with a very limited time period, without floor discussion,  without committee debate, without an amendment process, somehow our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle will fall prey to the notion  that there is a silver bullet, a magic solution. I have come to the  floor knowing that an amendment or a discussion piece or the new  behind-closed-doors discussion proposal being advanced by my colleagues  from Texas and Utah is basically to allow junk insurance into the  marketplace.   What do I mean by junk insurance? I mean a proposal that basically  offers less than the essential benefits, such as hospitalization,  prescription drug benefits, lab costs, and all of those things; that,  basically, by offering a market where you can get junk insurance, you  can say: Oh, well, you have to have one offering of insurance that does  cover all the basics and essentials, but then you can have junk  insurance.   I say ``junk insurance'' because this is the wrong idea for the  marketplace. It is basically mixing good and bad and not having  adequate risk spread across--so basically it means that you don't have  to have compliant plans for the market. I know this firsthand because  we had this in Washington. We had this same experiment in Washington in  the 1990s, and people tried to do the exact same thing--basically, have  a compliant plan, and then say that you have a bunch of less-than- adequate proposals for insurance in the market that really aren't  giving individuals coverage. What happened? It drove up the cost of the  compliant plans that covered most of healthcare and basically drove the  insurers out of the market. That was the experience in Washington  State. This same idea was tried, and it failed because basically it ran  up the price, and insurers didn't stay around to offer options. They  [[Page S3911]]  couldn't make the mandate of the required plan work because it  basically took the risk out of the system.   The notion that somehow this new idea by my colleagues is going to be  the silver bullet is, in my opinion, not an answer at all. People who  would be the ones who could get that kind of coverage for a short  period of time would then end up leaving the rest of the people without  adequate coverage. As I said, what happens is, the costs then just go  up, and then the market has to adjust. I would say that in our State-- because a lot of people are talking about leaving the individual  markets over the proposals that we are talking about today because they  are concerned about the costs and who is going to be covered--you would  see a very rapid collapse of the individual market exacerbated by what  my colleagues from Texas and Utah are proposing.   There are numerous nonpartisan health experts who seem to be saying  the same thing. There is the American Academy of Actuaries, where one  individual said:         People who are healthy now would tend to choose       noncompliant plans with really basic benefits. People who       want or need more comprehensive coverage could find it out of       their reach, because it could become unaffordable.    Another individual from the American Enterprise Institute wrote that  ``the main effect of the Cruz-Lee amendment would be to shift costs  from healthy consumers to less healthy consumers and households with  lower incomes.''   Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican and former Director of the  Congressional Budget Office called the amendment by my colleagues from  Texas and Utah ``a recipe for a meltdown.''   Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation,  summed it up best when he called the amendment ``a recipe for  instability and discrimination.''   So you can see that many people already understand the idea of junk  insurance is not a market solution at all. It is not really even  healthcare coverage. In its May 24 score of the House proposal, the CBO  provided a definition of health insurance, saying that they would  ``broadly define health insurance coverage as consisting of a  comprehensive major medical policy that, at a minimum, covers high-cost  medical events and various services, including those provided by  physicians and hospitals.''   To me it seems pretty clear that the types of plans that could be  sold under this proposal don't meet that definition.   What are essential benefits that we expect to be covered in a plan?  Obviously, hospitalization, emergency services, ambulatory services,  mental health, prescription drugs, rehabilitation, if needed,  laboratory services, like lab tests, and we have moved toward some  preventive, health, and wellness measures. Those are the essential  benefits that are supposed to be in a plan, and I want my colleagues to  know that this experiment was tried. It failed. It drove insurers out  of the marketplace because it just made the plans that were covering  essential benefits so costly by distorting--really tearing the market  apart.   The second point about the proposal we are hearing about is that it  is still a war on Medicaid. In my opinion there are cost-effective ways  for us to continue access to healthcare. I have brought them up on the  Senate floor. One would be looking at rebalancing from nursing home  care to community-based care or, as I have mentioned, a basic health  plan that bundles up a population and serves them up to get a discount  so that individuals would have as much clout as a large employer would  have in the marketplace.   I hope that my colleagues will stop the focus on capping, cutting  Medicare--because it would throw so many people off of the system--and  focus on rebalancing people to the type of healthcare that will help us  save costs, keep people in their homes, and give consumers the ability  to compete cost effectively in the individual market.   These are the problems I still see with this proposal. To think,  basically, that junk insurance will be the way for us to get a proposal  and to see that Medicaid is still the target in a war on Medicaid, to  me, is not the proposal to move forward on. I hope our colleagues will  realize that both of these have severe faults and will sit down and  talk about the proposals that will help us in establishing a more  robust individual market.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.
