 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2670) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year  2024 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for  military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of  Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   (For conference report and statement, see proceedings of the House of  December 6, 2023, at Book II, page H6213.)                           Parliamentary Inquiries     Mr. Speaker, I yield one half of my time to  the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), and ask that the gentleman  be allowed to control that time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on the conference report to accompany H.R.  2670 and that I may include tabular material on the same.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 14, 2023, on page H6948, in the second column, the  following appeared:  Madam Speaker, before I yield to my friends  and colleagues from the committee, I will respond to a charge that was  made earlier that only five members refused to sign the conference  report. There were 35 core conferees. Thirty core conferees did sign  the conference report.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Lamborn), my friend and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Strategic Forces.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), one of the  most senior members of the Armed Services Committee and a real leader  on national defense issues.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), my friend and colleague and the  chairman of the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, my friend from Florida (Mr.  Gaetz), who is a member of the Armed Service Committee, knows very well  there are hundreds of provisions in this bill that are good for our  servicemembers, in addition to the 5.2 percent pay raise, which is the  biggest in 20 years.   With regard to the individuals who had to leave the service because  of COVID, this bill provides a pathway for them to get back into the  service without a rank punishment.   There is much in this bill that he knows is good. To characterize it  as only having the pay raise as the reason to vote for it is  disappointing.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Gallagher), a real leader on the Armed Services Committee. He is the  chairman of the Cyber, Information Technologies, and Innovation  Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Strong), an outstanding freshman who is on  the Armed Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, as I listen to this debate, I  am reminded of how blessed we are with incredible staff on both the  majority and minority side who have spent months preparing this piece  of legislation. I think it is important for all of us to take a pause  and thank them for all of the hard work they have done in preparing  this bill, and, particularly, the overtime they have put in in the last  few weeks.   Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Gimenez), who is an outstanding freshman member of the House Armed  Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I want to close by reminding my colleagues who are considering voting  against this conference report of what it actually does and what they  would be on record opposing.   The fiscal year 2024 NDAA requires military promotions to be based on  merit and performance, bans the teaching of critical race theory in our  military, requires border wall materials to be turned over to our  Southwest border States, cuts and caps the pay of Pentagon DEI  bureaucracy, defends Israel with additional weapons transfers and  military training, prohibits the closure of Guantanamo Bay and transfer  of terrorists to U.S. prisons, bans the contracting with Chinese  companies, protects our military bases, defense research, and supply  chains from Chinese espionage, trains and equips Taiwan, provides a  path back to service for those discharged over the COVID-19 vaccine,  creates a new monthly pay bonus, improves housing and expands benefits  for junior enlisted servicemembers and their families, and, finally,  the NDAA provides for the largest pay raise in over 20 years.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to keep those things in mind when  they vote today.   I thank Chairman Reed and Ranking Members Smith and Wicker. It has  been great to work with them in this process. I also thank our House  and Senate staff. They are just top-notch.   I thank the leadership on both sides, as well as the tremendous  professionals of the Office of Legislative Counsel, the Congressional  Budget Office, the House Parliamentarian, and the House Clerk for all  their help.   Finally, I thank the brave men and women in uniform for their willing  service and sacrifice around the world to keep us free and safe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote in favor of the conference  report, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
