 Mr. Speaker, Lions Clubs International  is on Capitol Hill this week for their annual meetings with Members of  Congress. I am a member of my hometown  [[Page H4976]]  organization, the Howard Area Lion's Club, so I know firsthand the good  that this club does around the world.   Just a few years ago, during a Lion's Club reception at the Capitol  Visitor Center, I spoke with a Lion named Jimmy Ross. Jimmy is a past  president of Lions Club International, and he organized the Capitol  Hill visit that year. He shared an idea to create a congressional  caucus to highlight the work and the policies of nonprofit service  organizations like Lions, Rotary, Kiwanis, Optimist, and others, and I  loved the idea.   Together with Congressman   Jimmy Panetta of California, who is a  Rotarian, we founded the Congressional Service Organization Caucus in  2019. Tomorrow, the Congressional Service Organization Caucus will host  its first briefing. Speakers from Lions, Rotary, Kiwanis, and Optimist  clubs will share how their members strive to make the world a better  place one community at a time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join the Congressional Service  Organization Caucus to ensure that service to others remains a vital  part of American life for generations to come.                            ____________________
