 I am joined by Senator Van Hollen in reintroducing the  Consumer Credit Control Act, which gives consumers greater control over  when and how their consumer reports are shared by consumer reporting  agencies.   Our current consumer reporting system is backwards. Consumer  reporting agencies collect massive amounts of personal information on  consumers, often without their knowledge, in order to compile consumer  reports. These reports are then shared with financial institutions and  others, often without consent.   Following Equifax's failure in 2017 to secure troves of valuable  personally identifiable information it collected on approximately 147  million Americans, it remains clear that this system needs to change.  Indeed, the National Consumer Law Center's Chi Chi Wu stated in her  October 2017 testimony before the House Financial Services Committee  that the Equifax breach ``means half of the US population and nearly  three-quarters of the consumers with active credit reports are now at  risk of identity theft due to one of the worst--if not the worst-- breaches of consumer data in American history. These Americans are at  risk of having false new credit accounts, phony tax returns, and even  spurious medical bills incurred in their good names.'' To make matters  worse, the risks of identity fraud may only increase with time. As Ed  Mierzwinski, U.S. PIRG's federal Consumer Program Director, explains  ``unlike credit card numbers, your Social Security Number and Date of  Birth don't change and may even grow more  [[Page S2172]]  valuable over time, like gold in a bank vault. Much worse, they are the  keys to `new account identity theft.' ''   The Consumer Credit Control Act aims to address these concerns and  fix the current upside down system. Our legislation, at no cost to the  consumer, seeks to give Americans greater control over when and how  their consumer reports are released when applying for new credit, a  loan, or insurance. It also requires consumer reporting agencies to  verify a consumer's identity and secure the consumer's permission  before releasing consumer reports in instances that are particularly  susceptible to identity theft and fraud. Additionally, our legislation  requires every consumer reporting agency to take appropriate steps to  prevent unauthorized access to the consumer reports and personal  information they maintain. These changes are intended to make it  tougher for criminals to open new fraudulent credit or insurance  accounts in other people's names.   I urge our colleagues to cosponsor the Consumer Credit Control Act,  and I thank Senator Van Hollen, the National Consumer Law Center (on  behalf of its low-income clients), U.S. PIRG, Americans for Financial  Reform, the Center for Digital Democracy, Consumer Action, the Consumer  Federation of America, Consumer Reports, Demos, the NAACP, the National  Association of Consumer Advocates, the National Fair Housing Alliance,  Public Citizen, Tennessee Citizen Action, and the Woodstock Institute  for their support.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 1344. A bill to redesignate the Pullman National Monument in the  State of Illinois as the Pullman National Historical Park, and for  other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
