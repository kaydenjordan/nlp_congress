 Mr. President, we need bipartisan tax reform. We  should simplify our Tax Code. It has been filled over many years with  all sorts of junk that was put there by high-powered lobbyists, rather  than because of the public interests.   Unfortunately, this bill has nothing to do with tax reform. In fact,  it is hard to believe you could take a tax code that is already stacked  in favor of the very wealthy and the very powerful and make it even  more favorable to the very wealthy and very powerful, but that is  exactly what this Republican tax plan does.   Exhibit A about how this has nothing to do with tax reform has to do  with the carried interest loophole. Many may recall that during the  last campaign, whenever Candidate Trump talked about the need to reform  the Tax Code, what was his No. 1 example? He said: We have to get rid  of the carried interest loophole for hedge fund managers. Go back and  run the tape. Every time somebody asked him what was broken about the  Tax Code, that is what he said. In fact, he said:         The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder. They're       making a tremendous amount of money. They have to pay taxes.    That was Candidate Donald Trump.   Well, here we are. Shortly, we are going to vote on the final  Republican tax plan. And guess what. In a tax plan that is over 500  pages, nowhere do they get rid of the carried interest loophole for  hedge fund managers. Hedge fund managers are still going to get a  better tax rate than the people who work for them--a better tax rate  than their secretaries and a better tax rate than their assistants. So  in Candidate Trump's words, in this tax bill, it looks like those hedge  fund managers are still ``getting away with murder.''   That is why it is a farce to call this tax reform. It is stacking the  Tax Code more in favor of the very wealthy and the very powerful. In  fact, if you are a millionaire in America, you are going to get an  average annual tax cut of $70,000. That is great if you are a  millionaire. At the same time, millions of middle-class taxpayers are  going to pay more.  [[Page S8138]]    The folks who get the biggest windfall are big corporations. Their  tax rate will go from 35 percent to 21 percent. Who are these folks?  Well, primarily, they are the folks who are already the wealthiest  people in this country, but I bet a lot of people will be surprised to  learn that 35 percent of the stockholders in those American  corporations are foreign stockholders. Thirty-five percent of the folks  who have stock in these companies are foreigners.   In the year 2019, foreign stockholders are going to get a $48 billion  windfall from that big corporate tax cut. In that same year, 11 million  Americans will pay more taxes. So money out of the pockets of middle- class American families will go into the bank accounts of foreign  stockholders. That doesn't sound like America first to me. It doesn't  sound like middle-class taxpayers first to me.    In fact, I want my colleagues to see just how skewed this tax bill  is. I mentioned that about 11 million Americans are going to see their  taxes go up right away, but if you take the tax cut for every working- class family in every State Donald Trump won in the last election and  you add up all of their tax cuts, it is still $5 billion less than what  foreign stockholders get in the year 2019.   Think about that. These are families who make about $100,000 or less.  If you take the tax cut that every family in every State that Donald  Trump won, and you add them all up, all those tax cuts, it still comes  out to less than foreign stockholders are going to get in the year  2019.   I will tell you, when the American public finds out what is in this  tax plan, they are going to get madder and madder. I heard Speaker Ryan  say: Well, people are going to see the result, and they are going to  like it. The more they see the results, the madder they are going to  get. Here is the thing, it gets worse with time. There are some things  that do well over time; this gets worse.   When this bill fully kicks in, the tax cuts for American families  expire. They are small, relatively, to start with, then they expire,  but the tax cuts for corporations, they are big and they are forever.  You know what that means. That means those foreign stockholders are  going to have their tax cuts go on forever.   In fact, when this fully kicks in 10 years from now, those foreign  stockholders are going to get a $23 billion windfall in that year, but  average American families making $75,000 or less--$75,000 or less--on  average, are going to see their taxes go up. They will see their taxes  go up when this fully kicks in to give that windfall to foreign  stockholders.   That is a bad deal for America. It is a bad deal for the middle  class. We should say no to this tax bill. We should start over and do  real tax reform that benefits middle-class families and those working  their way into the middle class.   This is not it. Let's start over. Let's vote this down.   I yield back the remainder of my time.    Madam President, equality of opportunity is one of  our Nation's greatest pursuits and greatest struggles. Though the path  has not been easy, our society has slowly and steadily become more  just, more decent, and more powerful. President Obama's Defense  Secretary Carter reaffirmed this principle when he stated that every  qualified woman who met the high physical standards required of her  would be allowed to serve our country in combat.   Owen West soundly rejected this policy and the ethic undergirding it  in an inflammatory opinion editorial authored with his father in March  of 2016. He asserted that integrating women into infantry platoons,  including those who ``could run circles around the average Marine  grunt'' with their ``physical prowess,'' would ``swiftly reduce combat  effectiveness.'' He discounted the ability of women to contribute to  mission effectiveness, equating them only with ``intimate scandals.''  He contended that women would ``introduce sex, affection, favoritism,  protectiveness, jealously, anxiety and all the other co-ed dynamics to  an infantry platoon.''   These chauvinistic views have no place in the Department of Defense,  particularly in positions of leadership. As Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, Mr. West  will be responsible for the integration of women into our Special  Operations Forces. I appreciate that Mr. West offered a retraction of  his views on women in the military during his Senate confirmation  hearing, at the behest of Democratic members of the Armed Services  Committee, and it is my hope that Mr. West will do his utmost to  support and recruit qualified women into the military in the future.  However, many of President Trump's nominees have reneged on commitments  made during their confirmation hearings. Given Mr. West's public record  on women in combat, I cannot take that risk by supporting his  confirmation.                            ____________________
