 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2911.  [[Page S3974]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  reading of the amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, tomorrow the distinguished Senator from  Alabama, Mr. Shelby, and the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr.  Leahy, will lead us in the beginning of the Senate's appropriations  process for the year that begins this October 2018. This is also the  best opportunity we have had in a long time to do the appropriations  process properly.   For the last several years, we have finished and reported our 12  bills out of the Appropriations Committee on which about one-third of  the Senate sits. We have reported those bills to the Senate floor. We  have usually done that with bipartisan support and often unanimously.  This is no small task.   For example, in our Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee,  which I chair and which the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, is  the vice chair, this year we have had three hearings. We have received  comments from 83 Members of the Senate. We have considered their  comments. We considered our bill in a subcommittee markup, and then we  approved the bill 30 to 1 in the Appropriations Committee on May 24. We  are on pace this year, thanks to the leadership of Senator Shelby and  Senator Leahy, to take those same steps with all 12 appropriations  bills.   The Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, which has not been able to  get bipartisan agreement since fiscal year 2010, was able to reach an  agreement this year. So I thank Senator Shelby and Senator Leahy, and I  thank Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer, the Democratic and  Republican leaders, for creating an environment in which all of this is  possible.   We are saying to all Members of the Senate, we would like for the  appropriations bills to be considered by more than one-third of the  Senators. We know we have considered your thoughts in our committee  process. We have done that, and we have done that carefully, but to the  extent Senators want to, we ought to be able to consider relevant  amendments--amendments that have something to do with the bill on the  floor of the Senate.   So the key now is whether we know how to consider amendments, whether  we can remember how to consider, talk about, agree to time agreements,  and then vote on amendments; how we can occasionally show restraint and  not offer an amendment that would blow up the whole bill, keeping in  mind that our goal is to pass an appropriations bill--literally a  series of appropriations bills--that will spend more than $1 trillion  of the taxpayers' money in the year that begins October 2018.   Now, too often, once we have gotten on the Senate floor in this  shape, we have gotten ourselves into this situation: Senators blocking  other Senators' amendments--which Senators can do--but if Senators  block other Senators' amendments and the tit for tat gets going back  and forth, then no amendments are considered, and we are back in a  situation where only the 31 Senators on the Senate Appropriations  Committee have a say in the final bill. This is a chance for the other  69 Senators to be more involved by offering their amendments on the  floor.   So it is my hope that beginning tomorrow, we will return to the  practice of offering amendments that have something to do with the  bills at hand, and then we will either accept it, modify it, try to  talk a Senator out of offering it, or agree to a short period of time  to talk about an amendment and then actually vote on the amendment. If  we do that, we can finish our work in a timely way. We can restore to  the Senate its most basic process, which is its article I of the  Constitution responsibility for appropriating dollars.   Tonight I will make my opening remarks on one of the three bills we  will be considering this week, the Energy and Water Development  appropriations bill. Tomorrow, Senator Shelby and Senator Leahy will  officially kick off our appropriations process. Senator Feinstein, my  colleague on the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, with  whom I have worked for several years, will make her remarks and so will  other Senators from the other two subcommittees. Then we will begin to  vote on amendments. Our plan is to begin voting on amendments tomorrow.   We have a number of amendments already proposed that are bipartisan.  Of course, it is up to the Republican leader and the Democratic leader  how we proceed, but I have talked with them. I have talked with other  colleagues. Our hope is to have a couple of amendments to vote on just  before lunch, two more amendments to vote on right after lunch, and  other amendments to vote on tomorrow afternoon.   I would say to Senators and to staff that all of us--all six of us  Senators involved in the three subcommittees, plus Senator Shelby and  Senator Leahy--hope Senators will file their amendments tonight and  tomorrow. We want to finish the bill this week. That is what Senator  McConnell has asked us to do. That means, in order to have timely  consideration of amendments--and we could do a number during the week;  those that are not accepted, we could vote on--we need to get on with  it. We can still consider several amendments tomorrow, other than the  ones already planned. This information has been available to Senators  and staff for them to consider.   The Energy and Water appropriations bill went through the entire  process I just mentioned. That has been public, and it has been  available for anybody to read since May 24. It was approved 30 to 1-- one-third of the Senate--and 83 Senators made suggestions that we tried  to accommodate in the bill.   The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill has been  available to the full Senate since June 7. It was approved unanimously,  after going through the full committee process, by a vote of 31 to 0.   The Legislative Branch appropriations bill is the third subcommittee  bill that will be considered this week. It has been available since  June 14. It went through the entire committee process and was approved  31 to 0.   Last Saturday, all three of these bills were stitched together into  one bill. This has been available; we call it in our way of talking a  minibus--three subcommittee appropriations bills fully vetted, fully  public. It is time to deal with it.   Before I describe the Energy and Water appropriations bill in detail,  I wish to tell the Senate a story told to me by the Senator from  Colorado, Mr. Gardner, who has taken an active interest in research,  technology, and development ever since his arrival in the U.S. Senate 4  years ago.   Senator Gardner came by my office a few weeks ago, and this is what  he said to me: You know, I was flying over the Middle East, and I  looked down, and there were cars everywhere. I thought, well, Henry  Ford invented the assembly line. Then it got to be dark, and there were  lights everywhere, and I thought, well, Thomas Edison invented the  light bulb. We were flying at 30,000 feet, and I thought, the Wright  brothers invented the airplane. They are all Americans. I got to  thinking that is not all; we have invented the internet, the personal  computer, nuclear power, the polio vaccine. It is hard to think of a  major technological invention since World War II that didn't have some  support from government-sponsored research.   A few weeks ago, a friend of mine in Nashville came up to me and  lamented the fact--he said: I'm so sorry that Congress hasn't been  funding research. He understood that since World War II, it has been so  important to our country.   I told my friend: I think you have been missing what has actually  been happening, because quietly, with bipartisan support, this  Congress--which has a Republican majority and, for the last two  appropriations bills, a Republican President--has been approving record  funding for science, research, and technology. It is important that the  American people know that.  [[Page S3975]]    Since January of 2015, it is true we have had a Republican majority  in Congress, but there has been a consensus with Democratic Members of  Congress. We have worked together to provide those record levels of  funding for science, research, and technology.   Let me be specific. In the current year--fiscal year 2018--for the  third consecutive year we provided record funding levels in regular  appropriations bills for the following activities:   The Office of Science. The Office of Science provides funding for our  17 national laboratories, including the Oak Ridge National Laboratory,  which are America's secret weapon. No other country has anything like  them. Funding for the Office of Science in this fiscal year's  appropriations bill--the one we are voting on this week--would increase  funding by 6 percent.   Let's take supercomputing. Last Friday, Secretary of Energy Perry  traveled to Oak Ridge, where he announced that the United States will  regain the No. 1 position in the world in supercomputers, which we  compete for every year with China and Japan. This is the result not of  1 year of funding, but of 10 years of bipartisan effort through three  different administrations--Democratic and Republican--to try to make  sure that America is first in supercomputing in the world. We continue  to do that in the appropriations bill we are considering this week.   Or take an agency we call ARPA-E. ARPA-E is a cousin of DARPA which  is an agency that was created in the Department of Defense some time  ago, out of which came a variety of wondrous new technologies--from  stealth to the internet, for example. So 10 years ago, Congress decided  ``Why not try the same thing in energy?'' and created what we call  ARPA-E to invest in high-impact energy technologies and then quickly  get those technologies added to the private sector.    That is just our subcommittee. In other subcommittees--the Commerce,  Justice, Science Committee, chaired by Senator Moran and Senator  Shaheen, the fiscal year 2018 bill increased funding for the National  Science Foundation by $200 million. The fiscal year 2019 bill, approved  by the Senate Appropriation Committee last week, proposes to increase  funding another $300 million. The National Science Foundation makes  about 11,000 grants to universities and other institutions around the  country--$8 billion next year--as a part of our effort to stay first in  research, science, and technology.   Then there is one more example. In fiscal year 2018, for the third  straight year, the Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee,  chaired by Senator Blunt and Senator Murray, has provided increased  funding for the National Institutes of Health and biomedical research-- 2 billion additional dollars in the first year, 2 billion the second  year, and 2 billion the third year, which is in addition to 21st  Century Cures Act funding to focus on the Precision Medicine  Initiative, the Cancer Moonshot, among other things. Senator Blunt has  said that is a 23-percent increase over three years.   So I would say to my friend in Nashville--and to others who may not  have noticed this quiet development--that this Republican Congress and  the Democratic Members of Congress, as well, understand that a  principal reason why this country produces 24 percent of all the money  in the world for just 5 percent of the people--the principal reason for  this extraordinary concentration of brain power in the United States  has been support by Federal dollars through our National Laboratories,  the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and  other agencies.   Let me make one other statement right upfront. That funding is not  the cause of the Federal deficit. Funding for the National  Laboratories, national defense, national parks, and the National  Institutes of Health is all part of the 30 percent of the Federal  budget we call discretionary spending. That is what we are talking  about this week. That is the money Congress appropriates every year-- more than $1 trillion.   Over the last 10 years, this part of the Federal budget--the 30  percent that is the discretionary funding--has gone up at a little bit  less than the rate of inflation, according to the Congressional Budget  Office, and the Congressional Budget Office projects that over the next  10 years, this part of the budget will rise at a little bit more than  the rate of inflation.   So record funding for the National Institutes of Health or the  National Science Foundation or ARPA-E or to keep our position in  supercomputing--or, for that matter, national defense--is not the  source of the Federal deficit. What has happened is that the Congress-- Democrats and Republicans alike--have placed a priority on science,  technology, and research and, within the budget limits established, we  have given that excellent funding--record funding. The source of the  Federal budget deficit is mandatory spending, which amounts to more  than 63 percent of the budget.   Now to the Energy and Water appropriations bill. This legislation  provides a total of $43.8 billion, $566 million above what Congress  provided last fiscal year--the year we are in now--and $7.24 billion  above the President's budget request. Funding in this bill supports  several agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the Corps of  Engineers, the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the regional  commissions, including the Appalachian Regional Commission and the  Delta Regional Authority.   I am pleased that the bill provides the fourth year of record funding  for our 17 national laboratories and increases funding for  supercomputers so that we can stay first in the world. The U.S.  Department of Energy's Office of Science, which supports basic science  and energy research and is the Nation's largest supporter of research  in the physical sciences, is funded at $6.65 billion, a new record  funding level.   The Advanced Research Projects Agency--we call it ARPA-E--is funded  at $375 million, record funding in a regular appropriations bill. As I  said, it was created in 2007 by the America COMPETES Act, a bipartisan  effort to invest in high-impact energy technologies.   The bill provides a total of $1.68 billion for high-performance  computing, including $980 million within the Office of Science, and  $703 million within the National Nuclear Security Administration. This  amount includes $677 million to deliver at least one exascale machine  in 2021, the supercomputer that will reassert U.S. leadership in this  critical area--the one Secretary Perry announced last week.   The bill also advances efforts to clean up hazardous materials at  Cold War-era sites. The bill provides $7.2 billion to support cleanup  efforts, which is $581 million above the President's budget request.   This bill also includes provisions regarding the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers. The Corps of Engineers touches the lives of almost every  American. Based upon the number of appropriations requests we have  received from my colleagues in the Senate, the Corps of Engineers is  the Federal Government's most popular agency. I can remember a hearing  of one of our committees shortly after the Missouri and Mississippi  rivers flooded a few years ago, and 18 different Senators showed up to  suggest that we needed more money for the Army Corps of Engineers.   The Corps maintains our inland waterways. It deepens and keeps our  ports open. It looks after many of our recreational waters and lands.  It manages the river levels to prevent flooding and its dams provide  emission-free renewable hydroelectric energy.   The bill restores $2.142 billion that was cut from the President's  budget request, bringing the Corps budget up to $6.9 billion, a new  record funding level under regular appropriations bills. For the fifth  consecutive year, the bill makes full use of the Inland Waterway Trust  Fund revenues for water infrastructure projects. In other words, when  we take tax money from the barges that use the waterways, we spend that  tax money to improve the waterways rather than put it in some account  somewhere.   The bill also provides funding that exceeds the Harbor Maintenance  Trust Fund spending target established by the Water Resources Reform  and Development Act of 2014. This is the fifth consecutive year the  bill has met or exceeded the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund spending  target, which is necessary to adequately fund our Nation's  [[Page S3976]]  harbors, including Mobile Harbor in Alabama, Savannah Harbor in  Georgia, Long Beach Harbor in California, and many others across the  country.   We hear a lot of talk about infrastructure and the need to do  something about it. Well, this bill does something about it for 5  straight years. We are spending all the money we have collected--and,  in fact, we raised the revenues a couple of years ago--for the last few  years at record levels to improve our inland waterways and deepen our  ports.   A key pillar of our national defense is a strong nuclear deterrent.  That has been in the news these last few weeks because of the  President's discussions with the leader of North Korea. The bill  includes a total of $14 billion for the National Nuclear Security  Administration, including $1.9 billion for six life extension programs,  which fix or replace components and weapons systems to make sure they  are safe and reliable. Congress must maintain a safe and effective  nuclear weapons stockpile and keep big construction projects on time  and on budget. This bill achieves those goals. Nuclear power is our  best source of inexpensive, carbon-free baseload power. It is important  for our national security competitiveness. Nuclear power provides 20  percent of our Nation's electricity, more than half of our carbon-free  electricity.    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees our 99 nuclear  power reactors, is also funded in this bill. We included funding to  ensure that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is prepared to review  applications for new reactors, particularly small modular reactors and  advanced reactors, and to extend the licenses of our existing reactors  if it is safe to do so.   The bill also provides $47 million for research and development at  the Department of Energy to support existing nuclear reactors, $30  million for the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water  Reactors, and $30 million for the transformational challenge reactor.   The legislation again includes a pilot program to allow consolidated  nuclear waste storage that I have worked on with Senator Feinstein for  the last 6 years. This has been a special priority of the Senator from  California, as it is of mine. Funding is also included for the  Department of Energy to take the first steps toward being able to store  nuclear waste at private facilities.   Tomorrow, Senator Shelby and Senator Leahy will formally begin the  process of the appropriations of the Senate for the year that begins  October 1. As I said at the beginning, this is our opportunity to do it  right--something we haven't done in a long time.   We have done our work in committee. We have gotten our bills through.  We had our hearings. We considered everybody's ideas. But that is just  31 of us. What about the other 69 Senators? They might like to have  more of a say when the bill reaches the floor.   What we are asking tonight is that Senators and staff read the bills.  We don't have 2, 3, 4, or 5 days to sit around and read the bills.  Senator McConnell would like for us to be through with this bill this  week.   We have 12 appropriations bills to consider. We ought to be able to  do that in 2 or 3 days. If we read the bills and decide which  amendments haven't already been considered and file the amendments  tonight, tomorrow we can ask consent for a time agreement of, say, 20  minutes and give each side 10 minutes to speak, and then we can  actually vote on the amendments. That is what we are supposed to do.   Sometimes the U.S. Senate has been like joining the Grand Ole Opry  and not being allowed to sing. It is rare that we have an amendment.  The appropriations process is a chance to do that. I hope we will have  a chance to do that.   I wish to make one other plea to my fellow Senators. The Senate has  enormous power. Each Senator is equal. As a result, when the majority  leader gets up and says we are going to start tomorrow with a prayer  and this bill, and then we are going to move to something else, he  says, if you listen carefully: I ask unanimous consent that we open  tomorrow at 9:30. I ask unanimous consent that we move to this bill.   He gets that. He gets that because Senators recognize that although  any one of us could have stopped that by objecting, we demonstrate some  restraint. Just because you have the freedom to do something doesn't  mean you should always try to do it. We learned that in kindergarten.  We are well past that level now; we are in U.S. Senate.   I am hopeful that we can begin tomorrow with our speeches from at  least eight of our Senators who have been working on this bill,  including our leaders. I am hopeful that we will have a couple of  amendments to vote on before lunch--bipartisan amendments--maybe a  couple more after lunch, and maybe two or three more in the late  afternoon. That is up to the Democratic leader and the Republican  leader to finally decide, but I think the chances are good.   I will ask all Senators and staffs who are paying attention tonight,  please read these three bills. If you have amendments that need to be  considered that are relevant to the bill, please file them tonight or  first thing in the morning. Talk with our staff, and let's see if we  can accept them, modify them, and, if necessary, vote on them. Let's  try to get that done this week and show ourselves and the world that  the U.S. Senate is still capable of a complete appropriations process.  After all, that is our most basic responsibility.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the purpose of rule  XVI in relation to the substitute amendment No. 2910, division A of  H.R. 5895 serve as the basis for defense of germaneness for division A  of the amendment, division B of H.R. 5895 serve as the basis for  defense of germaneness for division B of the amendment, and that  division C of H.R. 5895 serve as the basis for defense of germaneness  for division C of the amendment.    I see the Senator from Hawaii. I don't know whether he  has any remarks to make.   I see the Senator from Oklahoma.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.
