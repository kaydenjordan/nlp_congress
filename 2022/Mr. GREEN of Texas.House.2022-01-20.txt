 Mr. Speaker, by way of further introduction, I am  the same Al Green who lives across the street from the DeBakey VA  hospital; the same Al Green who fought in this Congress to secure a  Congressional Gold Medal for Dr. Michael E. DeBakey; the same Al Green  who has 800 flags outside of his office presently to be distributed  over at the DeBakey VA hospital; the same Al Green that goes there  annually and speaks to veterans, who talks to them about their needs on  an annual basis; the same Al Green who has had veterans who tell me the  difficulties associated with enrollment; the same Al Green who has  veterans who say they are so pleased that somebody would come by to be  of service to them.   Mr. Speaker, this Al Green announces here and now that I will support  the underlying bill. I support it because it is necessary. I support it  because I believe the veterans that I have spoken to will support it.  They need it, and they will enjoy knowing that we came to this floor to  bring this to fruition.   Mr. Speaker, finally, if the VA hospital is not properly funded and  this creates some funding issues, I am prepared to vote to fund the VA  hospital sufficiently so that our veterans can be taken care of. Anyone  who is willing to go to a distant place, who may not return the same  way they left, who may have issues for the rest of their lives, and  they do it because they want to protect this country, I am going to do  all that I can to protect them. This is the least a grateful Nation can  do.
