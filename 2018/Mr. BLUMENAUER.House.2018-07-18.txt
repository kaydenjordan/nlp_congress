 Mr. Speaker, this resolution encapsulates what is  wrong with the Republican management of this Congress. It is a cartoon  that doesn't deal with the underlying issues. They conjure up an  imaginary carbon tax when there are real proposals to price carbon  before committees in Congress now.   Instead of engaging in fantasy, we could have a debate about real  legislation that would satisfy their answers and be able to deal with  what our responsibilities are in the future.   What we are talking about today encapsulates the failure of  Republican leadership in this Congress. They can't deal with  immigration. They can't deal meaningfully with climate change and  carbon pollution. Instead, we are dealing with empty gestures.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly suggest we reject this rule and get down to  business.
