 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I am able to  speak and followed by Senator Cortez Masto to be able to speak before  the Senate adjourns for the weekly caucus lunches.    Mr. President, today we took another giant step on  something that has been a lot harder than it should have been and could  have been because it actually started last June when I rose before this  body--June of 2021--to speak about the critical need to pass the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act, as it was known back then, USICA, in  order to shore up U.S. investment in research and development and  manufacturing of critical technologies.   On this bill--a few name changes later, and, unfortunately, more than  a year later--I rise again before this body to express my strong  support for this revised CHIPS+ legislation--that we just cleared an  important hurdle for over the last hour--and urge my colleagues to pass  this bill as quickly as possible so we can get it out of the Senate,  get it over to the House, and get it to the President's desk.   We cannot afford to waste any more time because this funding sends a  message that the United States is putting a strong down payment on  maintaining our edge in the global technology race and preventing  global supply chains from being weaponized against the United States  or, for that matter, against our allies.   Over the past few years, China has continued to increase investments  in its domestic industries and, particularly, in areas that confer  long-term strategic influence. This includes the semiconductor  industry, which I have been particularly focused on over the past few  years.   Now, let me be clear. When I talk about China--let me be clear--my  beef is with the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, and their  approach. It is not with the Chinese people; it is not with the Chinese  diaspora. As a matter of fact, when people don't make that distinction,  you may play exactly into the CCP's agenda that somehow these are all  simply anti-Chinese activists. These are not. These are activities  against the Government of China and, particularly, the Communist Party  of China.   Coming back to semiconductors: Semiconductors, often called chips,  are the backbone of our modern lives. They can be found in literally  everything with an on-and-off switch: from cars and trucks to washers  and dryers to smartphones and laptops. Chips are an essential component  in so many of the devices we use today.   The growth in chips is going to be exponential. Many have fought and  talked about the whole notion of the internet of things. The internet  of things require devices that are connected to the internet.  Obviously, autonomous driving would be one example. For every  connection, there needs to be a center, most of those requiring a  semiconductor chip.   Unfortunately, looking backwards, for many years, American  semiconductor companies led the world in both design and manufacturing  of this critical technology. But the truth is, our leadership has  languished. In recent years, we continue to lose ground, particularly  not just to China but to East Asian markets in total.   As a country, we have gone--from 1990, when we produced literally 37  percent of all the chips in the world, to today--in the whole field of  microelectronics, we are down to about 12 percent.   On the other hand, China has ramped up its investment in chips,  providing an estimated $200 billion in financial support between just  2015 and going forward projection up to 2025. Chinese orders for  semiconductor manufacturing equipment rose 58 percent in 2021 in the  midst of the COVID crisis. China has a goal to produce at least 70  percent of its use of semiconductors in the country by 2030.   The truth is, it is not just China. This is global competition. Japan  recently passed a $6.8 billion investment package that will fund  innovative chip manufacturing, as well as research and development.  South Korea, which has also been one of the great leaders in this  movement for it, has similar-type investments.   Unfortunately, one of the challenges we face is the country or the  entity that has evolved some of the fastest has been Taiwan, where,  unfortunately, we now rely on many of the most cutting-edge, leading- edge chips coming out of the Taiwan.   As we have seen with President Xi's aggressive--at least indications,  about trying to subjugate Taiwan--when we think of it in the context of  the Russian-Ukraine battle, the notion that could take place beyond  what it would do to the democracy that exists in Taiwan, what it would  do in terms of that critical semiconductor production--it would cause  not only a recession but depression around the world.   It is not just South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. India has recently  passed legislation investing $30 billion in their domestic electronics  manufacturing industry, with $10 billion of that dedicated to chips  manufacturing and display manufacturing.    The truth is--and this is one of the things I think was the great  irony--is that when I spoke about this bill 13 months ago, then,  obviously, the Senate, with the leadership of the Presiding Officer and  others, we actually passed this bill back in July of last year. Our  passage of that bill and raising the expectation that America was going  to really get in the game, set off alarm bells, not only in terms of  what is coming out of Asia but from some of our allies in Europe.   The truth is, European bureaucrats, particularly coming out of  Brussels, are not normally viewed as moving with a great deal of speed.  But because we have taken now 12 months to actually get our act  together and get this bill to this stage of passage, we have seen  European countries--Germany, for example, has already selected 32  semiconductor projects and put $12 billion in draft investments. And  even our friends in France recently announced a major U.S. global  foundry investment in France.   This has proven out--the lack of investment by the U.S. has had a  huge impact. From 2010 to 2020, only 17 major semiconductor plants-- they call them fabs, manufacturing fabs--were built in the United  States. Over that same time, we have seen 122 built elsewhere around  the world. And the handful of major projects announced in the last year  as a direct result of our efforts a year ago to say we are going to put  our money where our mouth is in terms of these kind of investments-- major facilities in Ohio, Arizona, and elsewhere, candidly, are very  much at risk at this point, unless we can get this legislation to the  President's desk.   Right now, the truth is: The cost of new fabs is 25 percent to 50  percent higher in the United States; and that is partially due to the  enormous financial incentives offered by our competitive ventures.   The truth is, in a perfect world, we wouldn't want governments  subsidizing some of these investments. We don't live in a perfect  world. We live in a real world where competitors like China and even  our allies around the world are making investments, candidly, that on a  per capita basis even make this investment by the United States seem  relatively small.   Many ask, so why is it so important for the United States to maintain  investment in semiconductor production when on a lot of accounts, the  PRC--China--is several generations behind? Because the truth is, U.S.  semiconductor firms--and firms in the adjacent areas of lithography,  packaging, and metrology--still lead the world.   I can tell you, as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I can tell  you unequivocally that the Communist Party of China and the PRC is  acutely aware of that gap and aggressively are working, not just to  close it, but to eventually leapfrog the United States and our allies  to lead in chip production.   As a matter of fact, just over this past week, there was an  extraordinary story coming out of Bloomberg that indicated that the  Chinese may have already moved dramatically forward in terms of 7- nanometer production. For those aware, if that is true, that could have  a huge, huge effect. We should expect that because last year, President  Xi announced a $1.4 trillion commitment through 2025 to develop  advanced  [[Page S3669]]  technologies, not only in chips, but in next-generation wireless  networks and artificial intelligence--technologies that will candidly  determine who is not only the economic but the security winner of the  21st century.   I firmly believe that this is the time of technology competition  across the series of domains, and China has a plan they articulated in  their China 2025 document. We, in this country, are still trying to  determine what are those domains.   The truth is, semiconductors--which enable advancements in artificial  intelligence or high-performance computing, hypersonics, and everything  else, again, with an on-off switch--is arguably the centerpiece of  President Xi's effort to ultimately control innovation system  development.   Meanwhile, many of the key ingredients to U.S. historical success,  including Federal support for R&D, investment in basic research and  support for advanced manufacturing, have declined over the last 20  years. Why? I am focusing on chips and the 5G and beyond. Here, there  is a whole series of components in this legislation we have advanced  today that includes beefing up R&D, advanced manufacturing, and other  critical areas.   It brings me down to my closing comments before I turn it over to the  Senator from Nevada. That is why the $52 billion in funding for CHIPS  for America Act--a bipartisan effort my friend, Senator Cornyn and I,  along with Senator Schumer and Senator Cotton--we have been working on  this, literally, for years, way beyond the 13 months, when I rose on  this topic 13 months ago--is so important and why a parallel effort  also in this bill to catalyze U.S. and allied innovation in a more  diverse and resilient telecommunications ecosystem is so virtually  important.   I would also note this simply isn't an economic competitiveness or  security issue. We know, as we see it play out right now in terms of  supply chains--vis-a-vis Russia and Ukraine, the notion of cutting off  advanced semiconductors to Russia will have a huge effect on Russia's  military capacity. We also know, as well, this will be a jobs bill in  terms of these fabrication facilities and research all across America.  And, candidly, as we know, there are literally thousands of cars that  already have been produced by American auto manufacturers that are  sitting, not getting into the market because they don't have the chips  to make the cars actually operate. Over the long haul, bringing that  supply chain back here will ultimately deal with inflation issues, as  well.   We cannot be held hostage on this critical issue. Most of the focus  has been on chips, as appropriate. But this bill also makes important  investments in the future of wireless telecommunications. In many ways,  this issue first came to the forefront, not on chips, but a few years  back--I say this as a former wireless telecom guy--when a Chinese  company, Huawei, suddenly started to dominate the market. We raised  concerns about Huawei. Many of our allies and others said: That is  fine; what is your alternative? What is the Western alternative?   I think we were a little bit slow on making the case; although, now,  virtually every nation that invested in Huawei equipment has realized  national security concerns that are literally in the process of ripping  and replacing that equipment.   We have still got more to do. Huawei penetrated some of our markets  in the United States. So this bill that has been called CHIPS also  includes funding for the bipartisan Utilizing Strategic Allied  Telecommunications Act, or the USA Act, which fosters U.S. innovation  in the race for 5G by providing $1.5 billion to invest in Western- backed alternatives to, again, Chinese equipment providers, like Huawei  but also ZTE.   This is a bill that, again, I was proud to work on with many of my  Intel colleagues, Senator Burr and Senator Rubio. It will also stand up  a new Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund to spur movements  toward open-architecture software. That would allow us to fund  innovative, ``leap ahead'' technologies in the domestic mobile  broadband market.   That approach plays to U.S. strengths, like software and network  virtualization, and it means that we will have a wider set of firms,  including American, with healthier balance sheets competing against  these state-sponsored Chinese vendors, because one thing that has been  clear over the past two administrations, our anti-Huawei message, or  the things that finally moved, would have moved a lot quicker if we had  had other U.S. and Western alternatives.   Again, I will close now. As the chairman of the Senate Intelligence  Committee, I see examples every day of how China is doubling down on  its pursuit of advanced technologies that I think will define the 21st  century, and in many ways, the United States has started to fall  behind.   Fortunately, it is not too late to change that narrative or to change  that result. With the right investments, like the ones that have been  provided in this legislation, we can unleash the ingenuity of the  American people. We can reinvigorate American innovation and improve  our national security while setting the country up to lead the way on  technologies that will define our future.   We need to get this passed as quickly as possible, and then I  strongly, strongly urge our colleagues in the House to pass it as well  and get it to the President's desk.   With that, I yield the floor.   I do want to thank my colleague from Nevada, who has been a leader on  this legislation, as well, and knows the importance of getting this  done.
