 Madam Speaker, we are here today for Soon Chung Park,  Suncha Kim, Yong Ae Yue, Hyun Jung Grant, Xiaojie Tan, Daoyou Feng,  Amarjeet Kaur Johal, Jasvinder Kaur, Jaswinder Singh, Amarjit Sekhon,  and too many others.   This bill is an important step to address and prevent hate crimes as  we deal with the root causes of hate and violence. That means providing  basic economic security, including housing, social services, education,  and healthcare.   A ``yes'' vote says that we won't stand by as our children are  bullied on playgrounds and our elders are beaten in the streets.   A ``yes'' vote says to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders-- Chinese, Korean, Indian, Vietnamese, Thai, Pakistani, Japanese,  Filipino, Native Hawaiian, Laotian, Hmong, Cambodian, Burmese,  Bangladeshi, Bhutanese, Indonesian, Tibetan, Sri Lankan, Tongan,  Malaysian, Mongolian, Taiwanese, Fijian, Singaporean, Chamorro,  Nepalese, Samoan, Bruneian, Afghani, Micronesian, and Marshallese--that  we are visible and that we matter.   We, too, are America.
