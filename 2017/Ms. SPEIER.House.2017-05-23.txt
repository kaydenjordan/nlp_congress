 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Four years ago, I stood on the House floor and condemned the online  bullying of U.S. Marine Corps servicewomen on Facebook. These web pages  contained obscene and abusive pictures, and implied that women only  advanced professionally by performing sexual favors.   I sent a letter to the Secretary of Defense and the Commandant of the  Marine Corps asking them to take action. I got a letter back from the  Commandant which said, ``I share your indignation.'' I didn't want him  to share my indignation. I wanted him to do something about it. Neither  he nor the Department of Defense inspector general did anything.   Lack of consequences caused this cultural rot to spread further. The  Marines United page, through which hundreds of Active-Duty and veteran  marines viewed thousands of nonconsensually distributed intimate  imagines, damaged the lives and the careers of more servicemembers than  I can imagine. In fact, many of these servicemembers were identified by  name and the bases at which they served.   Despite reports of this vile site, new versions continue to crop up  and spread more destruction, unchecked by military leadership. Until  now, the leadership failures that allowed this to go on for 4 years  also extended to Congress. We did nothing except hold a subcommittee  hearing on--wait, let me indicate what it was on--social media policy,  without a single survivor brought to testify.   This is not about social media policy. This is about abhorrent  behavior by servicemembers against other servicemembers.   Two months ago, a bipartisan group of Members held a hearing on this  very issue, and we had victims who testified. One of those members, who  was Active Duty, said that her Marine Corps drill instructor said to  her and the other women during their training, ``The only women that  serve in the marines are sluts, lesbians . . . '' or a word that starts  with a B that I won't mention on the House floor.    How destructive can that be?   Today, that ends. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle are taking  a stand. Today, I am honored and proud to support H.R. 2052 with my  colleague, Ms. McSally.   This bill will ensure that nonconsensual pornography is made illegal  by explicitly forbidding the sharing of intimate images without the  consent of the subject.   Right now, the reprehensible acts of nonconsensually distributed and  consensually obtained photographs is not clearly defined as illegal  under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. That is why this bill is a  critical step in ensuring that our female servicemembers aren't  distracted from protecting the country by having to also protect  themselves against online abusers and colleagues within the services.   But let me be clear. Our work is not done. If the chain of command  continues to see nonconsensual pornography as a ``boys will be boys''  joke instead of sexual violence, nothing will change. Such conduct must  result in severe and immediate consequences for the perpetrators. The  PRIVATE Act must pass, and it must be enforced.   I also want to note that the passage of the PRIVATE Act does not  apply to the civilian people in our country. Although 34 States have  passed laws to address nonconsensual pornography, their approaches vary  widely, and some are very flawed. That is why a Federal law is needed  to provide a single, clear articulation of the elements of this crime  to ensure that Americans in every part of the country--civilian and  military--are protected if they are subjected to this heinous abuse.  [[Page H4479]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2052. We have come  a long way in 4 years since I found those vile Facebook pages. Four  years from now, I hope I am standing here commending us all for  stamping out the scourge of nonconsensual pornography.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Guam (Ms. Bordallo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel), my good friend and colleague, and the co-chair  of the bipartisan Women's Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), the chair of the Bipartisan Task Force to  End Sexual Violence.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from  California (Mrs. Davis), the ranking member on the Democratic side of  the Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and, in so doing, I  also want to make the point that our commitment to making sure that our  armed services have the cohesion and readiness to serve requires us to  take action on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
