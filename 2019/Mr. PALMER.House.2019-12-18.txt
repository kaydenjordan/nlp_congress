 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the impeachment of  President Trump.   Today is a day that diminishes the reputation and stature of the  United States House of Representatives, a day I never dreamed I would  see.   Today, my Democratic colleagues seek to overturn an election by  forcing a vote that will forever be a stain on this Congress. They are  not just voting to impeach President Trump; my colleagues are voting to  impeach the judgment of every person who voted for him and the process  by which we elect a President and by which we will govern our Nation.   My Democratic colleagues claim the Russians influenced the outcome of  the 2016 election, but based on their corrupt impeachment proceedings,  it appears my colleagues have been influenced by how Russia conducts  political trials: no real evidence, no real crime, no due process, and  no justice.   The Democrats have failed to show any legitimate justification for  the impeachment of President Trump. When they could not find real  evidence, they made it up and called it a parity.   They conducted most of the hearings in secret.   They instructed witnesses not to answer Republican Members'  questions, and they denied Republicans the right to call witnesses,  making it absolutely clear their objective was, from the beginning,  pathetically political.   We all understand that elections have consequences.   To all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, this day  will surely have consequences, as well, as we descend into more  disrespect, distrust, and even contempt that will eventually be  destructive of this Chamber and, I fear, eventually, our Republic.   I urge all Members to vote ``no'' on impeachment.
