 Mr. President, I rise to speak up for those who serve  our country all around the world, courageously, selflessly, with great  sacrifice. I rise on behalf of our diplomatic corps, our Foreign  Service Officers, civil servants, and State Department personnel. I  rise on behalf of patriotic Americans serving our country on the front  lines of war zones and devastating conflicts, in countries with  oppressive governments and societies hostile to our own.   Our national security is stronger because of them. American people  are safer because of them. Our children's futures will be more secure,  more prosperous, because of them. And because  [[Page S6602]]  of them and their hard work and sacrifice, our grandchildren may know a  world with less pain, less strife, less conflict. And yet they have  come under attack, simply for serving their country.   This week, three State Department witnesses are testifying during the  House of Representatives' impeachment hearings on the Trump-Ukraine  scandal. These individuals have, in many cases, spent their entire  careers serving our Nation with distinction, on behalf of both  Republican and Democratic administrations. Some have even worn the  uniform of the U.S. Armed Forces.   These men and women are not partisans. They are patriots, patriots  who put our country first. And for putting country first, for being  willing to tell the truth, they have come under attack--not by a  foreign regime bristling at their efforts to promote democracy, not by  oligarchs and criminals who fear their effectiveness--though that has  happened as well.   No. They have come under attack in our own country, by our own  President, by the head of our government that they so bravely and  selflessly serve. It pains me, and so I am standing before you today to  speak up on their behalf, on behalf of each voice that has come forward  in this time of need and tumult for our country. This is a time when we  need truth--truth above party, truth above political loyalties and  expediency, truth above self-interest. These diplomats, these  professionals, these proud public servants are putting the country  before themselves--if only this President could do the same, if only  he--just once--could put the interests of others ahead of his own.   But frankly, I am not the one who should be standing up on behalf of  our diplomatic corps, nor should it be only the Democrats on the  Foreign Relations Committee. There is a job post that actually entails  standing up for the men and women of our State Department each and  every day. The job is called Secretary of State. It is a job held by  Secretary Mike Pompeo. Yet under Secretary Pompeo's watch, the  dedicated Americans who serve in the State Department have been thrown  to the wolves.   Our Secretary of State should be the No. 1 defender of our diplomatic  corps. He should come forward and tell the American people what he saw,  what he heard, and what he did about it. He should defend the officials  who serve in his own Department. And he could start by uttering just  one word of support for Ambassador Taylor, Deputy Assistant Secretary  Kent, and Ambassador Yovanovitch. But he has had plenty of time for  that. We have seen very clearly where he stands.   So instead, I, along with my Democratic colleagues on the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee, are calling on other senior officials at  the State Department to step up and do the right thing. This week, we  sent a letter to the Deputy Secretary of State, John Sullivan, and the  Undersecretary for Management, Brian Bulatao, calling on them to do  what Pompeo has not: to publicly support the brave officials who are  putting their careers, their reputations, and terribly, even their  personal finances on the line--all to serve their country. I hope that  they do, even in the face of vicious and unfounded attacks unleashed by  the President, his allies, and those who refuse to stand up for the  truth.   Some have been called ``disloyal,'' ``unpatriotic,'' and ``Never  Trumpers.'' In fact, yesterday morning, as State officials were about  to begin testifying, the President tweeted, in all caps, ``NEVER  TRUMPERS!'' These false attacks misunderstand the entire premise of  public service. To be a career public servant means to work every day  on behalf of the public, our government, our country, our Constitution,  to check politics at the door. To argue otherwise demonstrates this  President's warped view of how our government works. Our career Federal  employees do not serve him. They serve our country. They serve the  American people.   The only ``loyalty'' they pledge is loyalty to the oath they take to  uphold our Constitution. In coming forward, in speaking the truth, in  raising concerns about events that trouble them as guardians of our  national security, they are carrying out an act of selfless patriotism  and love of country that that this President is incapable of  understanding, let alone doing himself.   I hope that some of our other senior officials will step forward and  show just a sliver of the backbone that these individuals have shown. I  hope they will do the right thing. I hope they will issue statements of  public support for officials courageously coming before Congress and  commit to protecting them from retribution or reprisal.   Our State Department employees deserve commendation, not retaliation.  They deserve our thanks, not our scorn. Above all else, they deserve  leaders who will defend them, not desert them when it matters most.                            ____________________
