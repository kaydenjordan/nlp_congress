 The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Tennessee (Mrs.  Blackburn), the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), the Senator from  Kansas (Mr. Moran), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), the Senator  from Nebraska (Mr. Sasse), and the Senator from North Carolina (Mr.  Tillis).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from Florida (Mr.  Rubio) would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, on Saturday the President announced his  nominee to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by Justice Ginsburg.  As the Nation mourns the death of this trailblazing Justice, it is  fitting that the President chose an outstanding woman to replace her.   I had the pleasure of sitting down with Judge Amy Coney Barrett  yesterday, and I can say with confidence that she is everything you  would want in a Supreme Court Justice.   She is supremely qualified. Like Justice Ginsburg, Judge Barrett was  first in her class in law school--in this case, at Notre Dame. She was  a clerk for DC Circuit Judge Laurence H. Silberman and then for Supreme  Court Justice Antonin Scalia.   She worked at a prestigious law firm and served as a visiting  professor at the George Washington University Law School before  accepting a position at the University of Notre Dame Law School, where  she went on to teach for 15 years.   During her time at Notre Dame, Judge Barrett built a distinguished  record. She was published repeatedly in prominent law journals and was  chosen by Chief Justice John Roberts to serve on the Advisory Committee  for the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. She was elected  Distinguished Professor of the Year by the law school's graduating  class three times.   She also served as a visiting associate professor at another  prominent law school, the University of Virginia School of Law.   In 2017, she moved to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh  Circuit, winning Senate confirmation in a bipartisan vote. During her  confirmation to the Seventh Circuit, support for Judge Barrett poured  forth from her students, colleagues, and peers from both side of the  aisle.   Every one of the Supreme Court clerks who had served with Judge  Barrett during her clerkship with Justice Scalia wrote a letter to the  then-chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee expressing  their support for her confirmation. This included Justice Ginsburg's  clerks and other clerks from the liberal wing of the Court.   Here is what they had to say:         We are Democrats, Republicans, and independents, and we       have diverse points of view on politics, judicial philosophy,       and much else. Yet we all write to support the nomination of       Professor Barrett to be a Circuit Judge on the United States       Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Professor Barrett       is a woman of remarkable intellect and character. She is       eminently qualified for the job.    Judge Barrett's colleagues from Notre Dame sent a similar letter.  They said:         Amy Coney Barrett will be an exceptional federal judge. . .       . As a scholarly community, we have a wide range of political       views, as well as commitments to different approaches to       judicial methodology and judicial craft. We are united,       however, in our judgment about Amy. She is a brilliant       teacher and scholar, and a warm and generous colleague. She       possess in abundance all of the other qualities that shape       extraordinary jurists: discipline, intellect, wisdom,       impeccable temperament, and above all, fundamental decency       and humanity.    That letter was signed by every full-time member of the Notre Dame  Law School faculty--every full-time member.   Four hundred seventy Notre Dame Law graduates, former students of  Judge Barrett, sent a letter as well. Here is what they said:         Our backgrounds and life experiences are varied and       diverse. Our legal practices are as varied as the profession       itself. . . . Our religious, cultural, and political views       span a wide spectrum. Despite the many and genuine       differences among us, we are united in our conviction that       Professor Barrett would make an exceptional federal judge.    They went on:         We are convinced that Professor Barrett would bring to the       federal bench the same intelligence, fairness, decency,       generosity, and hard work she has demonstrated at Notre Dame       Law School. She will treat each litigant with respect and       care, conscious of the reality that judicial decisions       greatly affect the lives of those before the court. And she       will apply the law faithfully and impartially.    I could go on for a while here. There are a lot of tributes to Amy  Coney Barrett out there, like the one in support of her circuit court  nomination that was joined by former Obama Solicitor General Neal  Katyal, which praised her ``first-rate'' qualifications and stated that  she was ``exceptionally well qualified'' or the recent tribute from  Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, one of the House Democrats' star  impeachment witnesses, who stated: ``Barrett is highly qualified to  serve on the Supreme Court.'' But I will stop here because I think it  is abundantly obvious to everyone--my colleagues across the aisle  included--that Judge Barrett is supremely qualified to be a Supreme  Court Justice, which is why Democrats have resorted to scare tactics to  try to sink her nomination.    Democrats realize that it is pretty hard to oppose Judge Barrett on  the merits, and they seem at least somewhat wary of attacking her  religion, as they did during her confirmation hearing to the Seventh  Circuit, when multiple Democrats suggested that Judge Barrett was  unqualified because she happened to be a practicing Catholic. I think  Democrats may be realizing that their bias against religious people  doesn't play well with the millions of Americans who take their faith  seriously.   They may also be remembering that the Constitution explicitly  forbids--forbids--religious tests for public office, although I will  note that that didn't stop one of the Democratic Presidential  candidate's advisers from saying just this week that she doesn't think  that orthodox Catholics, Muslims, or Jews should sit on the Supreme  Court. That is right--in this Biden adviser's world, taking your  religious faith seriously should disqualify you from sitting on the  Supreme Court.   Apparently Democrats still don't think that people of faith are  capable of upholding the Constitution or discharging the duties of  their office. But, again, it seems the Democrats realize that offending  millions of religious Americans may not be their best strategy, so they  have turned to healthcare scare tactics.   Judge Barrett, Democrats say, will take away Americans' healthcare if  she is confirmed to the Supreme Court. It is actually a very old  Democratic line--something that they always use in their playbook.   It was deployed, if you can believe this, against Justice Kennedy  when he was a Supreme Court nominee back in 1986.   It was deployed against Justice Souter, a Republican nominee, who  became known for siding with the liberal wing of the Court. There were  lots of posters at the time that said things like ``Stop Souter or  women will die.'' ``He will jeopardize the health and lives of  Americans,'' it was said by the left at the time.   It was deployed against Justice Roberts--the very same man who cast  the deciding vote upholding the Affordable Care Act--when he was Chief  Justice on the Supreme Court. They said at the time that there would  literally be millions of American consumers and families at risk of  losing their coverage. That statement was made by a Member of the  current leadership here in the U.S. Senate about Chief Justice Roberts.   Now it is being deployed against Judge Barrett in an attempt to  derail her nomination, while promulgating one of the liberals' favorite  myths--that Republicans are eagerly waiting to rip away Americans'  healthcare.   Democrats are particularly focused on suggesting that Republicans  would like to take away protections for preexisting conditions, despite  the fact, I might add, that every single Senate Republican supports  protecting people with preexisting conditions--every single Senate  Republican. In fact, just a  [[Page S5903]]  few weeks ago, Republicans included language affirming protections for  those with preexisting conditions in our COVID relief bill--a bill that  Democrats filibustered.   It is both ridiculous and offensive to suggest that Judge Barrett,  the mom of seven children--more than one of whom has faced medical  challenges--is out to eliminate Americans' healthcare.   The truth is, we have no idea how Judge Barrett would vote on any  particular healthcare case, just as we have no idea how any Supreme  Court Justice will vote on any particular healthcare case. How could  we? How could we? Each case is unique, with unique legal and  constitutional issues. What we can say with certainty about Judge  Barrett is that she will carefully consider each case. She will  consider the facts of the case, the law, and the Constitution, and she  will rule based on those things regardless of her personal feelings or  beliefs.   As Judge Barrett noted in her speech accepting the President's  nomination, ``A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not  policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy  views that they might hold.'' That is the kind of Justice that Judge  Barrett would be, and that is the kind of Justice that all of us,  Democrat or Republican, should want--someone who will protect the  principles of justice and equality under the law by judging according  to the law and the Constitution and nothing else; someone who will  leave her personal beliefs at the courtroom door; someone who will, as  Judge Barrett said last week, quoting the judicial oath, ``administer  justice without respect to persons, do equal right to the poor and  rich, and faithfully and impartially discharge my duties under the  United States.''   One of the reasons I ran for the Senate was to help put judges like  Amy Coney Barrett on the bench. I commend the President for his  outstanding choice, and I look forward to supporting her nomination as  the Senate moves forward.   I yield the floor.
