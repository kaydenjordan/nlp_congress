 Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that it was 50 years ago  this week that three brave Americans stepped foot on the Moon. When we  look at our children's toys today, it is amazing that they contain more  data processing power than the systems which actually operated the  Apollo vehicles 50 years ago.   These three American astronauts--Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and  Michael Collins--could not really know whether they would return. They  were willing to serve their country and proud for America to be leading  the world in space.   But even if our space program got a strong jump-start, even because  of the Cold War, this mission was also about the human spirit and the  need to explore. The whole world was eager to hear news of the mission.  No matter what may happen in the future, this would be the first time  human beings would step foot on a world other than our own home. Neil  Armstrong's description of that mission was a leap, and it is as  fitting today as it is instructional now.   I am excited, as many of my colleagues and many Americans are, about  the President's call to accelerate our plans to land again on the Moon  by 2024. I am very proud of the role that my home State of Alabama has  played in the development of the most powerful rockets, the Saturn  family. You can still see today, if you go down to Huntsville, Alabama,  a real Saturn V rocket suspended horizontally at the U.S. Space &  Rocket Center in Huntsville.   Likewise, I am proud of the Marshall Space Flight Center, including  the Michoud Assembly Facility, as the designer and the builder of the  Space Launch System. This will be the most powerful rocket in the world  and is approximately 90 percent finished. The American taxpayers own  it, and they will benefit from it as a national asset. It is the  successful combined work of product companies and suppliers from  virtually every State in the Nation.   The Saturn V rocket was able to execute the Apollo mission in one  launch because of the rocket's third stage propelled lander and the  reentry vehicle to the Moon's orbit.   Similarly, the SLS exploration upper stage, referred to as the EUS,  will enable a payload delivery to the Moon's orbit, including the Orion  capsule, of 45 metric tons, three to four times greater than any other  launch vehicle currently in use or close to completion. It can have  that EUS capability ready by 2024, but we can only have that ready if  we move ahead this year with that goal.   Systems like the SLS and Orion inspire innovation, and maybe one day  other rockets and capsules will surpass them. But to reach our goal by  2024, we need to stay focused and complete these nearly mature systems.   Some have said in recent years about our going to the Moon: We have  been there. We have done that. With all due respect, I would disagree.  But this new mission to the Moon, I would say: Go there, but don't stop  there.   Sustainability offers many future benefits, but let's not get  distracted for this first human return to the Moon. Let's reach the  peak. Let's make that landing.   And as we ponder the future of the Moon, let's look up again and set  a date, a real mission date, for setting foot on Mars.                            ____________________
