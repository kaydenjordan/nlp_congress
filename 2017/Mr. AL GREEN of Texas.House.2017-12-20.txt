 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to note that the ranking member, the  Honorable Maxine Waters, is often the sentinel on watch. She is the  person who is there to protect investors. She is there to protect  persons who might, but for her absence, be taken advantage of. So I am  honored to speak with her and to stand with her.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill today because this bill epitomizes  what I believe is a business model that allows corporate America to  take advantage of investors. This business model is one that has been  perpetrated and perpetuated by my colleagues on the other side. This  business model is one that surfaced in 2008, when the credit rating  agencies became captives of the businesses that were providing the  instruments that were to be rated. They were catering to the businesses  to the detriment of the investors.   I believe this business model is one that allows the fiduciary rule  to be compromised. The fiduciary rule simply said that, if you are  working on behalf of an investor, you can't put your interest ahead of  the investor's interest. That rule was compromised by my colleagues on  the other side.   So today they again come with another business model that will allow  investors to be taken advantage of. Caveat emptor is going to apply in  a way that it has never been seen before as it will relate to these  investors.   It is time for us to prevent the business model of allowing investors  to be taken advantage of and to present a business model that allows  the investor to have the benefit of advice from the proxy. That is what  we have currently. Let's not change the business model. Let's make sure  that the investor is properly protected.
