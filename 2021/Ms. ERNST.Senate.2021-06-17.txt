 Madam President, as a member of the Senate Armed Services  Committee, I rise to pay tribute to COL David W. Trotter, who has  selflessly served our great country as a U.S. Army intelligence  officer. He is a fellow alumnus of the Iowa State University Cyclone  Battalion and a dear friend of mine.   Colonel Trotter will retire on November 30, 2021, after a successful  30-year military career as an accomplished leader, infantry, and  intelligence officer. Dave's leadership abilities were evident early  on. I met Dave early in my days at Iowa State, where he served as a  personal mentor and driving factor to my own service to this great  Nation. From those early days, he grew even more as a leader and  soldier, ultimately completing a storied career at home and abroad, in  peace and in war. It is fitting that we recognize his service to this  great Nation.   Colonel Trotter was commissioned in 1992 upon graduating from Iowa  State University as a distinguished military graduate with a bachelor  in business. Dave served as an infantry platoon leader in Korea and a  company executive officer at Fort Carson, CO. He then was selected as a  company commander for 18 months with Headquarters and Headquarters  Company, 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment in Fort Lewis, WA. After  command, he served as an operations officer for the Des Moines, IA,  Recruiting Battalion before being selected for the prestigious 75th  Ranger Regiment.   Upon arrival at the 75th Ranger Regiment in Fort Benning, GA, Dave  served as an assistant intelligence officer. He then was selected again  for command, where he served as the military intelligence detachment  commander. Throughout his time in the 75th Ranger Regiment, Dave  deployed in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.   As a field-grade officer, Dave served as an operations officer in the  XVIII Airborne Corps, G2 section at Fort Bragg, NC. He then served as  an operations officer and executive officer within the 525th  Battlefield Surveillance Brigade, where he also deployed in support of  Operation Iraqi Freedom. He then served again as an operations officer  for the Intelligence and Security Command at Fort Belvoir, VA, before  being selected for command of the Army Geospatial Intelligence  Battalion at Springfield, VA.   After various staff positions, Dave served as the chief of staff,  Afghanistan Ministry of Interior Advisory Group, where he deployed  again to Afghanistan in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and  Freedom Sentinel. After a brief year on staff at Fort Huachuca, AZ,  Dave deployed again in support of Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq,  where he served as the III Corps G2. After redeployment, he was chosen  to serve as the Army North senior intelligence officer. He then would  transfer once more to Joint Base San Antonio, Fort Sam Houston, TX,  where he served as the executive officer to the commanding general of  Army North, Fifth Army.   As his final assignment in uniform, COL David W. Trotter was selected  to serve as the deputy commander for Joint Base San Antonio and the  vice commander of the 502d Air Base Wing.   A highly decorated officer, Dave earned several service awards,  including the Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster and the Bronze Star  with oak leaf cluster, for his service. He also earned the Ranger Tab,  the Master Parachutist Badge, the Pathfinder Badge, and the Air Assault  Badge.   Dave has deployed in support of combat operations in Afghanistan,  Iraq, and Syria. He has served at every level and commanded with  distinction at the company through brigade levels within the  conventional force and within the Army's premier Special Operations  Command. He and his family have sacrificed so much to ensure America  can be what it is today.   David, congratulations on your successful career and well-deserved  retirement. I want to thank you and your family for the sacrifices you  have made over the past 30 years. I join my colleagues in Congress and  all Americans as we express our deepest appreciation for your service,  acknowledge you and your family's many accomplishments and sacrifices,  and wish the very best for you, your wife Tami, and your son Ty in the  future.                            ____________________
