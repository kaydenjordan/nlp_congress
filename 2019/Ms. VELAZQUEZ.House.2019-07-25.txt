 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Hector Figueroa, a  champion for workers, a New Yorker, and proud Puerto Rican, who, sadly,  passed last week.   While he was relentless in advocating for members of his union, SEIU  32BJ, he was also on the front lines helping taxi drivers, fast food  employees, and workers in every sector. To him, anyone who was  oppressed was an ally, and he was ready to join them in common cause.   Most recently, he was central to building support for relief in  Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.   His belief that everyone deserves respect extended beyond his work as  a labor leader. Hector treated everyone, from the youngest organizers  to the most powerful elected officials, with genuine kindness.   Just last week, this House voted to raise the Federal minimum wage. I  like to think, wherever he is, that this will bring a smile to Hector's  face.   We will honor his memory by advancing the causes that inspired him.   Hector always said, ``We'll keep organizing.''   Yes, my friend, we will.                            ____________________
