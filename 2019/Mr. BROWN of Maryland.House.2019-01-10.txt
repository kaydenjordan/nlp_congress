 Mr. Speaker, there is a crisis in our country,  but it is not at our southern border. There is a crisis mounting at  every airport, every national park, in the homes of furloughed Federal  employees and stop-work Federal contractors across this country, from  Los Angeles through Kansas City to Baltimore. It is a crisis that is  hurting the lives of countless Americans whose food won't be inspected,  whose water may not be clean, whose flight may not be safe, and whose  bills may not be paid. It is a crisis of the President's own making.   Right now, we are on the verge of the longest government shutdown in  our Nation's history, a shameful display of what happens when the  President governs solely to appeal to his political base, rather than  on behalf of all Americans.   Why are we here, Mr. Speaker? Because the President has committed  himself to a wall that many experts say is ineffective. It is  ineffective; it is expensive; and it is downright absurd. It has become  a vanity project that began as an applause line in a campaign speech in  which then-candidate Trump deemed the entire migration of people from  the south rapists and criminals.   It is clear, the wall is the only policy objective that matters to  the President, and he is willing to say or do anything to get it. He  will push hundreds of thousands of American families into suffering for  his wall, and he has gone so far as to threaten us with a declaration  of national emergency if he doesn't get his way, a declaration of  national emergency not because we are in the middle of one, but,  rather, as the President put it, because he can't make a deal.   What is this national emergency on the border that the President is  so concerned and afraid of? The past 2 years have seen border crossings  drop to a historic low. Most undocumented immigrants in this country  are visa overstays.   Mr. Speaker, 0.1 percent of all Border Patrol arrests in 2018 were  members of MS-13. Yes, that is a problem that we are sadly and  tragically familiar with in Maryland, but that doesn't make it a  national emergency.   Most drugs smuggled through the southern border come through official  ports of entry, not between them. And despite the President's false  claims, there aren't thousands of terrorists coming across the border.   Customs and Border Protection, an agency in which the President has  considerable confidence, said they encountered six people with names  that are like those on the terrorist watch list. Last year, more  suspected foreign terrorists were apprehended at the northern border  than at our southern border.   Sure, we need strong border security, and not just at our southern  border. But the President knows this isn't a national emergency but,  perhaps, an alarm to his own political future.   What will hurt our security and create a real crisis is if he takes  money away from the Armed Forces to fund the wall. If the President  used funding from the military construction budget, facilities used by  our men and women in uniform--like shipyards and aircraft hangars,  ammunition supply points and training ranges, and childcare centers and  family housing--those would continue to slide into disrepair. This  would impact military readiness and the quality of life for our  military families.   Or the President could decide to use money from infrastructure  projects from the Army Corps of Engineers, projects meant to protect  cities like Houston or Ellicott City in Maryland from flooding and  would threaten tens of thousands of Americans who may find themselves  in a real emergency during the next hurricane season.   The use of these authorities, like the deployment of our troops to  the border, is irresponsible, unnecessary, and misguided.   Mr. Speaker, we don't have a crisis on the border. We have a crisis  in the Oval Office. To President Trump, the wall, his symbol of  division, matters more than substantial improvements to border security  and true comprehensive immigration reform.   If President Trump wants to address the real crisis in our country,  let's end this shutdown and pay the people who work for the people.  Let's reduce our silent backlog, protect Dreamers, and fix our  dysfunctional immigration system. We need real action and a bipartisan  solution.                            ____________________
