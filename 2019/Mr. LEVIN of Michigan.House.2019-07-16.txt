 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, according to the Anti-Defamation  League, domestic extremists killed at least 50 people in the United  States in 2018, a sharp increase from  [[Page H5904]]  the 37 extremist-related murders documented in 2017. Indeed, that is a  26 percent jump in 1 year.   Given the disturbing rise of plots and incidents of domestic  terrorism nationwide, I am pleased with the provision in this bill  requiring that a joint report on domestic terrorism be submitted to  Congress each year by the DNI, the FBI Director, and the Under  Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis.   My amendment requires that this comprehensive report on domestic  terrorism be made available on the public websites not just of the  National Counterterrorism Center but also of the Federal Bureau of  Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security.   The amendment also specifies that the report should be made publicly  available no later than 30 days after submission to the appropriate  congressional committees. We can't let something this important be  delayed over and over again.   We need to ensure that this report is accessible not just to promote  transparency but also to help policymakers nationwide recognize the  scope of the threat that domestic terrorism poses and to encourage  academic research necessary to understand the scourge of domestic  terrorism better so that we might bring it to an end once and for all.  I am talking about policymakers on the local and the State level as  well as the Federal level.   Madam Chair, I thank, in particular, Chairman Schiff and his staff  for their leadership on this bill and for working with me on this and  other provisions.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time
