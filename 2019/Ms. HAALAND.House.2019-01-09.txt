 Madam Speaker, I rise to urge President Trump and Senate  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to reopen the Federal Government. Let's  be clear: the crisis is not along our Nation's southern border. The  real crisis is getting people back to work.   I cannot stand by silently while nearly 800,000 Federal workers,  thousands of which are in New Mexico, won't receive a paycheck, and  countless, innocent people suffer because they will not receive  essential services from the Federal Government.   The government shutdown impacts the State of New Mexico more than  almost anywhere in this country. The government shutdown directly  affects more than 6,000 Federal employees throughout New Mexico. These  dedicated public servants are not getting paid, but they still need to  pay the rent, put food on the table, and they still need to make  payments on their car loans and student loans.   Almost 50,000 residents of New Mexico's First Congressional District  depend on SNAP benefits to feed their families. The government shutdown  means that SNAP benefits are threatened.   As someone who relied on government assistance programs when I was  raising my daughter as a single mom, I have been there, and I know that  it is devastating for these people to worry about how they are going to  pay for their next meal and take care of their families.   Our Indian tribes, pueblos, and nations who rely on Federal funding  for aging services and Indian Health Services for medical care, are  already being impacted by this shutdown, and the suffering will grow  greater as the shutdown drags on. If this shutdown continues, 62  percent of Indian Health Services will be forced to cease offering  services, and 54 percent will be forced to lay off essential staff.  This is a recipe for disaster.   On the Navajo Nation in my State, people have been trapped in their  homes without food, water, and medicine because the government has  failed to fund the Federal maintenance to plow snow from the roads.   The Department of Agriculture's Food Distribution Program on Indian  reservations runs out of funding at the end of this month. This program  provides nutrition assistance to nearly 90,000 Native Americans.   Madam Speaker, I voted to pass legislation through this House that  Democrats have put forward to reopen the government. What we need now  is Senator Mitch McConnell and President Trump to show that same kind  of leadership and act on these bills, which the Senate already passed  last year, and reopen our government.                            ____________________
