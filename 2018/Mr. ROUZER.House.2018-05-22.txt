 Mr. Chairman, North Carolina's Seventh Congressional  District is fortunate to have more than 63,000 veterans call it home.   Unfortunately, many of these brave heroes encounter a variety of  problems that require congressional action, whether through casework or  legislation, as is the case with my amendment tonight.   Recently, a veteran battling Parkinson's disease contacted my office  in a desperate attempt to modify the beneficiary for his survivor  benefits plan. In this particular case, the veteran is fighting for his  life, and because one currently can only make changes during open  season, he is unable to change the beneficiary of his plan. My  amendment will provide flexibility, via waiver, to veterans such as  this gentleman who desire to change beneficiaries.   I appreciate my colleagues' support for this amendment so that  terminally ill veterans are given the ability to update their survivor  benefit plan as they wish, when they wish.
