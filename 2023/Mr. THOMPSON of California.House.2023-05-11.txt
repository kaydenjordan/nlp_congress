 Mr. Speaker, every day 30 people are  killed by someone using a gun. Gun violence is the leading cause of  death for children in the United States. When will you be bringing a  bill to the floor to help put an end to this carnage?   Mr. Speaker, our country is averaging 1.5 mass shootings every day.  There are over 70 suicides and accidental shootings every day. When  will you bring a bill to the floor to help put an end to this?   Mr. Speaker, every day our cops are on the street protecting  Americans, and they are confronted by criminals who have access, easy  access, to guns that they shouldn't have. When will the Republicans be  bringing a bill to the floor to help put an end to this, Mr. Speaker?  [[Page H2257]]    It is sad. It is sad that there is not even no word but there is no  action on this. When will the Republicans work with us Democrats to  help put an end to gun violence?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the  economies of every country around the world, resulting in great  economic shutdown. However, our country, the United States, came out of  the pandemic ahead of other nations because we expanded programs such  as unemployment insurance.   Sadly, this bill seeks to target Americans who received overpayment  from the government at no fault of their own instead of going after  those who committed fraud.   During the bill's markup and later in the Rules Committee, I offered  an amendment that would amend the criminal code to extend the statute  of limitations to 10 years, as recommended by the Department of Labor  Inspector General and legal experts so we could get the crooks.  [[Page H2287]]    However, the Republicans decided to go after public servants and  retirees instead of the criminals. One of the other members said that  criminals and cheats need to be brought to justice. They do. Extend the  statute of limitations and we can do it. We can catch the bad guys. We  can catch the crooks. We can get the taxpayer money back.
