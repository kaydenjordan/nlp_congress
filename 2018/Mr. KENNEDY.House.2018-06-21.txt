 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Ms. Clarke,  for her leadership on this issue and so many others in Congress as a  member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and of the Energy and  Commerce Committee. Healthcare and immigration policies run through the  veins of our society.   Mr. Speaker, over the course of the day today and over the course of  the last several days, my colleagues have  [[Page H5490]]  eloquently described the shortcomings of the immigration bills brought  forward by Republicans. I echo their outrage at what has taken place  over the past few weeks on American soil and their fury that Congress  still is so unwilling or unable to address it.   As this debate has unfolded, one chorus in particular caught my ear,  these voices that say: Our own kids are suffering. Our own country has  issues. We feel for these children at the border, but how do you expect  us to take care of them when you have made it so hard for us to take  care of our own?   Mr. Speaker, it is those voices that I want to speak to this evening  first to say: You are right.   Mr. Speaker, we have children in this country who will not get one  hot meal today let alone three. We have children who will show up to  schools without books, children who will spend a winter without coats  or Christmas presents, or a summer without clean water and cool air. We  have children who are abused or ill, who are abandoned, and who are  oppressed.   All of this is in the most powerful country in the world. We should  be ashamed and united in our rage that, as a country, a nation as rich  as ours makes it so damn hard for families to be able to survive. We  are united by a resolve to do better because if a place, a country like  America, can't meet its people's needs, then who can?   So, Mr. Speaker, some dream up walls, frantically grasping at what  they can have and pushing others away in a desperate attempt to make  sure that there is enough left over for them and their families. It is  a ferocious instinct to defend ourselves and our loved ones, and one  that any parent can understand, particularly those parents arriving at  our border today, those who risk everything to show up on our shores  and beg for mercy.   Can we not see in them that same parental, basic human instinct to  bear any burden to protect your child? If we were they, I know of no  parent who wouldn't walk through jungles and deserts and risk gangs and  violence for the chance of a brighter future for their child.   In a perfect world, all borders would be peaceful, all governments  would be strong and good, all families would be whole, all  neighborhoods would be safe, and all communities would have the  resources to fix what is broken and pick up those among us who have  fallen.   But ours is not a perfect world. So, night after night, children show  up on our doorstep terrified and traumatized. Yes, we have our own  tragedies, our own struggles, and our own monsters to defeat. No, we  cannot right every wrong; we cannot save every soul; and we cannot  shoulder the world's inequities alone.   But we absolutely can offer small and weary heads a safe place to  rest. We can make space for people with no place else to go. We can do  that and still take care of our own. We can welcome the tired, the  poor, and those yearning to be free and still be free ourselves. We can  help the very hungry afford food, the very sick get care, and the very  cold shelter without jeopardizing our own dinner, our own health, and  our own bed.   We can choose both. Americans do every single day. Across the country  in soup kitchens and shelters, in schools, on battlefields and  operating tables, our people struggle, they stretch, and they extend.  They do it when it is hard and when it is uncomfortable and  inconvenient.   So no matter how many times this administration doubts their capacity  or their compassion, they reach out. No matter how many times they try  and force us to choose between taking care of someone else and taking  care of ourselves, they do choose both.   We cannot fall for that false choice, because if we, the United  States of America, cannot figure out how to muster the resources, the  courage, the boldness, and the political will to ensure that no child  suffers on our shores, who will?                                time  1945
