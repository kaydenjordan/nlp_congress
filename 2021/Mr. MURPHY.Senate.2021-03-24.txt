 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Republicans are going to be on the floor  today, taking a sudden 100-percent sincere interest in immigration  reform. They are going to propose that the Senate take up a handful of  bills to address what they call a crisis created by President Biden on  our southern border.   Forgive me for being blunt, but give me a break. Republicans suddenly  care about the border because they don't want to talk about the real  crisis that President Donald Trump created and that President Biden is  fixing: the COVID crisis and our Nation's economic crisis. Republicans  don't want to fix our broken immigration laws. They want to distract  Americans from the real story right now, which is the implementation of  the very popular American Rescue Plan.   There are $1,400 checks that are arriving in people's bank accounts  right now. School budgets finally have enough resources to catch up on  all of the lost learning for our kids; childhood poverty is about to be  cut in half; more production of vaccines. That is the real story.   You know how I know the Republicans are less than sincere in this  interest in immigration policy? First, because they controlled the  Senate for 6 years and not once during the roughly 2,100 days that they  were in charge did they try to honestly bring a comprehensive  immigration reform proposal to the floor.   I checked. Two of the bills they are going to ask unanimous consent  for today were brought up for show votes in the middle of the 2016  Presidential election as a means of helping Donald Trump's candidacy,  but in neither instance was there actually any attempt to try to find  common ground to actually pass something.   Go back even further. In 2013, when Democrats were in the Senate,  that is when we actually did pass a comprehensive immigration reform  bill. But it was Republicans who opposed it--not all, but all of the  opposition came from Republicans--and it was the House Republican  majority that refused to even consider the bill. That is where it died.  So spare me this sudden concern for immigration policy.  [[Page S1730]]    But since Republicans are now newly concerned about what is happening  on the border, it probably makes sense for us to level set the facts.  The facts. So here are four of them.   The first is a pretty simple one. Republicans will tell you that Joe  Biden created this crisis, that his policies are the reason why we have  seen an increase in migration to the border. But here is the chart, and  I want you to zero in on the end of it. As you can see, apprehensions  at the border, which are a pretty decent indication of the number of  people who are crossing without documentation, started going up in the  middle of 2020 precipitously. All that is occurring now is a  continuation of these increases. Apprehensions and crossings at the  border didn't start increasing on Inauguration Day; they started  increasing back in the middle and end of 2020. So you can't say that  this was a creation of Joe Biden's policies if what we are witnessing  now is a continuation of a trend that began at the end of last year. In  fact, as you can see here, the 10-year high for apprehensions at the  border happened right in the middle of the Trump administration--a time  during which the President was crowing that his policies at the border  were the toughest ever.   Here is the second fact. The border is not open, as Republicans  falsely claim. Here is what is happening right now on our southern  border. Since the pandemic began, the administration invoked something  called title 42 that allows, temporarily, during a public health  emergency, the Border Patrol to turn everyone back around and send them  back into Mexico regardless of whether they have an asylum claim that  is legitimate or not. Under law, that is a temporary authority that is  only allowed to be used during a public health emergency, and President  Trump was using that authority.   The problem was that for these kids who were showing up at the  border, who had legitimate asylum claims, right, whose lives were in  danger in the places they were coming from, when we turned them around  and sent them back to the Mexican border, we were essentially leaving  them to die. Their parents weren't there. The smugglers who brought  them to the United States had already left.   This was a disastrous, inhumane, unconscionable policy, to turn these  kids back around to the border and leave them to the smugglers, to the  sex traffickers with no one to help. So the only change President Biden  made was to say that these unaccompanied minors need to be protected;  we need to process their asylum claims. But President Biden is still  turning around, under title 42 authority, every single adult, every  group of adults, and every family who comes to the border, under title  42 authority.   The border is not open. All that has changed is that the prior law  that was applied before the pandemic began is being applied selectively  to unaccompanied minors.   Let's be clear. The authority to expel everybody being applied now to  everybody except for unaccompanied minors, that is a temporary  authority--an authority that Donald Trump didn't even invoke until the  pandemic began.   Third, it is not even clear that what is happening now is anything  other than a natural increase in migration during the winter, combined  with the buildup of demand from title 42 enforcement in 2020.   The Washington Post data analysts took a look at the recent data on  border crossings year to year and month to month, and here is what they  said:         We looked at data from [the] U.S. Customs and Border       Protection to see whether there's a ``crisis''--or even a       ``surge,'' as many news outlets have characterized it. We       analyzed monthly CBP data from 2012 to now and [we] found no       crisis or surge that can be attributed to Biden       administration policies. Rather, the current increase in       apprehensions fits a predictable pattern of seasonal changes       in undocumented immigration combined with a backlog of demand       because of 2020's coronavirus border closure.    What they are essentially saying is that because of conditions on the  ground in Central America and Mexico, you saw an increase in crossings  and apprehensions in 2018 and 2019 that vanished only in 2020 because  of title 42 authority that is now starting back up again.   Again, the data backs this up. This year, from January to February,  there was a 28-percent increase in crossings. January to February 2019,  there was a 31-percent increase. Go back to 2018; February to March, a  25-percent increase. For the last 3 years, outside of the pandemic  environment, during the winter, you will see a routine 25- to 30- percent increase in presentations at the border. This is when people  normally cross, during the relatively colder weather months of the  winter.   Second, these numbers are really deceiving because these aren't  unique individuals; this is just total number of apprehensions. So what  is happening under title 42 is that adults are being immediately  removed right back to Mexico, but then they are immediately attempting  to recross. So many of these numbers look high because you have  individuals who never got the chance to make an asylum claim who are  crossing multiple times at the border.   The fourth fact is that there is little evidence that American policy  at the border has much to do with migration rates. The evidence, the  facts show that it is conditions on the ground in the origin nations  that are what determine whether people pack up their homes and leave  for America   Again, this chart is a good indication of that fact, because Donald  Trump would tell you that his policies were tougher than anybody's, but  the 10-year high in crossings, apprehensions happened in the middle of  Donald Trump's inhumane border policies. Why? Because during this time,  conditions are abysmal. Violence is spiking in many places from which  these migrants are coming.   Just as a matter of sort of further explanation, if we brought this  chart back into the Bush administration, you would find that crossings  were much higher, at a much higher rate during the Bush administration  than at any time during the Obama administration.   People come to the United States because they are fleeing violence,  they are fleeing economic desperation, not because of some message they  get from the U.S. Government.   One study I was looking at the other day, a comprehensive study of  rationales for crossings data on the times that people cross, says  this:         [T]ougher border controls have had remarkably little       influence on the propensity to migrate illegally.    These are the facts. These are the facts. Republicans need to stop  looking at immigration as a political opportunity. We need to start  dealing with the truth.   The number of immigrants showing up at the border today is large, but  the winter increase isn't bigger than either of the last two winters  prior to the pandemic with respect to percentage increase. It didn't  start when Joe Biden became President or because of Joe Biden's  policies. The increase started last year, when Donald Trump was  President.   To the extent that Republicans oppose President Biden's lifting of  the title 42 removal proceedings for kids, what is your alternative? Do  you support just dumping these kids, these 10- and 11-year-olds, on the  other side of the border, scared and alone, and just leaving them to  die or to be forced into the arms of drug cartels or traffickers in  Northern Mexico? That is un-American, and I am glad my President chose  to end that inhumane, temporary policy.   But even if President Biden continued title 42 authority for kids for  a few more months, expedited removal can't last forever. The law  doesn't allow it. So once again, pretty soon, every migrant is going to  be able to have the chance to apply for asylum, as they should. And  herein lies an opportunity. Let's work together to fix what is a  legitimately broken system.   I will give an example. People should be able to apply for asylum in  the United States. We built this Nation by allowing people to come here  from very dangerous places. But the asylum process takes too long-- years between when you present yourself at the border and when you get  a final decision on whether you can stay in the United States. Let's  fix that. It is within our ability as Members of Congress to fix that.  The administration can't do it. They need resources. They need new law  and new authorities.   Republicans and Democrats could choose to--instead of playing  politics, instead of offering up motions today that are sure to lose,  we could sit down and try to do something about it. But  [[Page S1731]]  for 6 years, Republicans had the opportunity to bring together a  conversation around comprehensive immigration reform, and they didn't.  Hopefully, we will have the opportunity to do that now.   Lastly, behind every single one of these individuals coming to the  border is a story, is a real human being. Ask yourself, if your child  were being recruited into vicious drug gangs with a high likelihood of  serious harm or death, would you not take steps to keep your child  safe? Would you not bring them to a place like America that was safer  for that child?   I visited, on Friday, the southwest border. I was in El Paso with a  group of bipartisan colleagues and Secretary Mayorkas, who is doing a  good job, who is managing this emergency with skill. I met a little  girl, about 13 years old, who was in one of these processing facilities  waiting to be moved into the asylum process. She was truly scared. She  was truly scared. She knew she was going to have a chance to reunite  with her family in the United States, but these detention centers--they  are better than they were in 2019, but they are no place for kids.   That little girl was coming from Guatemala, a place where there are  certain neighborhoods that are more violent than any war zone in the  Middle East, a place where murder rates eclipse anything we can even  imagine in the United States.   So that little girl, she needs America to survive, but I would argue  that America needs her more because without her and the thousands of  other children arriving at our border, hungry for a better life, we are  going to risk abandoning the entire original idea of this great, one- of-a-kind Nation, a Nation that opens its arms to those who are fleeing  violence and desperation. It is not just our tradition; it is our  definition as a country--more reason for those of us in the U.S. Senate  to resist the temptation to play politics with these kids' lives and  with the very complicated, nuanced, important issue of immigration and  instead find ways to be truthful about what is happening at the border  as a means to come together and do something about it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  morning business tomorrow, Thursday, March 25, all postcloture time on  the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 11, H.R. 1799, the PPP Extension  Act, be considered expired and the motion to proceed be agreed to; that  the only amendments in order be the following: Kennedy, No. 1401;  Rubio, No. 1405; further, that it be in order for Senator Paul or his  designee to raise a Budget Act point of order; finally, that at 11 a.m.  tomorrow, the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in the order  listed and on the motion to waive, if made; that if the motion to waive  is agreed to, the bill be considered read a third time and the Senate  vote on passage of the bill as amended, if amended, with 60 affirmative  votes required for passage, all with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I thank my friend Senator Bennet for those  remarks, for honoring the memories of those we have lost and commanding  us to action.   I remember getting a phone call from Michael Bennet that Friday  morning as Senator Blumenthal and I were sitting at a firehouse in  Sandy Hook, CT,  [[Page S1748]]  learning what had happened just around the corner at a schoolhouse.   I remember getting advice from Michael Bennet about what you do as an  elected official in the midst of this tragedy because he had already  been through it once before. Colorado had already been through it more  than once before.   I think about this macabre club that an increasing number of Members  of the Senate and House belong to in which we have this memory bank of  what to do when a mass shooting happens in your district or your  State--a set of capacities that no Member of the House or Senate, no  Governor ever had to think about or ever consider possessing decades  ago. Now, we call each other when these things happen to impart advice  as to how to be helpful to communities that are grieving.   I am thankful to have friends like Senator Bennet, who can be with  others at moments like this, but I hate the fact that he knows all too  well what communities go through when something happens like happened  earlier this week in Boulder.   We thought about what to do to try to move this country and our  colleagues to action after another spate of mass shootings. This is a  really old chart that I brought down to the floor for years. These  numbers are out of date, unfortunately, because, well, in 2019, we were  losing 100 people a day from gun violence. That is not the number from  2020 or 2021. We have seen a dramatic increase in gun violence.   While in 2020 we didn't see the mass shootings that we have been  accustomed to in years prior, we are now seeing them once again pop up  on our TV screens in 2021. But the lack of mass shootings masked the  reality, which was a dramatic increase in the number of people who were  felled by guns over the course of last year. We thought about what we  could do to try to make more real for our colleagues the scope of this  epidemic, and we thought of maybe something simple, you know, to make  people understand that these aren't really numbers. The numbers are  just a way to explain in aggregate who these people are, because each  one of them is an individual. Each one of them led a life. Each one of  them had people who loved them. Each one of them loved people. So many  of them, you can just see by these snapshots, were young. They had full  lives ahead of them, businesses to start, and families to begin. None  of that happened for them because they were shot, often at the  beginning or the peak of their early life.    So tonight I am hopeful that I will be joined by a number of my  colleagues to do something simple, just to read into the Record, the  permanent Congressional Record, the names of those who have died just  in 2021. Every single day, there are over 100 people dying right now. I  don't think America has ever seen this rate of gun violence, with the  exception of wartime, in our history.   While we won't have time to tell you the story of all these people,  as Michael did about those whom we lost in Boulder, at least we can  make sure that forever their name and a link to their story is in the  Congressional Record.   Senator Bennet already talked about Lynn Murray and Suzanne Fountain,  Teri Leiker, Kevin Mahoney, Tralona Bartkowiak, Rikki Olds, Neven  Stanisic, Denny Stong, Jody Waters, and Eric Talley. Those are the  victims from Colorado. I am sorry if I didn't get the pronunciations  perfectly. But we also lost, over the course of the first 3 months of  this year Patrice Lynette Jones in Indiana; Kelvin Darnell from  Illinois; Kevon Dickerson from Kentucky; Leah Brooke Hines from Ohio;  Linda McMurry in Tennessee; Michael Uttley in Missouri; Jarrea Gardner  in Pennsylvania; Robert Randall Turner III from Maryland; Maddox Jones  in Georgia; Joseph Jackson in Florida.   On Monday, the same day as the shooting, in Boulder, Alessia  Mesquita, 28 years old, was shot and killed in New Haven, CT, with her  1-year-old daughter sitting in the back seat of her car. She and her  boyfriend were arguing in the car when he shot her to death. According  to her mother, Alessia had been trying to leave her boyfriend.   Alessia is described as a devoted mother who loved her children with  all of her heart. Many of her friends really relied on her for advice  and guidance. They said she would give the shirt off her back to help a  friend.   Her mom said:         My heart has been shattered, and I don't think I'm ever       going to be right again.    She was the second of eight children. She had two children of her  own, and her mother will now raise her two grandchildren.   Nobody heard about Alessia Mesquita being shot with her daughter in  the back seat in New Haven, CT, on Monday. Her life isn't less valuable  than any of those who were killed in mass shootings. But this country's  attention to the pandemic of gun violence, the epidemic of gun  violence, seems to surface only when there is a mass shooting.   Benjamin Bagley was shot last week in Bridgeport, CT. He was 22 years  old. He was remembered by friends and family as somebody who always  kept a smile on the faces of people who loved him. He was a doting  father. He was a loving son and brother and always made people smile.   His friends wrote:         He was taken from us far before his light was fully able to       shine its brightest.    He was one of six siblings, two brothers and four sisters. He had two  children and one on the way. He was born and raised in Bridgeport. He  was involved in his church.   His mom Michelle Brown said:         I had to kiss my son lying in a hospital bed dead. I don't       wish this on nobody, not even my worst enemy.    This wasn't the first time Benjamin had been shot. He had been  previously wounded in a shooting in 2016, but he had recovered.   Kevin Jang was 26 years old. About a month and a half ago, in early  February, he was killed by gun violence. He had moved to New Haven just  2 years ago to pursue a master's degree at the Yale School of the  Environment. He was a west coast native. He had gotten engaged 1 week  before his death. He had earned a degree. He was an Army veteran. He  was a present Army National Guard member.   He was shot outside his fiance's apartment. His fiance said:         Kevin was . . . a gift from God. He was a true and       righteous man after God's own heart. Life is so precious and       short. My only hope is that he is with his Heavenly Father       now in perfect peace.    ``An extraordinary young man,'' said Yale University's president.   I mean, I have a stack of names, 20, 25 per page. We don't have  enough time tonight to read into the Record the number of victims of  gun violence in 2021 alone--alone. There is Adam Todd Saeed from South  Carolina; Andrew Wesley from Ohio; Antonio Rowban Thompson from South  Carolina; Artrell Conner, Louisiana; Beau Michael Wasmer, West  Virginia; Brittany Wagoner-Moore in Ohio; Byron ``B'' Donnell Ross in  Texas; Carolyn Ann Stephenson, North Carolina; Christian Parra, New  Jersey; Christopher Bess, Illinois; David Caballero, California; David  Prince, Illinois; Dean Wagstaff, Washington; Devin Dawkins, Missouri;  Dolores Reyes, California; Eric Thompson, Tennessee; Glorida Dean  Eddington Lewis, Ohio; Harold Edward Dennison, West Virginia; Javontae  Hendricks, Illinois; Jeffrey Gillespie, Mississippi; Justin Bartley  Williams, Texas; Keldrick Love, Louisiana; Kiron Golden, Alabama;  Lesean Long, Illinois; Malcolm Fitts, Illinois; Marcel Tramon Pimpton,  Texas; Mario Vines, Oklahoma; Melissa Marie Nease, Florida; Nestor  Gregorio, Texas; Pedro Arturo Delgado Tagle, Texas; Rene Hernandez,  Texas; Robert ``Trey'' Scott III, Indiana; Ryan Abraham Whiteis-Saks,  Minnesota; Satnam Singh, Utah; Shamso Gedi-Abdi, Minnesota; Teresa  Ratliff, Ohio; Thomas ``TJ'' Carr, Ohio; Timothy Alfred Nelson, Texas;  Timothy Dugar Ohio; Tony Nichols, Missouri; Tre'Veon D. Buckner; Victor  Zuniga; Xavier Crosby; Adam David-Lawrence Arrambide; Bobby King;  Brandon Chunko; Carol Tinsley; Cecilia Apolo; Christian Joseph Jones;  Christopher Benton McLeod; Cory McHaffie; Curtis Lee Upshaw; DeAndre  Carter; Dominicko Howell; Donnell Hoskin; Grayson Babbs; Jamie Bull. It  is two pages. I have 20 more here. My colleagues will hopefully join me  on the floor tonight to read some of these names into the Record.    This is as astonishing as it is heartbreaking. This country allows  for this to happen, allows these individuals to effectively be nameless  and to be anonymous. Tonight we are reading into the Record only the  names of individuals  [[Page S1749]]  who died in this year, and the year isn't even 90 days old. How is it  that we pay attention during the mass shootings but just sleep through  the days in which all of these people are stolen from us through an  epidemic that is preventable?   This doesn't happen anywhere else in the high-income world. No other  nation permits this level of gun violence. Don't tell me it is the  price of admission to America. Don't tell me it is not preventable.  Don't tell me it is inevitable. It only happens here. It only happens  here, and it is really hard to comprehend the impact this has on  people.   I was in an elementary school in Baltimore, MD, about 2 years ago. I  had gone there to see an afterschool program that I had heard was very  successful. The school had started about an hour late that day because  of a weather delay, and so when I was inside the school, at about 10  o'clock, kids were still just arriving.   I went upstairs to join the young lady who ran this program, and we  were about a half an hour into our conversation when buzzers started  going off, and the lights flickered, and the intercom system lit up  with somebody from the central office repeating over and over again:  Code green, code green, code green.   I didn't know what a code green was. The person I was meeting with,  who was just running this afterschool program, didn't know what code  green was.   Luckily, the front office called up and told us that ``code green''  means there has been an active shooting somewhere in and around the  school and that everybody needs to turn the lights off, lock the doors,  and shut the blinds. So that is what we did.   It was 10:30 in the morning. After about 20 minutes, code green  ended, lights turned back on, and we continued our discussion. I was  shaken.   This is a school I had never set foot in. I had only been there about  20 minutes, and there was an active shooting within a handful of  blocks. So I wanted to know what happened. I stayed in touch with  personnel at the school. I read the Baltimore papers over the course of  the next few days to find out what had happened, and here is what I  found out. A young man by the name of Corey Dodd, who lived just down  the street from the school, had told his wife--I believe her name is  Marissa, if I remember correctly--that he would drop their twins off at  Matthew Henson Elementary School that morning. They had two other kids.  She was busy with them. He said: I will drop the kids off this morning.   So he drove the kids to Matthew Henson Elementary School, the twin  girls, and brought them into the building. I could have been in that  lobby with him that morning as I was coming in and he was leaving. He  got into his car. He drove a few blocks home, and in between his car  and the door, he was shot dead--10 o'clock in the morning.   His little girl, the youngest, always waited for him at the door when  he was arriving. Well, he never showed up to that door because he died  that day. And his two little twin girls in that school at the same time  that I was there, who might have been giggling as they took a break  from instruction and the lights went off, and they got to chat with  their friends, didn't know that they were never going to see their  father again.   Think about it, how the lives of those children change when their dad  vanishes from the Earth just like that. Think about how the lives of  all the children in that school change when they have to contemplate  the fact that their dads might not be home when they arrive next week  or the week after, if it could happen to Mr. Dodd. Think about how the  entire neighborhood goes through trauma after trauma when that happens  so routinely in a place like Baltimore.   You can't understand the scope of this epidemic by just reading off  these names. Adam Todd Saeed died. Jason Wilson died. Jath Burns died.  Johnjairo Brito died. Johnnie Clark died. Jonathan Joseph died. Jose  Medero died. Joseph Carney died. Justin Locklear died. Justin Marshall  died of gun violence. So did Kristen Slack and Latarous Harris and  Lieutenant Justin Bedwell.   They all died of gunshot wounds just in 2021, but they simply  represent the surface. You scratch just a bit, and you will find their  kids and their moms and their dads and their neighbors who are going  through trauma right now because of their deaths.   Research tells us that often there are 20 people who experience  definable trauma when someone close to them dies. And so even the names  that we read into the record tonight don't accurately represent the  scope of this trauma. Those kids' lives will never ever be the same in  Sandtown, the neighborhood of Baltimore in which this elementary school  sits, neither will be the lives of those kids who go to that school.   And maybe what was so inexplicable to me was that I had to work  really hard to find out anything about that young man. It was barely a  story the next day that he had died bringing his daughters to school  and then returning home. Had there been six more people shot, maybe it  would have made the papers. Maybe America would have paid attention.   But think of it this way: What if that same story played out not in  Baltimore, MD, with an African-American father and African-American  girls, what if that story played out in Westport, CT, with a White  father and two twin, blond-haired, White girls? Do we care less because  Corey was African American? You better believe it. You better believe  that headline news would have been running stories about an affluent,  White, suburban father dropping his kids off at an affluent, White,  suburban school and being shot before he entered his suburban home.   We don't care about individual loss of life like we care about the  victims of mass shootings. That is a tragedy. We also don't care about  the loss of Black life. We don't care about the people of color who die  in the same way that we care when White people die in this country.  That is just the truth.   So, tonight, my colleagues and I are going to come to the floor--and  I hope some will join me. I thank Senator Blumenthal for being here to  start us off--to read into the Record the names of individuals who have  been lost to gun violence in 2021 as a way to make sure we recognize  who they were and the lives that they led, but also as a last-gasp  effort to try to convince our colleagues to do something.   Tonight isn't really going to be the night to go deep into policy.  Senator Bennet talked about what we know we need to do. We can have  that debate at another time. Tonight is a night to just recognize the  scope of this epidemic, how many people are being lost, how many lives  are being impacted in mass shootings and in individual acts of  violence, in homicides and suicides and domestic violence incidences.  And maybe, maybe by pounding into people's brains the human toll of  this tragedy in mass shootings and in other forms, we can inch this  body a little bit closer to doing the right thing.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank my friend Senator Cortez Masto for  that powerful testimony, for sharing some of these stories talking  about the impact on families in Las Vegas and throughout her State, and  to talk about what this means from a parent's perspective, to think  that her own family had to wonder whether their loved one was going to  come back from that shooting that dominated the news, to think about  how many lives were changed.   Senator Blumenthal made a really important observation earlier and  that was that the numbers we are using here, 39,000 people dying a  year, and the names that we are reading into the Record, these are the  names of the individuals who have died, but what we know is there are  hundreds of thousands of others who have survived gunshot wounds. The  trauma is different, but it is still serious and acute.   When a loved one is shot, obviously, that comes with a moral  disruption to the family that is hard to calculate. Often that injury  has lifelong consequences. The individual is bound to a wheelchair,  losing the use of legs and arms. These are serious consequences that  affect the rest of your life.   While today we are reading into the Record the names of those who  have died, this stack represents, I think, just a fraction of those who  have died in 2021. It could be four times as high if we had talked  about those who have been injured in episodes of gun violence.   Other colleagues are going to join us here tonight on the floor.  While they do, let me just read into the Record a handful of additional  names: Carlesa Taylor; Cleveland Sanders; Cortney Smith, Missouri;  Corporal Martinus Mitchum from Louisiana; Daniel Bonham from Georgia;  Darrell Merriwether from Iowa; Devon Lon Remmel from Minnesota;  Diontaye Petty from Kentucky; Gregory Marchand from Missouri; Gwendolyn  McMillan from Georgia; Irvinn Villalba from New Mexico; Jakob Lee  Haines from Pennsylvania; Jonatan Jose Martinez, Pennsylvania; Julian  Castro, Illinois; Julie Lee Karvelis, Mississippi; Keith Hawkins,  Arkansas; Lee Patrick David, West Virginia; Manyari Smith, Illinois;  Mario Turner, Illinois; Marquise Jones, Louisiana; Nazeer Defares,  California; Nicolette Sheridan Law, Pennsylvania; Officer Dominic Jared  Winum, Virginia; Peter Vanvallis, Montana; Qualil Terrion Young, Texas;  Raymond William Nieman, Kansas; Reginald Copning, Louisiana; Reginald  James, California; Robert Bigger, Illinois.  [[Page S1753]]    I am sure some cynical viewer tonight may listen to a name they  recognize on this list and say: Oh, well, wait a second. I know that  guy. He had a criminal record. That individual was involved with some  bad people.   There is never a justification for a gun homicide. No matter whether  the individuals on these lists were perfect angels or individuals who  had made mistakes, none of them deserved to die in an episode of  vigilante or random justice. So to answer a hypothetical question, I  haven't vetted the names that I am reading because not a single person  on this list deserved to go in the way that they did.   I remember talking to a woman who has become a friend in Hartford,  CT. She lost her son just about a month before Sandy Hook. She  remembers when Sandy Hook happened that she latched onto the number of  children who were killed. Twenty kids were killed that day in Sandy  Hook. I asked Senator Bennet were there survivors from the shooting in  the supermarket in Boulder, and he said he had to check, and I will  check as well, but he wasn't sure that there were individuals who were  seriously injured. If that is the case, there are parallels to Sandy  Hook.   The weapons that are being used in these crimes are so lethal, so  powerful that, increasingly, it is hard to survive wounds when a bullet  enters your body at the speed that bullets are traveling when they come  from an AR-15 or AR-15-style weapon as was used in Sandy Hook.   In Sandy Hook, 20 kids were shot. All 20 of them died. The number 20  wa meaningful to my friend because her son was 20 years old when he was  killed on October 20 of 2012, the year of Sandy Hook. He was killed by  a 20-year-old, and he was the 20th victim of gun violence that year in  Hartford, CT.    She told this story about what her life was like after her son was  killed, after Shane was killed. She said that first she just didn't  want to leave the house ever. She didn't want to see anybody. She would  always walk down the street to the corner bodega to pick up groceries.  I think it was only a block or so away. She came to driving there so  there was no chance that she would have to meet people she knew along  the way. Her life became fundamentally different. Her life ended, as  she described it, in so many ways when her only son disappeared from  the Earth.   She talked about this strange habit that came to dominate some of her  evenings. She would get up in the middle of the night and she would get  in her car and she would drive to the site where Shane was shot. Shane  was shot about two blocks from my house where I live in Hartford, CT. I  drive by the site of Shane's shooting almost every day when I am going  back to our home. She would drive to that site. She would stop her car,  and she would turn on her high beams as if she were waiting for Shane  to show up, as if she were waiting for him to come back. She knew he  never was, but this became a habit.   It just speaks to this immense, incalculable trauma that families go  through when they lose a loved one, a trauma that you can't truly  understand.   In Sandy Hook, one mother adopted another curious but understandable  habit in the years after Sandy Hook. She would, during an afternoon on  a Saturday or a Sunday, convince herself that her son who had been  killed in Sandy Hook was at a friend's house. She would sort of create  this fantasy, this fiction in her mind. She would find it a little bit  easier to go about cleaning up the house or doing laundry or playing  with her other children if, in her mind, she could pretend just for a  half hour or an hour that her son was safe at a friend's house. She was  successful in contorting her mind to give her that space for that short  period of time. It is what she needed to do.   It is something that you never ever want to have to contemplate,  creating these fictions in your minds to allow you to survive just for  an hour at a time, shining bright lights on an empty space near  downtown Hartford, thinking maybe that your son will show up. These are  contortions of action and thinking that nobody should have to deal  with.

I apologize if I am mispronouncing some of these names. I am seeing  many of them for the first time. But it is important for us to read  these names into the Record so that at least they live in that space  because the numbers aren't moving our colleagues to action.   So far this year, just 2021, there have been 9,649 gun-related  deaths. These include homicides and murders, accidental shootings, and  suicides. Some people take issue with the fact that when we talk about  the gun violence epidemic, that we are including suicides in these  numbers. There have been thousands of suicides in the United States  this year, but it is important that we talk about these deaths  together.   Again, this evening is not going to be a time to go deep into the  question of policy change, but when you do start to explore  interventions and causes, you will find that many of the same causes  for homicides cause suicides as well.   For instance, there is a very clear correlation between poverty and  gun homicide. There is a very clear correlation between poverty and  your risk of suicide. There is a clear correlation between the ease of  access to a firearm and homicide as there is to suicide. In States that  have universal background checks, there are generally lower rates of  homicide and there are generally lower rates of suicide as well. We  talk about suicides together.   People are paying attention today to this epidemic because of what  has happened in Atlanta and what has happened in Colorado. I understand  why we pay more attention to mass shootings. There is something unique  and frightening about large-scale, indiscriminate slaughter.   But mass shootings are just not those incidences where 10 people die;  there are mass shootings where 3 or 4 people are shot. That is still a  significant crime. So far, this year, there have been 104 of those.  There have been 104 mass shootings this year. You didn't know that,  right? You thought there was just Atlanta and Boulder. No, not true.  There have been 104 mass shootings.   I believe most times mass shootings are defined as when four or more  people are shot at the same time, not necessarily killed but shot.  There have been 104 mass shootings this year and 191 deaths and  injuries of children aged 11 and younger. Think about that. In this  year alone, almost 200 kids, aged 11 and younger, have been killed and  128 deaths and injuries of teenagers, aged 12 to 17.   In May 2020--think about this--there were 61 mass shootings. Now, in  May 2020, we were emotionally focused on the pandemic, and we were  focused on trying to get people well. The country was not talking about  gun violence in the way it normally would if there were 61 mass  shooting in 1 month. That is the highest monthly total ever tallied by  the Gun Violence Archive, which is a nonprofit research group where a  lot of our data and names come from. They began tracking data in 2013.  Since they have been tracking the data, May 2020 was the highest number  of mass shootings, but you didn't hear about it because most of those  mass shootings were of 4 or 5 or 6 people, not of 20 or 30 or 40, and,  honestly, many of those mass shootings were likely people of color,  which don't get as much attention either.

[[Page S1754]]    I am not even close to the 9,649 gun-related deaths in 2021 alone.   I am glad to be joined on the floor by my colleague Senator  Klobuchar, to whom I will yield in a moment. I want to thank her for  being a real steadfast partner in these efforts and, in particular, on  focusing, as she has, on the crime of domestic violence.   Senator Klobuchar, earlier this evening, I was describing a murder in  New Haven, CT, that happened on the same day as Colorado's, in which a  young woman was sitting in a car with her boyfriend and with her 1- year-old in the backseat. They were in an argument, and she was trying  to leave him, and she shot him while in the car with the child in the  backseat. I was talking about how little attention that got in  Connecticut, never mind in the country, in how we pay attention to  these mass shootings--and for good reason--and how every one of these  individuals has a story attached to them. She was someone her friends  relied on for counsel and for moral support, and it is how that death  initiates so many other traumas.   I was honored to be able to read her name into the Record tonight.  She is one of many who will now find their names in the Congressional  Record so that, at the very least, the Record of our proceedings will  remember her life and think about what could have been had we not been  so cavalier with her life and her safety through our inaction.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, Marcia Reitman Currie from New York;  Mitchell Wright, Jr., from Missouri; Nicholas Tarpley from  Pennsylvania; Reuben Lewis III from California; Rhyce Wingate-Bey,  Maryland; Robert Crochiere, Massachusetts; Samuel Lamont Smith- Williams, Tennessee; Spencer Wilcox, Oregon; Anthony Castillo, New  York--we didn't come close to finishing this list tonight. We didn't  make a dent in the list of those names of the people who have died from  gun violence in 2021 alone, a year in which almost 10,000 people have  died in less than 3 months in suicides and homicides and accidental  shootings.   It is a choice. None of this is inevitable. Almost all of it is  preventable. It only happens here in the United States of America  because other countries make different choices.   Congress goes the next 2 weeks on a district work period. We wanted  to come to the floor tonight to make clear that we are not going to  forget those who have died through the inaction of this body, their  national leaders; that we are going to renew our commitment to be  better and to change and to begin that process in the wake of the  shootings in Boulder and Atlanta by making sure that everybody hears  the names of those who have died.   I yield to Senator Blumenthal to wrap up for the evening.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading, and in  order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1651, which was received  from the House and is at the desk.    I further ask that the Durbin amendment at the desk be  considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read  three times and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Finally, I would ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, March 25; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon conclusion of morning  business, the Senate resume the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 11,  H.R. 1799, as provided under the previous order; finally, that the  votes scheduled for 11 a.m. begin at 10:45 a.m.    For the information of Senators, we expect to have four  rollcall votes beginning at 10:45 a.m. tomorrow. Additional rollcall  votes are expected during Thursday's session.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order following the remarks of Senators Sullivan and  Sasse.
