 Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on the impact of the  shutdown on Pennsylvania's Sixth District.   My office has heard from small businesses that can't pull permits,  veterans receiving food assistance who worry, and Federal workers about  paying their bills.   Agriculture is a vital part of the economy of my district, and the  shutdown is having an impact there already as well. The last Congress  passed a bipartisan farm bill, but the shutdown has prevented its  implementation. The USDA farm loan program, a program providing  millions of dollars to the Pennsylvania farmworkers, is no longer in  effect.   My district is the mushroom capital of the world, and, yesterday, I  heard from the mushroom growers that the lack of EPA inspections of  drainage ditches and other water runoff is impacting the development of  mushroom houses and the expansion of their businesses.   We cannot afford 1 day more, 1 week more, or 1 month more of this  shutdown. We cannot ignore the impact it is having on so many  Americans, including farmers, ranchers, and growers in Pennsylvania's  Sixth.   The House has passed legislation to open our government, and I urge  the Senate to do the people's work and to pass the bill as well.                            ____________________
