 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Illinois?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Illinois?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Climate  Solutions Caucus to speak on the issue of climate change. The caucus is  a bipartisan group of members committed to implementing economically  viable options to reduce climate risk.   The caucus has a ``Noah's Ark'' membership rule. Members can only  join in pairs, one from each party. Under the leadership of co-chairs  Mr. Curbelo and Mr. Deutch, the caucus is helping to break the partisan  gridlock on this issue and show that promoting climate solutions can be  truly bipartisan.   The formation and rapid growth of the Climate Solutions Caucus  represents a recognition of both the challenges and opportunities and  has demonstrated that there is bipartisan will to take action.   In recognition of the fact that 60 Members of Congress have come  together to fight climate change in a bipartisan fashion, I organized  this time for my colleagues to join me on the floor to let the American  people know what we, as their elected leaders, are doing to address  climate change.   We know, from scientific evidence, that our climate is changing. The  global average temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees  Fahrenheit over the last 100 years. Sea levels are rising, the ocean is  becoming more acidic, precipitation patterns are changing, and heat  waves are becoming more frequent and longer in duration.   Each of these changes produces a cascade of effects that impact our  lives and livelihoods, including flooding, changes in crop yields,  power shortages, declines in fisheries, and increases in cardiovascular  disease.   Recent events in our own country, such as devastating hurricanes in  the Southeast and wildfires in the West have brought this issue to the  forefront of everyone's minds. Now climate  [[Page H8375]]  change can't be directly blamed for all these problems, but the  evidence strongly suggests that it contributes to each of them, and  there are things that we can do to limit its effects.   Climate change also has a significant impact on public health. A  groundbreaking study published just this week in a medical journal, The  Lancet, unequivocally showed that climate change is a serious public  health threat. The study involved 24 institutions from around the world  and included staggering statistics, such as the fact that air pollution  caused 1.9 million premature deaths in Asia in 2015, and that the range  of common disease-transmitting mosquitoes increased 9.5 percent since  1950.   We know that high temperatures exasperate health problems and that  burning fossil fuels creates pollution that causes cardiovascular  disease. The National Academies estimate that air pollution causes  around $120 billion per year in health-related damages, including  healthcare costs, missed days of work and school, and premature death.   We also know that changing climate has altered the range, in some  cases accelerated the spread of vector-borne diseases likes Zika and  the West Nile virus. Responsibly transitioning to a clean energy  economy will not only reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that  contribute to climate change, but it will also reduce air pollution and  help all Americans breathe easier.   What I want to talk about for a few minutes, before I turn to some of  my colleagues, is a very common misperception about the relationship  between implementing climate solutions and growing jobs.   Some people think that this is a zero-sum game. That is, they think  if you have more of one, you get less of the other. But that is simply  not true.   Implementing climate solutions can grow jobs, especially new high- paying jobs. The U.S. needs to take advantage of these economic  opportunities. Regardless of what we do here in the U.S., the rest of  the world has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and  reaching the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement, as have many  cities, States, and companies here at home.   To achieve that goal, significant technological development and  innovation will be needed, as well as infrastructure, markets, and  distribution channels to get that technology to the people and places  that need it.   The national economies that produce this clean energy technology will  benefit greatly. The U.S. still leads the world in technology and  innovation. Countries around the world try to recreate the innovation  ethos that exists in Silicon Valley and in other places across our  Nation.   The United States also has the workers who are needed to build these  innovations. So we have what it takes, and if we seize the opportunity  to invest in clean and climate-resilient technologies, then our economy  and the American people will benefit as the world adapts to climate  change and America grows good-paying jobs all across our Nation.   But if we let this opportunity pass us by, then profits and jobs will  instead flow to foreign countries that develop the technologies the  world needs, and American cities and States will be forced to buy  foreign products as they upgrade to climate-resilient infrastructure.                                time  2000    That is why I will soon be introducing a bill called Challenges and  Prizes for Climate Act. This bill will establish five or more prize  challenges overseen by the Department of Energy to harness the  ingenuity of the research community in the private sector to solve big,  complex climate problems.   Challenges have been used in the past by a wide range of  organizations, including the XPRIZE, who used the challenge to jump- start the commercial space transportation industry. This industry is  now flourishing.   I was just recently at SpaceX in California and saw their impressive  manufacturing facility they have there. The U.S. is now relying on  SpaceX in order to bring supplies up to the International Space Station  and their plans to soon be flying astronauts. This commercial space  transportation industry began with those who reached to try to meet  this challenge and get the XPRIZE.   The Federal Trade Commission also used the prize challenge to help  bring a robocall blocking service to the market, something that we can  all very much appreciate. That is why I am going this direction.   My bill will create challenges that fall under five themes: carbon  capture and reuse, energy efficiency, energy storage, climate  adaptation and resiliency, and data analytics for better climate  predictions.   Using authority from the America COMPETES Act, the Department of  Energy will convene working groups from across agencies, universities,  nonprofits and the private sector to help plan the challenges, and even  to contribute to the prizes.   The goal of the challenge is not just to reward the winner of the  best solution, but also to bring visibility to the range of innovations  competing for the prize and to help society envision the future. This  bill will help us see what our clean energy future will look like, and  I urge all of my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin hearing from the bipartisan group of  climate leaders who have joined me here on the floor this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fitzpatrick), my Republican colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Fitzpatrick for his leadership  and jumping in, in his firm term here in the House leadership, on  coming to solutions on climate change.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney),  my colleague who I have been working with for a number of years here in  the House, a very dedicated Member, especially when it comes to issues  of science and climate change.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lipinski for his leadership on  this.   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a little bit about climate. We know that  climate is changing, and we have seen it.  [[Page H8376]]  In California, we had horrific wildfires that claimed 40 lives and  destroyed thousands of structures. We have seen hurricanes more  frequently, more devastating, and more powerful than ever before. So  the effects are there. We see it happening.   Now, the thing that we are faced with is that there is a significant  section of people that deny climate change. You can sort of see why  they are denying it. I mean, if something is in your interest, you are  going to be able to talk yourself into just about anything.   The big benefit of denying climate change is that we can continue to  use fossil fuels. If you are a company that uses fossil fuels or  produces fossil fuels, yeah, this is what you want. But there are costs  of denial, and the costs of denial are clear.   We are seeing weather. We just talked about that. We are seeing  health effects. We have seen that both in terms of elevated  temperatures, causing people to have heat problems. We are seeing  disease vectors moving to the temperate zones from the Equator. We are  also going to see significant infrastructure costs, like we see in  Puerto Rico now. These are real costs that we are going to pay for the  denial of climate change.    Now, what are the benefits of climate change?   Well, there are significant benefits, from my point of view.   First of all, we have been spending American taxpayer dollars to  develop technology to fight climate change, or to reduce carbon  emissions.   I will tell you a little story about my own career. I was working at  a company called U.S. Wind Power. With some amount of taxpayer dollars,  we developed the leading technology for wind energy. Of course, what  happened was that the funding stopped, tax credits ended, and that  technology that we developed with taxpayer dollars went to Europe. They  built thousands of windmills in Germany, and they made a lot of money  based on that technology that we developed and paid for right in the  United States of America.   We also know that renewable energy production creates more jobs than  fossil fuel production for the same amount of energy. We are talking  about a potential to create millions of jobs in this country. Not only  that, but renewable energy has a stable price market feature. Unlike  fossil fuels, which have highs and lows over a 10-year cycle, fossil  fuels are going to be nice and stable, will be predictable. And  businesses love predictability. So I think this is also another very  good argument.   Lastly, if we reduce fossil fuels and go to clean energy, we are  going to have cleaner air and cleaner water, a healthier environment,  and we can reach sustainability. I think the benefits are pretty clear.   So where are we now?   Well, there are still significant resources out there determined to  muddy the waters and confuse people about climate change. I have three  publications here I want to illustrate. One is called ``Clexit for a  Brighter Future.'' Now, the point of this is that we need to exit the  Paris and United States climate treaties because fossil fuels are what  we need to power the future.   Another one is called ``The Mad, Mad, Mad World of Climatism.'' This  one, if you look it up, is biased, and it seems to be paid for by oil  interests.   The last one I want to show is a respected magazine that is called  National Geographic. And the cover page shows ``The War on Science.''   So I think we have a pretty good case to make for moving forward with  action on climate change.   There will be significant costs if we don't. Renewable energy is more  than cost competitive these days. As I mentioned, I worked in the wind  energy business. We see wind and solar being more cost competitive-- more than cost competitive, really--with coal and oil for energy  production.   So we have the technology, we have the means, and we have the desire  to do this, yet we are still hung up here in Washington in terms of  following through with government support that is needed with the right  sort of policies that will encourage us to reduce fossil fuel  reduction.   Now, one of the great bright spots we see--as Mr. Lipinski, my friend  from Illinois, pointed out--is that there is a bipartisan Climate  Solutions Caucus that has been formed over the last two terms. In order  to join, you have to have a Member of the other party. If I am a  Democrat, I have a Member of the Republican Party join.   What we are doing in that caucus is creating legislation that will  help reduce carbon emissions in an economic and prosperous way. I think  good things have a potential to happen. I encourage the caucus to  continue, and I hope it continues to grow.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McNerney for all the work that  he does on this issue and many other issues here in the House.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to go back to the other side of the aisle. I  yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Faso).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McNerney for all the work that  he does on this issue and many other issues here in the House.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to go back to the other side of the aisle. I  yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Faso).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Faso for his work,  understanding that we are only going to make progress on this through  bipartisan action. I am very happy to join working with him on the  Climate Solutions Caucus to bring that action forward.   Mr. Speaker, my next speaker is a woman who I work with on the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee, who has done some fantastic  work on that committee, especially when it comes to the issue of  climate change and dealing with climate change.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).                                time  2015     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Bonamici for speaking tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman who really deserves a  tremendous amount of credit for all of us being here tonight. He is the  co-chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Deutch for his leadership of  the Climate Solutions Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Budd). The gentleman from Illinois has  25 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield to my colleague, the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield to my colleague, the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for all of his work  on this and other issues.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Carbajal), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Carbajal for his work. That  was a great lead-in to our next speaker. We just had, a couple of  speakers ago, the Democratic co-chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus.  Our next speaker is the Republican co-chair. I give him a lot of credit  and I thank him for the work that he has done in putting this caucus  together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Curbelo for his leadership and  for pointing out some of the victories that we already have had here on  this House floor, the Climate Solutions Caucus. That is just the  beginning. There will be plenty more to come as we grow this caucus and  do the work that we are here to do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta),  a freshman Member who is already making a big splash here getting a lot  done in Washington, working especially on a bipartisan basis on a lot  of these issues, getting some good things done.     Mr. Speaker, at this time, I just want to thank all my  colleagues for their leadership on this issue. The time to take action  on climate is now. We can't leave this problem to future generations to  solve for us. As we heard this evening, there is no shortage of good  ideas for how to do so.  [[Page H8381]]    I want to close by reading the mission statement of the Climate  Solutions Caucus, which reminds us of the many reasons why our  bipartisan group has come together to take action:   ``The members of the Climate Solutions Caucus acknowledge the fact  that, if left unaddressed, the consequences of a changing climate have  the potential to adversely affect the health of all Americans and the  strength of our economy, consequently imposing substantial costs on  both State and Federal budgets.   ``By seeking to reduce climate risk, we will, in turn, ensure the  protection of our economy, infrastructure, and public safety, all while  attaining energy independence from the world's most volatile regions.  Therefore, it is our goal to take a market-based approach to  substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in  order to leave a better planet and stronger economy for future  generations.''   Mr. Speaker, this is something that all Americans can endorse and  support. It is a better world and a better country.   So I thank, again, all my colleagues for joining me here tonight, and  for their work, all of the 60 members--30 Democrats, 30 Republicans-- for their work on the Climate Solutions Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
