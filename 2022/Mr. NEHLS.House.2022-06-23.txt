 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a true musical  prodigy with the kind of gift that many of us may only come across once  in a lifetime, my constituent Tayte Choudhury.   At only 17 years old, Tayte is internationally recognized for his  outstanding ability in piano. He is a first-place winner of the  American Protege award and is performing a winning piece at the world- renowned Carnegie Hall in New York City on June 26.   Despite a physical disability that left him 70 percent deaf in both  ears, Tayte has achieved great success in both music and scholastics. I  was sent a video of Tayte playing this week and was completely blown  away to be hearing and seeing such talent that can only be handed down  by God himself.   But the thing about talent like that is that it is meaningless  without hard work, sacrifice, resilience, and an entire village to get  you where you need to go.   From myself and all of Texas 22, we are extremely proud of you,  Tayte, and can't way to see how high you fly.                            ____________________
