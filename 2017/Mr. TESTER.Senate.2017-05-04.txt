 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes, and  it will probably be less than that.    Mr. President, I would like to thank the body for this  bill.   This is an omnibus, and I am going to vote for it. There are some  things that are disturbing about it--there is no doubt about that--not  to mention the fact that Congress took 7 months to take care of this  plan for the long term, which created uncertainty out there on the  ground. There were 7 months when Congress sat on their hands, which  left towns, hospitals, airports, and our citizenry in the lurch.   But it does do some good things, and I think it does reflect the  values of rural America, which I think is really important. I think it  is a responsible budget for rural America in States like Montana.   One of the things it does that I think is entirely appropriate is  that it pushes the Education Department to reconsider the Upward Bound  grant applications that were denied because of ridiculous--and I do  mean ridiculous--format requirements, which will allow first-generation  college kids to be able to go to college.   What the Department of Education did with the Upward Bound Program is  the worst of the bureaucracy that government can allow. This bill helps  fix that. It gives the Department of Education a pair of glasses so  they can apply a little common sense to their rules.    It also does some good things for our national parks, it does some  good things for our bases, and it does some good things to help our  natural resources. But since I am ranking member on the Appropriations  Subcommittee on Homeland Security, I can tell you that overall, I think  it really fits the needs of our homeland security, whether it is border  security or cyber security. I think it is a responsible bill to help  invest in our  [[Page S2761]]  economy moving forward while keeping this country secure.   With that, I would encourage a ``yes'' vote on this bill. I would  just ask that next time around, which is going to start immediately, we  let the subcommittees on appropriations do their work and bring these  subcommittee bills to the floor.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank the majority leader.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to remember the life of a  journalist, a husband, a father, a community leader, a guy by the name  of Don Dunwell. Dunwell was known for his thoughtful interviewing  style, creative storytelling, his ability to connect with the thousands  of viewers who entrusted him to deliver the news to them.   It was common to find Don teaching and mentoring young reporters  about the ins and outs of journalism. He believed fiercely in the free  press and strong ethics that were required to be a trusted source of  information. He never took his platform for granted, and he used it to  make Montana and this Nation a better place.   Outside the newsroom, he was a proud father to John, working hard  each day to ensure that his son had every opportunity possible. Don was  immensely proud of his wife Mary Ann who charted her own path as a  public servant.   Today, we remember the life and the legacy of Don Dunwell and aim to  follow in his ever-fervent footsteps. Don was 82 when he passed. He was  bitten by a bug that made him look much younger than that, but he was a  fine man and a good friend.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
