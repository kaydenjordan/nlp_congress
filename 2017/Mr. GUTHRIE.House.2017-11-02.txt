 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors'  Access to Medicare Act of 2017.   The Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, was created in the  Affordable Care Act to reduce per capita rate of growth in Medicare  spending. If a spending target is exceeded, cuts must be made, and the  HHS Secretary is directed to implement the proposals made by this 15- person board automatically unless Congress affirmatively acts to alter  the proposals or to discontinue automatic implementation of the  proposals. This board has not yet been formed, but the statute requires  the HHS Secretary to come up with the required reductions instead.   Medicare is crucial for our Nation's seniors to see their doctors,  and the program's viability must be protected. There is no question  that Medicare must be modernized in order to continue for future  generations, but IPAB is not the right approach, and a bipartisan group  of my colleagues agree that IPAB is not the answer to fixing Medicare's  shortfalls.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee  and my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one, this IPAB effort is bipartisan. We have even heard  on the floor both sides of the aisle support passage of the bill. It  has been bipartisan.    First, a couple of things. On the value-based payments--which I think  is the direction we need to go to rein in the costs and make sure we  have sustainable programs, but the IPAB's annual short-term focus  savings provision would affect Medicare and the wider health system in  unpredictable ways with potentially many negative unintended  consequences by doubling down on the traditional practice of squeezing  payment rates in order to slow spending with no meaningful eye to how  these changes impact long-term incentives--the IPAB could work at cross  purposes to broaden reform that would base Medicare payments on quality  and value.   On the offset, we did offset CHIP and the community health centers.  We know that money is going to be spent. We know that when we authorize  it, it is going to be spent. We believe it is going to be spent wisely.  That is why we are moving forward with these bills.   The IPAB has not been constituted, and repealing it should not have  to be offset since it has not spent any money nor been charged yet with  finding any savings. The IPAB trigger has never been hit. The CBO  estimates that the IPAB would be triggered in 2023, 2025, and 2027. But  by their own admission, and I quote from the report, ``Given the  uncertainty that surrounds these projections, it is possible such  authority would be invoked in other years,'' or we could also assume  possibly never at all.   The CBO estimate also has to assume the level of cuts required by the  amount Medicare is spending that exceeds the trigger. The CBO also then  has to speculate on how reductions made in any one year would impact  the trigger in future years, further laying assumption upon guesswork.  As the CBO notes in their estimate, the estimate represents a broad  range of possible effects.   The CBO admits they do not know if the IPAB will be triggered or what  policies they might pursue if activated. Some of their assumptions are  one-sided bets that may or may not achieve savings, and the CBO must  further speculate on the probabilities associated with such variations.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I believe the IPAB will not be effective  providing real solutions for Medicare solvency. It contributes  disproportionately little to the projected cost savings needed in  Medicare, but it has the potential to hurt seniors' access to care.  Fundamentally, I believe it is a constitutional affront to the  legislative branch.                                time  1645    The IPAB decisions don't come to Congress to be approved or  disapproved. We can undo the IPAB decisions if we have dollar-for- dollar replacement, but that could even be blocked by a minority vote  in the Senate.   So I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 849, to repeal the  Independent Payment Advisory Board, and I hope there will continue to  be bipartisan support for this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
