 Fight. This is going to be a fight.         We're going to fight like hell.        Vice President BIDEN. Fight like hell.         This is going to be a fight.         To ban former President Trump from running       again.         Mr. President.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Casey  and Brown, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. This is a question from Senator Klobuchar,  Senator Casey, and Senator Brown to the House managers.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         In presenting your case, you relied on past precedents from       impeachment trials, such as William Belknap's impeachment.       After what you have presented in the course of this trial, if       we do not convict former President Trump, what message will       we be sending to future Presidents and Congresses?    Ms. Manager PLASKETT. As we have shown, President Trump engaged in a  course of conduct that incited an armed attack on the Capitol. He did  so while seeking to overturn the results of the election and thwart the  transfer of power. And when the attack began, he further incited  violence aimed to his own Vice President, even demonstrating his state  of mind by failing to defend us and the law enforcement officials who  protect us.   The consequences of his conduct were devastating on every level.  Police officers were left overwhelmed, unprotected. Congress had to be  evacuated; our staff barricaded in this building, calling their  families to say goodbye. Some of us, like Mr. Raskin, had children  here.   And these people in this building, some of whom were on the FBI's  watch list, took photos, stole laptops, destroyed precious statues,  including one of John Lewis, desecrated the statue of a recently  deceased Member of Congress who stood for nonviolence.   This was devastating. And the world watched us, and the world is  still watching us to see what we will do this day and will know what we  did this day 100 years from now.   Those are the immediate consequences, and our actions will  reverberate as to what are the future consequences. The extremists who  attacked the Capitol at the President's provocation will be emboldened.  All our intelligence agencies have confirmed this; it is not House  managers saying that. They are quite literally standing by and standing  ready. Donald Trump told them This is only the beginning. They are  waiting and watching to see if Donald Trump is right that everyone said  this was totally appropriate.    Let me also bring something else up. I will briefly say that defense  counsel put a lot of videos out in their defense, playing clip after  clip of Black women talking about fighting for a cause or an issue or a  policy. It was not lost on me, as so many of them were people of color  and women and Black women, Black women like myself, who are sick and  tired of being sick and tired for our children--your children, our  children.   This summer, things happened that were violent, but there were also  things that gave some of us Black women great comfort: seeing Amish  people from Pennsylvania standing up with us, Members of Congress  fighting up with us. And so I thought we were past that. I think maybe  we are not.   There are longstanding consequences, decisions like this that will  define who we are as a people, who America is. We have in this room  made monumental decisions. You all have made monumental decisions. We  have declared wars, passed civil rights acts, ensured that no one in  this country is a slave. Every American has the right to vote, unless  you live in a territory. At this time, some of these decisions are even  controversial, but history has shown that they define us as a country  and as a people. Today is one of those moments, and history will wait  for our decision.
