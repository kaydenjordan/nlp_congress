 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader of the schedule for the week to come.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy).   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.   First of all, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that the majority leader and  I, as well as his predecessor, Mr. Cantor, have worked together on what  we call a Hackathon, which is a meeting annually of individuals  involved in the high-tech community in how better to communicate, how  better to process information, how better to make transparent the work  of this body and make the actions of this body accessible to the  general public as they happen.   I want to thank the majority leader for continuing to cosponsor this  effort with me and to be a leader on this effort. We just had the  President sign--I think yesterday, maybe the day before--a piece of  legislation, which will try to make the government more facile in  bringing its technology up to date so that it can operate more  efficiently and more effectively.   So I thank the majority leader for working together in a positive way  to make this institution work better and to make it more accessible and  better known to the American people. I thank him also for the schedule  that he has put forward.   Mr. Speaker, the majority leader mentioned a number of things that  the tax bill that is going to be coming before us will do. I don't  believe that the conference report is available for review at this  point in time.   Can the majority leader perhaps enlighten me as to whether or not the  conference report is available now to be reviewed? Or, if not, when it  will be available?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. It is my understanding  that that will be on the floor as early as Tuesday of next week. Is  that accurate?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I would simply observe that what the majority  leader did not mention--again, I have not seen the conference report,  so this is not based upon a review of the conference report, but this  is based upon the Senate bill and the House bills that were passed by  both bodies--was that it will increase the debt of our country by some  $1.5 trillion and a minimum of $1 trillion. It will raise taxes on some  78 million Americans between $50,000 of income and $150,000 of income.   I am assuming that the elimination of the mandate is still in the  conference report. I am not sure, but the information I have is that it  is still in the report. Mr. Speaker, that will cost 13 million people  to be uninsured as a result.   I have information, Mr. Speaker, that what the conference report does  is reduce taxes on some of the wealthiest people in America. I am not  sure how they offset that--maybe with a mandate, maybe with something  else--but 62 percent of the bill's resources go to the top 1 percent in  America.   Mr. Speaker, Speaker Ryan spoke on this floor about the average  family making $59,000 a year. He mentioned that that family will get,  under the House bill--again, I haven't seen the conference report-- $1,182 per year in a tax cut.   What the Speaker did not mention is that the family in the top 1  percent will get a tax cut of $1,198 per week. Per week, Mr. Speaker.  In other words, 52 times what the struggling American will get, what  the American who Speaker Ryan said may not be able to come up with $500  if they have a crisis with a refrigerator or their heating unit,  something of that nature, or their car breaks down will get.   Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the aisle do not believe that this  bill addresses relief for the struggling working men and women of this  country.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear, in all of the polling, that the average  working American shares that view. They believe correctly that this is  a tax cut for the rich and a few sprinkles to the middle class. I am  sure the leader will have something to say on that.   In addition, Mr. Speaker, it is ironic that what will happen in this  tax bill is we will phase out. We will--again, I have not seen the  conference report, so I don't know exactly whether that is true or not,  but in both the House and Senate bills, we phased out--we didn't phase  out, we proposed to be phased out. The benefits to those middle-income,  hardworking Americans will see their benefits phased out. That will not  be true of corporations. It will not be true of the wealthiest in our  country.   So it is troubling, Mr. Speaker, that a bill of this magnitude is  being rushed to judgment. In 1986, the gentleman, in making his  announcement, said we have been working on this for 31 years. Now, I  presume he was talking about from 1986 to 2017.   What he did not say, Mr. Speaker, is, in 1986, we had 30 days of  public hearings on a bill. Thirty days of public hearings. What he did  not say is that we had 450 witnesses during those public hearings  testifying about the taxes. What he did not say is that there were  nearly 4 months of hearings on the 1986 reform bill. And what he did  not say is that the Ways and Means Committee conducted 26 days of  markup.   This bill has received less than 7 days of markup in both bodies and  in the conference. This is being rushed to judgment. The American  people, by substantial numbers, believe this bill is not good for them.   Now, Mr. Collins said that he talked to a donor and the donor said:  Don't call me again if you don't pass this tax bill.   I get that. I don't know who the donor was and I don't know how rich  the donor was, but obviously the donor thought that he had a real stake  or she had a real stake in this tax bill.   We regret that we are not doing as we did in 1986, because what the  majority leader did not mention either was that the 1986 bill was a  bipartisan bill with President Reagan and Speaker O'Neill supporting  it, and with Chairman Rostenkowski, a Democratic chair of the House  Ways and Means Committee; and a Republican chair of the Senate Finance  Committee, Bob Packwood from Oregon, supporting the bill. It was a  bipartisan bill. And what the majority leader did not mention is the  1986 bill did not add a single cent to the deficit. It was paid for.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a much lesser product than it could have  been. We on this side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, think we need tax  reform. We are prepared to support tax reform. We believe we need to  bring down the corporate rate. We believe we need to make sure that  small businesses can prosper and grow into large businesses.   What we don't believe in, Mr. Speaker, is simply having a bill that  advantages the best-off in our country and says that the advantages we  give to the middle class will be phased out in a little bit, about 5  years.                                time  1145    So, Mr. Speaker, we will, according to the majority leader, consider  this bill next week. It will not be bipartisan, and that is a shame. It  will not be positive for the country because it will put us even more  deeply into debt, and the people who pay that bill, ultimately, will be  our children.   And on both sides of the aisle--we don't have a lot of Members on the  floor, but I say to every Member on the floor, every Member on this  floor, I am sure, at some point in time you have given a speech  somewhere that said: ``We care about the debt. We are going to bring  down the debt.'' This bill does not do it. This bill exacerbates the  debt.   Anybody who believes that this bill is going to pay for itself  through dynamic scoring and economic growth is kidding themselves. It  is a rationalization to vote for a bill for which the main imperative  is political, not policy, because my Republican colleagues, Mr.  Speaker, believe that, if they don't pass this bill, they will lose the  next election.   I have heard that argument over and over and over again. That is not  a reason to vote for this bill. It is a reason  [[Page H9920]]  to say: Let's go back to the table. Let's include Mr. Neal in the  consideration, the ranking member. Let's include Mr. Wyden, the ranking  member of the Senate Finance Committee. Let's include Mr. McCarthy and  me to try to see if we can reach a bipartisan, positive, constructive  piece of legislation which will, like the 1986 legislation, enjoy the  support of a wide range of the American people and their  Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, we had an election yesterday in Alabama. Mr. Jones won  that election. Mr. Strange, the incumbent Republican representing  Alabama right now, lost the primary. He has no mandate.   Why rush this bill through? This bill, if it were passed on December  31 of next year, would affect the 2018 taxes that would be filed in  April of 2019. The need to rush this bill, Mr. Speaker, seems to be  that, and the reason for having no hearings, the reason for having no  witnesses, is because this bill, on its merit, cannot sustain itself.   Now, let me read you a quote, Mr. Speaker: ``I think the message of  the moment is that the American people, all across the country, are  asking us, even in the most liberal State, Massachusetts, to stop this  healthcare bill. I think that means there will be no more healthcare  votes in the Senate prior to the swearing in of Scott Brown, whenever  that may be.''   That statement was made on January 20, 2010, by the present majority  leader who was then, of course, the minority leader. And his  proposition was: You ought to wait until Scott Brown is here so that  Massachusetts can have its vote counted. But hypocritically, he has  changed his tune today when Alabama, a very conservative State, the  opposite of Massachusetts, has voted to elect Doug Jones to the Senate.   I don't hear Mr. McConnell or anybody else saying: Let's wait for the  duly elected Member of the United States Senate from Alabama to be  seated so that he will have an opportunity to vote on this  extraordinarily consequential vote and, in my opinion, negative  consequences to our country.   Mr. Speaker, I am sure the majority leader might have some comments  he wants to make in response, and, therefore, I yield to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McCarthy).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. He  made a number of points.   First, generally, I have been here long enough to have heard the  debate for the 1981 bill, the so-called supply side, Jack Kemp. Vice  President Bush referred to it as ``voodoo economics.'' And point of  fact, as the gentleman knows, because I am sure he knows the record, we  increased the debt under Ronald Reagan 189 percent. Larger than any  other President with whom I have served over the last 37 years; 189  percent. Stockman said: We knew it wasn't going to balance the budget.  We just said that for political purposes. Stockman said that. He was  Director of the OMB under Ronald Reagan.   Then in 2001 and 2003, we had tax cuts. We heard the same arguments,  how it was going to grow robustly the economy. It brought in the  deepest recession anybody in this Chamber, other than perhaps Sam  Johnson, who I think is probably our oldest Member, because the rest of  us didn't experience the depression, it ushered in not the biggest  growth rate in America, but the least job-producing 8 years of any  American President whom I have served with, and the deepest recession  that anybody in this body has experienced, and a hemorrhaging of jobs.   In fact, the stock market, which the gentleman refers to, had a 25  percent decline in value over the 8 years of the Bush administration,  with two tax cuts where exactly the same argument for growth was made,  and it didn't happen.   On the other hand, I was here in 1993, when we raised taxes, not  much, but a little bit, particularly for infrastructure, and the  prediction, Mr. Leader, on your side of the aisle: we would tank as an  economy; we would have a terrible recession.   Exactly the opposite happened. You were dead, not you personally, but  those who made that representation were 180 degrees wrong.   First of all, we balanced the budget 4 years in a row. Nobody has  done that other than President Clinton. Now, you can say you were in  charge of the Congress, you were, and I would respond to you: Why  couldn't you do it under George Bush when you had everything? There is  no answer to that.   In terms of the experience that we have had when we had tax cuts, the  debt did, in fact, explode; 189 percent increase in the national debt.  That was approximately 2\1/2\ times the increase under Obama and the  increase under George Bush. But we continue to argue there is going to  be great growth. No reputable economist agrees with that proposition.  Well, you read them out to me. I will be glad to hear them.   The stock market increase under this President has gone up. It went  up 300 percent under Barack Obama. Three hundred percent. Three hundred  percent, from 6,500 to over 18,000.   He had the largest job production, and I told my friend, in 2016, as  opposed to 2017, hear, my friends, there were 279,000 more jobs created  in 2016, under Barack Obama, than have been created under this  President. Mr. Speaker, 279,000 more. Now, that is not a great deal,  but in terms of growth, there was more growth of jobs in 2016, when  Obama was President of the United States, than has occurred under  Donald Trump. Check the records. I am sure you will review and say:  Let's see if Hoyer is just giving us some malarkey.   The gentleman talks about this great tax benefit. What he didn't  mention, and what I was referring to, by the way, was when you were  giving the schedule, not in response to the question, but that aside,  doesn't mention the State and local taxes.   Now, I am not exactly sure what has happened to State and local  taxes, but in my State, it will have a very substantial negative  effect. Why? Because we have a significant income tax. Why? Because it  is a progressive tax, and it puts the burden on those who have more.   Now, you may disagree with that. Just have a flat tax no matter what  [[Page H9922]]  you have, and you pay the same thing. I am not sure exactly what you  have done.   The shutdown you talk about. You had 90 people vote against a CR that  you recommended they vote for in September, which was a clean CR. You  would not have passed that CR. You would have shut down government. You  are responsible for keeping government open, ``you'' being your party.  You are in the majority. The only reason that CR passed was because we  voted for it. You had 90 of your people vote against it; 90, who  apparently didn't want to pay the military, apparently didn't want to  protect them overseas. That proposition, like they say, won't hunt,  because the chairman of the Armed Services Committee voted against that  CR. Why? Because he thought it was harmful to the national security of  our country. Secretary Mattis believes the CR is damaging.    It is inappropriate, in my view, when we do something and say: We  don't like this bill, and the only party with whom I have served who  would consciously, purposely shut down the government, I tell my  friend, Mr. Speaker, is the Republican Party. They did it in 1995,  under Newt Gingrich, and they did it last year with Mr. Cruz coming  over here and saying: Shut down the government unless they repeal the  ACA. Shut it down, consciously.   We have never done that. Have we had to shut down because we couldn't  get agreement? We have done that for a few days. But for 16 days you  shut it down consciously. And guess what? When you voted to open up the  government, guess who voted against it? Mr. Mulvaney, the Director of  the OMB. He voted against opening up the government. I guess he was  against the Armed Forces. I guess he was against defending our country,  if that's your proposition.   CHIP. You are right. You waited. We didn't get an agreement. But we  waited long after September 30, when the gentleman says he is very  concerned about funding it. The authorization expired. Now, you passed,  ultimately, a bill that we didn't vote for. You passed it on your own.  If you really were that concerned, you would have passed it before the  authorization expired on September 30. We passed it some weeks later,  and we passed it with a piece of funding in there that is going to  undermine, for instance, just as one example, vaccinations for  children, because you funded it, in part, by reducing substantially the  Prevention Fund, which seeks to prevent illness.   On bipartisanship, very frankly, we had a 2-week CR, you are right, a  2-week CR. You got a 2-week CR. The only thing you have worked on, from  our perspective, is the tax bill, and you did not include us in those  discussions. You had closed hearings.   We had a conference hearing yesterday. Mr. Neal tried to move an  amendment out of order. It wasn't accepted. It was a done deal. Done  deal in secret.   I tell my friend, I reread a little bit of ``Young Guns'' last night.  It talked about transparency. It talked about openness. It talked about  doing things one at a time, not packaging a lot of bills.   The reason we all hate CRs is because nobody knows what is in a CR.  We lard it down, and this CR is larded down with numerous bills. We are  talking about the tax bill, but the CR that the gentleman talked about  is five or six major pieces of legislation put in one package. Take it  or leave it.   That is not the way to run this organization, and that is what you  guys said in ``Young Guns.'' And I agree with you, but it is not what  you have done. It is what you said, but it is not what you have done.   Let me just close on this. Frankly, I was going to talk about the CR,  but I am talking about it now.   We don't have a budget caps deal. Today is the 14th; so we are  essentially 17 days from the end of the year. We don't have a caps  deal. We don't have a disaster supplemental for Texas, Florida, Puerto  Rico, and the Virgin Islands that is proposed to be in this CR, as I  understand it, and the fires in California. The gentleman is absolutely  correct, and we are going to support helping the folks of California  who have been devastated by these fires. The gentleman is absolutely  correct.   We don't have anything on DREAMers. We think that is critically  important. I said to the majority leader 4 months ago that we felt this  was critically important and we needed to get this done. I think, as I  have said to the gentleman, we have over 300 votes on this floor for a  bill to get this done.   Alexander-Murray. I don't think, I don't know, I haven't seen the  conference report, but Alexander-Murray, which tries to stabilize the  availability of healthcare at a reasonable price to the American  people, I don't think that is in the tax bill, as I understand it.   VA Choice funding, I think, is in the CR. I haven't seen exactly what  it says.   Opioids funding. I have a crisis in my district. In every district in  America, opioids is a critical issue. There is no funding in the CR, as  I understand it, for that.   The fire grants program for our emergency responders, no money for  that.   Perkins loans, nothing for that. The debt limit is going to come  later.   National Flood Insurance Program, nothing for that, as I understand  it.   Medicare and other health extenders, 702 of FISA to keep America  secure and strong and safe. As I understand it, none of that is being  dealt with.   The reason we voted against the last CR is because we are tired of  kicking things down the road. We are tired of kicking the can down the  road. We want to get to an agreement on a bipartisan basis to pass  legislation that is positive for our country, and that is why we may  vote against this next CR, because we ought to stop just kicking the  can down the road. And we are going to kick the can, as I understand  it, down the road to some point in time to January 19, is the  discussion.   Mr. Leader, Mr. Speaker, we are prepared to sit down to try to reach  agreement on these issues that have got to be reached. If we don't  reach them, America will be less safe, less secure, less healthy as an  economy and less healthy, literally, in terms of making sure that the  healthcare available to America is on a stable path.   Mr. Speaker, I will yield to the majority leader and then make a few  comments, and then we will close. I yield to my friend.                                time  1215     Well, I keep pushing it for you.    ``Come back, Shane.'' Maybe many of you are not old enough  to remember that wonderful movie. Shane rode off and the little boy  intoned, ``Come back, Shane.''   I haven't gone anywhere. Democrats have no ability to shut down the  government on the floor of this House. Hear me: We don't have the votes  to shut down government and we don't want to shut down government.   Maybe the leader also wants those 90 of his--he is not our leader. He  is the leader of the majority party, and 90 of his people did not  follow him. I presume he must be much more concerned about that.   With all due respect, he is my friend, but not my leader. We voted to  give 90 days and nothing was accomplished in that 90 days other than  working on a tax bill that we think is a disaster for this country.  Nothing.   The gentleman talks about passing these appropriations bills. We knew  they wouldn't pass the Senate and we told him so. We said: Let's do it  on a bipartisan basis.   But, no. By the way, Mr. Speaker, it was the least regular order  prior to an omnibus at the end of a year in dealing with appropriations  bills that I have ever seen. They packaged, I think it was four or five  the first time--four, I think, and then the balance of eight.   We didn't consider them individually. We didn't have an opportunity  to consider them thoughtfully, no. It was one big package, for or  against. I said I read that book. It was anything but regular order.   By the way, Mr. Speaker, the majority party that passed them is the  majority in the United States Senate; and not a single one of those  bills, not a single one, has passed out of the Senate. Not a single one  has gone to the President of the United States. Not one. The  Republicans are in charge of the House and the Senate. Not a single  bill has gone to the President of the United States.   Harry Reid is no longer there just to beat on: Oh, it is Harry Reid.   Now, what it would have taken to pass some of those appropriations  bills in the Senate is some compromise, but that didn't happen. So  don't wring your hands about how bad it is that we haven't had  bipartisanship on the appropriations bills--we haven't--or  bipartisanship on the CR when you lose  [[Page H9924]]  90 of your people. Ninety Republicans voted against a simple CR. You  say simple CR, nothing to be partisan about, et cetera. Ninety of your  people voted ``no.''    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Let me reclaim my time just so the gentleman can further  explain.   Does that mean 90 of your people did not want to pay the bills of the  United States and default on our debt?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Reclaiming my time, let me say to the gentleman very  respectfully: Do not expect cooperation from our side if we don't get  cooperation from your side, if we don't get some inclusion in making  decisions.                                time  1230    We are, after all, 194 Members of this body. From time to time, you  and I do work together. When we work together, we get majorities and we  pass pieces of legislation.   You have not passed a single controversial fiscal bill on this floor  without our substantial help until last week. You got about 230 on that  last bill. But let me tell you, the reason we voted against it is  because we knew exactly what was going to happen: nothing. There would  be no agreement to CHIP; there is no agreement on CHIP. There would be  no agreement on FISA; there has been no agreement on FISA. There would  be no agreement on flood control; there has been no agreement on flood  control. So we knew that we were not going to get any bipartisan buy- in, so all we were doing is delaying the inevitable.   Let me tell you, when we did defeat the homeland security bill--you  remember that, I am sure; we did, and you were in the majority--you  came back to the floor and said that we are going to meet tomorrow. We  reached an agreement, and we passed it.   Very frankly, you have never heard us say that, as a policy, in order  to get the ACA repealed or Gingrich wanted to get some fiscal thing  done, that we would shut down the government. Three times you shut it  down in 1995 and 1996. Three times, intentionally. That was your  policy.   Yes, if you are going to take the government hostage and force us to  do something that we think is inimical to the best interests of this  country, yes, Mr. Leader, you will leave us with no other option: to  pretend that we are keeping government moving but not getting any  agreement.   I talked to you very sincerely 4 months ago about one of the things  that we wanted to get done before the end of this year is getting  DREAMers protected who are now vulnerable and very scared that they are  going to be sent back to someplace they do not know, have not lived in,  brought here as children through no fault of their own, gone to  elementary school, junior high school, high school, college, served in  the military, working at jobs, and vetted to make sure that they  haven't done anything wrong. They are afraid of being sent back home-- not back home. Excuse me. I say that. That is not their home. This is  their home.   Nothing has been done on that. I know you have a task force and  talked about it, but we haven't done anything. There is no reason why  we can't. I think we have 300 votes on this floor to get that done.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Reclaiming my time, I don't know who the gentleman is  relying on for that information, but I will tell you I have talked to  Mr. Pallone. That is not correct.   I don't know who you think directed him not to reach an agreement,  but I will tell you, after you made that assertion, I think last week  or the week before, I went to Mr. Pallone. I asked him that, and he  said absolutely not.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I reclaim my time for just a second, and then  I will yield back to the gentleman.   Is the gentleman proud that you control the House, you control the  Senate, and you haven't sent a single appropriations bill to the  President? Not a single one. Not one.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, what it would have meant,  you would have had to compromise. That is why the Senate has that 60- vote rule. I am not crazy about it myself, but that is why they have  the 60-vote rule. They think it is good because that is why they kept  it. They think it is good because it requires  [[Page H9925]]  compromise; it requires agreement; It requires moving ahead on a piece  of legislation.    I will tell you, I served on the Appropriations Committee for 23  years, and we reached agreement between Republicans and Democrats on  almost every bill. And when we had the bills, they weren't partisan  bills, and they got a lot of Republican votes, almost always, when we  were in charge--not all the time, almost always.   If you are a party of no compromise, then you can't move things in  the United States Senate. I get that. But that is the reason. That is  the reason, because you couldn't reach compromise.   Very frankly, a lot of the bills have come out of the committee. Do  you know why they came out of committee? Because they were bipartisan.  But they haven't been brought to the floor by Mr. McConnell, and they  haven't been sent to the President of the United States, so somewhat  crocodile tears.   Yes, you passed those 12 bills just like you can pass the CRs, on  your own, without any help from us. If the government shuts down, it is  because you can't get the majority of your party to pass bills.    You are in charge. There is no doubt when we were in  charge and you didn't support us, we passed every piece of legislation  we wanted to pass on this floor with 218 Democrats. We were united as a  party. Now, we lost some, but never enough to make it so that we didn't  get 218. You lost 90. You can say it was on the debt; you can say it  was on national security; you can say whatever you want on it; but you  brought a bill to the floor, and 90 of your people voted against it to  keep government open and to keep government operating.   Very frankly, we voted with you so that we could get some work done,  and we haven't gotten work done. That is what frustrates us. That is  what frustrates the American people.   I will tell my friend, at the end of the day, after this Congress is  gone, historians are not going to be kind, notwithstanding the fact you  say you passed so many bills. You passed so many bills on a partisan  basis, and you used, essentially, the 51 vote because you didn't want  to compromise. We get it. You don't want to compromise. You don't want  to work with us. You didn't have any hearing on this tax bill. We were  not included in any phase of the marking up and fashioning of this tax  bill.   Now, I am about ready to yield back the balance of my time. I am sure  that everybody who wants to give a 1-minute or a Special Order is very  happy to hear that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, in reclaiming my time, does the gentleman  remember President Trump saying that a good shutdown will be good for  government? Do you remember him saying that, when you tell me about how  he has been down here lobbying? He said: A ``good shutdown'' may be  good for government.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I would, again, reiterate: the majority party can do  whatever it wants on this floor. It could have kept government open. It  could have kept policies moving with its votes. Time after time after  time on critical issues confronting this country, they couldn't come up  with a majority.   As a matter of fact, on one occasion, Mr. McCarthy was the whip, Mr.  Cantor was the majority leader, and Mr. Boehner was the Speaker. They  offered a bill to keep government moving. They only got 84 of their  colleagues, approximately one-third of their colleagues on their side  of the aisle, to vote with them.   I don't want to hear about us shutting down government. We can't shut  down government. They are in charge. The majority has the votes. You  can do whatever you want. We get it. We may not like it any more than  you liked it, but we get it.   But we voted on the hope that we would get some work done. We haven't  moved anyplace except on the tax bill, which we think is bad for this  country, in the last 90 days since we passed--and we passed. The CR  would not have passed without us.   And, yes, we will not be held hostage. Yes, we will oppose what we  think is a very, very bad tax bill and we think is an effort to avoid  getting the work of this House done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    I thank the gentleman for yielding and for taking this  opportunity on the Special Order. I think, as an aside, I need to  apologize to him for making him wait so long for this Special Order.   I also want to tell the American people, Mr. Speaker, that the  gentleman who has taken this Special Order is probably the  constitutional expert not only in this body, but one of the  constitutional experts in our country. He is a great legislator  himself. Although he is new to this body, he is not new to being a  legislative leader at all. He has been a legislative leader in our  State for many years. He is a wonderful teacher and somebody who has  great political courage and is willing to stand and say that the  emperor has no clothes. He is willing to call attention to the fact  that our democracy is at risk, that our due process is at risk.   He used the phrase ``trumped up.'' What an interesting phrase that is  that we have used for many years. I don't know that it has had as much  relevance in years past as it now may have.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Raskin, for leading this Special  Order. Our system of government, as he has pointed out, is based on the  rule of law. We are a government of laws, not of men.   What that means is that it is not personalities, not dictators, not  kings that rule our land. It is the law, the law of our Constitution,  the law of our legislators, and the common law that we pursue as  interpreted by our court systems. Its foundation is the constitutional  principle that all are equal under the law. No one is exempt.   The appointment of a special prosecutor earlier this year to look  into the possibility of the administration or Trump campaign officials  colluding with a foreign adversary or obstructing justice falls into a  long tradition in our country of using independent counsel to  investigate those in the most senior offices of our government.   Our Founding Fathers would say that is a check and balance; that is a  protection against the usurpation of democracy.   The choice of former FBI Director Bob Mueller to be that independent  investigator was an extraordinarily wise one; a decision greeted with  support from across the political spectrum, precisely because Mr.  Mueller is so widely respected for his independence and his commitment  to the law above all else.   And, parenthetically, although it is not necessarily relevant, he is  a Republican. He is not, however, driven by the politics of left or  right or Republican or Democrat. He is a man of the law, a man who  seeks the truth, a man who has dedicated his career to assuring that we  remain a land of liberty under law.   We have already seen a demonstration of that commitment in the prompt  firing of a subordinate investigator for an act that was not illegal,  as the gentleman from Maryland, our constitutional scholar, has pointed  out, but, however, threatened to impugn the objectivity of the  investigation.   In other words, he removed somebody who he thought might undermine  the credibility of this investigation because he is so committed to  this investigation being objective and unquestionably fair. Mr. Mueller  has made it abundantly clear that he will not tolerate any hint of bias  in this investigation.   So far, it appears that his investigation is bearing fruit, having  uncovered serious crimes and secured three indictments as well as  guilty pleas from two key subjects. Guilty pleas.   This was not a question of: We had a trial and somebody convinced 12  people that he was guilty.   This was a case where the individual said: ``I am guilty. I did what  was alleged. I know that it is illegal, and I should bear the  consequences.''   That included, of course, the National Security Advisor--who was  National Security Advisor, I think, for 25 days, or close to that  number--Mr. Flynn.   As the investigation has advanced, Mr. Speaker, we have seen  troubling statements from the President and his advisers seeking to sow  uncertainty about the legitimacy of the special counsel's activities  and undermine confidence in him.   But it is not so much the confidence in him that is critical. It is  confidence in the law. It is confidence in the process. It is  confidence that, in fact, we are a nation of laws, and whether we are  President or peasant, we will be held accountable if, in fact, we break  the laws.   What is being done to undermine this process threatens the  independence of the investigation and those who are undertaking it. It  is dangerous to our democracy and to our freedom.   Now, in recent days, we have heard calls by the President and his  allies to launch a counterinvestigation of the special prosecutor's  investigation. Those of us who know history know that that is so often  the defense of those who seek authoritarian power, of those who believe  they are above the law, of those who believe they can intimidate others  so that they will never be held accountable for wrongdoing.   This preposterous suggestion has but one purpose: to cast a shadow of  doubt over the findings of Mr. Mueller's inquiry by attempting to frame  it in a partisan way.   In fact, Mr. Mueller was appointed by a Republican-appointed Deputy  Attorney General. It is tactics like this one that we see so often  overseas in countries ruled by dictators and those seeking to become  dictators. This willful effort to erode confidence in any institution  that must be seen as impartial is harmful because if nobody and nothing  is impartial, if everyone and everything is tainted by politics and  interest, then no one can possess the moral authority to hold  accountable one who wishes to be entirely unaccountable.   That, Mr. Speaker, is the reason I think that the President has also  attacked the fourth estate, the newspapers, the broadcasters, the  people whose duty it is to bring facts to the people so that they, the  people, can make a rational judgment in a democracy, for it is in their  hands that the power ultimately resides; and if you undermine those who  give them the facts, then you undermine their ability to make  decisions.    This ultimately is what the special prosecutor's work is all about:  accountability, ensuring that every person is held to the same high  standard of behavior under the laws of our Nation.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in both parties--this is not  about party. This is about country. This is about patriotism. This is  about the rule of law. If we lose that respect  [[Page H9933]]  for law, we will lose our country. It will be a different, lesser  country.   I urge my colleagues, from both parties, from every ideological  corner, let us not forget the most fundamental principle that binds us  together as Americans and as public servants: That all are created  equal; that all of us, all Americans, are equal under the law.   That doesn't mean we are the same, but it means, in the eyes of the  law, we are equal as we stand to be held accountable, or to be held  innocent, or not involved, or not owing somebody else for wrongdoing.  We need to uphold it by our words and by our deeds.   The special prosecutor's work must continue unimpeded, and it must  continue to be respected. Yesterday, in the Judiciary Committee, that  was not the case. To defend the indefensible undermines respect for  law.   I want to thank my friend again, Mr. Jamie Raskin, from Montgomery  County, Maryland, for this Special Order. As I said, he is a great  constitutional scholar and teacher, a great legislator. More  importantly than that, he is an individual who loves his country and,  throughout his life, has fought to make the country all that the  Founding Fathers meant it to be.   I thank him for coming to this floor and for his efforts to ensure  that Mr. Mueller's investigation can continue to be seen as impartial  and with its objective unquestioned, and that is accountability,  accountability and justice, and equal justice under the law. That is  our bedrock. That is our touchstone. That is our guiding star. That is  what Professor Raskin, Congressman Raskin, Citizen Raskin is talking  about today, and we all ought to thank him for that.
