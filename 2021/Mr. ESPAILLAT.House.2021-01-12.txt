 Mr. Speaker, we have all known it for a while now, but  this past week it has become undeniably clear: Donald J. Trump is  unfit.   To the Secretaries of Agriculture, Defense, Commerce, Education, and  Transportation: He is unfit.   To the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security,  Housing, Interior, and Labor: He is unfit.   To the Attorney General: He is unfit.   To the Vice President of the United States: He summons his goons.  They shut their hoods and came with their racist Confederate flag to  assassinate him, to assassinate the Vice President.   He is unfit. Invoke the 25th Amendment. If not, we will impeach him  tomorrow.
