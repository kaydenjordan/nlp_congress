 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, early yesterday morning, I returned from a  whirlwind trip to the Middle East as part of a bipartisan codel, or a  congressional delegation, to Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The trip  was a direct response to Hamas's savage attack on Israel. The codel,  led by my friend Senator Lindsey Graham, brought together 10 Senators  from both parties to show the United States' support for Israel and to  demonstrate U.S. commitment to protecting our now-threatened national  interests in the region.   Our message was united: The United States stands with Israel. Iran is  on notice, and it must stand down; and we need to get hostages freed  and Americans out of harm's way.   We are committed to seeing Hamas defeated so that a new chapter of  prosperity for Israel and its Arab neighbors can begin, of which  normalized relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia would be a  keystone.   Our engagements on the ground included frank and candid discussions  with heads of state, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and our U.S. Embassy  teams on the ground. Our day in Tel Aviv began with meeting the  families of hostages being held in Gaza, including Americans who shared  their painful stories. As a parent and grandparent, it is heartbreaking  to see and hear the grief of these family members.   Later that day, we met with Israeli defense officials for an update  on the war. We were shown video evidence of the unnerving atrocities  committed by Hamas terrorists--horrific images that I will not soon  forget. Our meetings made clear the absolute imperative to see Hamas  defeated.   Hamas's attacks have been likened to Israel's own September 11; but  Prime Minister Netanyahu made a point that is especially chilling for  Americans but that every critic of Israel must hear. He pointed out  that, on 9/11, our enemy was thousands of miles away. In Israel, their  enemy is only a kilometer away.   For more than 15 years, Israel has had to live every day with a  terrorist organization on its border whose sole mission in life is to  kill Jews and to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth; and during that  time, Hamas has loomed as a persistent threat to Israel, attacking,  kidnapping, and killing Israelis. But the barbarism and brutality that  Hamas displayed in its October 7 attacks took its evil to new heights,  and now Israel knows what it has to do: It has to wipe Hamas off the  face of the Earth.   For the Israelis, this is existential. Israel's cause is just, and  its resolve is firm, and it should have every peace-loving nation in  the world on its side. Now, how Israel goes about that mission matters,  and it needs to be done in a way that minimizes civilian casualties.   The Palestinians living in Gaza are also victims of Hamas's reign of  terror. Hamas has made it clear that the only value it places on the  lives of Palestinians is to use them as fodder to direct attention away  from its atrocities and to try and turn public sentiment, especially in  Western media and the Arab street, against Israel. Case in point:  Hamas's disproven claim that Israel struck a hospital, which sparked  protests and riots in a number of countries.   Israelis know that there are innocent Palestinians trapped in this  fight and that civilian casualties and a humanitarian crisis could  drive more Palestinians toward extremism. That is why Israel is taking  measures to protect innocents in Gaza, although its efforts are being  undermined by Hamas, which has discouraged Palestinians from complying  with Israel's evacuation order.   The United States and other peace-loving nations in the region and  beyond need to give Israel space to take the fight to and eradicate  Hamas, because if Hamas and its reign of terror are allowed to  continue, no nation in the region or beyond will be able to live in  peace and security. It really is that simple.   And one final but important point: Hamas might claim to represent  Palestinians, but its violent actions do nothing--nothing--to benefit  the Palestinian people. The only people who benefit from this brutal  bloodshed are the ayatollahs in Iran, whose goal is to bring chaos,  violence, and death to all who don't share their extreme and militant  religious ideology, which, I might add, includes wiping Israel off the  face of the Earth.   Look no further than Hamas if you want to see Iran's influence, as 90  percent of their military budget comes from Iran, or Hezbollah, the  terrorist organization on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, which  is also armed and financed by Iran. Then there are the Houthis in Yemen  who, in the aftermath of October 7, fired missiles and drones headed  for Israel--again, likely at the direction of Iran; the Shia militias,  who are attacking American soldiers in Iraq and Syria; the killing by  Russians of innocent civilians in Ukraine with drones supplied by Iran.  Through its proxies, Iran is literally getting away with murder.   To the Iranian regime, we say: We are on to you.   In addition to working with regional partners to get American  hostages and citizens out of Gaza, the Biden administration must  clearly articulate to the Iranians that, if they do not stand down or  if they green-light the escalation of this war, the United States and  our allies will be forced to respond forcefully. The movement of U.S.  firepower to the region should make that point very clear to Tehran.   The attacks on October 7 represent a kind of evil that the world  hasn't seen in generations, and it must be confronted and contained. If  it is not, we could see death and destruction on a scale akin to the  horrors of the last century. History is watching.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.
