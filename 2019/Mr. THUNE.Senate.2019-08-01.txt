The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Jane Tschetter  Lucas. This month, she is leaving government service after serving her  home State of South Dakota as a member of my staff for 10 years and,  most recently, serving in the executive branch for the last 2 years.   In 2007, Jane graduated from South Dakota State University, SDSU, in  her hometown of Brookings. where she was a Briggs Scholar and a student  athlete.   After graduating from SDSU, Jane moved from South Dakota to  Washington, DC, to take a position as a staff assistant in my office.   In the 12 years since then, a lot has happened for her both  personally and professionally. She quickly moved on from the front  office and went on to serve on my legislative team in several  capacities, including as a legislative assistant, health policy  counsel, and finally as legislative director.   Jane was a fierce advocate for rural healthcare and education  priorities, and I know many South Dakotans benefited from her tireless  work on these issues.   While working full time in my office, through healthcare debates and  education reform, and all that came with them, Jane earned her law  degree from Georgetown University. In 2017, Jane and her husband Chris  welcomed a future SDSU Jackrabbit, their daughter, Grace. During that  time, she transitioned to a senior role at the Department of Health and  Human Services. Shortly after, she accepted a role in the White House  Counsel's office. For the last 13 months, she has served the  administration as a special assistant to the President in the White  House Office of Legislative Affairs.   Since her days as an intern in the South Dakota State Legislature,  Jane has demonstrated an affinity for public service and a knack for  developing solid public policy. She is a natural leader, a patient  mentor, and thoughtful and thorough in her work. I would like to thank  her for her decade of  [[Page S5301]]  service to my office and the State of South Dakota and for her service  to the American people.   I wish her continued success in her new endeavors,                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Jayden Bies, an  intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all of the hard work she has  done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota over the past  several weeks.
