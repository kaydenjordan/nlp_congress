 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Boyd W. Sorenson  of Waite Park for receiving France's highest distinction, the Legion of  Honor, for his service during World War II.   As a fighter pilot in the U.S. Army Air Corps, he flew 89 missions in  the European theater during World War II, assisting in the liberation  of France.   Mr. Sorenson's service didn't end after World War II. In fact, Boyd  went on to fly 72 missions during the Korean war.   Mr. Boyd is no stranger to recognition for his bravery. He has  already been awarded the European African Middle Eastern Medal with  three bronze stars, the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the  Distinguished Flying Cross with two oak leaf clusters, and the Canadian  Operational Service Medal with maple leaf cluster.   Boyd is a hero, and his actions helped further the cause of freedom  we enjoy today. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Sorenson for his service and  congratulate him on another well-deserved award.                       Congratulating Violet Halverson     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Violet Halverson  of Sartell, Minnesota. At 94 years old, Violet has just earned herself  the silver medal in shuffleboard at the National Senior Games. The  National Senior Games were created to promote healthy lifestyles for  aging adults through education, fitness, and sport.   Violet began playing shuffleboard in the 1980s. Over the years since,  she has participated in recreational leagues and competitions. When she  heard about the National Senior Games, she knew she had to compete.  Violet won gold her first year, and this year she takes home a silver.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Violet and can't wait to see how she  performs next year.
