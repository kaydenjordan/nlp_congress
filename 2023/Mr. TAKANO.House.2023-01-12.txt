 Mr. Speaker, it should not be a partisan issue to support  democracies globally and, in particular, affirm the results of the  free, fair, and credible Presidential election in Brazil last fall.   The radio silence of my Republican colleagues regarding the January 8  attack on Brazilian democracy is inconsistent with their professed  concern over freedom.   On a bipartisan basis, we should denounce a would-be autocrat who  refuses to accept the results of elections and is taking refuge within  the United States.   Our contempt should also extend to American extremists who are  undermining democratic institutions at home and abroad.   Our commitment to democratic freedom cannot be selective. Fascism and  communism are two sides of the same authoritarian coin.   Standing up for democratic values is not just about standing up to  the Chinese Communist Party. It is about condemning autocratic  movements globally.   We must defend democratic institutions here and everywhere, including  any conspiracy undermining Brazilian democracy.                            ____________________
