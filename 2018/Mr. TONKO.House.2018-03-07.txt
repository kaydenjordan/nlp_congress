 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1917, the Blocking  Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns, or BRICK, Act.   EPA issued the Brick and Clay MACT rule in 2015, which sets maximum  achievable control technology based on what is already being achieved  at similar facilities.   Section 2 of the BRICK Act seeks to delay compliance with the Brick  and Clay MACT until ``judgment becomes final, and no longer subject to  further appeal or review.''   This would incentivize frivolous litigation simply to put off having  to comply with the rule.   Courts already have the ability to issue a stay of any compliance  dates in a final rule. Congress should not insert itself into the  judicial process.   The courts have regularly used this process. There is no reason for  Congress to override it.   To date, no one has petitioned the court to stay the Brick and Clay  MACT rule.   Section 3 of H.R. 1917 incorporates another bill reported out of the  Energy and Commerce Committee, H.R. 453, the Relief from New Source  Performance Standards Act.    This section, Mr. Speaker, delays implementation of the EPA's step 2  emission standards for three categories of wood-fueled heaters.   EPA finalized the rule in 2015. Under the rule, manufacturers have  until 2020 to comply with the new standards. This bill would delay the  standards until 2023.   Much like the Brick MACT, these standards are achievable.   In a recent list of devices certified under the 2015 standard, 171  devices report certified emission levels that already meet the 2020  standards.   These 2020-compliant products are both cleaner and more efficient,  generating more heat per unit of wood burned and making them less  expensive to operate.   By delaying these standards, Congress is unfairly punishing companies  that made investments to produce cleaner, more efficient products by  the original deadline.   Since these appliances typically last for 25 years or more once  installed, delaying this standard will result in decades of additional  pollution in and around people's homes.   The original bill, H.R. 453, was opposed by State attorneys general  of New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, and the  Puget Sound Clean Air Agency.   In a letter from December 12, these officials pointed out that EPA  estimated the net benefits of implementing the rule at more than 100  times the costs.  [[Page H1460]]    Wood smoke contains considerable amounts of fine particle pollution,  carbon monoxide, and other toxic pollutants.   In my home State of New York, less than 2 percent of residents heat  their homes with wood, but residential wood heating accounts for 41  percent of the State's particulate emissions.                                time  1400    Because the emissions are released close to ground level and homes,  there is significant human exposure, which is why this bill is also  opposed by a number of public health and medical organizations.   The BRICK Act gives special treatment to a couple of industries by  shifting the health and financial burdens of pollution on to the  public. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. McEachin).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, no one wants to shut down these businesses, but H.R.  1917 is the wrong remedy. We understand the circumstances, and those  circumstances should be brought to the attention of the courts.   The court has the power to grant the stay of this rule. For some  reason, the industry has not yet made that request, even though there  are a number of pending lawsuits challenging the rule. In fact,  industry petitioned the court to put their lawsuits on hold until EPA  decides whether to grant their request to reconsider the rule.   The pending decisions by the court and the EPA indicate there are  still a number of remedies available to address the industry's  concerns, including a request to the court to stay the rule. There is  no need for H.R. 1917.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, Congress should not be in the business of encouraging  frivolous litigation or penalizing businesses that made the necessary  investments to comply with standards, especially when clean air is at  stake.   Unfortunately, that is what the BRICK Act would do. These standards  are achievable, long overdue, and provide considerable health benefits.  It has been nearly two decades for pollution control standards for  brick and clay facilities and nearly three decades since the last  Federal standards for wood stoves.   We shouldn't have to choose between a giveaway to a couple of special  interests over clean air for all of our constituents. Again, I urge my  colleagues to oppose this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
