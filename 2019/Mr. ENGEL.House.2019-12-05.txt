 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4, the Voting  Rights Advancement Act.   The right to vote is sacred and must not be infringed upon. Sadly,  our Nation has a long and even bloody history of racial voter  suppression, but lately that suppression has been supercharged by the  terrible decision in Shelby County v. Holder. This case gutted key  protections of the Voting Rights Act, allowing for States to prevent  certain groups from accessing the ballot through voter ID laws, closing  polling locations, and even purging voter rolls.   I will be pleased to vote in favor of H.R. 4, as it represents a  major step toward ensuring every citizen has the ability to vote. H.R.  4 will create a new coverage formula for repeated voting rights  violations in the last 25 years and establish practice-based  preclearance to focus administrative or judiciary review narrowly on  suspect voting practices.   With the House approving H.R. 4, we take a major step forward, and I  urge prompt action by the other body.                            ____________________
