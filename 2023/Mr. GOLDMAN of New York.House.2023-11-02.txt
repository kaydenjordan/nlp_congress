 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I stand before you and this body as the only Member who  was in Israel on October 7, hiding in a stairwell with my wife and  three young kids to avoid rockets sent our way by a brutal terrorist  regime. Twenty-seven days later, there are 240 hostages that remain in  Gaza. My children are still traumatized, but their trauma does not  compare to the trauma every single Israeli feels after the most  barbaric and horrific terrorist attack targeting Jews since the  Holocaust.   So to my Republican colleagues, please spare me the lectures about  what is best for Israel.   Mr. Speaker, you will not find a Member of Congress who is more  supportive of Israel than I am. That is why I am so personally  disappointed that the House Republicans have chosen to divide us by  playing political games with aid for Israel when what Israel needs  desperately right now is our unified and unconditional support.   Mr. Speaker, 412 Members of this body voted last week to condemn  Hamas and support Israel, but today for the first time ever,  Republicans have put conditions on emergency aid to Israel in a purely  political ploy designed to divide us. This is a terrible precedent for  the future of Israel.   I look forward to supporting the full amount of Israel aid that is in  this bill when it comes back from the Senate as soon as possible and  without conditions.   Support for Israel may be a political game for my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, but this is personal for us Jews, and it is  existential for the one Jewish nation in the world that is a safe haven  against the rising tide of anti-Semitism across the globe.   This is a shameful effort to use Israel and the Jewish people as a  political weapon.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
