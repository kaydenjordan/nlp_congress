 Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump has stained the American  Presidency with his unAmerican values.   His Muslim ban has caused the suffering of countless families seeking  the American promise of a better life, and it has put the safety of the  American people at risk by providing fodder for extremist groups who  wish to do us harm.   I condemn this ban and the unfit President behind it. I ask my  Republican colleagues who have stood by and said nothing: How can you  remain silent?   The American people are sending a clear message that they will not  remain silent. I have received a large volume of calls from  constituents in opposition to the Muslim ban. It is unfortunate that  these calls are necessary, but I am glad the American people are paying  attention and are committed to holding this administration accountable.   I want to add that hundreds of Syrian refugees have settled in New  Jersey. Many have settled in Jersey City, which is part of my district,  and I am proud to be their Member of Congress. These refugees have  escaped chaos at home and went through a rigorous screening process  before entering the United States. They are respectful of America's  values. The same cannot be said of this President.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Francis Rooney of Florida). Members are  reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the  President.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first let me thank the gentleman from Fort  Worth and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands for heading these  Special Order hours. It is an honor that I had prior to them, and I am  sure that they see the importance of being able to spearhead topics  that are important for today.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump's claims of widespread voter fraud are  unsubstantiated. Officials in both parties have said that there is no  evidence of large-scale voter fraud. A comprehensive investigation  found only 31 possible cases of impersonation fraud out of 1 billion  votes cast in all elections between 2000 and 2014. President Trump lost  the popular vote by 2.8 million, and it looks like he is looking for an  excuse.   What is worse is that President Trump's unfounded claims will  encourage Republicans to double down on their assault on voting rights.  There is no significant evidence of fraud, but President Trump's claims  will be used as cover to suppress the vote. He is already talking about  launching a major investigation into nonexistent voter fraud. The only  thing that would come from such an investigation would be further  restrictions on voting rights.    If President Trump wants to investigate anything, he should  investigate the real voter fraud talking place--the Republican-led  attempts to suppress minority votes.   The strategy of Republican legislatures in some States has been to  suppress votes by instituting voter ID laws, reducing hours for early  voting, and closing polling places. According to the Brennan Center for  Justice, in 2016, 14 States had new voting restrictions in place for  the first time in a Presidential election. This Presidential election  was the first in 50 years without the full protections of the Voting  Rights Act.   As a country, we should make it as easy as possible for people to  exercise the right to vote. Election officials should not erode our  democratic principles. They should make sure that every American  citizen has an equal voice in the democratic process.   Protecting every person's right to vote is essential to a fully  functioning democracy. The countless men and women who have risked  their lives to defend that right knew our system of government only  works when it is inclusive and fair, when it enables all voices to have  a say in the future of our country.
