 Madam President, South Dakota's veterans and the Hot  Springs community are currently celebrating the VA's announcement that  it has begun the process of rescinding its order to close the Hot  Springs VA facility. This was a hard-fought victory in a battle that we  weren't always sure we would win. It started almost a decade ago, in  2011, when the Obama administration announced its plans to realign-- when I say ``realign,'' reclose--the Hot Springs VA facility.   I was well aware of what the Hot Springs facility means to South  Dakota veterans and to the entire Hot Springs community, and I  determined that there wasn't going to be a closure if I could help it.  I knew that closing the Hot Springs facility would put accessible care  out of the reach of a lot of rural and Tribal veterans--not only rural  and Tribal South Dakota veterans but rural and Tribal veterans from  neighboring Wyoming and Nebraska who depend on the Hot Springs facility  for care.   Traveling to Rapid City and Fort Meade for care, as the VA proposed,  would be a real hardship, if not an impossibility, for many of these  veterans. I also strongly disagreed with moving not only medical care  but the vital Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Program from Hot Springs.  Not only would this put the program out of reach of some veterans, I  believed it was also a mistake to remove a tremendously effective  program from the place where it has been so successful and try to  reconstitute it elsewhere.   I got to work in Congress, along with other Members of the South  Dakota delegation. My first priority was simply trying to get Hot  Springs' veterans a hearing with the VA.   In 2016, after years of trying, we persuaded then-VA Secretary Bob  McDonald to visit Hot Springs. Unfortunately, the visit didn't work,  and soon  [[Page S5684]]  after the Secretary signed an order finalizing the decision to close  the majority of the facility.   The battle wasn't over. In 2014, I had succeeded in attaching a  measure to an appropriations legislation prohibiting the closure of the  Hot Springs facility until a national VA realignment strategy was  proposed. In each year, with appreciation to the Appropriations  Committee, I have managed to renew this measure. And after a new VA  Secretary--Secretary Robert Wilkie--took the helm, I repeatedly urged  him to come to Hot Springs and to check out our facility for himself.  Early this year, the Secretary announced that he would visit the  facility in March.   I then organized a letter with the rest of the South Dakota  delegation strongly urging the Secretary to make time to sit down with  Hot Springs veterans and other stakeholders and listen to their  concerns about the planned closure. To our great gratitude, the  Secretary agreed.   Early in Secretary Wilkie's visit to Hot Springs on March 2, I  requested that he revisit the order to close the facility signed over 3  years ago. A bit to our surprise and much to our relief, the Secretary  agreed, reassuring us that the Hot Springs VA would remain open for our  veterans.   That meeting with veterans was pivotal. I worked hard in Congress-- along with other Members of the South Dakota delegation--to keep the  Hot Springs facility open. But the campaign would never have succeeded  without the passion of Hot Springs veterans and the Hot Springs  community, which rallied in support of the facility and have proposed  innovative ideas for the campus's future. And meeting with these  veterans and other stakeholders and hearing their thoughts and stories  played a major role in Secretary Wilkie's decision.   Now, 2020 has been a tough year. But even in tough times, good things  can happen. And last week's announcement that the VA has begun the  formal process of rescinding its order to close the Hot Springs  facility, expected to take 30 to 60 days, has given a lot of us reason  for gratitude. I am thankful to Secretary Wilkie for taking a real look  at South Dakota veterans' concerns and reversing the VA's decision to  close the facility. And I look forward to celebrating with South Dakota  veterans the next time I am in Hot Springs--or, as a lot of us know it,  the ``Veterans Town.'
