 Mr. Speaker, I have been told that service is  the rent that we pay for living in a free and democratic society.   Such has been the life and the legacy of Ms. Phyllis Smith, regional  commissioner of Social Security for Region 5, who is retiring after 45  years of service with the agency.   Commissioner Smith has worked with thousands of individual clients,  and her supervisory and leadership roles have placed her in positions  to positively impact the lives of thousands of others.   Commissioner Smith started work for Social Security in 1978 as a  title 16 claims representative in the Chicago East Field Office. She  stated that her initial plan was to work with SSA until she could  decide what her long-term work plans were. She stated and has written  that, ``When I saw firsthand the impact of SSA on people's lives, the  fact that we are the country's financial safety net, and my  hardworking, dedicated, compassionate coworkers, I was hooked,'' and  she was. As a matter of fact, she moved through the ranks to become the  regional commissioner.   If you can imagine working 45 years for one agency, you come in  contact with many clients, and she also had a great impact on improving  and enhancing the quality of life for thousands of individuals.   Commissioner, you have done exceptionally well. You have done your  job--more than your job. You have given unselfishly of yourself for the  benefit of others.   I commend you for your outstanding career, and as you leave, I ask  that you take with you an Irish prayer. It says: May the sun shine  warmly upon your face. May the wind always be at your back. And until  we meet again, may the good Lord hold you in the hollow of his hands.   Congratulations. It is time. You have done well.                            ____________________
