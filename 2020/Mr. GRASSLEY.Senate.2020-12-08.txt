 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, long before he was sworn into the U.S.  Senate, my former colleague, Tom Harkin from Iowa, served in the U.S.  Navy in Vietnam. He and I represented Iowans for 30 years together here  in the U.S. Senate.   Six years ago, I came to the floor to wish my friend well in  retirement, and I used these words: [So that he could] enjoy the  blessings of hearth and home.   Now, I am not so sure that he took my advice to heart. I recently  learned that Tom has been moonlighting in retirement as an intrepid  crew member sailing the icy waters of the North Atlantic. In fact, he  joined the crew of 59 North Sailing for five voyages. His most recent  adventure found Tom aboard Ice Bear navigating gale force winds in and  around the rugged coastline of Newfoundland.   They say you can't take the farm out of an Iowa farm kid. The same  must be true for a lifelong sailor and the sea.   Tom recently celebrated his 81st birthday in November. Barbara and I  wish him many more trips around the Sun and as many adventures at sea  that his heart desires.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
