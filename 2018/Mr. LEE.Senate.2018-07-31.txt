 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I first saw  this legislation literally moments ago; therefore, I haven't had  adequate time to review it, but I will say this: Any legislation that  comes from this body that begins with the following words will attract  my attention and should attract the attention of anyone who is  concerned about our First Amendment and other constitutional rights. It  begins with the words: ``It shall be unlawful for any person to  intentionally publish. . . . '' That ought to be concerning to us--to  each and every one of us--Democrats and Republicans alike.   On that basis, I object.
