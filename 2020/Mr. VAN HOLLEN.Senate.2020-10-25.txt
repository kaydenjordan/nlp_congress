 Mr. President, earlier this year we lost one of our  Senate alumnae--a constituent and a personal friend--Ellen Michelle  Bloom. She was a devoted mother and wife, who dedicated her career to  public service and advocating for consumers. While she was not a  household name, her 40-year career has benefited the lives of millions  of Americans.   Ellen began her extraordinary career while a student at the  University of Maryland, interning for Senator John Tunney before  joining the staff of a newly elected Senator, Howard Metzenbaum. Her  first job was in the mailroom, answering constituent mail, learning  about the concerns of Ohioans and figuring out how to navigate the  bureaucracy.   Over the ensuing 18 years on Senator Metzenbaum's staff, Ellen rose  through the ranks, at a time when female aides were a distinct  minority, to become his legislative director and an expert in consumer  protection. As her many friends and colleagues have written in the  months since her passing at age 65, Ellen was not interested in  attention; she was only interested in results. A long-time friend and  colleague wrote of Ellen, ``It's amazing how much you can get done when  you don't care who gets the credit.'' That was Ellen.   From provisions in the 1984 Cable Act mandating Equal Employment  Opportunity standards, to promoting children's television legislation,  to regulations requiring lavatories on commuter airplanes, to warning  labels on large buckets designed to protect small children from  drowning, Ellen's work was far-reaching. She advocated for the use of  car seats and bicycle helmets and was among a small group who sought to  bridge the ``digital divide'' long before it became a popular phrase.  She believed in equality and fairness and sought ways to incorporate  these principles into public policy.   When Senator Metzenbaum retired, Ellen was recruited to join the  Clinton administration, first at the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration, then as the Commerce Department's Deputy  Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs, and lastly as Deputy Chief  of Staff for Commerce Secretary William Daley, where her  responsibilities included the 2000 Census.   Following her public service career, Ellen joined the Washington  staff of Consumer Reports. As Director of Federal Policy and head of  the D.C. office, she led the organization's advocacy in support of the  Affordable Care Act, fought for stricter vehicle emission standards,  promoted expanded consumer product labeling, and worked on many other  issues that protected the safety and health of American consumers.   At a time when so many question the ability of the government and  public advocacy to improve the quality of life for our citizens,  Ellen's work stands as an antidote to cynicism. She recognized that the  work of democracy is hard but always had faith that we could make  progress.   Her legacy of good works is a testament to that conviction and an  inspiration for all. She was also an example of how to face adversity  with courage and fortitude.   While her professional accomplishments were many, her greatest pride  was her family: her husband David Bushnell and their children Michael  and Jenna Bushnell, her many nieces and nephews, her brother and  sister-in-law, her cousins spread across the country. Her life was too  short--way too--short; but it was full of love and rich in the ways  that gave it depth, joy, and consequence.   We were lucky to have such a dedicated and passionate public servant.  I was fortunate to count Ellen as a dear friend. She made our country a  better, safer place. She may be gone, but her many accomplishments live  on and will continue to protect and benefit Americans for generations  to come. We need many more Ellen Blooms, but she was one of a kind.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my friend  and colleague, the Senator from Pennsylvania, for talking this evening  about what is at stake for so many of his constituents with this  Supreme Court nomination and the very real possibility that the  Affordable Care Act will be struck down and what that means to so many  of his constituents.   I do think this is a moment where we need to reflect and take stock  of where we are as a country on many fronts. We are in the middle of a  global pandemic. We just saw the highest single day of new reported  cases on Friday. Millions of Americans are unemployed and worried about  how they are going to pay their rent and how they are going to pay for  their medications.   We are here at a time when a Republican-led lawsuit to strike down  the Affordable Care Act, supported by President Trump and his  Department of Justice, is scheduled for a fateful hearing in the  Supreme Court on November 10--1 week after the upcoming election.   We are here in the wake of the killings of Black men, like George  Floyd, and Black women, like Breonna Taylor, which sent throngs of  protesters into the streets across the country to rightly demand  greater police accountability and racial justice.   We gather here as wildfires in the West and hurricanes in the South  demonstrate with deadly and destructive voracity the accelerating and  dangerous consequences of climate change. We meet as voters are filling  out mail-in ballots as early as they can to make sure that the Postal  Service, which this administration has deliberately slowed down, can  get their ballots delivered on time so that they can be counted and as  voters stand in long lines, with their masks, 6 feet apart, to cast  their ballots in the early vote.   At this moment, this country is facing all these pressing issues, but  as I come here this evening or early this morning, we are not  considering solutions to any of those critical and urgent issues, not a  single one. Instead, we are blowing up the precedent that the Senate  Republican leader and other Republican Senators themselves established  4 years ago and considering a Supreme Court nominee closer in time to  the Presidential election than ever before in American history, as  millions of Americans have already have already cast their ballots.   We are blowing up this Republican Senate established precedent and  racing toward a nomination that will turn the clock back, take us  backwards on all of those pressing issues that I just outlined. But  sadly, I suppose none of us should be surprised that we are focused  here on another judicial nomination at the expense of focusing on  legislation to advance and address the interests of the American people  on so many front-burner pressing issues.   Indeed, as I reflect on the last months and years, just about the  only thing this Republican Senate has done is pass nominations. Week  after week, we ignore our job as legislators in favor of an agenda of  rubberstamping, blindly supporting whatever nominee this President puts  forward. In many cases, it hasn't even mattered if a judicial  nomination is qualified, if they have even tried a case. Our Republican  Senate colleagues have abandoned any principles they claim to hold with  respect to our Judiciary Committee   When President Obama was in office, those Republican Senators who  were here in this Chamber erected a wall of opposition to scores of his  nominees, refused to even consider many of them. They outright rejected  President Obama's efforts to fill seats on the DC Circuit, the court  just below the Supreme Court.   Republican Senators at the time claimed that it wasn't necessary to  fill those vacancies. They rejected qualified nominees up and down the  bench, denying simple consideration and withholding blue slips. It was  a deliberate effort to stonewall President Obama's judicial nominees.  In fact, they rejected a highly-qualified nominee for the very seat  Judge Amy Coney Barrett currently holds. President Obama nominated Myra  Selby for the Seventh Circuit in January of 2016. She had served on the  Indiana Supreme Court and would have been the first African-American  and first woman from Indiana on that circuit.   Senate Republicans--what did they do? Didn't even give her a hearing.  Then, 1 month later, February 2016, Justice Scalia passes away.  President Obama nominates Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, a good  and very fair judge who had been confirmed to the DC Circuit by a  Republican-controlled Senate by a vote of 76 to 23. What did Senate  Republicans do? They refused to consider the nomination.   They said, February--February of 2016, February of that election--was  simply too close to a Presidential election to fill the slot. The  American people should have a voice, they said. Let the people choose a  President this year and then that President, whomever that may be, make  the nomination to the Supreme Court.   Not only did Senate Republicans oppose Merrick Garland, they refused  to meet with him. They refused to hold a hearing. This is February  2016. The American people should have a voice. It is a Presidential  election year, they said, 8 months--8 months--before that November 2016  election was just too close.   And yet, here we are today, 4 years later, 8 days--not 8 months, 8  days--from the beginning of the last day of this Presidential election,  November 3. Over 50 million ballots are already cast, and suddenly,  there is nothing more important than rushing to fill the Supreme Court  vacancy--not responding to a global pandemic.   And we just learned from a very reputable Columbia University study  that had this administration acted and followed the advice of  healthcare experts, we could have saved at least 130,000 American  lives--up to 220,000 American lives. But here we are, taking no more  meaningful action, not giving a lifeline to people who are out of work,  through no fault of their own; not closing the digital divide so  children who can't go to school because of COVID can access their  classes; not reforming our justice and policing system to make sure  that everyone, no matter the color of their skin, is protected and  treated equally; not securing our elections against foreign attacks and  interference.   Just a few days ago, I was right here on the Senate floor, asking  this Senate to take up what had been a bipartisan piece of legislation  called the DETER Act. I introduced it years ago with Senator Rubio,  after we learned of the Russian interference in 2016. We wanted to make  sure that we send a clear message in advance of the 2020 election that  if we catch the Russians or any other adversaries interfering in our  election, this time, there will be a swift and certain price to pay.  [[Page S6514]]    Just earlier this past week, we got not surprising news from the DNI  that, yes, what we have known all along, the Russians are interfering,  other adversaries are interfering, and yet we couldn't even take up the  bipartisan bill to send a clear message to Putin and others because the  Trump administration continues to oppose it and the Senate Republican  leader continues to bury it here in U.S. Senate.   No response to global pandemic of meaningful note at this point,  nothing to do on justice and policing, nothing to secure our elections.  No, the top priority has been to jettison the precedent that our  Republican colleagues themselves established under President Obama 4  years ago and rush to confirm a Supreme Court Justice.   Why? Why this 180-degree turnaround? After all, it is not as if our  Senate Republican colleagues have always been so worried about an  eight-person Supreme Court. They kept the Supreme Court to eight  Justices for a year--for a full year--when they refused to consider  Merrick Garland's nomination. Some of our Senate Republican colleagues  praised the idea of only having eight Justices on the Supreme Court  forever if Hillary Clinton had won the Presidency in 2016. So what is  different this time around?   Well, as we have been hearing on the floor of the Senate and from the  President himself, there are a number of irresistible opportunities--at  least irresistible for our President and the Republican colleagues-- things they have been trying to do for years and have not succeeded yet  in doing.   First, they can pack the Court--pack the Court with increasingly  ideological and rightwing Justices to align the very top Court--the  Supreme Court--with the increasingly ideological rightwing judiciary  they have been creating over years, first by stonewalling and blocking  President Obama's nominees and then fast-tracking them for President  Trump's nominees.   Second, they can achieve another goal that they have been striving  for, for a decade: overturning the Affordable Care Act. Ten years ago-- I was a Member of the House of Representatives at the time--Republicans  did everything--I mean, everything they could--to block passage of the  Affordable Care Act to stop ObamaCare. We heard outright lies about it.  They said it was going to cause massive job loss. They said that the  government would be picking your doctor. They said a government panel  would decide whether your grandparents lived or died. They called them  death panels. None of it was true. None of it has come true.   The first part of the Affordable Care Act was signed into law on  March 23, 2010. On that very day, House Republicans filed a bill to  repeal it outright. Also, on that same day, the first Republican  lawsuits were filed against it. That two-pronged approach--trying to  undo it legislatively and trying to undo it through the courts-- continued for the next decade, dozens of votes in the House of  Representatives and the Senate to attempt to repeal the law and dozens  of Republican attorneys general and special interests filing lawsuits  to challenge it in the courts. They failed. They failed in the  Congress. And so far, they have failed in the courts.   In the courts, in 2012, the Roberts Court upheld the  constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in a 5-to-4 decision in  one of the very first cases that had been filed against the law. It  wasn't a complete victory for the Affordable Care Act. It did make  Medicaid expansion optional. And a number of Republican-held States  refused to implement that unless and until voters demanded it at the  ballots. But that Supreme Court decision did uphold the central tenets  of the Affordable Care Act.   The Supreme Court upheld the ACA again in a 6-to-3 decision in 2015.  But that hasn't stopped the Republican Party's quest to eliminate it  entirely. Just look at the 2016 Republican Party platform where they  continued the attack with three strategies.   First, President Trump: ``With the unanimous support of Congressional  Republicans, will sign its repeal.''   Second, while working to legislatively repeal it, the President would  use his administrative authority to undermine, weaken, and sabotage it.   Third, the President would appoint Justices to reverse past  decisions, including the Affordable Care Act decisions made by the  Supreme Court.   That was the three-pronged plan. Well, they ran into problems with  the first part of the plan because despite President Trump's campaign  promise to convene a special session of Congress to ``immediately  repeal and replace ObamaCare very, very quickly''--despite that  pledge--our Republican colleagues soon realized they had no replacement  plan. They promised that they could repeal the Affordable Care Act and  replace it with something much, much better and less expensive, but  there was no real plan. There was no ``there'' there, and the idea they  offered to the American people was to trade healthcare for millions of  Americans for tax breaks for the very rich. Tens of millions of  Americans would have lost access to affordable healthcare. People with  preexisting conditions would have lost protections, deductibles, and  copays would have gotten more expensive. Insurance companies would have  been able to get tax breaks on the bonuses they gave to their CEOs.  That is what was in the Republican replacement plan--giving tax breaks  to companies for the bonuses they pay to their CEOs.   Not surprisingly, they couldn't sell it to the American people, and I  think we all recall here, in 2017, it dramatically failed by one vote  in the U.S. Senate. Every Democratic Senator voting against destroying  the Affordable Care Act, three Republicans joining us, including, of  course, Senator McCain giving it a big thumbs down.   Republicans have been a little more successful trying to sabotage the  law through the Trump administration's Executive authorities by scaling  back outreach for enrollment plans.   What does that mean? That means don't tell the public about what  opportunities they have to get healthcare coverage in the Affordable  Care Act. We just won't provide as much public information so people  won't know about it, and then they won't be able to sign up for it;  also, by ending cost-sharing in an attempt to destabilize the  healthcare exchanges and allowing more junk health plans that don't  offer critical benefits or protections, the kind of plans we used to  see when people thought that they had coverage, and then, when they  really needed it, they suddenly discovered, no, in the fine print, it  just wasn't there.   But despite these efforts by the administration, the law has  survived. All their efforts to slash it with 100 cuts, it continues to  provide affordable coverage to millions of Americans, and, in many  States, including mine in Maryland, they have taken efforts to try to  protect the Affordable Care Act from the Trump administration's  attacks.   But on November 10, when the Supreme Court hears that Affordable Care  Act case, all of that could change. They could decide, after upholding  it on two separate occasions, that now they have got another Supreme  Court Justice, we are going to strike it down.   And make no mistake, Donald Trump wants this law overturned. I mean,  no one should be under any illusions about that. You can take it from  the word of the brief--the legal brief filed by the Solicitor General  of the United States on behalf of the Trump administration. It is the  country's lawyer before the Supreme Court.   He filed a case and said that the entire law ``must fall.'' The  entire law must fall. Not one piece of it or another piece, the entire  law must fall. That is the position of the Trump administration. You  can listen to President Trump back in May of this year. We are in the  middle of a pandemic, when he said: ``We want to terminate healthcare  under ObamaCare.''   You can listen to him just this week on ``60 Minutes.'' It aired  tonight, and he tweeted out to make sure everyone could see it just in  case they missed the show. President Trump said of the Supreme Court's  ACA case: ``I hope that they end it--it'll be so good if they end it.''  That is President Trump. It will be so good if they--the Supreme  Court--end the Affordable Care Act. That has been his plan from the  Supreme Court from the start.   In 2015, when he was running, he said: ``If I win the presidency, my  judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike Bush's appointee  John Roberts on ObamaCare.'' Candidate Trump hasn't changed his tune.  And he has found his nominee in Amy Coney Barrett, who has publicly  criticized past Supreme Court decisions on the Affordable Care Act. She  is President  [[Page S6515]]  Trump's torpedo aimed at fulfilling his pledge to destroy the  Affordable Care Act.   She criticized the decision in NFIB v. Sebelius, saying that Chief  Justice Roberts' argument ``pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond it  plausible meaning to save the statute.'' She applauded the dissent in  King v. Burwell, saying that they had ``the better of the legal  argument.''   So it is no wonder that Republican Senators who tried unsuccessfully  to defeat the Affordable Care Act legislatively in 2017 are now rushing  to appoint her before that case is heard 1 week after the election.   The stakes could not be higher for the American people. I want  everybody to think back to the days before we had the Affordable Care  Act. Back then, if you had a preexisting health condition, companies  could deny you coverage outright. If you didn't have the coverage, you  might otherwise be offered it at a price that you couldn't possibly  afford--outrageously expensive. Instead of denying it outright, we will  offer you that coverage, but you have got a preexisting health  condition, so we are going to charge you something that you can't  possibly afford and so you can't buy it.   If you did have coverage and then developed a health issue, you would  be locked into your current plan no matter how high the costs arose,  unable to shop around because of what had become a preexisting  condition. It is called job lock. You have to stay in a job even if you  have a better opportunity or you want to pursue your dreams because you  now have a preexisting health condition and you can't get coverage  elsewhere.   One Marylander, Angela, wrote to me about her daughter Rachel, who  was diagnosed with epilepsy when she was in 8th grade. She had to take  expensive medications, which she can afford thanks to the Affordable  Care Act. Here is what Rachel's mother wrote:         She now has a lifetime preexisting condition. If she were       to be kicked off her healthcare, I imagine she would be       bankrupted having to pay full costs of the medications that       help her be a productive member of society.    Rachel is a teacher, and her mother Angela says: ``It is because of  ObamaCare that she is able to be where she is today.''   Another constituent, Megan, wrote to me that she turned 26 on the  Thursday that the Senate Republicans on the Judiciary Committee  reported out the Barrett nomination. She turned 26 just last Thursday.  She has asthma. She pays $60 a month for her medications. And here is  what she wrote to me:         If I lost my job or my insurance. . . . I would have to       make a choice between my medicine or paying the electric bill       on time.    And she ended her note to me with the following:         For my 26th birthday, my only wish is that the Affordable       Care Act not be overturned. There are so many people like me,       Americans with preexisting conditions, that depend on this       crucial legislation that provides necessary protection and       guarantees that they will stay covered no matter what.    That is what Megan wrote.   And before the Affordable Care Act, women could be charged more just  because they were women. Being a woman was a preexisting condition that  allowed insurance companies to charge more. It is also true that before  the Affordable Care Act, if you had a catastrophic accident or a long- term health issue, you would hit a coverage gap and be bankrupted by  millions of dollars in hospital bills. There were no annual caps and no  lifetime caps.   Sometimes that meant that people wouldn't go to the hospital or see a  doctor because they didn't want to face unending, uncapped bills. That  is what would have happened to another constituent of mine, Robin, if  she did not have the Affordable Care Act.   She wrote:         I am 64.    So she is not yet 65, so she is not covered by Medicare.         I am 64, took a tumble at home. My older son urged me to go       to the emergency room due to my family health history. I was       kept in the hospital due to a low thyroid level and almost       non-existent potassium level among other problems. I would       not have recovered if I did not have [the] ACA. I would not       have health insurance and I know I could not pay a hospital       bill, so I would not go to the emergency room. I would have       died. [The Affordable Care Act] saved my life.    Before the Affordable Care Act, if you were a recent college graduate  but you hadn't found a job with health insurance yet, you couldn't stay  automatically on your parents' health insurance policy. You were on  your own, out of luck, young people thinking they are invincible until  they are not. Insurance companies could deny coverage to them, and now  they can't.   I heard from one Marylander who worries about his son's future if  this particular provision is taken away. He wrote to me:         If the ACA is overturned and we lose the coverage for my       son on my policy, this would be a disaster for my son and for       my family. . . . I would hate to see him have to drop out of       school just to find a job to cover health insurance--this       would destroy his future. And we don't have--    He continued to write--       the extra $5,000 or so a year lying around that would be       required for him to have a policy under our current provider       that would cover his preexisting conditions. My son could be       one of the millions to lose health insurance if the       Republicans have their way.    This provision of the Affordable Care Act has been lifesaving for  Pamela's family. She wrote:         This year, my 23-year-old daughter was diagnosed with stage       3 breast cancer.    Stage 3 breast cancer.         Thanks to the [Affordable Care Act] she is still on our       insurance. Even with our insurance, she will be in debt for a       very long time. Without it she would be dead. I have not       heard a single Republican guarantee this will be in any bill       they propose.    It is also a fact that before the Affordable Care Act, you had to pay  for annual checkups and preventive coverage like breast cancer  screenings. It is also a fact that if you want to quit your job to  start a small business, you had to figure out how you would pay for an  expensive health plan, which might not provide very good coverage on  the individual market.   Another Marylander, who had a lump in her breast that was treated as  a preexisting condition even after it disappeared, decided she had to  limit her employment options to those with decent health insurance  before the ACA was enacted. She wrote:         This experience steered me to work only for employers large       enough to offer stable, subsidized healthcare insurance. . .       . The downside has been the golden handcuffs. It is important       to have universal decent healthcare coverage to encourage       small businesses, nonprofits, and entrepreneurs.    Kathleen from Maryland decided to leave an office job to find  something that suited her better, but the job she took in the  restaurant industry didn't offer any medical coverage. She wrote:         I developed adult-onset asthma, more than once resorting to       the ERs or Urgent Care. I searched everywhere I knew for       medical insurance but was refused, either because I was just       an individual and/or because I now had a ``pre-existing       condition.'' Knowing nothing about asthma treatment, and       unable to cover medical bills entirely on my own, I was       chronically ill, and more than once almost died.    She had to rely on friends and family for help, and after 10 years  without insurance, she finally found a job with coverage. Kathleen  wrote:         We ALL need medical coverage, ALL the time, no matter your       employment status.    The Affordable Care Act dramatically expanded Medicaid in many  States--those that opted to participate--providing subsidies for low- income Americans to find affordable plans and gave small business tax  credits for providing health insurance for their employees. It also  closed the prescription drug doughnut hole for seniors on Medicare.   A lot of people forget, seniors on Medicare benefited from the  Affordable Care Act and continue to benefit. That is part of the law  that the Trump administration is trying to overturn in its entirety.  These are seniors who have faced a big coverage gap from the initial  spending threshold, and on the other side of the doughnut hole,  catastrophic spending--a big doughnut hole.   In 2016, the most recent years where we have complete data, close to  5 million seniors on Medicare received an average of over $1,000 in  Part D prescription discounts because the doughnut hole was closed.  Another 46 million seniors are on Part D Medicare today. If any of them  all of a sudden develop a condition that requires high drug costs, any  of those 46 million Americans could fall into that doughnut hole,  costing them as much as $3,000 more per year.   Now, the Affordable Care Act isn't a perfect law, but it did set a  key standard for essential health benefits, cut  [[Page S6516]]  the rate of uninsured Americans, and started improving healthcare  outcomes for Americans. And, right now, while we are in the middle of  the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever.   The United States has had over 8.6 million COVID-19 cases, a number  that we see grow by the day. For patients who require hospitalization,  the Kaiser Family Foundation reports that the average stay can cost  more than $20,000 a person and rise to closer to $90,000 if the patient  requires a ventilator.   So what would happen to those Americans if they are once again  subjected to a lifetime out-of-pocket limit on their insurance coverage  where they are not protected against huge expenditures?   We are all glad that when President Trump got COVID, he got world- class care. It is a good thing. We are glad he got airlifted to Walter  Reed in Maryland. It is a great national military medical facility. We  are glad he had a team of doctors devoted to his case. We are glad he  got access to cutting-edge drugs. He won't have to pay for that  coverage.   But that is not the kind of treatment every other American gets, and  it is offensive for the President to relish his first-class treatment  while denying his fellow Americans simple protections, as he would, by  calling for the destruction of the Affordable Care Act.   Speaking of COVID-19 and the impact of preexisting conditions, we are  seeing many COVID-19 patients who have long-term health effects. They  call them the ``long-haulers.'' The CDC noted last month that COVID-19  can have an impact on the heart, including heart damage that can lead  to long-term symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart  palpitations.   An article this month in the Harvard Medical School Health Blog notes  that COVID can damage the brain, causing cognitive effects comparable  to those who have suffered traumatic brain injury.   So while Senate Republicans have refused to take meaningful action to  confront the next step of COVID-19 relief, including refusing to pass a  strong testing and tracing plan to halt the spread of the virus as  proposed in the Heroes Act--both 1 and 2--from the House of  Representatives, they are pushing for a nominee to take the Affordable  Care Act away from the American people who have gotten sick, and now up  to 8.6 million of them have a preexisting condition due to COVID-19.  But they will no longer be protected from that preexisting condition if  the Affordable Care Act goes away.   This isn't crying wolf. I want to remind everybody again, the  Solicitor General of the United States, acting on behalf of the  President of the United States, wrote in his brief supporting the case  for the Affordable Care Act that the entire law--the entire law,  coverage for preexisting conditions, closing the Medicare doughnut  hole, and ending lifetime limits for care--``must fall.'' All of it  ``must fall.''   We know President Trump has no plan to replace it. He has had plenty  of time to present one. For years, he kept telling us: It is going to  be a matter of weeks. Four years after his inauguration: It is going to  be a matter of weeks. Two years ago: It is a matter of weeks. Three  years ago: It is a matter of weeks.   He was asked about it in the last debate. He said don't worry. He is  going to come up with ``a brand new, beautiful health [plan].''   Women's health, in particular, is in jeopardy with this nomination.  Not only do women stand to lose the Affordable Care Act protections  against discrimination--because before that, as I said, just being a  woman was a preexisting condition that would and could cost you more-- they will no longer have access to the guarantee of precancer  screenings for breast cancer and other screenings. But it is also a  fact that President Trump and Republicans have long sought to deny them  reproductive health freedom.   That brings us to another longtime priority of President Trump and  Senate Republicans--putting a Justice on the Supreme Court who will  provide a majority to strike down a woman's right to reproductive  choice in accordance with the Roe v. Wade decision.   The Roe v. Wade decision was 7 to 2 in the Supreme Court. It was  founded on the right to privacy, that a woman's healthcare choice was  her own, without interference from the State, in accordance with the  Roe v. Wade framework.   Before Roe v. Wade, when abortion was illegal in most States, unsafe  abortions caused one-sixth of all pregnancy-related deaths. Many low- income women jeopardized their lives with self-induced procedures.   Now, women have safe options, both to obtain abortions and also,  thanks to the Affordable Care Act, no-cost contraception that is used  both to plan families and manage a variety of health conditions. Women  can make decisions about their own bodies, in consultation with their  doctors, that are best for their health and the well-being of their  families.   The vast majority of Americans support comprehensive healthcare,  including a woman's right to reproductive choice under Roe v. Wade, but  there has been a long fight chipping away at this protection, this  care, with the ultimate goal of overturning Roe v. Wade altogether.   Overturning that case has been one of President Trump's litmus tests  for this Supreme Court nominee and his other picks. Like the Affordable  Care Act, it is not like he has been subtle about this.   In a Presidential debate in 2016, he was asked if he wanted the  Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. He said:         Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on,       that's really what's going to be--that will happen. And that       will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am       putting pro-life judges on the court.    There it is. This would be President Trump's third Supreme Court  nominee--the magic number he talked about for overturning Roe v. Wade  and a woman's protected right to choose under the Constitution of the  United States. This comes on top of the more than 60 judges with anti- choice records whom he has already nominated and the Senate has  confirmed to the lower courts.   More States are passing laws to drastically limit or effectively ban  abortion in order to set up cases to challenge Roe v. Wade in the  courts, to set up those cases to take to the Supreme Court.   Again, as with his intention to overturn the Affordable Care Act,  President Trump has found the perfect nominee to overturn Roe v. Wade  in Judge Barrett.   We don't have to rely on the President's words alone or on all the  anti-choice groups who have vigorously lobbied for her appointment and  who have said that she ``believes that Roe v. Wade is something that  can be reversed.'' That is what all the advocacy groups supporting her  nomination are saying. One of our Republican Senate colleagues said he  absolutely will never vote for a Justice who has not shown that they  believe Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided and has told us that Judge  Barrett ``certainly would meet that standard.''   Just as we can see Judge Barrett's opposition to the Affordable Care  Act in her own record, we can see her opposition to Roe v. Wade in her  own record. She signed on to an advertisement calling Roe v. Wade ``an  exercise of raw judicial power'' that advocated for ending ``the  barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.'' That is what she said.   She signed another advertisement criticizing Roe v. Wade when she was  a member of Notre Dame's University Faculty for Life, an anti-choice  group. She has said that Roe v. Wade is not settled precedent.   Indeed, at her hearing in the Senate, she questioned the principle  that the Constitution protects certain fundamental rights from  government interference on privacy grounds, saying that there is a  debate about how far that can go--a debate that is generally waged by  those looking to overturn Roe v. Wade and Obergefell, the case that  allows for gay marriage.   She would not even concede--and this is very telling--she would not  even concede in her hearing that the decision in Griswold v.  Connecticut was settled law. Griswold v. Connecticut is the case that  protects access to contraceptives. There was a Connecticut law on the  books that prohibited any person from using contraception, and the  Court invalidated that law in a 7-to-2 decision on the grounds that it  violated marital privacy.   I want our colleagues to think about this. This is a State law that  said that  [[Page S6517]]  adults could not use contraception, and she would not say that is  settled law under the Constitution of the United States. She would not  even concede that in vitro fertilization, which has helped many women  start their families, was constitutional and could not be made illegal.    It is clear from President Trump's stated intentions from the words  of anti-choice groups, the promise of our own colleagues, and from  Judge Barrett's own words that her nomination is the culmination of a  decades-long effort to overturn a woman's right to choose.   We also see that with respect to the decision in Obergefell v.  Hodges. On that day in 2015, the Supreme Court showed us what it could  be--a body that would ensure, rather than restrict, the rights of  Americans. In a 5-to-4 decision, it told LGBTQ Americans that the love  they had for each other and their wish to declare that love in marriage  was their right, as it has been for straight couples for the whole  history of our Nation. Five years later, the American people support  this decision at record-high levels. But that was a 5-to-4 decision,  and we are now facing a fundamental shift in the balance of the Court,  and we have seen time and again this President attack laws designed to  protect people against discrimination based on sexual orientation.   We also see this not just from the administration but, again, through  Judge Barrett's own words and actions. She received an honorarium to  teach at a program run by the Alliance Defending Freedom, which the  Southern Poverty Law Center has categorized as a hate group for its  efforts to prohibit same-sex marriage and recriminalize homosexuality,  and she called the experience ``a wonderful one.'' She has referred to  sexual orientation as a ``sexual preference,'' which are the buzz words  used by those who want to overturn LGBTQ rights on the grounds that  this is not a question of ``immutable characteristic'' but simply  someone's chosen preference.   There are a number of cases coming to the Supreme Court that deal  with the issue of discrimination against foster families headed by  same-sex couples. One will arrive at the Court on November 4, the day  after the election--another reason you see this nomination being  rushed.   If you look through the issues I outlined at the start--from racial  justice and police accountability, to other questions on the ability to  access healthcare--you will find time and again in Judge Barrett's  record telltale signs and clear signs--flashing warning signs--that she  wants to turn back the clock.   We see that with respect to criminal justice reform, where she  dissented in a case on whether a defendant who had been convicted but  not yet sentenced when the First Step Act was enacted by this Congress  and signed by the President--as to whether the new sentencing  requirements of that law would apply. Fortunately, the Seventh Circuit  ruled 9 to 3 that the First Step Act applied to the defendant. Judge  Barrett was one of the three dissenting votes who adopted a cramped  interpretation of the law devoid of any mercy.   There are other cases relating to the rights of those who have been  injured, including a pregnant teenager who was repeatedly sexually  assaulted by a prison guard, where Judge Barrett found that the prison  guard could not be held liable under his employment with the prison  system. If you read through that case and the horrifying facts, I think  you come away very troubled with the fact that she had such a cramped  reading of the law.   On a question that is not a legal matter but a matter of fact-- climate change--we would have thought that the question that was put to  her was quite easy. Judge Barrett admitted that the coronavirus was  infectious. Why? Because that is what the medical experts say. But when  she was asked about climate change--again, not a tricky, legal  question--she refused to say what the overwhelming scientific consensus  is--that climate change is real. We see it, as I said, with the forest  fires. We see it with the hurricanes. We see it in my State of  Maryland, just in the city of Annapolis, the home of the Naval Academy.  We see flooding at our docks that is wreaking havoc on local  businesses.   Time and again, when Judge Barrett was given an opportunity to answer  basic fact questions or pretty straightforward legal questions in the  Judiciary Committee, she ducked them entirely, but we have her record  to indicate where she stands.   On the issue of voter protection and voting rights, we also find  another troubling pattern in Judge Barrett's record. This is especially  important when you think about the fact that she is filling the seat of  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who wrote that very powerful dissent in  the 5-to-4 decision in Shelby v. Eric Holder that took a big bite out  of the Voting Rights Act.   If you look at the statements by Judge Barrett, she distinguishes  between what she calls individual rights, like the Second Amendment  rights, versus what she calls a civic right, the right to vote--putting  the right to vote in a lesser protected category than what she defines  as individual rights. In fact, Judge Barrett wrote: ``As a right that  was exercised for the benefit of the community (like voting and jury  service), rather than for the benefit of the individual . . . it  belonged only to virtuous citizens.''   ``Only to virtuous citizens''--that is what Judge Barrett wrote about  the right to vote. The right to vote, as we all know, is fundamental to  our democracy.   Our dear colleague John Lewis, who recently passed away and was  nearly beaten to death for fighting for that right to vote, said many  times:         The vote is precious. It is almost sacred. It is the most       powerful, non-violent tool we have in a democracy.    That right to vote should not be relegated to some kind of secondary  status, as Judge Barrett's writings indicate she would do.   So if you look at all the challenges that we face as a country-- dealing with the pandemic, dealing with issues of police accountability  and racial justice, dealing with climate change, dealing with  protecting voting rights--all these pressing issues that we should be  focused on here in the U.S. Senate, we are not. Instead, we are rushing  through this illegitimate process to put a Justice on the Supreme Court  who in each of these areas--each of these areas where we should be  focusing on attention--is actually going to take us backward.   So I urge the Senate--I can see the march that is going day after day  toward the vote tomorrow, but I urge this Senate to reconsider the path  that it is on.   This has been a very shameful episode--watching the complete flip- flop from 2016, rushing to put on a Justice whom the President wants  and who Senate Republicans, I think, believe will act to overturn the  Affordable Care Act, take away a woman's right to choose, and be part  of an ideological majority that will strip away important rights from  the American people.   I will end by just pointing out that public surveys right now show  the American people are not fooled by this process. They don't like  what they see. They want us to be focused on dealing with COVID-19.  They want us to pass a robust, comprehensive emergency response  package. That is what the American people are calling for. Instead,  this Senate has embarked on this charade of a process.   There will be a verdict on all of this by the American people in a  matter of 8 days, and I believe there will be a reckoning on the  actions the Senate is taking and the actions the Senate has refused to  take in addressing the urgent issues that are really facing the  country.   I yield the floor.
