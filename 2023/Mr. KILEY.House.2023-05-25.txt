 Madam Speaker, we just heard a lot of speeches at a very  high volume on the topic of the debt ceiling, and many of them had an  accompanying visual that said, ``House Republicans are forcing a  default on our debt.''  [[Page H2624]]    Now, that is a very strange statement, given that the House has  already passed a bill to stop us from defaulting on our debt. Weeks  ago, the House passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling. I will say that  again. The House has passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling that  protects Social Security, protects Medicare, protects our veterans, and  puts us on the more fiscally sustainable path that Americans are  demanding.   Now, that bill is sitting in the Senate right now. The Senate could  pass it at any time, but, of course, the Senate isn't even here this  week, so they haven't done so.   As we speak, Speaker McCarthy and President Biden are negotiating.  This is precisely what the overwhelming majority of Americans-- Democrats, Republicans, Independents--say that they want: A bipartisan  solution that raises the debt ceiling while making responsible reforms  to spending.   The speeches we just heard are advocating precisely the opposite.  They want to pull the rug out from under this ongoing negotiation,  bring it to a stop, impose a one-sided, partisan solution that allows  us to keep spending money without limit.   Indeed, I was particularly struck by a comment from the Congresswoman  from New York, who in defense of this idea that we should keep spending  money without limit said this: If anyone wants to entertain the thought  that we spend too much, think about the last time that someone said the  government does too much.   Those are her words. She said, think about the last time anyone said  the government does too much.   Well, actually, my constituents say that a lot. The government does  too much when it overtaxes and overregulates Americans.   The government certainly did too much when it shut down schools, shut  down businesses, shut down churches, and imposed unlawful mandates.   The government does too much when it pays people more to not work  than to work.   The government did too much when it went on a multitrillion-dollar  spending spree that even Barack Obama's top economic adviser warned  against and gave us this historic inflation crisis.   The government does too much when it unleashes 87,000 new IRS agents  on unsuspecting American taxpayers.   The government does too much when it shuts down the Keystone pipeline  and inhibits our ability to produce energy domestically and make us  energy independent.   At the end of the day, though, we also need to ask, as we have seen  the budget just grow and grow and grow without limit, what has the  result of all that additional spending been?   Do you look around and see beautiful roads and infrastructure?   Do you see world-leading schools?   Do you see a prosperous economy?   No, of course not.   Therefore, I do think that as we make reforms to spending, we also  need to focus on waste, fraud, and abuse. We need to focus not just on  how much money is being spent but on how that money is being spent. Not  just on the number of dollars that we are spending, but on the results  that we are getting.    I am hoping that that is the new paradigm that will emerge from the  negotiations going on right now between President Biden and Speaker  McCarthy, a paradigm of customer service, citizen service, a  performance-based government. That is what Americans deserve, and I  encourage the President to negotiate in good faith with Speaker  McCarthy to move us in that direction.            President Biden Should Withdraw Julie Su's Nomination     Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the latest  disturbing revelations relating to President Biden's nominee for U.S.  Labor Secretary, Julie Su. The nomination remains stalled, and for good  reason.   Ms. Su's record of gross mismanagement, historic, unmatched  mismanagement as California's labor secretary under Governor Gavin  Newsom is now well understood. For example, under Ms. Su's tenure,  $32.6 billion in taxpayer funds were fraudulently paid to death row  inmates, international criminal syndicates, and other fraudsters.   This fraud was possible because Su waived fraud prevention  protections, actually removed guardrails despite repeated warnings, and  she failed to follow the commonsense practices of other States, and  then failed to take corrective actions as billions were lost to fraud.   At the same time that this fraud was occurring, by the way, Su  improperly denied or delayed for weeks, months, sometimes indefinitely,  legitimate unemployment claims for millions of Americans.   Madam Speaker, I have now spoken on this floor several times to make  sure that Americans are aware of that track record and understand the  risk that elevating Ms. Su poses.   It is a reasonable inference that a nominee who failed in her role as  State labor secretary would likewise fail in the role as U.S. Labor  Secretary, and certainly has failed to earn such a promotion.   Well, now that is no longer merely an inference. It is the reality  because as her nomination has stalled, Ms. Su has all the while been  serving as the Acting Secretary at the Department of Labor, and  unsurprisingly, she has brought her record of mismanagement from  California to the Department of Labor as Acting Secretary, with  terrible consequences.   A recent report from The New York Times has uncovered evidence of a  major spike in unaccompanied migrant minors, children, being funneled  to work in dangerous jobs in violation of Federal labor law. The  article is titled, ``As Migrant Children Were Put to Work, U.S. Ignored  Warnings.''   The Times reports the White House and Federal agencies were  repeatedly alerted to signs of children at risk. The warnings were  ignored or missed.   To take one example from The Times article: ``. . . a boy working  construction said he felt ashamed about not knowing how to read. He,  too, was released in 2021--at age 12--and was immediately put to work  by a man who had sponsored at least five children.''   In another case: ``At a day-labor pickup site, a 13-year-old released  last year to a man he had never met, said he wished he could enroll in  middle school and start learning English.''   The problem is much broader than a handful of cases. Signs of migrant  child labor have been uncovered inside industrial workplaces, including  several auto part factories. Additionally, over 100 children were found  working the overnight shift scouring meatpacking plants across the  country, according to The Times.   Now, I should note, monitoring workplaces to prevent child labor is  the job of the Department of Labor. Julie Su was Deputy Labor Secretary  and is now Acting Labor Secretary. She held those roles as children  were exploited to work in grueling conditions in violation of Federal  labor law.   This pattern of conduct almost exactly mirrors Su's tenure in  California: repeated warnings of a serious problem, little to no  preventative action, followed by a refusal to accept responsibility or  change course when her failures are brought to light.   Unfortunately, this isn't the only major concern that has emerged  during Julie Su's short time as U.S. Acting Secretary of Labor. At the  same time that children have been exploited in workplaces, Ms. Su has  failed to properly manage the H-2A program for bringing in temporary  agricultural workers on a legal basis.   Just this morning, House Education and the Workforce Committee  Chairwoman Virginia Foxx and I sent an oversight letter to Acting  Secretary Su regarding serious delays in the processing of H-2A  applications. In the letter we write: ``It has come to the attention of  the Committee on Education and the Workforce that employers applying  for labor certifications at the Department of Labor for H-2A  agricultural workers are facing substantial delays. These delays can be  tremendously harmful for American agriculture. The arrival of workers  can be delayed by weeks, causing inefficiencies and supply chain  disruptions. . . . The planting and harvesting windows offer only a  short amount of time to meet the season's needs. Our understanding is  that this worsening problem is caused by unnecessary and avoidable  delays at the Department of Labor.''   Incredibly, a Department of Labor official, Mike Rios, who serves as  regional agricultural enforcement director at the Wage and Hour  Division, is  [[Page H2625]]  quoted as saying this: ``You can see that the H-2A program literally is  the purchase of humans to perform difficult work under terrible  conditions, sometimes including subhuman living conditions.''   This is a bipartisan program that has been created and has existed  for a long time. But that is what he had to say about it. He is also  quoted as saying: ``You can throw a rock and hit a violation in the  agricultural industry.'' That is a strange thing for him to say  considering that it is his department and Julie Su's department, the  Department of Labor, that is responsible for preventing those sorts of  violations, for enforcing our labor laws.   Under Julie Su's leadership, the Department of Labor is failing to  protect workers, including children, is unfairly attacking America's  farmers, and is failing to support our agriculture sector's workforce  needs under a program authorized by Federal law.    She has been Acting Secretary for only a matter of months and was  Deputy Secretary for 2 years. In that time, she has directly  transferred her record of mismanagement from California to the rest of  the Nation.   I should say, in California right now, we have the Nation's largest  budget deficit. We have the Nation's second highest unemployment rate.  We have the Nation's lowest rate of income growth. We have the highest  rate of poverty. This is the direct result of the mismanagement and the  antiworker, antibusiness, antiopportunity policies from the likes of  Julie Su and Gavin Newsom.   With everything we now know, to elevate Ms. Su would be to take our  country down the failed path of California with eyes wide open. I urge  President Biden to choose a different course. It is past time to  withdraw this nomination.                     Fentanyl Trafficking Must Be Stopped     Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the Halt All Lethal  Trafficking of Fentanyl Act, which passed the House of Representatives  earlier today. This bill fixes a critical loophole and empowers law  enforcement to continue to have the tools they need to prevent fentanyl  distribution in communities across America.   We are seeing staggering amounts of fentanyl pour across the southern  border, flooding our communities with illicit and lethal pills, killing  tens of thousands of Americans every year. This is now the leading  cause of death for young people in our country; more than car  accidents, more than suicides, more than anything. It is affecting  every community in our country, including my own.   During the State of the Union a few months ago, I was honored to have  as my guests two of our Nation's leading advocates for fentanyl  awareness, the parents of a young man named Zach Didier, who tragically  lost his life to fentanyl. He was a senior at Whitney High School, a  standout student with no history of drug use, and from one pill, he  tragically lost his life. His parents had to go through the gut- wrenching experience of seeing him get letters in the mail accepting  him to some of our Nation's leading universities after he had passed  away. There is simply no doubt that addressing the fentanyl crisis will  save the lives of many of my constituents and of people in every  community in our country.                                time  1315    This act, the Halt All Lethal Trafficking of Fentanyl Act, is a major  step in that direction. In fact, the act itself is common sense.   Fentanyl is currently classified as a schedule I drug, which gives  the Drug Enforcement Administration the power to enforce and arrest  criminals involved in producing and distributing fentanyl. To avoid  prosecution, criminals have begun to manufacture drugs nearly  chemically identical to fentanyl.   Now, these drugs are just as deadly. They mimic fentanyl in every  way, but they don't fall under the technical definition of fentanyl.   In response, the Department of Justice and DEA temporarily classified  these fentanyl-related substances as schedule I drugs. This commonsense  act makes this temporary classification permanent rather than letting  it expire.   Giving law enforcement the tools they need to prosecute those  responsible and involved in the fentanyl crisis, from producers to  dealers, is a critical component of the multipronged approach needed to  save lives and stop fentanyl from destroying our communities. We know  this approach works.   After the DEA classified fentanyl-related substances as schedule I  drugs, law enforcement encounters of these fentanyl copycat drugs fell  by over 90 percent.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support a proven  measure that will save lives and to vote ``aye'' on the Halt All Lethal  Trafficking of Fentanyl Act, which just passed the House today with  bipartisan support and has the support of President Biden, as well.                         Replacing Senator Feinstein     Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the situation  surrounding the senior Senator from California, Dianne Feinstein.   The latest news is that our Governor, Gavin Newsom, is now talking  about appointing Oprah to the U.S. Senate as a replacement.   Now, Gavin Newsom has been talking about replacing Senator Feinstein  for over 2 years. He started publicly speculating in 2021 about who he  would replace, and at that point, Senator Feinstein was barely a third  of the way through her term.   California's other senator, Alex Padilla, himself first got his  office through appointment by Governor Newsom, so if there was, in  fact, an appointment for Senator Feinstein, then both of our U.S.  Senators would have been handpicked not by millions of voters but by a  single person to initially get their jobs.   At this moment, pressure is coming from all directions when it comes  to this situation and with a race for 2024 already underway. A number  of sitting Members of the House have actually overtly called on Senator  Feinstein to resign.   Ro Khanna said: ``It is time for Senator Feinstein to resign. We need  to put the country ahead of personal loyalty. While she has had a  lifetime of public service, it is obvious she can no longer fulfill her  duties. Not speaking out undermines our credibility as elected  representatives of the people.'' That is what he said.   We also had Congresswoman Tlaib, as well as Congresswoman Kamlager- Dove, make similar comments, urging the Senator to vacate her office.   The individual who is being supported by Congressman Khanna, Barbara  Lee, told KQED that she would accept an appointment to the job if  Governor Gavin Newsom offered it to her.   Meanwhile, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who, of course, herself is from  California, is supporting another candidate, Congressman Schiff, and  there have been a number of recent headlines related to this.   This comes from Politico, which says that Feinstein's primary  caregiver is Pelosi's daughter. The subheading says: ``A quiet  caretaking arrangement has raised questions about whether Nancy Pelosi  has the ailing Senator's personal interests at heart.''   Another headline from Washington Examiner: ``Pelosi's secret campaign  to aid Feinstein and get Schiff into the Senate.''   From FOX News: ``Pelosi's office denies her daughter is aiding  Feinstein to help Adam Schiff win a Senate seat.''   This is just a mess. None of it right now is about what is in the  interest of Senator Feinstein, the interest of our State, or the  interest of our country. It is all about politics.   I believe the solution is to do away with the possibility of a  gubernatorial appointment altogether. That way, Senator Feinstein can  make a decision on her own terms. She will know that whether she  finishes her term or whether she steps down before the end of her term,  it is California voters who will decide who her successor will be. That  is what will allow her to make a decision without all the distractions  of politics at the moment.   To that end, I have introduced a constitutional amendment doing away  with appointed Senators. Now, this would make it so the Senate is the  same as the House. You don't have any appointed Members of the House  who step onto this floor. Yet, you have had a lot of appointed  Senators. I want to make it the same way, that if you want to represent  your State as a United  [[Page H2626]]  States Senator, you need to be elected to do so.   Indeed, this is really an anachronism, this process of appointing  Senators in the case of a vacancy, and it has been subject to rampant  abuse.   We had Governor Rob Blagojevich go to prison after he essentially  auctioned off Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat. We have had Governors  who have appointed their family members, who have appointed their  spouses. Several Governors have even appointed themselves.   I am calling on Members of the House and Senate to join me in passing  that to do away with this anachronistic, antidemocratic process of  appointing Senators.   In the meantime, this almost certainly will not take effect prior to  the current situation with Senator Feinstein being resolved, so I am  calling on the California State Legislature, which has oversight  over election laws and itself is responsible for creating the procedure  for gubernatorial appointment, to address the situation.    There is actually a little bit of a backstory here. When Senator  Padilla was appointed to the Senate following the election of Kamala  Harris as Vice President, I raised an issue at the time with the  legality of that appointment. Actually, the California State  Legislative Analyst's Office, the legislative counsel's office in  California, agreed with me that it would not be constitutional for the  Governor to appoint a Senator who would then serve out the remainder of  Kamala Harris' term, which was set to expire in 2022.   The reason for that is that the Constitution, the 17th Amendment,  only allows temporary appointments. So, if you appoint someone who  serves the rest of the term, that is not temporary. That is permanent.   What the legislature did in response to the legal issue I raised, and  that the legislative counsel's office agreed with me on, is they passed  a bill to say that they will have a special election to determine who  the new Senator is going to be and who is going to finish the term, but  we are not going to have that special election until the next election.  That actually happened in November 2022 at the exact same time we held  the election for who would serve the new 6-year term.   It was an absurdity. We literally had the same election on the ballot  twice. One was for the new 6-year term, and the other was just for the  last couple of months, the lame duck portion of the existing term.   That was the way our legislature figured out to give basically as  much advantage to the Governor's chosen appointed Senator as possible  while still abiding by the letter, if not the spirit, of the 17th  Amendment.   What I have been in conversations with some members of the  legislature about is that they should change this law or, at the very  least, make an exception to it for the current situation with Senator  Feinstein, to say that if there is a vacancy, then there will not be an  appointment, that there will be an immediate special election, and that  is how the successor will be chosen for the remainder of Senator  Feinstein's term, which is set to expire in 2024.   I think that this is what will allow for fairness in the process of  choosing our next Senator. It will give millions of Californians a say,  rather than just one individual, and it will give Senator Feinstein the  ability to make a decision that is best for her, best for the State,  and best for the country.   I urge that action on the part of the California Legislature and  Governor.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
