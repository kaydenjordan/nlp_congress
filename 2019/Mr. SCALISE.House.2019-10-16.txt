 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of my colleague    Andy Biggs' resolution to censure Adam Schiff for the way he has  conducted this impeachment inquiry behind closed doors and in secret.   We have seen this pattern of misinformation time and time again,  where he throws out false information, like when he said he had more  than circumstantial evidence that the President colluded with Russia.  Then, after the Mueller report comes out, we find out there was no  collusion. Not once did he try, by the way, Mr. Speaker, to present  that evidence because there was no evidence.   Then he goes on and gives this false representation of the  whistleblower report. Of course, we now have seen the transcript. We  know what happened. There was no quid pro quo, even though he was  alleging quid pro quo.   Now he is holding meetings in secret, behind closed doors, to impeach  a President of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, we had an election in 2016; Donald Trump was elected. We  have another election next year, and the people will decide who the  President is, not Speaker Pelosi and not Adam Schiff behind closed  doors.   We need transparency, and we need to end this kangaroo court witch  hunt. Let's get back to the people's work here in this House.                            ____________________
