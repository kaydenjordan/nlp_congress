 Mr. Speaker, this has been one of the most productive  sessions of the U.S. House in modern history.   In less than 2 years, under Democratic leadership, the House has  passed more than 600 pieces of legislation responding to the urgent  priorities of the American people.   We have passed bills for the people, cracking down on corruption,  driving down healthcare costs, and raising wages for workers.   Many of these bills are bipartisan. All are commonsense approaches  for delivering results for working people.   But roughly 400 of these bills have been buried in Mitch McConnell's  legislative graveyard. He won't even give them a vote. His sole  purpose, it seems, is to pack the Federal judiciary with rightwing  judges who will rip away healthcare from 20 million people and  eliminate protections for people with preexisting conditions.   This is no way to run a democracy. The American people deserve  better. That is why House Democrats will keep fighting for the people  until these bills become law.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, for most of the past century, the United  States has led the world in the promotion of human rights. People from  all over the world have long come to America seeking refuge and a  better life. And in our best moments, we welcome them with open arms.   Yet under the Trump administration, immigrants have been met with  great hostility. On Trump's watch, children have been separated from  their families and endured unspeakable trauma in DHS custody.   In just the past few weeks, new and horrific allegations have emerged  about the use of forced sterilization on immigrant women by ICE,  allegations so serious and sickening, that they demand a swift and  thorough investigation.   According to one nurse who worked at the Irwin County Detention  Center in Georgia, immigrant women received unnecessary hysterectomies,  records were destroyed, and migrants were not tested for COVID-19.   In the words of one immigrant held at the facility, ``When I met all  these women who had surgeries, I thought this was like an experimental  concentration camp. It was like they are experimenting with our  bodies.''   Mr. Speaker, these allegations are horrifying.   If true, they are a gross violation of human rights and a violation  of the  [[Page H5649]]  most basic ethics that medical professionals are sworn to uphold.   What is more, there is a long history of forced sterilizations, like  the procedures found in these allegations, being used against people of  color, religious minorities, prisoners, individuals with disabilities,  and other vulnerable communities.   Such procedures are not only wrong, but they rise to the level of  gross human rights abuses.   That is why it is so important that these shocking and staggering  allegations be investigated now and anyone who participated in such  abuses be held fully accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I want to end by thanking all of my colleagues, but in  particular, my friend Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, a champion for  human rights here and around the world, someone who has led this effort  and authored H. Res. 1153 to condemn forced medical procedures on  individuals without their full, informed concept. I thank her for her  leadership and for this powerful message that we are sending to ICE and  to the world that we will not tolerate this kind of behavior.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, one of the stages of deprogramming cult members is to  point out the differences between the cult's ideology and reality. And  QAnon is a cult. In an effort to reach some of the people that have  fallen under its control, I would point out a few facts.   Mass shootings are not staged so that the government can come and  take away your guns.   John F. Kennedy, Jr., died more than 20 years ago in a tragic  aircraft accident. He is not in hiding, nor is he going to be President  Trump's running mate.   And President Trump is not fighting a secret war against a Satanic,  child-molesting network of politicians.   It is a sad statement that discussing such obvious absurdities is  occurring in this Chamber today, but the fact is, that some have  praised QAnon and encouraged the growth of this cult, even as the FBI  has labeled it a domestic terror threat.   And sadly, with the support of the White House, and even some Members  of Congress, QAnon has moved from the darkest corners of the internet  into the mainstream of today's political discourse.    This November, there will be 22 individuals on the ballot for the  House and the Senate who have either been endorsed by or lent credence  to QAnon. This is a threat to public safety and to our democracy as a  whole. This movement needs to be condemned and its followers need to be  brought back to reality, just as we would do with any other cult.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman Malinowski, for his  leadership on this resolution, for the hard work he did to make certain  that the condemnation of this dangerous cult is bipartisan. And I hope  all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this  resolution so we can send a message clearly and strongly to the  American people that this cult is dangerous for our public discourse,  dangerous for our democracy, and dangerous for our communities.
