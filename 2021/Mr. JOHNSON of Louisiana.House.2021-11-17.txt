 Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer much- deserved recognition to the group of faithful fathers known as Dads on  Duty, who have stepped up to serve as role models for the students at  Southwood High School in my hometown of Shreveport. Since the dads came  to school, instances of disruptive behavior have plummeted, and spirits  have been raised to new heights.   These Dads on Duty walk the halls every day and talk to students  about personal responsibility, self-discipline, and strong work ethic.  They are there to encourage the kids and set an example in their words  and in their actions. It is irrefutable the role that fathers play in  the life of a child. And now since these dads have made it a point of  engaging directly with the kids at Southwood, school fights haven't  been a problem, grades and attitudes have risen, and the whole Nation's  attention has been drawn to this inspirational endeavor.   They have made an incredible difference in the lives of everyone  involved. So we want to say thank you to the Dads on Duty for their  incredible work and extraordinary example. May it be duplicated  nationwide.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, during what should be a  period of sustained economic recovery, job growth has stalled, consumer  prices are skyrocketing, and many shelves are empty thanks to supply  chain chokepoints.   Nevertheless, House Democrats are forging ahead to pass their 2,100- page reckless tax and spending spree before they even know how it  impacts the budget and before the American people can understand even  what is in it, which is certain to drive up consumer prices even  further and make job growth that much harder.   Make no mistake, this bill is a clunker. If you can stomach the price  tag and look underneath the hood, you will see tax breaks for the rich;  you will see incentives to stay home instead of going back to work;  massive taxpayer subsidies for inefficient green energy sources; and  fewer cures for rare diseases.   The bill eliminates jobs. It reduces paychecks. It increases  government dependency. It crushes small businesses. It repeals  longstanding protections against taxpayer funding of abortions. And it  taxes American companies at a higher rate than Communist China. Yes,  that is all in the bill.   During our time this afternoon, in addition to the House Democrats'  disastrous left-wing agenda, my colleagues and I will be discussing the  many self-inflicted crises of the Biden administration. Whether it is  the most expensive Thanksgiving in history, inflation, skyrocketing gas  prices, or our overwhelmed southern border, one thing is for certain,  the answer to the countless Democrat-caused crises is not more  Democrat-authored policies.   I thank my colleagues for being here today, and I yield to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Florida ( Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for that  reminder that socialism never worked and never has. It is a fool's  errand.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. He is so  right about that. The hardworking American families are feeling the  pain from Tennessee all the way to California.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Obernolte), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Van  Drew).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of  the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. Midland  over Moscow, we ought to print T-shirts with that one.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Burchett), where they are deeply concerned about this as well.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's  adequate comments. And I will tell the gentleman that they are going to  have to amend and print new stickers for the gas pumps because if our  Democrat colleagues vote for this monstrosity, they are going to have  to make a new sticker that says, ``I and the House Democrats did  that.'' That is what is going down.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Madam Speaker, that voice from Georgia is  so  [[Page H6353]]  strong. I think we are going to stick with that theme.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Moore).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Carter for that  optimistic close. As Ronald Reagan said, we are the ``last best hope of  man on Earth.'' We better hold it.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs.  Miller).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend. It is a  shame that China is being assisted by these Democrat policies, even as  they openly challenge us. Another thing Ronald Reagan warned us about  is that weakness invites aggression. This is a dangerous game.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Bentz).    Madam Speaker, it will damage all of our  States.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for  prosecuting the case. That was his background.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining in the hour.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice).    The gentlewoman has said it very well.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).    I thank my friend for his common sense. We  will continue with that theme.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Any time a Bronze Star and Purple Heart  recipient speaks, we ought to listen.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline.)    We are going to feel the pain. My friend is  exactly right.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions).    Madam Speaker, that was so well said, and  the American people are going to speak again next fall; we know that  for certain.   Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Clyde).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I thank my friends for  participating tonight, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
