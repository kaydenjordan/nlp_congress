 Mr. Speaker, AM radio has been an integral part of  American history. From FDR's ``Fireside Chats'' to the Emergency Alert  System, the importance of this form of media, both culturally and  functionally, cannot be overstated.  [[Page H4036]]    Forty-one percent of Arkansans live in rural counties, and of those,  only 60 percent have access to standard broadband internet. Many of  these individuals have long and often hazardous commutes to work. Along  many of the beautiful back roads of my district, cell service is  oftentimes nonexistent or spotty at best.   I was glad to cosponsor, along with my friend Representative Josh  Gottheimer, bipartisan legislation, the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act  of 2023, that will require all new motor vehicles to have access to AM  radio in an attempt to put the safety of Americans first.   This access has and will continue to save lives during emergencies,  improve lives during travel, and support hardworking Americans all over  the Nation.                         Remembering Mary Mae Fisher     Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my deepest condolences  to the family and friends of Mrs. Mary Mae Fisher, who passed away on  Saturday.    Mary was an active member of the Dardanelle Rotary Club and  Dardanelle Chamber of Commerce, and she was a dedicated community  leader in both Dardanelle and Danville, Arkansas.   For over 50 years, Mary was the editor and publisher of the Yell  County Record and the Dardanelle Post Dispatch. Mary had a heart for  community service, and her mark on the Fourth District will not be soon  forgotten.   My prayers go out to her husband, David Fisher, and all Arkansans  mourning this loss.                       Honoring the Life of Mark Lowery     Mr. Speaker, I now invite two of my colleagues from  Arkansas, Mr. Crawford and Mr. Womack, to join me.   We are here today and rise to honor the life of former State  legislator and Arkansas Treasurer Mark Lowery. A Maumelle native, Mark  was a devoted public servant. He served as editor of the Maumelle  Monitor and the Sherwood Voice and taught communications at the  University of Central Arkansas and Henderson State University.   In 2013, Mark began his nearly 10-year career as a State legislator,  serving Arkansas's 39th District, where I had the pleasure of serving  alongside him. Although his time as State treasurer was short, he was  passionate about serving our State.   On behalf of the Arkansas delegation, I want to express our deepest  condolences to his family, friends, and staff during this time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Womack).    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 614, I call  up the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 9) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service relating to  ``Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Lesser Prairie- Chicken; Threatened Status With Section 4(d) Rule for the Northern  Distinct Population Segment and Endangered Status for the Southern  Distinct Population Segment'', and ask for its immediate consideration  in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on S.J. Res. 9.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 9, sponsored by Senator  Marshall of Kansas. This bipartisan resolution will protect voluntary  conservation while eliminating the litigation-driven listing of the  lesser prairie-chicken.   Last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a final rule  listing the lesser prairie-chicken as an endangered species. The rule  created two distinct population segments. In the northern segment,  which covers Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and the Texas panhandle, the  lesser prairie-chicken will be considered threatened in that area,  while in the southern segment, which covers New Mexico and west Texas,  it would be considered endangered.   The lesser prairie-chicken is a boom-and-bust species that is  extremely susceptible to precipitation in its native range. Simply put,  when it rains the lesser prairie-chicken populations grow, and in  droughts their populations often shrink.   To ensure a healthy lesser prairie-chicken population, a private,  voluntary conservation effort, known as the range-wide plan, was  developed and implemented in 2013. At the time, the Fish and Wildlife  Service declared that the voluntary conservation efforts being  undertaken to be an unprecedented collaborative effort that produced a  sound conservation plan for the lesser prairie-chicken.   As part of the range-wide plan, voluntary conservation agreements  were formed that allow private landowners and businesses who operate on  Federal lands to implement voluntary measures to conserve habitat.  These programs have proven to be successful with private industry  investing $65 million into species conservation and nearly 6 million  acres of habitat conserved for the lesser prairie-chicken.   These investments have produced results. They have resulted in  population growth from less than 20,000 birds in 2013 to more than  35,000 birds in 2020. However, the listing puts all of the volunteer  conservation efforts to date in jeopardy.   The unavoidable truth about the ESA is that a listing means less  private investment which harms conservation efforts.   Mr. Speaker, some people might ask why is it so important that we  talk about the lesser prairie-chicken on the House floor?   Some people might say: Why on Earth would the Fish and Wildlife  Service move a species from threatened to endangered that went from  20,000 to 35,000 in its population in less than 10 years because of  conservation efforts?   What would inspire the Fish and Wildlife Service to do such a thing?   Mr. Speaker, you would think that if a species were increasing, they  wouldn't go from threatened to endangered, they would go the other way.  However, I think this map behind me tells the motivation behind the  Biden administration and the motivation behind this U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service to make the lesser prairie-chicken not threatened but  endangered.   Mr. Speaker, you see the two ranges here, the northern range where  they would remain threatened and the southern range where they would be  listed as endangered.   So what is so unique about these areas?   It happens to be where the largest production of oil and gas in  America is located. The area that this Fish and Wildlife Service  decided to make the lesser prairie-chicken endangered is in the Permian  Basin--not just the Permian Basin, but the Delaware Basin and the  Permian Basin. It is the richest deposit of oil in our country.   So this is just a tool for the Fish and Wildlife Service to go  implement the Biden administration's none-of-the-above energy policy,  except their handpicked energy policies, and it is another attack on  low-cost energy for the American taxpayer. It is an attack on jobs in  America, and at the same time it is weakening our national security. It  is making us more dependent on member countries of OPEC, on Russia, and  on OPEC+, like Venezuela, all because this administration is using  every tool in the tool pouch to stop oil and gas and low-cost energy  and safe energy production on U.S. lands and waters.   We just had a hearing this morning in the Natural Resources Committee  about how BOEM has delayed the 5-year plan in the Gulf of Mexico and  the earliest we could get a new sale in the Gulf of Mexico is 2026.  That is the result of this Biden administration energy policy.   The ESA should be about protecting endangered species and about  restoring habitat for endangered species. It shouldn't be something  used that is going to attack the very heart of our economy and our  energy production, that is going to harm our national security, and  that at the end of the day it is just going to make prices higher for  Americans.   That is why it is important to talk about something like the lesser  prairie-chicken on the House floor because this administration made a  rule--Congress didn't make a rule--this administration made a rule that  said they are going to list the species as endangered that has shown  dramatic increases in population.    Voluntary conservation is working, and this listing puts that at  risk. That is why repealing the Biden administration's listing of the  prairie-chicken is crucial.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would say the only science that went  into this decision by Fish and Wildlife was political science. It is  all about this administration's attack on American energy.   People all around the world are going to die as a result of food  shortages from this administration's attack on natural gas. Natural gas  is the main ingredient in fertilizer, and fertilizer is the main  ingredient in agriculture.   These are serious problems that have huge impacts to society. That is  why it is important that we push back on these ridiculous rules that  the administration makes.   Do you think we enjoy coming out on the House floor and speaking  about prairie-chickens and bats?   Not necessarily, but when an administration uses that for a weapon  against the energy production in this country, then somebody has to  speak out against it and has to speak out for the rural communities and  the workers across this country.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, again, this move by Fish and Wildlife is  actually going to hurt the population of the lesser prairie-chicken  because it is going to disincentivize private investment that is shown  to work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Jackson).    Mr. Speaker, when an administration takes bad actions,  then Congress has to take extreme measures to pull back the power that  has been granted to the administration.   I gladly stand behind the statement that it is time for Congress to  reel back that power that the administration is abusing.   It is not just me saying that. It is also a Democrat-controlled  Senate that sent this bill to the House with Democrat votes in the  Senate.   We need to put it on President Biden's desk and let him answer to the  American people on what he is going to do about truly protecting  endangered species and what he is going to do about energy production  in America.   Speaking of energy production in America and agriculture in America,  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), who knows  a lot about both.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Mann).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let's talk about inflation a little bit. My colleagues  across the aisle want to talk about inflation. They know a lot about it  because they passed laws that put inflation on a steady increase here  in our country.   This so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which around D.C. is called  the Green New Deal, put money into the economy to push their agenda  that has caused prices to increase across the country. Now the  administration is doing things like listing species that shouldn't be  listed so they can attack American energy even more and drive up  inflation even more.   America needs energy. The world needs energy. Attacking domestic  energy doesn't mean that the demand for energy is going away. It just  means somebody else in the world is going to produce it.   Through their great idea of the Inflation Reduction Act to build a  lot of windmills and solar farms, they are now taking American wealth  and exporting it to China so we can buy those solar panels and  windmills and the components.   China has hoarded the world's resources on minerals and rare earth  elements which go into all of this technology. We have that here in  America, but it is a not-in-my-backyard policy that my friends across  the aisle want to implement. They turn a blind eye to what goes on in  the rest of the world that affects the climate and want to put all of  the burden on America and on American taxpayers when America is leading  the world in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Arrington), who knows just how devastating rules like this can be to  the fine people that he represents in west Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes), who lives right in the heart of lesser prairie- chicken country.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time and  am prepared to close. I continue to reserve.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Republicans care about the environment. The word ``conservation'' is  derived from the word ``conservative,'' and a true conservative is one  who is a good steward of the environment and takes care of what we have  got so it will be better in the future.   This rule by the Fish and Wildlife Service listing the lesser  prairie-chicken is not about conservation. It is about moving a  political agenda.   I had the great opportunity to study forestry at--Yale School of the  Environment, as it is now called--Yale Forest School. There was  somebody who went through that program decades before I did. His name  was Aldo Leopold. He is quoted probably as often as anybody in the  world of conservation. One of my favorite quotes of his is: ``There are  two spiritual dangers in not owning a farm. One is the danger of  supposing that breakfast comes from the grocery, and the other that  heat comes from the furnace.''   How applicable that is today in the world that we live in where you  have got an urban America that doesn't realize what rural America  provides for the rest of the country. They really think food comes from  the grocery store and energy comes from the plug-in or heat comes from  the furnace without giving any thought to where that comes from.   When you keep attacking the very people who are providing the food  and the energy for this country, some day you are going to go to the  grocery store and there is not going to be food there. You are going to  try to flip on the light switch, and the lights aren't going to come  on. You are going to be in a cold winter, and there is not going to be  heat. Ask people in Europe who got dependent on Russia for their energy  about what it means to have energy shortages. This is serious business.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to think about the American farmer  and rancher and the oil and gas worker who are living in this species'  range. They are people who wake up before dawn and go to bed late at  night, working to provide food and energy for the American people, who  have likely made substantial investments to modify their operations to  benefit the lesser prairie-chicken and has contributed to the  successful recovery of the species; somebody who does the right thing-- they do it day in and day out--yet the Federal Government comes in and  says: That is not good enough.    To the extremist environmental community, it does not matter that the  lesser prairie-chicken numbers are increasing and millions of acres and  hard-earned dollars have been voluntarily contributed toward benefiting  the species. They pay no mind to the conservation efforts of these  hardworking men and women. Instead, they seek to wield the ESA as a  hammer to separate the people from the land and their way of life.   The ESA hammer has come down, and flexibility is gone. That is both  unfair and unjust, and at the end of the day, it is going to hurt the  very people who are pushing these rules, who think, again, that  breakfast comes from the grocery and heat comes from the furnace. They  are putting so many burdens on the men and women of this country who  provide those things. These are the men and women who didn't work from  home during COVID. They went to their job every day so that the world  could keep going around, yet they are highly unappreciated and are  attacked every day in this country.   This bipartisan CRA, which again was passed by the Senate and sent  here, will put an end to the Biden administration's unjust listing  decision. I ask my colleagues to support this resolution and return  sanity to the ESA decisionmaking process.   Let's make the ESA something that is really about restoring habitat  and helping endangered species, not using animals as a tool to move  political agendas.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage support of the CRA, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 614, I  call up the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 24) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service relating to  ``Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Endangered Species  Status for Northern Long-Eared Bat'', and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S.J. Res. 24.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 24 sponsored by Senator  Mullin of Oklahoma. This resolution will ensure that the northern long- eared bat remains protected as a threatened species under the  Endangered Species Act.   Last November, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced it would  uplist the bat from threatened to endangered. The Service freely admits  that a disease known as white-nose syndrome, not human activity, is the  bat's main threat.   Why is that relevant? The bat's habitat spans 37 States. Uplisting  the species will increase the bureaucratic red tape critical  infrastructure and forest management projects will have to go through.   Yet, because a fungal disease is its main threat, those actions will  not help the bat. Actually, the actions by Fish and Wildlife will hurt  the bat.   The Service is pursuing a preservationist approach to recovering the  species by restricting forest management activities, an approach that  will prove to be unlikely to benefit the bat but is guaranteed to leave  our forests unmanaged, unhealthy, and vulnerable to catastrophic events  such as wildfires.   Non-forest management projects, such as roads, bridges, and pipelines  that travel through the bat's habitat, will also face bureaucratic red  tape. In fact, the Service has identified over 3,000 projects that will  require additional permits to operate due to the uplisting.   In my home State of Arkansas, we have a few million acres of Federal  land, and we do a great job managing that land. Our Federal land  managers will now be focused on the bat instead of managing the habitat  that is actually good for the bat.   An example of this is what was done on Federal land in Arkansas to  help restore the red-cockaded woodpecker, which is an endangered  species.   As you can see by this poster, this is what the forest looks like  unmanaged. You see management activity of thinning and burning, and you  end up with a habitat that is an open, savanna-type forest that is  actually a good habitat for the bat. It is a good habitat for the red- cockaded woodpecker.   With these practices put in place, not only has the woodpecker  thrived, but so too have the bobwhite quail, wild turkey, deer, a  flourish of new vegetation, and more biodiversity for plant and animal  species, all because of good management practices.   They now capture red-cockaded woodpeckers from this land and relocate  them to other places. This is a success story, much like other  management activities that we saw with the lesser prairie-chicken in  the last bill we debated.   When U.S. Fish and Wildlife comes in with an uplisting, it will stop  the management, and it will actually create worse habitat for the bat,  as well as many other species. This is hurting--let me repeat, this is  hurting--an endangered species more than it is helping an endangered  species.   None of the actions Fish and Wildlife has proposed will address the  bat's main threat, which is white-nose syndrome.   I want to be clear: The CRA will not remove the bat from the  endangered species list. Instead, it returns the species to its  previous status as threatened. This approach will allow States to  continue their efforts to develop effective, voluntary conservation  agreements to benefit the northern long-eared bat as a species while  also ensuring the long-term viability of local communities.   To date, 6 of the 37 States in the bat's range have developed habitat  conservation plans to benefit the bat while providing reasonable  assurances to stakeholders that forest management and infrastructure  projects can continue. These plans should continue to be developed and  implemented.   Again, this is a bipartisan resolution that was sent to us from the  Senate. The Democrat-controlled Senate sent us this bill. It is now our  obligation to pass this bill and send it to President Biden so that he  can sign it into law and stop this egregious action by Fish and  Wildlife, which continues to go above and beyond their authority--which  has been given to them by Congress--by making rules that are based on  political science, not real science.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, we talk about the northern long-eared bat, this  generation's version of the spotted owl from the West Coast.   What happened with the spotted owl? Radical groups, which were,  again, using political science instead of real science, got the spotted  owl listed, and they shut down most of the timber industry on the West  Coast.   Guess who the largest importer of timber in the world is today. The  good old United States. We import more timber than anybody else while  we watch wildfires devastate these lands in the West that were  ``protected'' so we could save the spotted owl.   We have not saved the spotted owl and restored its habitat on our  public lands. It is private landowners who are doing the management to  create the habitat that benefits the spotted owl.   This is just another attempt by the Biden administration to kowtow to  radical environmental groups and use this as a weapon to stop timber  production, stop mining, and stop construction projects.   They are not focusing on the bat. They are not focusing on the real  problem of white-nose syndrome. They are using the bat as a tool to  stop the things that make America strong, that put America first.   They are using these tools in the next gentleman's district, and he  can talk firsthand about how these burdensome regulations hurt his  constituents.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Stauber).                                time  1430     Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Minnesota.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, as Republicans, we care about Americans, American  companies, American small businesses, and American workers. My  colleagues across the aisle were talking about the record profits of  U.S. oil and gas companies. Well, they might need to read the news a  little bit deeper and look at the profits of Aramco, the Saudi-owned  oil company.   There was an article in March of this year that said that Aramco's  profits were $161 billion, `` . . . the largest annual profit ever  recorded by an oil and gas company. . . .'' Aramco, the Saudi-owned  company. The Saudis, the ones President Biden went to and begged them  to send us more oil because of his attack on energy here in America.  Look who now has the largest profits of any oil company in the history  of the world.   That is what these kinds of policies add up to. It is a thousand  cuts. It is death by a thousand cuts. It is using every rule, every  opportunity that they have to attack American energy, which makes  America less strong, which feeds into the hands of our adversaries.  Instead of us dominating energy, we become dependent on others to  supply energy--OPEC and OPEC+ countries.   How does Putin fund his war in Ukraine? He funds it with high  revenues off his oil and gas. We can change that. We can produce more  gas and export it to our allies in Europe, but not under this  administration, not when they are promoting rules like the lesser  prairie-chicken, the northern long-eared bat. They don't do a 5-year  plan, they don't do leases on Federal lands or Federal waters. It is an  all-out attack on American energy. This is just another spoke in the  wheel, another cut against the American people, against the American  economy, and against the future of our country.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Thompson), chairman of the Ag Committee, who knows a little bit  about the northern long-eared bat.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse), the chairman of the Congressional Western  Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, we have heard it said, this won't affect  the timber industry. This won't affect the construction activities of  the country, and I am sure this was said back in the 1990s when the  spotted owl was listed. This won't affect the timber companies. Go tell  that to the mill towns on the West Coast that were devastated by this  weaponized rule.   This, again, is just another attempt by the Biden administration to  use whatever tool they can to go against the things that they oppose.  It is not based on science. It is based on--it is science, it is  political science, that they are trying to push an agenda. I don't  understand why they are trying to push this agenda.   Why do they not want America to succeed? Why do they not want rural  America to be able to supply the goods and the services that this  country depends on?   It is another obstacle that they will use as a weapon that is not  going to help the long-eared bat. It is not going to help other  species. It is actually going to hurt them when we stop management on  our Federal lands and also on private lands where these bats are  located.   Again, this is something that is important. It shouldn't be  downplayed. I think it is an affront to rural America to say this isn't  an important issue, and I think it is an affront to all Americans, even  those that believe that breakfast comes from the grocery store and heat  comes from the furnace, that don't appreciate the hardworking men and  women across this country that provide those things.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time and I am prepared to  close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We are having productive talks with our commonsense friends across  the aisle on permitting reform. We made some progress in the debt limit  bill, and putting some sideboards on NEPA, on pushing back against  these out-of-control agencies that are delaying projects.   I would just caution my friends on the other side of the aisle that  these rules that are based on a political agenda can cut both ways.  Those rules can be used to stop projects that my friends would support,  as well as stopping ones that they don't like.    It almost seems like there is this atmosphere of stopping everything.  It is what I call the preservationist approach. I believe the central  question facing us today is do we support a preservationist approach to  not just recovering the northern long-eared bat, or do we support a  conservationist approach?   I wholeheartedly believe that a conservationist approach is what will  be most successful in maintaining bat habitat, in maintaining lesser  prairie-chicken habitat, and helping all of our endangered species if  we will actively work for conservation to create habitat that supports  these species.   A preservationist approach will do nothing. It is basically this idea  that we take a hands-off approach. We put an invisible fence around our  public lands and these habitat areas and just hope for the best.   I often tell people that when you talk about conservation, you are  talking about being a good steward. It is like being a gardener. It is  like taking care of what you have got, leaving the Earth in a better  place than you found it for future generations.   A preservationist wants to lock up the natural world and say we are  going to keep it here like that piece of art on the wall. I say that  conservation is for critters and preservation is for pickles.   The only way we preserve the outdoors with nature that is a living  dynamic organism--it is like when you pluck a cucumber and you boil it  in vinegar and you put it in a jar, you preserve it. That is not going  to work for species habitat. It is not going to work for rural America  that provides the necessities that our country needs.                                time  1500    The preservationist approach benefits no one, least of all the  northern long-eared bat. By returning the status of the bat to  threatened, Congress will be telling this administration that it  believes in conservation, not preservation. Again, I remind this  Chamber, this is a bipartisan bill that was sent to the House from a  Democratic-controlled Senate.   We should pass this CRA, which would put it on President Biden's  desk. If he cares about America, especially if he cares about rural  America, he should sign this and stop his out-of-control  administration.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the CRA, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
