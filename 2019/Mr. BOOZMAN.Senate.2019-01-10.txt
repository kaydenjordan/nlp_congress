 Mr. President, today I wish to remember and pay  tribute to Dick Barclay. Dick was a friend and civic leader from  Rogers, AR, who passed away from complications due to Alzheimer's last  week at the age of 81.   Born in Oberlin, KS, Dick attended Kansas State University before his  honeymoon brought him to Arkansas. Dick and Jan eventually moved to  Rogers where Dick, along with his brother Charles, opened a successful  public accounting firm that served the area for decades. When I first  moved to Rogers in the 1970s, naturally, Dick was one of the first  people I met and someone I quickly grew to lean on and turn to for his  consistently sound advice.   In addition to his successful career as a trusted accountant in  northwest Arkansas, Dick put his belief in community service into  practice throughout his entire life. He served in the Arkansas House of  Representatives from 1976 until 1992. In 1996, he joined Governor Mike  Huckabee's administration, where he put his financial expertise to use  as executive director of budget, legislative affairs, and policy. He  went on to become Arkansas's chief fiscal officer and directed the  Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration in 1999.   Dick didn't believe that holding public office alone was where his  call to service ended, though. He was active among many different  groups and organizations that worked to improve life in Rogers and in  greater northwest Arkansas. A few such roles included serving on the  board of the Northwest Arkansas Community College Foundation, as  president and board member of the Rogers Little Theater, chairman of  the Rogers-Lowell Chamber of Commerce, commissioner of the Arkansas  Economic Development Commission, member and president of the Northwest  Arkansas Council, and chairman of the Arkansas State Chamber of  Commerce. He also led the Benton County Republican Party for a time.   A man of strong faith, Dick was a board chair and elder at First  Christian Church in Rogers. One of his sons went on to lead services at  Fellowship Bible Church, and Dick, along with his wife, was proud to  attend services there to show his support. He has already been  remembered by others as being a devoted family man and a person of  principle and integrity with the highest ethics. He was all these  things and more, including a talented musician who played in a  bluegrass band with friends and also performed with a barbershop  quartet.   As a former colleague described him, Dick Barclay was a  ``quintessential public servant.'' He had a tremendous impact across  northwest Arkansas. His example of leadership and dedication are truly  worthy of emulation by anyone who wishes to do the important work  required to better their own town, community, and entire state.   I greatly admired and respected Dick and will feel his loss keenly,  as will so many others in Rogers and throughout Benton County and  northwest Arkansas. My thoughts and prayers are with Jan and the entire  Barclay family at this difficult time. Dick's legacy of service, his  ever-present positivity, and the difference he made in countless lives  will be remembered for years to come.                            ____________________
