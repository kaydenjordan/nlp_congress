 Mr. Speaker, today in Franklin,  Pennsylvania, an American hero will be laid to rest. Mr. Andrew A.  Kistler, past commander of the Disabled American Veterans, died on  March 9 in Erie, Pennsylvania. He was 88 years old.   Andy Kistler was a tireless advocate for disabled veterans not only  in Pennsylvania, but nationally. A Korean war veteran who was almost  mortally wounded Christmas week in 1952, he lost both of his legs, a  finger, and a concussion put him into a deep coma.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with you the words of the late  Korean war medic and journalist Chris Farlekas. He helped save Andy  Kistler, a 21-year-old baseball player from Franklin who arrived at the  11th Evacuation Hospital for care. I quote from this letter:   ``The ward was crammed with casualties, and every helicopter that  landed outside the tent brought even more. The doctor said Andy was too  far gone, that he would die.   ``But something inside me said no.   ``I still don't completely understand my ferocity in needing Andy to  live. Maybe it was because I'd seen so much death already in the 4  months that I'd been in the war, holding frightened, dying young men as  they talked about home. Andy was my test case with God. If he lived,  I'd believe. If not, tough.   ``So for 3 days I sat with Andy, willing him to live.   ``On Christmas Eve, several of the nurses, doctors, and corpsmen went  through the 11th Evac, singing Christmas carols. At exactly midnight,  they came to the shock ward and sang `Silent Night.' It may have  sounded a little ragged, off-pitch, but to me it was absolutely  beautiful, angelic.   ``As I listened, Andy came out of the coma, opened his eyes, grabbed  my hand, and softly sang, `All is calm, all is bright.' The doctors  said it was a miracle.''   Andy and Chris spoke about that glorious moment in the PBS  documentary, ``Korean War Stories,'' produced in 2002.  [[Page H1615]]    Andy, a double amputee, went on to be a major force for the American  veterans as head of the Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit that  provides a lifetime of support for veterans and their families. With  almost 1,300 chapters and more than a million members across the  country, DAV empowers our Nation's heroes and their families by helping  to provide the resources they need and ensuring our Nation keeps the  promises that were made to them.   Mr. Speaker, Andy said he sometimes found himself humming or singing  ``Silent Night'' in odd moments, ``like when I'm shaving,'' he told  Chris. I know that as friends and family say good-bye to a true  American hero today in Franklin, all is calm, all is bright.   May God bless Andy Kistler, whose service to this Nation will be long  remembered, and may he rest in peace.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Penn  State students for their fight against pediatric cancer.   THON, a 46-hour dance marathon, took place February 16 through 18,  and students raised $10,151,663 for the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn  State Children's Hospital. Four Diamonds ensures that families that are  battling pediatric cancer are not faced with any costs, allowing them  to fully focus on the needs of their child.   THON is the largest student-run student philanthropy in the world,  but it all began in 1973 by a group of students looking to add  excitement to a dreary February in central Pennsylvania and for a way  to give back to the community. Today, THON engages more than 15,000  students each year and has inspired other university, high school,  middle school, and elementary school students across the Nation to  start dance marathons of their own, all in hopes of conquering  pediatric cancer.  [[Page H1646]]    Mr. Speaker, I am in awe of the power of our Penn State students and  their care and concern for others, and I thank them for this  outstanding contribution to the community.                            ____________________
