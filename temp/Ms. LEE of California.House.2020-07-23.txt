 Madam Speaker, first of all, let me just say,  I rise today to support not only my colleague, Congresswoman Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez, but I rise in strong support of this privileged  resolution.   As an African-American woman, first let me just say that I personally  have experienced a lifetime of insults, racism, and sexism. And believe  you me, Madam Speaker, this did not stop after being elected to public  office.   It is past time that this body understands that women of color are  here to stay. Congresswoman AOC is here to stay. It is past time that  this House recognizes that women will not tolerate these personal  attacks and insist that we be treated with the respect due to anyone in  this House representing over 700,000 people.   The impact of using this language against any woman dehumanizes women  and girls and sends the message to other men that women are valued less  than a human being.   Now, my mentor, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm from Brooklyn, New  York, was the first Black woman elected to Congress. As a member of the  late Congressman Ron Dellums' staff, I spent many years on Capitol Hill  and witnessed the personal attacks and curse words against her as a  Black female Member of Congress.   But do you know what, Madam Speaker? Just like the gentlewoman, she  would not tolerate such behavior, and she had to fight, oftentimes  alone, against such despicable language and behavior.   Well, we are here today with the Congresswoman. We are here  supporting her right to speak out, to represent her constituents, and  to be who she is: a brave and bold Member of Congress, which we know  her to be.   Now, the gentleman from Florida, yes, he must apologize to the  Congresswoman. He must apologize, though, to all the little girls who  aspire to be who they are without being called disgusting names and  without barriers to keep their voices silent.   Madam Speaker, I close with reading you just one verse of our beloved  Dr. Maya Angelou's poem, ``Still I Rise.'' I am reminded of the  gentlewoman today.       You may shoot me with your words,      You may cut me with your eyes,      You may kill me with your hatefulness,      But still, like air, I'll rise.    So, yes, the Congresswoman has risen once again.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend,  Congresswoman Shalala, for her tremendous work and support. Her  leadership certainly is warranted and necessary and needed right at  this moment in our country's history.   Let me first take a moment to thank Congresswoman Nita Lowey for her  years of leadership both on the full Committee on Appropriations as  well as the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  Subcommittee.   Over the years, the chairwoman has been a steadfast and effective  advocate for a humane and generous American role in the world,  especially through her work to expand education, especially for girls  and women, focused on creating many opportunities for millions of girls  around the world.   I will miss Chairwoman Lowey, but I just want to say that her legacy  as our chair is going to remain very close to all of us, and it will  remind us of the work which we must continue for future generations.   I serve as the vice chair of our State, Foreign Operations, and  Related Programs subcommittee and as a member of the Agriculture  Committee. I rise to support this rule, which provides for the  consideration----    Madam Speaker, I rise to support this rule. It  provides for the consideration of appropriations bill and contains the  emergency funds to respond to the impact of COVID around the world and  also to ensure that our diplomacy and development programs can sustain  their efforts in the face of this pandemic.   I am pleased that we provide almost $6 billion for PEPFAR, including  $1.5 billion for the Global Fund. We provide $55 million for UNFPA,  and, yes, we repeal the global gag rule.    Madam Speaker, let me just be very quick in  terms of just laying out why I support this rule again.   We provide $55 million for UNFPA and $68 billion for SNAP, which is  extremely important now, with so many people needing food security  falling through the cracks.   We provide $90 billion for veterans' health and more than a half  billion to get lead out of drinking water, which really, in this  country, should be no more. It is a shame and a disgrace.   And as we consider this rule, I urge my colleagues to examine the  appropriations bill through the lens of racial justice. These bills  contain important provisions that respond to this moment in American  history when people are marching in the streets to demand that our  country dismantle systemic racism.   So I ask that we look at these bills and understand that equity has  got to be so much a part of our funding priorities.   Madam Speaker, I support this rule, and I hope we adopt the important  funding in this package.                                time  1200
