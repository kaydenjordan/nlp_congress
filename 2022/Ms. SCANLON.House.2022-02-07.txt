 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, sexual harassment and violence in the workplace are a  corrosive and pervasive threat to the success and dignity of all  workers, but particularly women. And forced or mandatory arbitration  clauses in employment contracts have played an important role in  thwarting efforts to hold accountable the predators who engage in such  conduct and the companies that allow it to continue.   The widespread use of these clauses in employment contracts forces  many Americans to agree to a form of dispute resolution that silences  victims of sexual harassment and assault and allows the harassers and  employers to escape accountability. These arbitration proceedings  overwhelmingly benefit the employer, which drafts the nonnegotiable  clauses dictating the venue, the terms of mediation, even the  arbitrators themselves, as well as creating a perverse incentive for  the allegedly neutral arbiters to rule in favor of employers, lest they  not be hired again.   In addition to denying survivors a public forum to expose sexual  abuse, which can deter future misconduct, these arbitration clauses  also preclude class actions, which is often the only way that employees  can afford to bring successful claims.   H.R. 4445 would ban the use of forced arbitration in employment  contracts in cases of sexual assault and harassment. In addition to  protecting survivors of such harassment, that is just good public  policy.
