 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, often here in Washington, it can be  difficult to focus on what counts.   We live in an information environment which is increasingly atomized  and persistently polarized. Almost all will inevitably focus on who is  up and who is down in the endless cycle of partisan gamesmanship. News  cycles come and news cycles go. Poll numbers jump, then fall, then jump  again, and fall again, but nobody should forget that what really  matters around here, at the end of the day, is policy, and the first  year of unified Republican government has delivered plenty of that.   In 2016, the American people faced a stark choice. The Republicans  promised a new era of deregulation and limited government--a new policy  approach that would entrust free markets and free citizens to drive us  forward. The Democrats, on the other hand, renewed and restated their  faith in the effectiveness of government, centered here in Washington,  to direct and command the national welfare. The American people spoke  loudly, and they spoke decisively. The Republicans were given the reins  and were instructed to sort all of this out.   Nobody needs to remind me that elections are the beginning of the  challenge, not the end. The Republicans may have prevailed in the  campaign, but an election won is nothing more than an opportunity  seized. It is nothing more than a charge to carry out the promises  offered on the trail, and that is precisely what we are doing.   Here in the Senate, despite fits and starts, we are moving the ball  forward. Notwithstanding often vicious treatment by the media and the  constant obstruction of the Democrats here in Congress, we are getting  work done. Promises made in 2016 have become promises kept in 2017. The  American people were promised the removal of redtape and infuriating  bureaucratic encumbrances on economic growth. As soon as we took office  in early 2017, we moved to do just that.   We confirmed Neomi Rao as the Administrator of the Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs. Under her stewardship, the  Executive has cut over a dozen old rules for every single new rule  created. Regulation has been subjected to actual cost-savings analysis,  and, likely, billions have been saved in the process.   Here in Congress we passed a dozen CRAs to cut down on costly and  ineffective rules passed in the twilight hours of the Obama  administration. The list of deregulatory items speaks for itself:  restoration of free markets and free competition on internet, done; new  environmental policy to unleash the potential of American energy  production, done; reform of public lands designation and renewal of  State and local control over western territories, done; Labor  Department reform that restores bargaining power to employees and  employers rather than unions and bureaucrats, done. On nearly every  front, from education to justice issues and everything in between,  there has been substantial progress.   Personnel are often the catalyst to policy, and we still have  nominations in several agencies to come. The Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau is in good hands with Mick Mulvaney and will  eventually be handed off to a capable permanent Director. Federal Trade  Commission nominations should be arriving shortly, and just recently  the  [[Page S8190]]  Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported the next Director of  the USPTO, Andrei Iancu. As a longtime champion of intellectual  property rights, and head of the High-Tech Task Force, I encourage my  colleagues to swiftly confirm him to this post.   Overall, this President has delivered on his nominations, and his  nominees have delivered on his promises. While I am on the topic of  nominations, I want to talk about the judiciary. Controversy seems to  be swirling, due to a few recent--and I would say unfortunate--bumps in  the road, but we must not miss the forest no matter how much the press  would like to harken on a few of the trees. The accomplishments of this  administration and Senate in addressing the judiciary have been  historic.   Neil Gorsuch was a superb choice for the Supreme Court. At a critical  juncture for our courts, he stands poised to seize the mantle left by  Justice Antonin Scalia and carry the cause of originalism and  textualism forward for a new generation, but Justice Gorsuch was only  the beginning. From the circuit courts to the district courts, judicial  nominations across the board have really been outstanding. We have  confirmed more circuit court nominees this year than in any President's  first year in American history.   We accomplished this despite Democrats using their time-tested  obstruction tactics and even coming up with some new ones. They forced  us to take 18 cloture votes on judicial nominees alone this year,  compared to just one cloture vote during the first year of all previous  Presidents combined. Nevertheless, we got the job done. The results  will be felt for decades to come.   Whatever our differences on other issues, conservatives across the  board heartily approve of the way this administration has handled  judicial nominations.   I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate Judiciary  Committee, as well as Leader McConnell, to confirm these judges. As the  rest of our agenda gains steam, judicial selection will remain the  vanguard. There are more judges to come this new year, and we are going  to keep on confirming them. Each and every week, a new trial or  appellate court judge will add to the ranks of a rapidly improving  judiciary.   Finally, on the legislative front, this administration and Republican  Congress have just delivered the most consequential and far-reaching  tax reform package in 30 years. When other administrations and other  sessions of Congress couldn't get it done, we did. Individuals will see  their tax rates drop. Businesses, from large corporations that employ  thousands to small businesses paying passthrough rates, will enjoy new  capital for investment, expansion, and more. In fact, seemingly to the  dismay of our Democratic colleagues, businesses are already responding  to the good news with announcements of bonuses and new ventures, and  that is just the beginning.   On top of it all, the individual mandate has been repealed and  ObamaCare is now firmly on its way out, thank goodness. Despite earlier  difficulties, we are well on our way toward repeal. As we move toward  2018, we can look forward to additional policy success on everything  from entitlements to infrastructure to immigration.   In conclusion, I don't want to hear anyone claim that this President  and this Congress have not gotten things done. Promises were made and  promises were kept. Only a year into things, we are making good on our  pledge for historic change in Washington.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, I would like to offer a  few words of support for the nomination of Ryan Nelson to be the  Solicitor for the Department of Interior.   Mr. Nelson has a distinguished legal background. He has worked in  both the private and public sector, including in all three branches of  the Federal Government. Most importantly, he is respected by those  members of the Idaho State Bar who know him best.   He has been endorsed by numerous colleagues representing a broad  spectrum of political views. Mr. Nelson's exemplary legal background  makes him ideally suited to serve as the Department of Interior's  Solicitor, and we owe the people of Utah and the West the opportunity  to confirm him at once.   Once confirmed, I am very eager to work with Mr. Nelson and Secretary  Ryan Zinke to continue a shared mission of restoring trust between the  Federal Government and the people of the West.   There have been some marvelous changes this year, and there will be  even more if we could just work together and quit all the bumbling  around here as though we hate each other. I am grateful for my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I believe we have made important  strides this year, and I think we can make even more. I am grateful for  what we have been able to get done this year.   I yield the floor.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss  the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP.   As we all know, the authorization for CHIP expired at the end of  September. Since that time, States have been utilizing their reserve  funds in order to cover the healthcare needs of kids. For a number of  States, those funds are due to run out in the near future.   There have been a number of claims from our friends on the other side  and some of their allies in the media that Republicans have ignored the  CHIP program; that we don't intend to reauthorize it; or that we  supposedly placed a higher priority on tax cuts for the rich than on  providing health insurance for needy children. Those claims are  absolutely ridiculous, and they know it. It gets a little old  sometimes--some of the stupid politics that are being played by the  other side.   I come at this issue from two angles. I am both the original author  of CHIP, and I currently chair the committee with jurisdiction over the  program. Nobody should doubt my commitment to  [[Page S8214]]  continuing the CHIP program. For two decades now, I have been a  supporter of CHIP, and I worked with Members of both parties to keep it  moving forward and functioning properly--even in times when my  Democratic colleagues have pursued a more divisive approach with the  program. That commitment continues to this day.   On October 4, the Senate Finance Committee unanimously reported a  bipartisan bill that would reauthorize CHIP for 5 years. In my view, a  long-term reauthorization is essential so that States, including my  home State of Utah, can plan well into the future and the families who  benefit from CHIP can be sure that coverage for their needy children  won't just disappear.   It appears that the year-end continuing resolution could include a  short-term reauthorization for CHIP. That is far from ideal, and as the  leading advocate for this program, I have no desire to see it become  subject to repeated short-term fixes and constantly looming deadlines.   I intend to continue working with Senator Wyden and my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle in both the Senate and the House to enact the  KIDS Act in a fiscally responsible manner as soon as possible. Doing so  is essential to providing certainty for families and States.                            ____________________     Mr. President, with this week's passage of the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act, many throughout the country are rightly celebrating the  first substantive reform of our Nation's Tax Code in more than three  decades.   While the popular narrative surrounding this bill has been that  Congress has moved quickly to pass this legislation, I don't think  anyone who has worked on tax reform over the last several years would  agree with that assessment. This week's success is made possible by  years of hard work and the efforts of countless policymakers, experts,  advocates, and public servants.   Over the last several years, I have come to the floor on many  occasions to advocate for tax reform. I am glad today to be able to  rise and acknowledge the efforts of many people whose work made the  historic occasion possible.   First, I would like to thank those Members who went before us. Former  Chairmen Camp, Grassley, and Baucus spent the better part of the decade  laying the groundwork for this effort.   I also want to thank Senator Wyden, who, along with Chairman Baucus,  worked with me on the Finance Committee over the last several years as  we produced reports and options papers, convened bipartisan working  groups, and held more than 70 hearings to discuss tax policy.   While I have been disappointed that my Democratic colleagues have  opted not to participate in this year's efforts to produce this  particular bill, they definitely contributed to this knowledge and  policy base we worked from to put our legislation together.   For years, I have reiterated the importance of Presidential  leadership when it comes to tax reform. I am grateful that President  Trump has been willing to engage with Congress on this issue and to put  some political skin in the game in order to move us forward.   From the outset of this administration, Secretary Mnuchin and  Director Cohn have been actively working to make this success a  reality. I thank them for their engagement in this effort and the work  they and their staffs have put in.   From the Treasury staff, I would like to thank Justin Muzinich, Dan  Kowalski, and Jay Mackie.   From Director Cohn's staff at the National Economic Council, I need  to thank Jeremy Katz and Shahira Knight.   From the White House, thanks to Mark Short, Amy Swonger, Andy Koenig,  Joseph Lai, and Jim Goyer.   These staffers from the administration have worked for the better  part of the year with leaders from both Chambers to produce this bill  and get it over the finish line. Their success is shared with our  colleagues over in the House, led by Chairman Brady and Speaker Ryan. I  thank my colleagues for their hard work and their willingness to find  common ground when many believed that it was impossible to do so.   From the Ways and Means staff, I want to thank David Stewart, Matt  Weidinger, Allison Halataei, Rick Limardo, and Paul Guaglianone.  Special thanks is owed to the committee tax staff: Barbara Angus,  Aharon Friedman, John Sandell, Victoria Glover, John Schoenecker, Randy  Gartin, Aaron Junge, Donald Scheider, Danielle Dubose, Kathryn Chakmak,  and Loren Ponds.   From the Speaker's office, I want to thank Jonathan Burks, Austin  Smythe, George Callas, Derrick Dockery, and Josh Althouse.   From the House majority whip's office, I need to thank both Marty  Reiser and Kelly Hudak.   Of course, here in the Senate, we have been ably led by the majority  leader. I want to thank Senator McConnell for his commitment to get  this done and for his leadership throughout this entire endeavor.   From the leader's staff, I want to thank Sharon Soderstrom, Brendan  Dunn, Antonia Ferrier, Hazen Marshall, Erica Suares, Terry Van Doren,  Don Stewart, and Jane Lee.   Joining Senator McConnell, as always, has been our distinguished  majority whip. I thank Senator Cornyn for his efforts in shoring up  support and addressing our Members' concerns from the beginning of this  process until final passage of the conference report.   From the whip's staff, I want to thank Monica Popp and Sam Beaver.   Of course, when it came time to draft the Senate's tax reform  legislation, most of the real work was done in the Finance Committee.  The committee bill was truly a shared product that included the input  and addressed the interests of every majority member on our dais.  Without their work, we wouldn't have had a bill, and without their  commitment to seeing this through, we wouldn't have gotten to where we  are.   I want to thank Senators Grassley, Crapo, Roberts, Enzi, Cornyn,  Thune, Burr, Isakson, Portman, Toomey, Heller, Scott, and Cassidy for  the months of work they put into producing and passing this  legislation. I also need to thank their staffs who, until this week,  haven't slept in months.   My thanks also go to the tax staffers on the committee, namely, Chris  Allen, Joseph Boddicker, Chris Conlin, Shay Hawkins, Randy Herndon,  Bart Massey, Monica McGuire, Mike Quickel, Zachary Rudisill, Andrew  Siracuse, Robert Sneeden, Derek Theurer, and Mark Warren.   My thanks go, as well, to the committee's legislative directors:  Charles Cogar, Ken Flanz, Chris Gillott, Brad Grantz, Amber  Kirchhoefer, Kurt Kovarik, Jessica McBride, Sarah Paul, Landon Stropko,  Jay Sulzmann, Stephen Tausend, Pam Thiessen, and Christopher Toppings.   Of course, when the Democrats signaled their refusal to even meet on  tax reform, we knew we would need a well-crafted budget resolution with  the right instruction to get tax reform passed. So I need to thank my  good friend, Chairman Enzi, and the Budget Committee for their work,  which made a seemingly mundane and tedious process look easy.   From the Budget Committee staff, I want to thank Joe Brenckle, Jim  Neill, Betsy McDonnell, Matt Giroux, Paul Vinovich, Becky Cole, Eric  Ueland, Steve Townsend, Jeremy Dalrymple, and Thomas Fueller.   Once we had a resolution, we had to hold a markup. In the Finance  Committee, that can be a challenging process, particularly on a bill  this big and complex.   Thankfully, we have been ably served by a professional staff who  helped us through that whole process, namely, Joshua Levasseur, Jewel  Harper, Joe Carnucci, Mark Blair, Athena Schritz, Susanna Segal, Eliza  Smith, Tim Corley, and Michael Pinkerton.   The Joint Committee on Taxation was also critical throughout the  committee process, as well as when we moved the bill onto the floor.  They worked countless hours doing the work that often just made  everybody mad at one point or another. Theirs is an often thankless but  really critical job, and I am grateful for their dedication and  earnestness.   Specifically, I need to thank Tom Barthold and his team for making  sure both parties in the House and the Senate were getting all the  information that was needed, at times under challenging time  constraints. Tom does a  [[Page S8215]]  terrific job for the Senate, and I personally appreciate him and value  him as a friend.   After moving a mark through the committee, we relied on assistance  from the Senate Legislative Counsel's office to put together the  legislative text. That was a critical step, and we could not have done  it without Mark McGunagle, Jim Fransen, and their team.    Then as we began to prep the bill for the floor, we spent countless  hours debating different provisions before the Parliamentarian. This  process can be difficult, and I would like to offer my thanks to our  Parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, and her team for the hours and  days they put into helping us comply with the rules of the Senate.   As the bill neared its final phase, we were grateful to be able to  work with Senator Murkowski on the second title of the bill, and as we  moved to conference committee, Senator Murkowski's counterparts in the  House also played an instrumental role in helping to finalize this  legislation.   Of course, there are those who work hard to make sure things go  smoothly here on the floor. I thank the majority floor staff for their  assistance, particularly, Laura Dove, Robert Duncan, and Megan Mercer.   As I said, this has been a long process, and throughout this entire  venture, I have had the benefit of working with a skilled and committed  staff. My staff have sacrificed time, energy, sleep, and, in some  cases, likely their physical and mental health for the passage of this  bill. It has been an incredible effort, and I need to thank all of  them.   I want to single out my chief tax counsel, Mark Prater. I think  everyone in this Chamber and everyone in Washington would agree that we  could not have done any of this without Mark.   I also need to thank my staff director, Jay Khosla, who has been the  tip of the spear, managing the incoming and outgoing issues with  apparent ease. I also want to thank his assistant, Jason Stegmaier, for  helping to keep Jay from forgetting the important details, like  remembering to eat lunch.   I want to thank my entire tax staff: Jennifer Acuna, Tony Coughlan,  Christopher Hanna, Alex Monie, Eric Oman, Marty Pippins, Preston  Rutledge, and Nick Wyatt.   I need to thank the members of my senior team as well: Matt Hoffmann,  Jeff Wrase, Julia Lawless, Jennifer Kuskowski, Chris Armstrong, Bryan  Hickman, and Shane Warren.   I want to thank my communications staff on the committee: Katie  Niederee, Nicole Hager, and Joshua Blume.   I also want to thank a couple of former Finance Committee staff  members, specifically, Chris Campbell, my former staff director, who  helped to set the stage for this entire effort, and Jim Lyons, my tax  counsel who passed away last year, much to the sorrow of us. He spent  years working on tax reform, and I know we all wish he could have been  here to celebrate with us this week.   From my personal office staff, I want to thank my legislative  assistant, James Williams, and Matt Sandgren, my chief of staff.   There are many more people who deserve thanks this week--far too many  to mention at this time. They are not forgotten, though, believe me.   We have done a good thing here this week. This is truly a historic  success.   Some of our colleagues on the other side last night said that the  American people will remember what happened here this week. To that,  all I can say is that I hope they do. This new tax law will do a lot of  good for a great number of people throughout our country, and I am  humbled to have been a part of the efforts of so many people who were  willing to get this thing done for the American people.   I am grateful to my staff. I am grateful to the staffs of our  Senators on the committee. I am grateful for everyone involved in the  Finance Committee and for the good efforts that they put forward. But I  am really grateful that I serve in the U.S. Senate, the greatest  deliberative body in the world, and this is a perfect illustration of  why.   I am very grateful to be able to stand on this floor and show my  complete devotion to this wonderful government. To both sides of the  floor--Democrats and Republicans alike--I am grateful. I am grateful  that we have this Constitution to guide us, and I am grateful that for  the most part, we have abided by it.   With that, I yield the floor.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.                            ____________________
