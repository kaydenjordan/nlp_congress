 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Children's Health Insurance Program that so many of our vulnerable  young people depend on for their healthcare coverage. Across the  country, 8 million young people use CHIP, more than 300,000 people in  Illinois alone. But their coverage and, consequently, their health and  future are now in jeopardy because this House has failed to reauthorize  the program for the first time in 20 years. Yesterday marked 100 days  since the authorization lapsed.   Before the new year, Congress temporarily extended limited funding,  but the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is already warning  that some States won't have funding to make it through the month of  January.   It is beyond shameful that this House can pass trillions of dollars  in tax breaks for those with the most security but not see its way to  provide health insurance for the children most in need.   This is a vital program. This is a popular program. This is a program  that traditionally enjoys bipartisan support. There is no reason to  continue to extend the uncertainty.   I urge my colleagues to act and reauthorize the CHIP program as soon  as possible to offer much-needed stability to families and their  children depending on this coverage.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bipartisan  resolution, H. Res. 676, offered by my friends, Chairman Ed Royce and  Ranking Member Eliot Engel, of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I  thank my friend from Florida and my friend from California for leading  us in this conversation today.   Less than 2 weeks ago, on December 28, protests began in towns and  villages throughout Iran. These quickly and organically grew to become  the largest antigovernment demonstrations the country has witnessed  since those remarkable demonstrations in the summer of 2009.   Iranian citizens have taken to the streets to decry the regime's  corruption, economic mismanagement, and destabilizing activities  abroad, including support for such terrorist groups as Hezbollah.   The Iranian people, the good men and women seeking relief from the  failings of the current regime, deserve our support. Their voices  deserve to be heard. Not surprisingly, the response of the regime in  Tehran to these protests have been predictably draconian.   News reports suggest dozens of Iranians have been killed in the  crackdown on protests and more than 1,000 Iranians have been arrested.  In an effort to silence the protesters, the Iranian Government has  blocked access to social media platforms used to organize and spread  word of the demonstrations.   This most recent crackdown is part of a long history of human rights  abuses by the Iranian Government, both at home through violent  oppression and abroad through funding of groups that support terror.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud that last month the House passed my amendment  to the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act to help crack down on  Iranian human rights abusers and ensure U.S. sanctions are best  positioned to improve the human rights situation in Iran.   This is but one step. We need to do more to stop Iran's repression  and persecution of different religious faiths, including Sunni Muslims,  Christians, and Baha'is. We need to do more to stop the regime's  arbitrary and unlawful killings. We must do more to protect the Iranian  people's right to freedom of expression.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    This resolution is an opportunity for the American  people to stand with the peaceful Iranian protesters and condemn the  maligned activities of the oppressive Iranian regime.   In the days ahead, I urge this administration to hold the Iranian  regime accountable to its international human rights obligation as well  as work with our allies at the United Nations to condemn and sanction  Iran for its ongoing human rights violations.   The Iranian Government is seeking to silence its people. Today's  resolution shows we are watching and that we stand with the people of  Iran. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who is the chairman of the Foreign  Affairs' Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights,  and International Organizations.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of H. Res. 676 and in solidarity with the people of Iran who  courageously took to the streets in the recent weeks to protest their  country's barbaric dictatorship.   I thank my good friends, Ed Royce and Eliot Engel, for their  leadership in bringing this resolution to the floor. I also thank the  chairwoman emeritus for her tremendous work over the years towards Iran  in trying to get a policy that respects fundamental human rights and  also ends their barbaric reign of terror and terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, over the past several weeks, tens of thousands of  Iranians participated in nationwide protests to condemn the corruption,  repression, and brutality that together represent the unique legacy of  Iran's nearly 40-year-old authority theocracy.   The regime responded with characteristic coercion, intimidating  activists and employing government-sponsored thugs and military units  to quell the unrest. Approximately 20 protesters died in clashes with  security forces. At least 1,000 people were arrested. I am sure those  1,000 are being tortured as we meet here today. Some estimates place  the number closer to 4,000 people.   This unrest is the inevitable consequence of a dictatorship built on  brutality and corruption in the service of domestic repression and  regional conquest. Ambassador Haley was absolutely right when she told  the U.N. Security Council: ``When the rights of the people are denied,  the people rightly resist. If the concerns are not acknowledged, then  peace and security are inevitably threatened.''   I am very proud of the work this Congress has done over the years. In  my subcommittee, we have held hearings on human rights abuses in Iran,  including with Pastor Saeed Abedini, who did a tremendous job with his  wife in trying to effectuate his relief.   We must hold Iran to account for the treatment of the hundreds of  jailed protesters and not let their faith be forgotten with the next  news cycle. We must work tirelessly to secure the liberty of our own  citizens, including Xiyue Wang, a graduate student from my own State of  New Jersey, who has spent the past 519 days in the Evin Prison complex.   Mr. Speaker, again, I urge support of the resolution.
