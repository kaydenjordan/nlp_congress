 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me tell my Republican friends this:  All you have to do to know why we have got to go big for the survival  of our Nation is look at the news recently. Have you seen the lines of  cars? Some have been in line since 4 and 5 in the morning. And our  community food banks are there.   Why do you think that they are there? They are hungry. We have got 17  million of our children going to bed hungry every single night because  the American people don't have the money to go buy groceries. And you  know, what? One of the fastest growing groups of those out there  hungry, who are starving, who are dying under the viaducts, who are  committing suicide in record numbers, are our veterans.   That is why we need to go bold, to go big. You talk about  bipartisanship. That is what the American people want, bipartisanship  to get money in their pockets.   And look, friends, I am chairman of the Agriculture Committee. I am a  businessman. I graduated from the top school of finance in the world,  the Wharton School of Finance. I can speak on this economy. The basic  tool of growth in economy is getting money in the pockets of people who  are spending. That is how you keep your community going. They are not  going to sit on that money. They are going to buy, go into Kroger and  Publix and get food.    Mr. Speaker, now is the time. We can't  afford more delays. The time for us to be bold is now. This is the time  to be decisive, to move confidently, and most importantly, to move  Democrats and Republicans together to save our great Nation; not  tomorrow. The time is now.
