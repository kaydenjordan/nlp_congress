 Mr. President, today I applaud the Senate's bipartisan  confirmation of Dr. Heath Tarbert to head the Commodity Futures Trading  Comission. I am confident that Dr. Tarbert, who is no stranger to  public service, will lead the CFTC well. As the former acting Under  Secretary for International Affairs at the Department of the Treasury,  Dr. Tarbert has exactly the right experience, at the right time, to  lead the CFTC. The CFTC needs a strong leader like Dr. Tarbert. He  understands how the markets are impacted by actions taken by Congress  and U.S. Federal regulators, as well as those of our legislative and  regulatory partners around the world. His experience clearly  demonstrates appreciation of what led to the financial crisis 10 years  ago. Dr. Tarbert also has the support of a range of agricultural  groups, all voicing strong sport and appreciation for his experience in  the financial sector, the effort demonstrated to understand priority  issues, and the commitment to visiting agricultural operations to  reinforce the importance of these markets to farmers, ranchers,  growers, and agribusiness.   The CFTC is charged with fostering open, transparent, competitive,  and financially sound markets, while working to prevent systemic risk.  The regulation and oversight provided by the CFTC allows end users-- farmers, ranchers, commercial companies, municipalities, energy  companies, pension funds, and others--to hedge commercial risk using  the derivatives market. These markets allow companies to generate jobs  and produce goods and services for our economy. I look forward to  working with Dr. Tarbert in his new role. Thank you.                            ____________________
