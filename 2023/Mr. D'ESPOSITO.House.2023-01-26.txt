 Madam Speaker, for too long, the Biden administration  has surrendered control of our Nation's southern border to members of  the cartels and other bad actors who seek to do this great Nation harm.   This inaction by the Biden administration has allowed an untold  number of illegal migrants, drug smugglers, and human traffickers to  cross into our country with ease.   Many of these illegal entrants bring anarchy to our streets by  committing violent crimes and help fuel America's drug crisis by  smuggling in dangerous narcotics such as fentanyl.   Since Joe Biden has taken office, over 4.7 million illegal immigrants  have been apprehended at our southern border, representing a 500  percent increase in border crossings since 2020.   While many have been apprehended, thousands of migrants have evaded  capture by Federal authorities, including 70,000 known got-aways in  December of 2022 alone.   These migrants remain unaccounted for, and now are free to roam the  streets of our cities and towns, endangering the lives of innocent  Americans.   In fact, earlier this month, four migrants who were bused to New York  from the southern border were arrested on Long Island after stealing  thousands of dollars in merchandise from a store in my district.   Thanks to the hard work of the Nassau County Police Department they  were apprehended. Unfortunately, in New York, Democrats have put  criminals ahead of law-abiding citizens and those individuals were  released once again to wreak havoc on our communities.   While I am glad that these thieves were captured, local law  enforcement should not be forced to deal with the end result of Joe  Biden's failed border policy.   If President Biden is serious about securing our border and  preventing migrants from committing crimes, like what happened in the  Fourth Congressional District of New York, he would stop underfunding  Customs and Border Protection and treat our Border Patrol agents the  way they should be treated and provide the agency the resources it  needs to secure our borders here in America.   As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I fully intend to  hold the President and Secretary Mayorkas accountable for their  disastrous open border policies and seek solutions that safeguard this  great Nation.                            ____________________
