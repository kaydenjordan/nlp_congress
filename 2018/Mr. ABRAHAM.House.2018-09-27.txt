 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the nonprofit  organization Kids' Orchestra for the positive impact it has had on the  children throughout East Baton Rouge Parish.   Kids' Orchestra is located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and is one of  the largest after school programs for elementary schools in the entire  United States. The program began in 2011 with 30 students from a few  local schools. Now, 800 students from 21 schools participate each year,  learning a musical instrument, performing in an ensemble, and/or  singing in the choir.   Kids' Orchestra uses music as a way to teach students valuable  lessons, both in and out of the classroom. Ultimately, they are  successful, as 82 percent of their students say they feel more  confident, part of the team, and like they are good at something after  completing the program. Teachers and parents also see improvements in  peer  [[Page H9096]]  interaction, self-confidence, school attendance, and classroom behavior  from the participating students.   These benefits translate academically also, as, on average, Kids'  Orchestra students receive 15 percent higher grades than students who  do not participate in the program.   The organization also aims to create a strong sense of community  between the children from all different backgrounds, different  neighborhoods, and different schools. Each class contains 25 students  of varying ages, schools, and skill levels, all brought together for  weekly lessons and regular performances.   By forming a community based on musical training and enrichment,  Kids' Orchestra is making a positive impact on neighborhood schools and  individual students.   I am proud to have had this program in Louisiana, and I look forward  to seeing the positive impacts from the organization for many, many  years to come.                       Celebrating National Rice Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate September as  National Rice Month.   Very few places in the world take their rice as seriously as  Louisiana, where we produced 2.7 billion pounds of rice just last year.   Rice is also a huge economic driver for the United States, as rice  milling operations generate about $6 billion in wages and business  profits, according to the LSU AgCenter.    U.S. rice not only puts food on our tables, but also on tables across  the world. We contribute 5 percent of the total rice exports in food  aid to developing nations. This is the kind of international  contribution our rice producers can be proud of.   In turn, I am proud to represent the hardworking rice farmers across  Louisiana. They produce high-quality rice that feeds the world, gives  jobs to their neighbors, and helps the community. These facts alone  make rice worth celebrating all month long.                            ____________________
