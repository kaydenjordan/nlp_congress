 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to  me.   I rise to agree with my colleagues that we are facing a crisis. The  number of overdoses and deaths related to fentanyl has skyrocketed over  the last few years; however, the emergency scheduling of fentanyl and  its analogues or any other substance as a schedule I drug has serious  criminal justice implications.   We should not forget our history and what happened to communities of  color during the failed war on drugs. We can't forget that classifying  a substance as a schedule I drug comes with harsh mandatory minimum  sentences that even the lowest quantity can trigger.   We cannot forget that over 60 percent of people federally charged for  drug possession and over 95 percent of people charged with drug  trafficking receive a prison sentence. We should not forget that over  78 percent of people charged with a fentanyl trafficking offense are  people of color.   We must work together to prioritize a public health solution, not  just a criminal justice one, to the fentanyl epidemic. We must remember  that a criminal justice approach disproportionately impacts people of  color and does not necessarily reduce the crime.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to address the problems  that this bill possibly could create.
