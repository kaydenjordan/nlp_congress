 Madam Speaker, across this country, people of all  political persuasions are profoundly frustrated with the conflicts of  interest and divisive politics practiced in this town.   And who could blame them for their frustration?   Their votes are being suppressed by power-hungry folks at all costs.  The people are tired of the revolving door of lobbyists and special  interests working to diminish their trust in this institution and in  us.   But maybe that is what some people want, for Americans to become so  frustrated, bone tired of standing in long lines, that they just give  up and go home.   It is long past time that Congress brought a little more Minnesota  common sense to America in clean and fair elections. That is exactly  what this bill will accomplish by expanding voting rights, ending the  dominance of dark money in our politics, and finally addressing  partisan gerrymandering.   We must reform if we are to hold on to this democracy. Madam Speaker,  we must do it now.
