 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate a philanthropist,  a community activist, a constituent of Ohio's 13th Congressional  District, the birthplace of champions, and the greatest basketball  player of all time, LeBron James, but we know him as just a kid from  Akron, the GOAT, or King James.   Yesterday, LeBron broke the NBA's scoring record previously set by  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with 38,390 points. It was a feat that once seemed  almost impossible for anyone except for LeBron, but James has become  known for making the improbable part of his routine, including four NBA  championships and numerous MVP titles.   Mr. Speaker, LeBron James has scored 38,390 points in his career,  making history on the 38th day of the year of his 38th year of life  with 38 points.   LeBron, we celebrate you and all of your accomplishments. You have,  indeed, earned the title of greatest of all time and cemented Ohio's  13th Congressional District as the birthplace of champions.  [[Page H770]]    From one kid from Akron to another, LeBron, we are proud of you.                            ____________________
