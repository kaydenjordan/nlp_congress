 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Officer Thomas Sawyer  of the Hammond Police Department, who heartbreakingly passed away  earlier this month after a 5-week battle with COVID-19.   Officer Sawyer's life's work was one of public service. After serving  as a member of the United States Air Force during tours in Iraq and  Afghanistan, he went on to serve another 23 years with the Hammond  Police Department.   The first responders of northwest Indiana and across our Nation run  toward danger at a moment's notice in our times of greatest need, and  our communities will forever be grateful for the selfless service of  Officer Sawyer.   As Officer Sawyer contracted this disease in the line of duty, let us  continue to recognize its ever-present danger and how we must take  action to keep ourselves and our neighbors safe.   My thoughts and prayers continue to be with his wife, Mary, and all  of his family and friends during this difficult time.                            ____________________
