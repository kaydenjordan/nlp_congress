 Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the life and  legacy of my dear friend, the last surviving World War II Medal of  Honor Recipient, West Virginian, and one of the last of the ``greatest  generation,'' Woody Williams of Quiet Dell, WV.   Before I begin today, I want to recognize members of Woody's family  who are here today with us in the Gallery, and in recognizing all of  them, I want to say thank you. Thank you for being here and thank you  for sharing Woody all those years with me and Shelley and all of our  West Virginians.   We are here today to respect Woody's wishes of honoring all veterans  and their families and to pay respects to our Nation's last living  World War II Medal of Honor recipient.   To the family, I want to say this: You are the legacy he was most  proud of, all of you, and I am honored to welcome--Senator Capito, both  of us, are welcoming you, which is Woody's legacy, still here, and  thank you.   But we are going to respect his wishes, and his wishes, basically,  were honoring veterans and their families and to pay respects to the  Nation's last living World War II Medal of Honor recipient.   It has been 77 years since Woody Williams quieted those enemy  machineguns on the sands of Iwo Jima, and while he is now sadly gone,  the ideals that he lived by are not: the love of his family, his  friends and his faith and service to country above all.   GEN George Patton once said:         It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather,       we should thank God that such men lived.    Woody lived every day as if he were given a second chance, and we are  all so much better for it.   And, boy, did Woody live for a long time. His grandson Brent Casey  passed along Woody's recipe for a long life. I hope I have got all this  right. He would say when asked:         It's Braggs apple cider vinegar, and it has to have the       ``mother,'' and, you know, the cloudy stuff in the bottom of       the bottle, mixed with local honey, and 6 ounces of warm       water. You can add some pure maple syrup for extra flavoring       if you'd like.    And Woody said:         I've been drinking it every morning since the early 1960s.    About 3 years ago, he got it printed on a business card because he  said he was so tired of reciting it every time someone asked, and he  handed out quite a few of those cards too.   One of my favorite Woody quotes is the one he cited when his great- grandson Cedar graduated from Marine boot camp. When Woody was asked  what it meant to be a marine, he said:         By taking that oath, you can take my life, but you cannot       take my country or my freedom.    You cannot take my country or my freedom. That says it all about  Woody.    During the ceremony in West Virginia last weekend, Woody's grandson  Chad said:         We must remember what Woody taught us. There are few things       in the world that we can do alone. It is only through the       support of others that we can truly reach our goals. So look       to your left and look to your right. We are all a part of his       legacy, and it is up to us to carry it forward. In the words       of Woody, ``The cause is greater than I.''    One of Woody's last wishes was lying in state at the U.S. Capitol,  and it wasn't for himself. We spoke about this years ago. It wasn't for  himself, but he wanted to make sure that we represent all Medal of  Honor recipients from World War II, and there were only 472--of the  whole war, 472.   Tomorrow, the West Virginia farm boy from Quiet Dell will lie in  honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, laying to rest the sacrifices of a  generation of heroes. That is what we do tomorrow.   Woody can rest in peace knowing his mission is complete.   I will miss Woody because he was my wingman or may I say this: We  maybe were all his wingmen, and I think that is what he would have  preferred.   Woody always had a project for everyone around him. Everyone sitting  up there, he had projects for you. He had projects for me and projects  for Shelley. He made sure that we understood exactly what he wanted  done.   As his grandson Bryan Casey said, ``If you met with Woody, you know  he always had a project for everyone. He would magically produce  napkins and sharpies with his projects--typically with him diagramming  the project while we watched and listened. They were not always unused  napkins, but they always became works of art.''   Woody came to me a few years ago and said that we needed to help the  Gold Star families in West Virginia and across the whole country. So we  started a motorcycle ride for fallen service heroes. We did six of  those rides--and Woody was in his nineties--and he was there every time  in that sling shot, just giving it all he had, and he stayed right with  us.   We raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Gold Star  families. Some of those funds, as you know, went into monuments across  the Nation, including the one that sits at the Capitol we honored also  with the laying of the wreath.   I know how many good things Woody and I worked on together. If you  multiply that by all the other people he worked with, you will fully  realize Woody's incredible impact on West Virginia and the entire  country.   That is why he got a ship, a VA hospital, and a National Guard  Reserve Center named after him.   Most recently, because of Woody, our VA medical centers were saved.  His testimony ended the AIR Commission, which would have turned three  of our four West Virginia VA medical centers into urgent care centers,  as well as countless others across the Nation. And, really, in rural  America, rural veterans would not have been served.   Every veteran in the Nation can thank Woody for saving their VA  hospital.   Woody was with me when I was Governor and helped so much as we stood  [[Page S3262]]  up to the Cabinet Secretary for Veterans Affairs. Then he was the  founding member of my Senate Veterans Advisory Group, where he led  efforts to clean up the Clarksburg and Beckley VAMCs.   He helped get the first Fisher House. I remember we called Ken  Fisher. Ken came in, met with Woody, and it was over. It was going to  be done. It was that quick. It was unbelievable, and I know it gave so  much solace to the family when they got to spend a few moments in that  beautiful place. It was really something very, very special.   Woody has been there every step of the way, making sure that families  of the fallen receive death gratuities during government shutdowns.  That was the time that he said: Joe, we have to do something. He said:  The shutdown is preventing us from giving the gratuities the families  need.   That is when we called Ken Fisher, and that is when we all became  very good friends with Fisher House. Ken Fisher was the leader of that.  That is how that all began, and Ken was happy to step up.   Naming the first Gold Star Children's Day, August 1--he was  instrumental in that.   It was also amazing that so many people from across the country and  each of our States that we represent in this great deliberative body  had so many good things to say about Woody because his legacy runs  farther than just West Virginia, as you know.   I didn't realize the magnitude of Woody's impact until I traveled  with him to California and also in Virginia when his ship was  commissioned and it was christened. And, when that happened, I mean,  from the brass all the way down to the ensigns on this ship, the  marines learned about being a marine because of studying Woody  Williams.   I didn't realize the impact that he had. It was unbelievable. I am  there, and I had all of these people coming to me and telling me the  impact that he had on them and how much they admired him.   But I am always remembering the one general telling me how they  studied Woody Williams in the Marine Corps. I never forgot that. He  said: Let me tell you, I know you know him as a friend. I know you know  him as representing your State. Let me tell you how he represented the  Marine Corps.   So when marines learn how to be marines, they learn about Woody  Williams.   I always knew that West Virginia had a treasure with Woody, but what  I didn't know is that he was their treasure also. I will forever be  grateful that Woody and his family gave me the gift of spending time  with him in Huntington. And when Mara and I were able to go down that  Sunday morning before he passed, it was such a special day. He was as  chirpy and bright as ever. You would not think that anything was really  that much different.   And I said: Woody, I think someone wants to speak to you.   It was Denis McDonough, who is the Secretary of the VA for the United  States of America. He wanted to speak to Woody, and Woody was so  thrilled. It was a great conversation. And just as true to form as  Woody, he said, ``Mr. Secretary, I have to tell you just a couple of  things,'' and he went into exactly what needed to be done. It was just  classic. Denis called me afterward to explain the conversation, and he  was so tickled.   It took a Woody, also, to be able to have that conversation. And he  was just full of life. He was still full of life, and he was still full  of ambition to get things accomplished.   In his final days, he stayed the same as I always knew him. As you  know, he was quick as a whip, kind, selfless, and concerned for his  fellow veterans and the families and all of you. He was concerned about  everybody.   And he was ready. It was a moment that I will cherish the rest of my  days being able to spend that little bit of time at the end there. But  in true Woody fashion, he gave me marching orders that day. He said  that one of his last wishes was enclosing the committal shelter at the  Donel C. Kinnard Memorial State Veterans Cemetery. Senator Capito got  the same order I got. It is on our to-do list, and it will get done so  that the families will be protected from the elements when paying their  final respects. It is something that should be done in every shelter  and every VA burial ground, in every VA cemetery.   But, of course, this project was bigger than just West Virginia for  Woody. It will probably lead to a national effort. I can promise you  this: that we are going to get that done. It was a commitment we made  to Woody, and it will happen.   As President Biden said upon Woody's passing, ``I don't throw the  word `hero' around lightly, but if I'm going to use it, I'd use it for  a guy like Woody Williams. . . . Heroism--like it did for Woody--can  come in all shapes and sizes.''   Woody Williams was far more than just a hero. He was the greatest of  the ``greatest generation'' and a model for future generations.   From what I know, Woody's greatest wish was for all of us to continue  his mission, to give back to each other, to love our country. As his  grandson Bryan said last week, ``I have the project that he wants each  of you to work on. A couple of them, actually.''   And, today, I will ask each of you to work on these projects, too. If  Gold Star families in your area are traveling more than an hour to one  of the Gold Star Family Memorial Monuments, they are traveling too far.  Your project is to get a project working in your backyard.   Second, if you have a monument in your area, your project is to  ensure the legacy that Woody helped create by working to recognize  these families. Become part of the project. Become part of the process  to bring people back to that monument, lest we never forget these Gold  Star families.   As we celebrate the life and legacy of Woody Williams and all our  veterans of World War II this evening and tomorrow, let us all do our  best to continue Woody's mission.   May God rest the soul of our dear friend, our leader, our national  hero, Woody Williams.   I yield the floor to my colleague Senator Capito.    Madam President, I know that both of us want to thank  Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the ranking  member of the Republican Party, Mitch McConnell, and all the people who  were so instrumental in making this happen.   There have only been 35 people lying in state in this Capitol--35 out  of millions and millions and millions. And it is a tremendous tribute  for us, coming from our wonderful, patriotic, beautiful State of West  Virginia, to have the ``greatest generation'' being represented.   And as we have said, this is not him; it is for everybody and, I  hope, for all the families and anybody who had anybody who served.   Shelley's dad was wounded in World War II and received a Purple  Heart. He became our Governor three times and was a friend of mine. And  my father and all of my family served in World War II.   But to have so many people, and Woody is doing that for them.  Tomorrow is for every person who has sacrificed and given their all and  the families who have sacrificed also.   So we want to thank them for making that happen. It was a great  tribute and a great honor, I know, for the family and all of us. God  bless you all and thank you for coming.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges  of the floor be granted to the following fellows in my office: Carrie  Libell, through July 31, 2022; and Sean Dzierzanowski, through December  31, 2022.
