 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend both  the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, the ILWU, and the  Pacific Maritime Association, the PMA, for reaching a new 6-year  contract just last night for 22,000 workers across 29 West Coast ports.   This agreement is critical for our economy and recognizes the heroic  work of all frontline dock workers, who worked tirelessly throughout  our entire supply chain crisis to move our economy forward.   As mayor of Long Beach, I oversaw our port, which supports 2.6  million jobs across the country. As co-chair of the Ports Caucus, I am  proud to have worked with both sides throughout the entire bargaining  process. This deal would not have been possible without the work of  President Biden and Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su.   Julie's engagement was key and proved why she should be confirmed  swiftly by the Senate.   This news builds upon Tuesday's report that showed inflation has  fallen for 11 months in a row.   Our ports will continue to fight inflation and bring back jobs.                            ____________________
