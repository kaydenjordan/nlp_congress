 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Massachusetts for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, today we are seeing that the GOP tax scam is one long  con. Last year, they gave away trillions of dollars to the very  wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations while bragging about  letting an extra $1.50 trickle down to hardworking public school  employees. It is clear what they really intended. It was a setup.   Who is going to take the fall? Seniors, the disabled, children, and  those who are sick.   The GOP tax scam exploded the deficit by nearly $2 trillion, and now  this balanced budget constitutional amendment is laying the groundwork  for an attack on Medicare, on Medicaid, and on Social Security.   Now we are considering a constitutional amendment, a change to our  Nation's founding document. For all of the pocket Constitution wagging  from the GOP, in light of their recent action, this amendment amounts  to little more than a political farce. If the GOP wanted a balanced  budget, they should propose one.   Instead, President Trump's budgets have threatened the poorest  Americans with the biggest cuts--slashing $500 billion from Medicare,  $1.4 trillion from Medicaid, and $72 billion from Social Security  disability--and it still doesn't balance.   This week, the Congressional Budget Office released the devastating  impact of the GOP tax scam. Fiscal year 2018 deficits will increase by  $139 billion to a total of $804 billion.   Republicans have put our national debt on track to eclipse the size  of our economy by 2028. Let me say that again. Our national debt,  because of these reckless policies, will put our debt on track to  eclipse the size of our economy.                                time  1245    The idea that the GOP tax scam would pay for itself has been exposed  as a lie. Now we know what is at risk to help pay for these handouts to  billionaires and large corporations: our seniors, disabled Americans,  children, and those who are sick.   Over 55 million Americans rely on Medicare. More than 67 million  Americans depend on Social Security. These programs represent the  bedrock of the secure retirement that is too often challenged by high  prices at the doctor and pharmacy. Social Security is already off  budget. It never has added a penny to the deficit.   Mr. Speaker, this balanced budget amendment would threaten the  120,000 retirees, over 13,000 disabled workers, and more than 5,000  kids in my home district who are depending upon this Congress to keep  their promise to not cut their hard-earned benefits. Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid are more than just the most successful and  popular government programs to ever exist; they are solemn promises  that we make to one another as Americans. This constitutional amendment  would break those promises, and it would put the hard-earned Social  Security and Medicare benefits of tens of millions of Americans at  risk.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on the previous question so that we  can protect the promise that we made to vulnerable Americans by  exempting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid from the balanced  budget amendment. Our constituents deserve nothing less than our  standing up for them, for the promise that we have made to them, and  for those who depend upon these vital programs. The way we can do that  is to vote no on the previous question and pass legislation that will  enable us to do exactly that.
