 Madam Speaker, a mile from my district sits The  Stonewall Inn, the site where, five decades ago, Americans took to the  streets to fight back against hate and launch the modern movement for  LGBT rights.   In a few hours, this House will pay homage to that struggle as we  vote on historic legislation to protect the fundamental rights of  millions of Americans.   The Equality Act will extend antidiscrimination protections to LGBTQ  Americans. Sadly, from education to housing to credit, in so many  areas, discrimination based on sexual orientation or identity remains  legal. That is wrong, and this bill will, at long last, change that.   Madam Speaker, this is an issue of moral character. It speaks to who  we are as a Nation.   For us individually, this vote speaks to who we are not just as  legislators but as human beings. I implore all my colleagues to do what  you know is right in your heart.   Vote for equality. Vote for respect, kindness, and love. Vote to end  bigotry and discrimination.   Vote ``yes'' on the Equality Act.                            ____________________
