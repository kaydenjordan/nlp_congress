 Madam Speaker, I would like to ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on my Special  Order for tonight.    Madam Speaker, I am honored tonight to share  and conduct the Special Order sponsored by the Congressional Black  Caucus, and I want to thank Chairwoman Karen Bass for her tremendous  leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus and for holding this  Special Order tonight in our effort to raise to the public and this  body's attention the observance of 400 years since the first enslaved  Africans were brought to the shores of America, which began 250 years  of one of the most horrific crimes committed against humanity: the  government-sanctioned institution of slavery.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Chairwoman  Bass) for her statement, and I want to say to her that I really commend  her tonight for her leadership and, really, for keeping Africa as  central in our foreign policy, because we are all reminded, through her  leadership, that Africa does matter.    Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Bass for  laying out much of the history and reminding us that this is really an  opportunity to recognize the resilience, the renewal, and the strength  of Africans and African Americans. Through much adversity, as the  gentlewoman laid out, African Americans, the descendants of enslaved  people, continued to rise from our brutal past.   I thank the gentlewoman again for her leadership.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott),  chairman of our Committee on Education and Labor, who has led so many  efforts to educate the public with regard to this 400th year  commemoration and, also, the real significance of the Middle Passage as  it relates to not only 400 years ago, but today.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Virginia for that very powerful statement and, also, for the very hard  and diligent work that he has been engaged in around the commission and  what he is doing each and every day to educate not only his district,  but the entire country with regard to not only the past, but, also,  where we must go from here. I thank Chairman Scott again.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Adams). Congresswoman Adams serves on the Financial Services Committee  and the Committee on Education and Labor. But, also, I always have to  say that I know her as an artist, as a professor, but also as a great  public servant. I thank the gentlewoman, again, for being with us  tonight.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Adams for  that very eloquent statement, and also for what she is doing with our  young people as the chair of our Historically Black College and  University Caucus. What the gentlewoman is doing in terms of pulling us  all together on behalf of the education of all of our children is  remarkable. And she is not only teaching us how to teach them, but also  leading the way on so many issues as an educator.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne),  who serves on the Homeland Security Committee and the Transportation  Committee.   Congressman Payne's whole life has been about addressing the  inequities and the vestiges of this last 400 years. But also, he grew  up in a household where his dad, our great friend, the late Congressman  Don Payne, focused on Africa. His son, Congressman  Don Payne, Jr., has  Africa in his blood as a result of growing up in a household with his  wonderful, beloved father.   I thank the gentleman for being here.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Payne,  first of all, for his kind and gracious words, but, also, for that  brilliant presentation reminding us again not only of our history, but  how we have risen to be great leaders in our country.   I also want to thank the gentleman for his steady leadership on so  many issues, including healthcare, and how he is working to raise the  issue of the racial gaps as it relates to people of color, as it  relates to diabetes and all of those health indices that we have to  close these gaps. I thank him for being here tonight and participating.   Madam Speaker, how much time do I have remaining, please?    Madam Speaker, 400 years ago, as we have heard  tonight, the first slave ship arrived in Virginia. This began one of  the darkest chapters in American history.   During the course of over 250 years of slavery--that is, government- sanctioned slavery in America--families were ripped apart. People were  beaten and brutalized. Men, women, and children were sold and traded  like objects. And to this day, Black communities   [[Page H7554]]  continue to suffer from the generational trauma from these crimes  against humanity.    That was followed by another 75 years of racism and domestic  terrorism under Jim Crow and segregation, during which thousands of  African Americans were lynched. Churches were bombed. Entire  communities were burned to the ground in the not-so-recent, distant  past.   Racist economic policies also institutionalized the racial hierarchy  established by slavery and kept African Americans trapped and  segregated disproportionately in poverty: policies like land seizure  laws that left African American farmers at risk of having their land  seized and turned over to their White peers; the Fair Labor Standards  Act, which excluded professions dominated by African Americans from  minimum wage protections; the separate but equal doctrine in schools  and public facilities; the segregation of the armed services, in which  my dad served in a segregated military, fighting in two wars for our  country.   Jim Crow gave way to decades of racist housing policies like  redlining and subprime lending that further prevented African Americans  from building wealth; followed by the war on drugs, which devastated  our communities, tore apart families, and incarcerated millions of  needlessly incarcerated fellow African Americans.   Today, we see continued disparities among African Americans due to  the legacy of slavery, racism, and Jim Crow in America. African  Americans still face disproportionate levels of poverty, unemployment,  and overwhelming struggles to achieve educational and economic  opportunities.   Health disparities, including the highest rate of HIV infections,  continue to impact African American communities due to the lack of  equal access and prevention resources. It is completely unacceptable  that Black women are four times more likely to die from preventable  pregnancy complications than White women.   Now, for decades, our criminal justice system has disproportionately  targeted communities of color, especially Black and Brown women and  men. Structural and institutional racism permeates every aspect of  American society.   And now, sadly, we have a Presidential administration that continues  to ignore our Nation's dark history of racism and bondage and, in many  ways, is trying to move us backwards. From voter suppression, from  targeting African Americans and people of color with budget cuts that  undermine and affect their livelihoods to undermining decades of civil  rights, the gains that we have made, now we see an administration that  is trying to roll those protections back. This President is trying to  turn back the clock.   Tragically, we are also now seeing history repeat itself with rampant  family separation of immigrant families at the border, children being  taken from their parents and put into cages.   The President has normalized racism and xenophobia. His constant  attacks on African Americans and people of color, to questioning the  nationality of our first Black President, to claiming that there are  good people among white supremacists, his racism has given others  permission to hate out loud. It has also set the stage for the toxic  mix of racism, gun violence, and domestic terrorism that is gripping  our country.   Yes, we have a President today, and an administration, who continues  to fan the flames of the fire that was born out of slavery.   So let me be clear, though. We aren't going back. As I our beloved  Dr. Maya Angelou said: And still we rise.   And just because we aren't going back doesn't mean we shouldn't look  back and learn from our past. That informs what we must do today.   Now, the Akan people of West Africa, they have a mythical symbol. It  is a mythical bird. It is a bird called Sankofa. The bird looks back  with an egg in her mouth. It means reminding us to look back at our  past, to look at the mistakes we have made, to look at what happened in  our past that has strengthened us and made us who we are today, and to  move forward and to not make those same mistakes but to fly forward,  creating a new world based on justice and freedom.                                time  2015    This is our ``Sankofa'' moment.   Earlier this month we observed the 400th anniversary by travelling to  Ghana with a delegation of Members led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  and Congresswoman Karen Bass. It was such a privilege and an honor to  witness and hear our Speaker speak as the first American Speaker of the  United States of America to the Ghanaian Parliament. This strengthens  the ties that bind not only between Africans and African Americans, but  between the African continent and American continent. People in both of  our continents really have a long history that we need to recognize as  being oftentimes very difficult but together we must move forward.   So while we were there, we paid our respects at Cape Coast and Elmina  Castles. And at the ``Door of No Return'' we walked through where the  first enslaved Africans departed in chains bound for America. The  experience was a powerful reminder of the inhumanity of the slave  trade, but it was also empowering to witness the strength and  determination of the enslaved to survive and to build a better future  for the next generation. And we walked back through the ``Door of  Return,'' what a glorious moment that was for all Members.   So, today, as we observe 400 years since the first Africans were  bought to these shores, let it be known that this is a Sankofa moment.   Moving forward, I look forward to this body addressing the damage  caused by the inhumanity of slavery, by advancing positive legislation  that uplifts the descendants of those who were enslaved, including H.R.  40 championed by our great warrior, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,  whose steadfast and brilliant work is educating the Congress and the  public as to why we need a commission to look these past inequities,  bring them current, and how we begin to address them in 2019.   Let me close by reading a quote from Nikole Hannah-Jones. She is the  author of the 1619 Project. ``The 1619 Project aims to reframe the  country's history, understanding 1619 as our true founding and placing  the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at  the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are.''   In Hannah-Jones' seminal piece in the New York Times she wrote: ``Our  Declaration of Independence, signed on July 4, 1776, proclaims that  `all men are created equal' and `endowed by their creator with certain  inalienable rights.' But the white men who drafted those words did not  believe them to be true for the hundreds of thousands of Black people  in their midst. `Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness' did not  apply fully to one-fifth of the country. Yet despite being violently  denied the freedom and justice promised to all, Black Americans  believed fervently in the American creed. Through centuries of Black  resistance and protest, we have helped the country to live up to its  founding ideals.'' She said, ``Without the idealistic, strenuous, and  patriotic efforts of Black Americans, our democracy today would most  likely look very different--it might not be a democracy at all.''   Madam Chair, I have this here, and I want to read a couple of things  from NETWORK, who are our Catholic sisters who are fighting for  justice, because I think this lays it out very clearly in terms of the  progression of where we have been and where we are today through some  of the laws that were passed.   So the NETWORK Catholic sisters laid out the first policy: Slave  codes, 1613 to 1860.   Policy 2: Andrew Johnson's land policies and sharecropping, 1865 to  1880.   Policy 3: Land seizures, 1865 to 1960. During the sixties it was  repealed.   The National Housing Act of 1934. This policy, mind you, guaranteed  loans to white people and legally refused loans to Black people. That  was 1934. That was enacted in 1934.   The Social Security Act, 1935 to present. Black people were twice as  likely to experience hunger or poverty during the Great Depression. And  65 percent of Black people were ineligible to receive this income  support.   The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.   The GI Bill of 1944.   The Separate but Equal Doctrine, 1954 really to present day.  [[Page H7555]]    Policy 9: Subprime loans, 1970s to present day.   Policy 10: The War on Drugs, 1971 to present day.   I really appreciate the sisters and the nuns for laying this out,  because it shows us the institutional policies, the laws that were put  in place that have created this new form of slavery. And this is a very  powerful document. I hope that everyone has a chance to read this. I  include in the Record this document.  [From the Network: Advocates for Justice, Inspired by Catholic Sisters]                      The Racial Wealth and Income Gap     POLICY 1: Slave Codes, the Fugitive Slave Act, and American Chattel                            Slavery (1613-1860)         The slave codes created ``servitude for natural life'' for       African laborers. 250+ years slave labor of millions of       African and Black people was the foundation of the American       economy and global force that it eventually became. On the       eve of the Civil War, Black slaves were valued at an       estimated $3.6 billion (not scaled for modern inflation), and       none of the Black slaves were able to cash in on that value.    POLICY 2: Andrew Johnson's Land Policies and Sharecropping (1865-1880)         After the Civil War, 4 million Black people largely       resorted to renting the farm land of their previous master in       exchange for a ``share'' of their crop. This system of       ``sharecropping'' tied farmers to their former master because       they were legally obligated to buy and sell from them.                     POLICY 3: Land Seizures (1865-1960s)         Black people were legally at risk of having their land       seized from 1865 to the 1960's, due in part to the       sharecropping debt that many Black farmers found themselves       in. White landowners could arbitrarily declare that Black       farmers or business owners were in debt at any time and seize       their land.                  POLICY 4: The National Housing Act of 1934         This policy guaranteed loans to White people and legally       refused loans to Black people and anyone living near Black       neighborhoods. This policy also resulted in Black people       paying sometimes double or triple the amount to buy a       contract from a white person to pay mortgage on a house that       legally wasn't in their name. Meanwhile, Black people were       making payments to secure their chances of being able to own       their home, while still not receiving any equity on the       payments toward that home.               POLICY 5: The Social Security Act (1935-Present)         Black people were twice as likely to experience hunger or       poverty during The Great Depression, and sixty-five percent       of Black people were ineligible to receive this income       support. This was designed in such a way that excluded       farmworkers and domestic workers--who were predominantly       Black--from receiving ``old-age'' and ``unemployment''       insurance. To this day, farmworkers and domestic workers are       excluded.                POLICY 6: The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938         This was enacted to help lift the economy out of the Great       Depression but excluded a number of tip-based professions       predominantly held by Black workers from the first minimum-      wage protections. Even though the Black unemployment and       poverty rates were twice that of White people during the       Great Depression, the very policies meant to alleviate       economic strain were often withheld from the Black community,       making it harder to build wealth in the future.                       POLICY 7: The G.I. Bill of 1944         This was enacted to help World War II veterans adjust to       civilian life by providing low-cost home mortgages, low-      interest business loans, tuition assistance, and unemployment       compensation. Most of the benefits distributed were       unavailable to Black service members.         POLICY 8: Separate but Equal Doctrine (1954 to Present Day)         Despite the Separate but Equal, Doctrine being overturned       in 1954, American schools are more racially segregated today       than they have been in the past four decades, since Black       students are seven times more likely to live in areas of       concentrated poverty, and attend underfunded, understaffed,       and overcrowded schools.               POLICY 9: Subprime Loans (1970s to Present Day)         Starting in the 1970's and continuing today, the private       sector issued subprime loans almost exclusively to Black       families, regardless of income, good credit, or financial       history. As a result, Black families continued to unfairly       pay more money for homes of the same value as their White       counterparts, causing rates of foreclosure among Black       families to increase.              POLICY 10: The War on Drugs (1971 to Present Day)         The War on Drugs exacerbated the racial wealth gap with       practices that inherently targeted Black and brown       communities. Although rates of drug use and selling are       similar across racial lines, Black men are up to 10 times as       likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, prosecuted,       convicted and incarcerated for drug law violations than       White.    Madam Speaker, finally, let me just close by  thanking Congresswoman Karen Bass, once again, for keeping the  motherland of millions of Americans in the forefront of our foreign  policy, for the Congressional Black Caucus for recognizing the  solemnness of this moment, the importance of this moment and  recognizing that African Americans after 400 years are continuing to  fight for justice and for freedom and for a more perfect union for all  Americans.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 21 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, September 10, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
