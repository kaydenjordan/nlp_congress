 Mr. Speaker, families across southeast Wisconsin are  concerned about the rising costs of healthcare, especially prescription  drug costs. No parent should have to worry that they cannot afford  insulin or an EpiPen for their child.   We must work together to bring transparency to drug prices, hold drug  companies accountable, and empower patients. The Stopping the  Pharmaceutical Industry from Keeping drugs Expensive Act, or the SPIKE  Act, is a nonpartisan bill addressing drug pricing.   The SPIKE Act holds drug companies accountable for their pricing of  lifesaving drugs. If a drug manufacturer of insulin or EpiPens  drastically increases its price, the company must publicly justify its  decision to do so.   As a cosponsor of the SPIKE Act, I will continue fighting to ensure  this bill becomes law.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to bring the SPIKE Act to a vote.                            Bring USMCA to a Vote     Mr. Speaker, November 30 marks 1 year since President  Trump agreed with Mexico and Canada to create the United States-Mexico- Canada trade agreement, or USMCA.   USMCA is an improved trade agreement with Wisconsin's largest trading  partners, Canada and Mexico. Mexico passed USMCA. Canada is ready to  ratify it. They are waiting on us.   Generations of Wisconsinites have dedicated their lives to farming.  Our farmers need our help. Our farmers need USMCA now more than ever.   Small dairy farms in Wisconsin are closing. Wisconsin farmers are  struggling to cope with low milk prices and limited access to markets.  USMCA opens dairy markets and allows farmers to sell their milk to  Canada.   I have addressed this Chamber multiple times on the need to get USMCA  across the finish line. Enough is enough. Bring USMCA to a vote.                Take Steps to Prepare Before Disaster Strikes     Mr. Speaker, today, the House is voting on the Reforming  Disaster Recovery Act. This is a nonpartisan bill to help families when  disaster strikes.   In Wisconsin, we have seen our fair share of storms, tornadoes, and  flooding. When a storm hits, resources and assistance must be readily  available. That is why this bill is so important. We must have a plan  in place before the storm to avoid waste, fraud, and abuse.   This bill does that. Right now, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development, HUD, does not have a codified process in place to  distribute assistance to communities in need. The bill requires HUD to  have a clear process in place before disasters strike.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Reforming  Disaster Recovery Act. We cannot always know where a storm will strike  or when it will hit, but we can take steps to be prepared and respond.                            ____________________
