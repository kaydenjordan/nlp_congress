 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bedford County  Sheriff Mike Brown and his wife, Liberty University professor, Dr.  Janet Brown, for their tireless efforts to combat human trafficking and  human sexual slavery throughout the world.   The Browns founded the Safe Surfin' Foundation in 1998 with the  mission to educate youth and teens about the dangers of the internet  and social media. In May the Browns were invited to present a program  they developed called Cyber Safety While Accessing Technology, or Cyber  S.W.A.T., to the Global Sustainability Network at the Vatican.   Cyber S.W.A.T. utilizes the social cognitive theory, a means of  education, where students learn by observing and imitating the behavior  of their peers. This program was first launched at Jefferson Forest  High School in Lynchburg, Virginia, where students received training  and designed presentations for their classmates about online threats.  The response was outstanding, and since then the program has been  implemented in eight other high schools across the country.   Cyber S.W.A.T. has the potential not only to save lives in the United  States, but around the world.   I want to thank the Browns for their efforts to protect the next  generation by teaching them proper internet safety, and I look forward  to watching the continued success of the Cyber S.W.A.T. program.                            ____________________
