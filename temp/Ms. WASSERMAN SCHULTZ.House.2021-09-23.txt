 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Iron Dome Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2022, which I was proud to  help bring to the floor today.   The United States has long supported critical funding to help our  democratic ally, Israel, protect herself by herself.   During my trips to Israel, I have been privileged to spend hours  meeting with families living near the border with Gaza who huddle in  bomb shelters designed to dually function as schools. There you can see  Israel's geographic vulnerability firsthand and clearly understand the  urgency of securing this replenishment funding for Israel's highly  effective Iron Dome missile defense program.   Israel relies on the Iron Dome to defend her citizens against  incoming rocket fire from terrorist groups like Hamas, Islamic jihad,  and Hezbollah. Earlier this year when terrorist groups fired 4,500  rockets at Israel's population centers in just 11 days, the Iron Dome  effectively intercepted 90 percent of those rockets, saving innocent  Israeli and Palestinian lives.   The system also maintains regional stability by preventing dangerous  escalation. For these reasons, I know I will continue to use my vote  and my voice to maintain our Nation's ironclad commitment to Israel's  security, including maintaining her qualitative military edge,  especially against emerging terrorist threats.   This is a defense system. Its whole purpose is to stop violence and  save lives. By supporting this program, you are promoting peace.   I am proud to have worked on a strategy with other pro-Israel  Democrats and our House leadership to ensure there is no question about  our commitment to the safety and security of our closest ally in the  Middle East, Israel.   I urge the United States Senate to take up this urgent funding bill  immediately to defend our ally Israel and increase prospects for peace  and avoid the CR debt-limit debate. I thank the chair for bringing this  important legislation to the floor.
