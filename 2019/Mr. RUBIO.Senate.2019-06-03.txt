 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my pleasure to recognize  a service-minded small business. Small businesses fulfill important  needs in our communities, not only through their valuable products and  services, but also in their ability to connect with and assist their  fellow neighbors in times of need. It is my distinct pleasure to name  Royal Furniture and Design of the Florida Keys as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   Founded in 1984, Royal Furniture and Design has grown from a single  retail store in Marathon, FL, to a full service home design and  remodeling company with three Keys showrooms and a warehouse in Florida  City. Owned and operated by the Elwell family, Ross and Janice own the  company, while their sons Chris and Ryan help to manage the Key West  and Marathon stores. Today, Royal Furniture and Design employs 40 full- time workers. The Elwell family has long-standing, generational ties  with the Keys community as their family has been small business owners  in Marathon since 1959.   For decades, the Elwell's have been incredible philanthropists.  Following  [[Page S3160]]  the devastation of Hurricane Irma, Royal Furniture and Design set up  tents in their parking lot and fed members of the community every day  for a month. Immediately following the hurricane, they donated space in  their former Marathon location to the American Legion to store  emergency relief and water supplies. In collaboration with other local  organizations, they helped 48 families who were severely impacted by  the storm with free, brand-new furniture.   Royal Furniture and Design is an outstanding example of the  charitable services that small businesses offer our communities  throughout Florida. They continue to host charity cooking events  throughout the Keys in addition to their Mardi Gras masquerade ball to  benefit the Fishermen's Community Hospital. In 2018, Royal Furniture  and Design was recognized as both the Best Family Owned Business and  Best Business by Marathon Rotary Club and the Marathon Weekly  Newspaper. Members of the Marathon community voted on these awards and  ultimately chose Royal Furniture and Design for their dedication to  customer service.   Royal Furniture and Design and the entire Elwell family are an  outstanding example of the American entrepreneurial spirit. They  continue to go above and beyond to serve the Keys community while  treating each customer like family. It is my pleasure to be able to  recognize the Elwell family and the entire team at Royal Furniture and  Design as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Congratulations, thank you for your service to Floridians, and I look  forward to watching your continued service and success.                            ____________________
