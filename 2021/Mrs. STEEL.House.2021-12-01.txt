 Madam Speaker, the massive social spending bill the House  passed just 2 weeks ago is a disaster for our future. If the policies  in the build back framework are made permanent, this spending would  amount to $4.12 trillion over the next 10 years.   I always say that other Members of Congress who write these bills  must not know how to count because the revenue for this bill is just  not there.   We should not spend more than what we have. Families don't run their  households this way. The government shouldn't either.   I do not want my kids and grandkids paying for this irresponsible  spending. Americans are already experiencing record-high inflation.   The trillions in new spending will only make costs higher. I continue  to fight against the government taking more of our hard-earned money.                            ____________________
