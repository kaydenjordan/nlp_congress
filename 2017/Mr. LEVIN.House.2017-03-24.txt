 Mr. Speaker, this is the Republican bill: a trillion  dollars in lost health care for millions; at the same time, a trillion  dollars in tax breaks, mostly for the very wealthy and corporations.   The Republican majority says their bill is to provide patient- centered health care, but for patients there is no healthcare center  when there is no insurance.   The Republican bill robs millions of needed insurance for their  health and, in many cases, would rob them of their life.   The Republican plan would create death panels for numerous unknown  Americans.   This is not our America. America can do better. We must.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Neal for his work and that of all  of us on the committee on the Democratic side.   As CBO has said, under this bill, 24 million Americans would lose  their health insurance next year, and 24 million over the next decade.   Today, most are invisible, but they would become seen and heard at  emergency rooms, with no other place to go with more serious illnesses  because of no preventive care.   They are people 50 to 64 with far higher premiums; mothers without  access to affordable maternity care; elderly evicted from nursing  homes, losing coverage from Medicaid, the largest source of long-term  care in our Nation; and lives lost that could have been saved. I  repeat: lives lost that could have been saved.   I remember some time ago I met a woman who had health insurance  through her job. She contracted breast cancer and received treatment  but then lost her job and insurance. Then the ACA covered her. She  looked straight at us and said that, without further treatments, she  would not be alive today.   Under this bill, a trillion dollars is lost for health care, and  there will be a trillion dollars in tax cuts, mostly for the very  wealthy and corporations.   This is not America. I repeat: This is not America.
