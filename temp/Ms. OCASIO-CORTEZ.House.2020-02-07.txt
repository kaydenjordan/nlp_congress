 Madam Chair, I thank the chairwoman for the  generous introduction and time on this bill.   Madam Chair, the fact of the matter is that innocent children,  families, and the elderly in Puerto Rico are dying. They are breathing  poisoned air, and they are now enduring the psychological trauma of  ongoing earthquakes.   My own grandmother is oxygen dependent, and every day when the Earth  shakes below her, we don't know if she will have the power to continue  her equipment that is medically necessary.   While everyone here is arguing over money and over the administration  of a colonial state, we have to take a look at the actual reality on  the ground. Ninety-five percent of schools in Puerto Rico are not up to  code. They are leaving thousands of Puerto Rican children vulnerable to  the effects of natural disasters. Many have lost all their belongings,  and many more live with psychological trauma.   But this administration is not releasing any of these funds that are  supposed to be duly allocated for recovery. For that, we have to make  sure that we support this bill, and I strongly support H.R. 5687.
