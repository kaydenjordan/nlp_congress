 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal for yielding me  time.   I am in awe of the countless unsung heroes who made it possible for  all of us to get here safely today. We thank them.   I am here not just to vote for badly needed additional relief, but in  support of the Speaker and our leadership in their successful effort  resisting the Republicans and the Senate in fighting against making it  better.   But I am here to give voice to my fellow Oregonians, who know so much  more needs to be done, that it is outrageous that big banks and the  Trump administration gave too much to the  [[Page H1930]]  wrong people and not enough to those most in need.   The administration can do something that costs taxpayers nothing:  clarify the PPP provisions with a simple answer on how exactly the  forgiveness provisions are going to work.   I was on the phone until 1 a.m. last night with a small businesswoman  in Portland who, because of this lack of clarity, is unsure if she  should even accept the loan that she has been given.   We must do better for the small businesses and the millions of jobs  that depend upon them.
