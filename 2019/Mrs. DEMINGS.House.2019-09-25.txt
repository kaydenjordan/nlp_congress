 Madam Speaker, Republican President Teddy Roosevelt  said that ``patriotism means to stand by the country.'' It does not  mean to stand by the President at any cost.   The whistleblower is a patriot who stood up for their country. It is  time for Americans of good conscience, starting with every member of  this committee, to follow in that patriot's footsteps and unite behind  the belief that no one is above the law.   The President has abused the powers of his office. Perhaps he is  afraid of losing the next election. Perhaps it is just who he is.   When the President of Ukraine brought up a request to buy military  equipment from the United States, the President said--and yes, it is  quite clear--``I would like you to do us a favor.''   But even worse, press reports indicate that the whistleblower's  complaint was far more extensive than any one call.   The ongoing cover-up by this White House has prevented us from  immediately reviewing the report that is required by law.   Further, the administration must immediately move to ensure that the  whistleblower is fully protected as required under law.   To my colleagues, history is about to be written at this moment. I  ask you to think about your place in that history. Decide whether you  want to defend and stand up for corruption or abuse of power or stand  up for the country we all swore to protect.
