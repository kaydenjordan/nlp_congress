 Mr. Speaker, the land of opportunity is right here. It  is called the United States of America. But, unfortunately, there is  not always a level playing field when it comes to that land of  opportunity. This year is the 83rd anniversary of the National Labor  Relations Act, the act that gave workers a voice, a voice in the  workplace. It gave them the ability to bargain--along with their  employers--a living wage, pensions, the ability to retire with dignity.   But today, we are really debating how to hurt workers--that somehow  you get treated outside of the reservations in a humane way, where  casinos are operating in a very profitable way, but you cross that  line, and you are being treated differently. You are being treated less  than and doing it all under the guise of Native American sovereignty.   The vast majority of casinos on their properties are treated with  respect by employees. But they were able to get to some folks to  introduce this piece that somehow let them try to do it differently on  that line. When we cross it, you are less than. We can take advantage  of you, and we see that happen time after time.   I have been before the NLRB many times, had cases. I won many, but I  also lost them. But I always felt as if I was treated fairly. And that  is what we should be doing here, treating employees, no matter where  you are in this great country, fairly. It has been a decade since we  raised the minimum wage. And somehow, we are just looking for no reason  to hurt employees.    Mr. Speaker, we want to respect the sovereign nations,  but we can't pick and choose the way we treat them. Certainly,  everybody who works in this great country deserves an opportunity to be  treated fairly.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Transport  Workers Union of America that talks about being fairly treated.           Transport Workders Union of America, AFL-CIO,                                                  January 10, 2018.      Vote Alert: Vote NO on the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act (S. 140)         Dear Representative: On behalf of the Transport Workers       Union of America (TWU), AFL-CIO, we write urging you to       oppose the  [[Page H123]]       Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act. This bill (introduced as H.R.       986) has been paired with unrelated bills and packaged as       part of S. 140, which the House is expected to vote on today.       We urge you to oppose the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act by       voting NO on S. 140.        The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act would exempt from the       protections of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)       workers employed by tribal-owned and -operated commercial       enterprises located on tribal lands. Under this bill, the       NLRA rights and protections would be denied to more than       600,000 tribal casino workers, the vast majority of whom are       not Native American.        This bill would overturn a 2004 decision by the Bush       Administration's National Labor Relations Board (Board), in       which the Board applied the NLRA to a tribal casino (San       Manuel Indian Bingo and Casino, 341 NLRB No. 138 (2004)). In       reaching this decision, the Board applied a test: the NLRA       will not apply if its application would ``touch exclusive       rights of self-governance in purely intramural matters.''       And, the NLRA will not apply if it would ``abrogate Indian       treaty rights.'' The Board also considered other factors,       including that the casino in question was a typical       commercial enterprise that catered to non-Native American       customers and employed non-Native Americans. While the Board       asserted NLRA protections in the San Manuel decision, it       ruled the opposite way, denying its jurisdiction in a       companion case (Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation, 341 NLRB       No. 139 (2004)).        We understand the importance of tribal sovereignty and       support the principle in true self-governance matters. But       the fundamental human rights of employees are not the       exclusive concern of tribal enterprises or tribal       governments. While proponents of the bill falsely compare       tribal governments to state governments, they miss a glaring       truth: while state governments are exempt from NLRA       protections, their workers are eligible to vote for those who       set their labor laws. But the vast majority of the 600,000       casino workers who would be impacted by the Tribal Labor       Sovereignty Act are not Native Americans, and therefore have       no voice in the selection of those setting tribal policy nor       the ability to petition the tribal government to protect       their rights.        We object to a sweeping exemption of all tribal enterprises       from the NLRA, and believe the test used by the Board to       determine whether the NLRA is applicable should remain.       Unfortunately, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act has been       packaged with unrelated bills in an attempt to pressure       support for this particular bill. While TWU has no position       on the other bills contained in S. 140, we urge you vote NO       in opposition to the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask Members to really look inside  yourself. Is this the best way to treat employees? Is this how we help  lift up all of those workers? I think not, and I urge Members to reject  this attempt to hurt workers and not protect sovereignty.
