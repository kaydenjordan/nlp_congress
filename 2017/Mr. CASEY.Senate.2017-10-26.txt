 Madam President, I wish to extend my support for the  Baha'i community in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the birth  of Baha'u'llah, the founder of the Baha'i Faith.   Baha'u'llah preached a message of justice, unity, and peace. The  religion that he founded has spread across the world, including to the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. While the Baha'i people have and continue  to face persecution for their beliefs, they persevere by promoting a  message of peace and equality and with a commitment to service. I  congratulate the Baha'i community of Pennsylvania who have contributed  so much to the spirit of the Commonwealth on this momentous  anniversary.                            ____________________
