 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   It is with the heaviest of hearts that I stand in tribute to  Congressman John Robert Lewis this evening.   Brother John, your imprint on my heart and soul is forever.   The loss of John Lewis has left us with a deep, unanswerable sadness,  and a resolve that will echo in this Chamber and within all of our  hearts forever.   Time and again, John gave us the gift of his courage and lit our path  with a humble but fierce moral light. He risked everything to teach us,  to remind us what it really means to fight for liberty and justice for  all; and why we must fight on, even after our great champion has  fallen.   My thoughts, my prayers, and my heart go out to John's family, to  Michael, and his staff, his community, and all who knew and loved this  giant of a man.   May John's light always fill the halls of our Capitol. May his hope  guide our hands, and his vision for a more perfect Union continue to  inspire us with timeless faith and purpose.   Of late, when I would talk to Brother John, he had a concern that  those wheels of progress toward a more perfect Union might roll  backward. We cannot tolerate that. Brother John taught us that; that we  will only go forward.   So if we truly loved this man, if we truly want to honor his spirit,  let us make certain that those wheels of progress toward a more perfect  Union, in fact, go forward and upward.   God bless you, my friend. You walked so humbly with your God. Rest in  peace. Rest in power, my dear and so noble of a friend.
