 Mr. Speaker, over this last month, my hometown of Austin,  Texas, was terrorized by a serial bomber, a serial killer. Mr. Speaker,  fortunately, this nightmare that my hometown of Austin has lived  through has come to an end, and now is the time to heal the wounds for  the victims and their families.   I want to thank the 500 Federal agents who descended upon my hometown  of Austin for their great work and magnificent job working with my  Texas Department of Public Safety and my Austin Police Department--many  of whom I have worked with when I was in the U.S. Attorney's Office  down there--for their incredible work bringing this killer to his final  justice.   Mr. Speaker, I now ask for a moment of silence for the victims and  their families of this horrible tragedy.
