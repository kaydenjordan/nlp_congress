 Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment  to recognize and honor the life of Rev. Bertha L. Givens, a great South  Carolinian, who departed this life on September 22, 2018. Reverend  Givens was a well-respected and universally loved leader of her local  Green Pond community, as well as Colleton County as a whole.   Reverend Givens served as a supportive and devoted matriarch not only  to her husband of 48 years, her children, and extended family, but also  to dozens of foster children and children in the community over the  years. Additionally, Reverend Givens was known to provide counsel and  comfort to each and every member of the community who came to her, and  countless individuals benefitted from her wisdom, gentle voice, and  unfaltering faith.   As a reverend, she lived a life of impeccable integrity in ministry.  She served for many years as a class leader and associate pastor at Mt.  Olive A.M.E. in Green Pond, worked in prison outreach ministry, and  took on many other positions of church leadership. She also founded the  major community outreach program, Harvest Day, which gives away produce  and preserves, as well as teaches God's word to members of the  community. She did this for over 30 years, desiring no fanfare or  recognition, which only highlights her strong Christian devotion and  conviction.   Reverend Givens will surely be missed by all of those that had the  pleasure to know her and in the Green Pond community especially. Her  life and legacy provide an example of true Christian selflessness and  spirit to all.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to wish Mr. James  ``Jim'' French of Charleston, SC, a happy 92nd birthday.   Mr. French, a committed, passionate, and award-winning journalist,  served as a U.S. Navy chief journalist for 26 years. After retiring, he  founded the Charleston Chronicle in 1971. His work at the Charleston  Chronicle, focused on offering solutions for problems within the  African-American community and successfully led to the paper receiving  hundreds of awards from organizations throughout the Lowcountry and  Nation.   Mr. French's legacy will forever be defined not just by his work and  service, but by all of the many people he has touched in the Charleston  community.   I would like to recognize Mr. French for his service to our country  and our amazing State; he truly represents the very best of South  Carolina.   Happy 92nd birthday, Mr. French. May God bless you.                            ____________________
