 Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the last time  as a Member of Congress. For the past 6 years, it has been an  extraordinary honor to serve the residents of central and northwest  Connecticut as their Representative in the House.   The title for this job is a humble one: Representative--not emperor,  not knower of all things, but Representative.   Congress was not my dream, but making a difference was. In 2005, my  then 15-year-old daughter challenged me to either run for the local  town council or stop complaining. I ran. I  [[Page H10032]]  found that I could get things done, first on the town council and then  as a State representative.   I came to Congress with a desire to make a difference for people, to  help solve their problems, fight for affordable quality healthcare,  ensure education that addresses the needs of every child, work across  the aisle for better jobs and better pay for Americans, and keep us all  safe and free   Yet I arrived in Congress in the aftermath of the terrible shootings  of 20 6- and 7-year-old children and six educators in the town of  Newtown in my district, 6 years ago this coming Friday. My task  immediately became how to truly care for and represent those families  and be an effective voice for taking action to prevent gun violence. At  the time, I did not even know how to find the elevator to get to my  attic office in the Cannon House Office Building.   John Dingell, the longest serving Member of Congress, took me under  his wing and helped me navigate these Halls. He gave me invaluable  advice. He said:         Elizabeth, always remember this: What you do is very       important. But you are not important.    He also told me:         It is your job to know your district and vote your       district.    How right he was. I learned my district. My team and I worked with  others to get lots of legislation passed to help veterans and their  families, to support STEM education for women, girls, and children of  color; to modernize and upgrade our infrastructure; and to fight the  scourge of opioid addiction. We helped thousands of individuals at home  cut through red tape and get much-needed support. By working with  people, we were able to help government work for people.   Here are some things that I have learned:   The American people are good, great, and eager to see our democracy  work better;   Sharing credit is not only the right thing to do, but it works;   If you listen to others, if you look for and build on common ground,  you can get things done even with people with whom you disagree on many  issues.   The first step is often the hardest. In politics, Mr. Speaker, you  need to earn support. You are not entitled to it. You will fail  sometimes. You will not meet your own high expectations. You will  disappoint people. You will lose an election, but you get up the next  day and you try harder.   If there is nothing you would be willing to lose an election over,  you shouldn't run for office. Democracy needs people who are prepared  to lose their job to make a difference.   Democracy is not about perfection. Democracy is about doing your best  every day and bringing out the best in others; and when we fail--which  we will--we should not give up. We should get right back to work.   Mr. Speaker, you shouldn't run because you know you will win; you  should run because there are things worth fighting for.   If we remember our common values rather than call into question each  other's integrity, there is much we can do together. Democracy is  something we do; it is not something we tweet about.   Democracy is hard. It is not a spectator sport. You don't need  permission in this great country. Democracy gives us--each and every  one of us--the opportunity and the right to run, to serve, and to make  a difference.   American democracy is a great thing, but it requires us to pitch in  and to do our part. We have the opportunity--and in these challenging  times for our Nation and the world, I believe we have an obligation--to  get involved.   I want to thank my amazing family for their love, their support, and  their sacrifices over more than a dozen years of elected office. I  thank the voters who entrusted me to work on their behalf. I thank my  excellent staff who have worked so hard and ably. I thank the many  colleagues who generously guided me and worked with me on issues of  common concern for the American people.   In closing, John Dingell's words return to me:         If you ever look up at the Capitol Dome at night and it       doesn't send shivers down your spine, you don't deserve to be       here because you aren't sufficiently in awe of American       democracy.    I can say without hesitation that the white of the Capitol Dome  gleaming in the night still sends shivers down my spine. It always  will, for we are fortunate enough to live in this amazing country where  we have the right to choose our leaders, to raise our voices, and,  together, to forge a better nation and a better future for all our  children.                            ____________________
