 Madam President, I rise today to explain my position  on Senator Sanders' motion to instruct conferees to remove language  from any final conference report of the U.S. Innovation and Competition  Act and the America COMPETES Act that would provide $10 billion for  NASA to develop a second Human Landing System.   California has long been the epicenter of the global aerospace and  commercial space industries, and I am proud of the many technical and  scientific advancements made by California scientists and engineers.  The bills that the conference committee will consider are intended to  ensure that the innovation in aerospace in California and beyond has  the support needed to maintain the United States' global competitive  edge and lead scientific advancement.   When the Senate passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act last  summer, I was concerned that section 2614 of the bill would circumvent  the competitive process at the heart of Federal procurement and  undermined NASA's existing contract for the Artemis Human Landing  System.   By that time, NASA had already completed a contract review and award  for the Artemis program for the development of a landing system,  selecting the proposal by SpaceX. The SpaceX bid not only received the  highest rating for its technical aspects and management approach, it  also had the lowest price.   Nevertheless, the unsuccessful contractors who did not receive the  final contract, Blue Origin and Dynetics, filed a complaint with the  Government Accountability Office, alleging violations and unreasonable  evaluation practices.   The GAO investigated for 3 months and ultimately denied the claims by  the contractors, saying: ``The evaluation of all three proposals was  reasonable and consistent with applicable procurement law, regulation,  and the announcement's terms.''   Like Senator Sanders, I had initial concerns that section 2614 of the  U.S. Innovation and Competition Act would create an additional Human  Landing System contract, thereby providing substantial public funding  to contractors who lost a fair competitive contract award. Moreover,  the terms of section 2614 threatened to force NASA into a rushed  acquisition and could have diverted funds from other important projects  to cover the expenses of this second Artemis award.   However, my staff and I have worked with Senator Cantwell and her  staff at the Senate Commerce Committee to address those concerns. I  understand that the Commerce Committee will work through the conference  process to extend the timeline for the new contract in the bill-- previously just 90 days--to ensure that NASA can undertake another fair  procurement process.   They have further committed to working with NASA to ensure that the  language does not represent an unfunded mandate, forcing NASA to pull  funds from other programs.   Lastly, NASA's budget request this year for the landing system was  $1.5 billion, a significantly more reasonable amount than the enormous  figure included in the original Senate bill. As a member of the  Appropriations Subcommittee for Commerce, Justice, and Science, I will  continue to observe this program closely to ensure that these Federal  funds are spent responsibly and without favoritism.   I want to reiterate that I have long supported NASA's scientific  endeavors, including the upcoming Artemis moon mission, and I look  forward to seeing the improved language in the final version of the  bill. I thank Senator Cantwell and her staff for working with me to  address my concerns, and I respectfully note that I will vote no on the  motion by Senator Sanders.                                Vote on Motion
