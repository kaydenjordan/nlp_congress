 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor a titan of Miami,  Mr. Gus Machado, who passed away last month.   Gus is remembered for his iconic leadership as a pioneering marketer  and owner of car dealerships around Miami. Ford Motor Company  recognized his leadership by honoring Mr. Machado with the President's  Award in 2003, 2009, and 2010.   He was a founder of the United States-Cuba Democracy PAC, but his  real legacy will be his heart of service. In 2008, he created the Gus  Machado Family Foundation, and every school year, the foundation  provides more than 400 children with backpacks full of school supplies.  Another impressive example of his generosity was his $5 million  donation to St. Thomas University to establish a business school.   He was one of the best the Cuban-American exile community in Miami  has produced. I am proud to stand on the floor of the United States  House to pay tribute to Mr. Machado. His life was an example of faith,  hard work, determination, family, friends, and a good community. In  other words, he was the best example of the American Dream.   Rest in peace.                            ____________________
