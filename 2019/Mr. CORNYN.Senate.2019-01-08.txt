 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today the Senate will vote to begin  consideration of legislation that will address some of the seemingly  never-ending challenges the world--including the United States--is  facing in the Middle East.   The decision made at the beginning of the 20th century by then First  Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, to convert British ships from  coal to oil for fuel changed world history by making access to Middle  East oil reserves a national security imperative for all developed  nations.   More recently, on 9/11 of 2001, when nearly 3,000 Americans lost  their lives in a terrorist attack directed from Afghanistan on New  York's World Trade Center and the Pentagon, we learned a hard lesson:  Although separated by an ocean, what happens in the region does not  stay in the region.   Finally, with the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the nuclear  aspirations of Iran--the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism in the  world--to attain them, the relative stability and security of the  Middle East have a direct connection to our national security, as well  as that of our allies, like Israel.   With the administration's recent announcement that the United States  will begin withdrawing troops from Syria, this debate and these votes  could not be more timely.   While I am comforted by National Security Advisor John Brennan's  recent statement that the withdrawal from Syria will be conditions- based, the precise details of how and when it will be executed remain  to be seen. One thing, however, is perfectly clear: We cannot allow the  creation of a power vacuum in the Middle East to bolster our  adversaries' influence in the region. That is precisely what this  legislation addresses. The Strengthening America's Security in the  Middle East Act incorporates four bipartisan, noncontroversial bills  that were nearly enacted last year, but the clock on the 115th Congress  ran out on December 31. As we begin what I hope will be another  productive year in the Senate, I am glad we will have a chance to vote  on this legislation.   Our national interests demand that we fully support and ensure the  security of Israel--our closest ally in the region. As the majority  leader said last week, this bill affirms that the United States needs  to do more than just talk the talk; we must also walk the walk to  support Israel's security.   This legislation will help Israel maintain its qualitative military  edge against ongoing threats by authorizing military assistance and  allowing the transfer of equipment and defensive weapons. Importantly,  it will also assist Israel in countering the emerging threat of  unmanned aerial vehicles deployed by Iran, in particular.   In addition to supporting Israel, it will empower State and local  governments in the United States to counter the anti-Israel boycott,  divestment, and sanctions movement--better known as BDS--and its  discriminatory economic warfare against the Jewish state.   In addition to nurturing our relationship with Israel, the bill also  recognizes the importance of supporting Jordan--another key regional  ally. It reauthorizes legislation to strengthen our defense cooperation  and support Jordan's response to the overwhelming humanitarian crisis  caused by the Syrian civil war. According to the United Nations, there  are more than 740,000 refugees in Jordan. That equates to 89 refugees  per 1,000 inhabitants, making them the second highest refugee host  nation per capita in the world.  [[Page S37]]    The impact of the crisis in Syria is immense and potentially  destabilizing and requires our support to maintain the peace.   Finally, this bill takes critical steps to address the ongoing war  and humanitarian crisis in Syria by providing aid to impacted  communities and condemns the heinous human rights violations committed  by the murderous Assad regime.   Until this horrendous conflict is resolved, new sanctions will be  imposed on anyone who supports Syria either financially or militarily.   It is true that this bill will not solve all the problems in the  Middle East. It will not, for example, provide justice to innocent  civilians killed by the Assad regime. It will not rebuild the  communities treated as collateral damage throughout this crisis. But it  is a step to ensure our allies are prepared to fight for and defend our  shared national security interests.   Senate Democrats have indicated, unfortunately, that they are likely  to block this legislation from coming to the floor, as their  discussions with the President on border security remain at an impasse.  Leader McConnell, though, has made it clear that the Senate will not  waste time holding show votes on legislation that the President will  not sign, so we continue to wait for Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader  Schumer to take serious, credible action to break that impasse. Until  that time, there is a lot of work we can and should do, such as  debating and voting on this legislation, which will protect our  national security interests in the Middle East.   Twenty-five percent of our government has already been shut down  because of this impasse. I urge our Democratic colleagues in the Senate  not to shut down the work of the Senate too.   I want to thank the majority leader for scheduling this important  debate and vote, and I look forward to voting yes when the time comes.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as I mentioned, this partial government  shutdown continues, now on its 18th day. But 18 days in, not much has  changed. The newly elected Democratic House refused to come to the  negotiating table with a serious offer or to negotiate in good faith.   This entire debate has been surreal. I would say it has been a joke,  but it is really not funny. It has now degenerated into a game of silly  semantics, while losing sight of just how much is at stake for the  people affected.   A secure and vibrant border is critical to the safety and livelihood  of our entire country, and it, of course, plays a vital part in the  daily life for many Texans, especially those who live and work in the  border region. If you visit El Paso, for example, out West, you will  see firsthand how interconnected the city is with its neighbor, Juarez.  Mexico is literally on the other side of the international bridge. Each  day at that single port of entry, an average of 20,000 people cross the  border on foot legally--going to work, going to school, visiting  friends and family, or shopping. That is in addition to the 35,000 car  crossings and the 2,500 cargo trucks that cross each day just at the El  Paso port of entry.   I often compare the United States and Mexico to an old married couple  who have occasional differences but who can't get divorced. We depend  on one another, and we depend on a safe, secure, and efficient border  to allow both countries to live in harmony.   Not everyone or everything attempting to cross the border is in our  country's best interest. Transnational criminals, drug smugglers, and  human traffickers try to take advantage of any opportunity, any gaps in  our border, and they use it to infiltrate, threaten, and endanger our  communities.   For too long, our frontline officers and agents haven't had the tools  and resources they need to do their job. Whether it is outdated  infrastructure, personnel shortages, or technology, the fact remains  that we need additional border security funding to empower these hard- working officers and agents to complete their mission at both our ports  of entry and between those ports of entry.   After talking to the experts--Border Patrol officials in Texas, as  well as local stakeholders--I introduced legislation in the fall of  2017 to address a number of their concerns. That legislation, called  the Building America's Trust Act, would have authorized approximately  $15 billion over 4 years for a long-term border security and interior  enforcement strategy. Notably, the bill provided a great deal of  discretion to the Department of Homeland Security's experts on the  ground to determine what tactics were needed and where.   As my friend Manuel Padilla, former Chief of the Border Patrol's Rio  Grande Valley Sector, once told me--he said: The answer to border  security from the Border Patrol's perspective is finding the right  balance of three things: personnel, technology, and infrastructure.   The landscape along the U.S.-Mexico border--particularly the 1,200  miles of common border between Mexico and Texas--the geography varies  significantly, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution to border  security. That is why it is important to listen and learn from law  enforcement and key stakeholders how to adapt the right mix to each  area. That way, we can ensure we are deploying the most effective and  practical solutions to achieve operational control along the southern  border.   Yes, we need physical infrastructure in places--a fence, a wall, a  vehicle barrier, for example--because the hard-working agents and  officers on the ground tell us that it works, and we would benefit from  more of it. But we also need personnel to enforce the laws along the  border and ensure our ports of entry are operating efficiently. And,  yes, we need technology, things like scanners to scan for drugs that  are embedded in shipments that come across the border. We need drones,  radar, and sensors to help maximize border security, as well as access  to the Rio Grande for Border Patrol agents so they can police the  border for illegal entry.   This shouldn't be a partisan debate, and historically, our  differences on this topic have not been so polarizing. I think the  nature of our political system today makes it easy to forget that not  too long ago, border security was something supported by both political  parties.   In 2006, the Senate passed the Secure Fence Act by a vote of 80 to  19. That is what I would call a bipartisan victory. Among those who  voted for that bill include many current and former leaders of the  Democratic Party, including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, then-Senator  Barack Obama, and then-Senator Hillary Clinton. They didn't believe  that fences and walls and physical barriers were immoral, as apparently  the current Speaker of the House of Representatives does. Not only did  that legislation call for more than 800 miles of fencing along the  U.S.-Mexico border, it also authorized the other important components  of border security that I talked about, things like technology and  personnel. That was in the 2006.   In 2013, more recently, all 54 Democratic Senators voted for $46  billion in border security--every single one--and now President Trump's  request for $5 billion is somehow a nonstarter.   The Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration  Modernization Act provided funding for, yes, infrastructure, personnel,  and technology. That is exactly the right mix that Chief Padilla  mentioned, which I referred to a moment ago. These are really the same  types of issues we are talking about today. These are not radical  ideas. We need a sensible combination of physical barriers, technology,  and personnel.   My Democratic colleagues supported border security during the Bush  administration. They supported border security during the Obama  administration. Now I urge them to come to the table with a serious  proposal to help secure our border and end this standoff and to stop  the foolishness and the political games.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I now suggest the absence of a quorum.
