 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I want to begin my remarks with some of the most beautiful words in  our country's history: ``We the people of the United States, in order  to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic  tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general  welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our  posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution of the United  States of America.''   It goes on immediately to establish Article I, the legislative  branch; Article II, the executive branch; Article III, the judiciary-- the genius of the Constitution, a separation of powers, three coequal  branches of government to be a check and balance on each other.   It is to that that we take the oath of office. We gather here on that  opening day with our families gathered around to proudly raise our hand  to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. And that  is exactly what we are doing today.   Sadly, this is not any cause for any glee or comfort. This is  something that is very solemn, that is something prayerful, and that we  had to gather so much information to take us to this next step.   Again, this is a solemn occasion. Nobody, I doubt anybody in this  place or anybody that you know, who comes to Congress to take the oath  of office  [[Page H8691]]  comes to Congress to impeach the President of the United States unless  his actions are jeopardizing our honoring our oath of office.   I am grateful to our committee chairs for all the careful and  thoughtful investigation they have been doing as this inquiry has  proceeded.   Today, the House takes the next step forward, as we establish the  procedures for open hearings conducted by the House Intelligence  Committee so that the public can see the facts for themselves.   This resolution ensures transparency, advancing the public disclosure  of deposition transcripts, and outlining the procedure for the transfer  of evidence to the Judiciary Committee to use in its proceedings.   It enables effective public hearings, setting out procedures for the  questioning of witnesses, and continuing the precedent of giving the  minority the same rights in questioning witnesses as the majority,  which has been true at every step of this inquiry, despite what you  might hear fomenting there.   It provides the President and his counsel opportunities to  participate, including presenting his case, submitting requests for  testimony, attending hearings, raising objections to testimony given,  cross-examining witnesses, and more.   Contrary to what you may have heard today, we give more opportunity  to his case than was given to other Presidents before.    Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Schiff for making that point so  clearly.   These actions--this process, these open hearings, seeking the truth  and making it available to the American people--will inform Congress on  the very difficult decisions we will have to make in the future as to  whether to impeach the President.   That decision has not been made. That is what the inquiry will  investigate. Then, we can make the decision based on the truth. I don't  know why the Republicans are afraid of the truth.   Every Member should support allowing the American people to hear the  facts for themselves. That is really what this vote is about. It is  about the truth.   What is at stake? What is at stake in all of this is nothing less  than our democracy.   Madam Chair, I proudly stand next to the flag, and I thank the  gentleman from New York for providing it for us. So many have fought  and died for this flag, which stands for our democracy.   When Benjamin Franklin came out of Independence Hall--you have heard  this over and over--on September 17, 1787, the day our Constitution was  adopted, people said to him: ``Dr. Franklin, what do we have, a  monarchy or a republic?'' As you know, he said: ``A republic, if you  can keep it.'' If we can keep it.   This Constitution is the blueprint for our Republic and not a  monarchy.                                time  1015    But when we have a President who says Article II says ``I can do  whatever I want,'' that is in defiance of the separation of powers.  That is not what our Constitution says.   What is at stake? Our democracy.   What are we fighting for? Defending our democracy for the people.   In the early days of our Revolution, Thomas Paine said, ``The times  have found us.'' The times found our Founders to declare independence  from a monarchy, to fight a war of independence, to win, to write our  founding documents--and, thank God, they made them amendable so that we  can always be expanding freedom.   And the genius--again, the genius--of that Constitution was the  separation of powers. Any usurping of that power is a violation of our  oath of office.   So, proudly, we all raised our hand to protect, defend, and support  the Constitution of the United States. That is what this vote is about.   Today, we think the times found our Founders. The times have found  others in the course of our history to protect our democracy and to  keep our country united.   The times have found each and every one of us in this room--and in  our country--to pay attention to how we protect and defend the  Constitution of the United States: honoring the vision of our Founders  who declared independence from a monarch and established a country  contrary to that principle; honoring the men and women in uniform who  fight for our flag, for our freedom, and for our democracy; and  honoring the aspirations of our children so that no President, whoever  he or she may be in the future, could decide that Article II says they  can do whatever they want.   Again, let us honor our oath of office. Let us defend our democracy.  Let us have a good vote, today, and have clarity--clarity--as to how we  proceed, why we proceed, and, again, doing so in a way that honors the  Constitution.   We must honor the Constitution in how we do this; we must respect the  institution we serve; and we must heed the further words of our  Founders, ``e pluribus unum,'' ``out of many, one.'' They didn't know  how many it would be or how different we would be, but they knew that  we needed to always be unifying.   Hopefully, as we go forward with this with a clarity of purpose, a  clarity of procedure, a clarity of fact, and a clarity of truth--it is  about the truth; it is about the Constitution--we will do so in a way  that brings people together that is healing rather than dividing, and  that is how we will honor our oath of office.   Madam Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote.
