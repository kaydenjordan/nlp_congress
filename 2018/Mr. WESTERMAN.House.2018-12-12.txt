 Mr. Speaker, I was blessed to be a walk-on football  player for the University of Arkansas and participate on two 10-win  conference championship teams.   Coach Ken Hatfield's triple option offense averaged over 300 yards  per game, but it came in small chunks that resulted in first downs,  that resulted in touchdowns, and eventually led to victories.   Mr. Speaker, farm incomes are down across the board. The West is  consumed by wildfires. China and other nations are taking advantage of  unfair trade laws.   What rural America needs is a first down. Our farmers and ranchers  need to see Congress move the ball forward and provide their families  the protection and relief they need during these hard times.   This conference report is not a Hail Mary. It does not contain  everything that I would like to see in a farm bill, but it does move  the ball forward. It is progress that our farmers need right now.   I am disappointed that Senate Democrats blocked many needed forest  management provisions as we continue to sift through the ashes of  catastrophic wildfires.   However, this conference report strengthens the farm safety net and  provides certainty to our farmers. It does address some forest  management issues. It provides millions of dollars in new funding to  combat a range of issues facing rural America, from funding to  eradicate feral hogs, to address the opioid crisis, and to expand rural  broadband.   This conference report moves farm policy in the right direction. I  urge the adoption of the rule for this farm bill.
