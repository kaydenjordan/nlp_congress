 Madam Speaker, the world knows no one takes better care of  their friends than Texans. The whole world knows my hometown of Sugar  Land is the best of the best. The world saw this in global stories  about Hurricane Harvey, but the world misses so many stories.   There was a Fort Bend Star article about an eight-alarm fire that  destroyed eight apartments weeks before Christmas. The world needs to  know about Nazila, Isabella, Blanca, Ann, and Troy. That fire burned  all they owned, except two cellos Ann uses to teach kids music at  Austin High School. As the world can see, Ann and her loved ones have a  fully furnished apartment, courtesy of BEL Furniture in Sugar Land,  Texas.   Sugar Land is the best of the best--the best in America, the best in  the world.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
