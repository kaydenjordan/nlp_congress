 Mr. President, I am introducing bipartisan  legislation with Senator Collins today to improve safety standards on  products that affect every single American household. Most people  assume that the personal care products they use every day, whether it  is shampoo or shaving cream, lotion or make-up, hair dye or deodorant,  have up-to-date Federal oversight.   In reality, however, the Food and Drug Administration's authority to  do so is sorely outdated. In fact, even though research continues to  better inform us on the safety of ingredients used in products that we  absorb through our bodies, skin and even our nails, regulation of these  ingredients have not kept up and little has changed over the past eight  decades on how we conduct oversight of these products. It is time to  modernize our safety oversight and correct this problem.   Over the last several years, Senator Collins and I have worked with a  wide group of stakeholders that represent both industry and consumer  groups. Together, we have drafted the Personal Care Products Safety Act  with the support of many companies, health experts, and consumer  organizations to put commonsense measures in place.   One of the most critical components of this legislation is a process  for the FDA to review the safety of ingredients in personal care  products. The FDA may limit the quantity of an ingredient, require  specific screening protocol to ensure dangerous contaminants aren't  present, or require warning labels when needed to alert consumers. If  an ingredient is simply unsafe for use under any conditions, the FDA  can require that it be banned from use in all personal care products.   Just this week, the FDA announced finding asbestos in several  different types of make-up marketed to children and teens at the  popular store, Claire's. This is a serious concern that highlights the  need for Congress to move quickly to give FDA the tools they need.   Under our bill, the FDA could implement new screening protocols for  contaminants like asbestos. Companies would be required to register, so  it would be easier to know where products were coming from. FDA would  have mandatory recall authority for personal care products like they do  for food, and companies would finally be required to report adverse  health events.   The Personal Care Products Safety Act is the result of many diverse  groups working together with the common goal of modernizing the Federal  oversight system to ensure the safest products possible are on the  market. These stakeholders include small and large companies, doctors,  consumer advocates, patient advocates, scientists, and the Food and  Drug Administration.   This legislation recognizes the needs of businesses of all sizes to  support their growth while not sacrificing high safety standards that  will keep consumers safe and raise the bar for industry standards. Many  companies are taking voluntary steps to do the right thing, but it is  time for this to be a uniform requirement.   Another shocking example of concern is the ongoing use of  formaldehyde, also called methylene glycol when in liquid form. It is  used in the popular hair straightening treatment called a Brazilian  blowout. During this beauty treatment, formaldehyde is released into  the air and can cause shortness of breath, headaches, and dizziness in  the short-term. Exposure to formaldehyde long-term has even been linked  to cancer.   I am also greatly concerned about safety of salon professionals, who  are exposed daily to a variety of chemicals. In addition to reviewing  the safety of chemicals they may be exposed to, this legislation  ensures that the salon products they use are properly labeled with  ingredients and warnings.   This bill will require the Food and Drug Administration to evaluate  at least five ingredients per year for safety and use in personal care  products. In addition to reviewing the latest scientific and medical  studies, the agency will consider how prevalent the ingredient is, the  likelihood to exposure, adverse event reports, and information from  public comments.   Public input will be critical to the review process. There will be  opportunities for companies, scientists, consumer groups, medical  professionals, and members of the public to weigh in on not only the  safety of particular ingredients but also which ingredients should be a  priority for review.   After review, the Food and Drug Administration may deem an ingredient  safe, unsafe, or safe under certain uses or under certain conditions.  The agency will also have the authority to require warning labels as  needed for certain ingredients and limit the amount of an ingredient  that may be used in personal care products. For example, some  ingredients may only be safe for use by adults or when used by  professionals in a salon or spa setting.   The Personal Care Products Safety Act will also require companies to  provide the Food and Drug Administration with a list of their products'  ingredients and attest to their safety.   The bill recognizes the unique nature of the American handmade  cosmetic industry and meets their needs to encourage growth and  innovation. This legislation provides flexibility for small businesses,  particularly those making low-risk products. And this bill would not  increase taxpayer obligations because it is paid for by user fees from  the cosmetic industry.   I am pleased to have the support of a broad coalition, including  Environmental Working Group, Endocrine Society, National Alliance for  Hispanic Health, National Women's Health Network, American Autoimmune  Related Diseases Association, March of Dimes, Handmade Cosmetic  Alliance, and the following companies that together represent over 90  brands of products: The Estee Lauder Companies, Procter and Gamble,  Revlon, Unilever, L'Oreal, Johnson and Johnson, Beautycounter, Makes 3  Organics, SkinOwl, Silk Therapeutics, and S.W. Basics.   I want to thank Senator Collins for her support and hard work on this  important legislation. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting  this much needed legislation to modernize our outdated regulatory  system for personal care products, and I hope the Senate will pass this  long overdue legislation this year.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Reed, Mr. Van          Hollen, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Markey, Mr. Schatz, Ms. Smith, Mr.          Blumenthal, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Booker, Ms. Stabenow, Ms.          Klobuchar, Ms.  [[Page S1743]]          Hassan, Mr. Merkley, and Mrs. Feinstein):   S. 729.
