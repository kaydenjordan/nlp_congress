 Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act has improved the  health care and financial security of every American, regardless of  where he or she gets health insurance.   Healthcare costs have been growing at the slowest rate in more than  50 years. Seniors in the so-called Medicare doughnut hole have saved  more than $23 billion on their prescription drugs. Every American woman  can rest easier knowing that women are no longer charged more than men  for the same coverage. And 137 million Americans with private insurance  now receive free preventive services.   Despite this remarkable progress, the majority has made it their  mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act, no matter the cost, and  those costs would extend far beyond the healthcare system.   A recent report found that repeal would cause just New York to lose  more than 130,000 jobs in 2019 alone.   The Affordable Care Act has reduced the burden of healthcare costs  for hardworking families not only in New York, but across the Nation;  and it is those Americans for whom repeal would be so devastating.   We are making a mistake if we repeal ObamaCare.                            ____________________
