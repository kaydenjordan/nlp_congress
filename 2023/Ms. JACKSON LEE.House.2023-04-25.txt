 Mr. Speaker, he sold millions of records. He was  known around the world: Harry Belafonte. That song we remember, ``Day- O.'' But for those of us who admired and hung onto his every word, we  know that he provided a transformational change in the civil rights  history of this Nation.   Heroic and courageous, he was not afraid of those who attacked him  and called him names. What a major force standing by Dr. Martin Luther  King, intervening with politicians and entertainers and providing  financial support. He continued questioning this Nation's issues of  race. He was fearless.   Mr. Speaker, I am sad about his passing, but I will say that no one  will fill his giant shoes. To his wife Pamela, Gina, and other  wonderful relatives, I offer my personal regrets and sympathy. As a  Jamaican immigrant that he was, he obviously touches my heart and that  of my family.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that we will always remember a man that could  have been only an entertainer, as well as rich and resounding, but  Harry Belafonte wanted to change this country.   Harry, as I see you soar where the eagles fly, may the Lord bless  you. Rest in peace, my brother, and rest in power.                            ____________________
