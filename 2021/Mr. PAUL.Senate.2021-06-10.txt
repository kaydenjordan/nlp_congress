 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I will  recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the  American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to  recognize Bluegrass Family Wellness, PLLC, of Crestwood, KY, as the  Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 2014, Dr. Molly Rutherford and her husband Chris Rutherford  founded Bluegrass Family Wellness, PLLC, in Crestwood, KY. A graduate  of Virginia Tech, Dr. Rutherford earned an MPH in epidemiology from  Johns Hopkins University and an M.D. from Eastern Virginia Medical  School, specializing in family medicine. After 8 years of working in  the healthcare sector, Dr. Rutherford and her husband established  Bluegrass Family Wellness. Through a direct primary care model,  Bluegrass Family Wellness provides individualized, affordable, and  accessible medical care for Oldham County and the surrounding area.   As a medical practitioner, Dr. Rutherford has been at the forefront  of battling the opioid crisis in Kentucky. She pursued a specialty in  addiction medicine, ensuring that Bluegrass Family Wellness treated  addiction with an evidence-based approach balancing medication and  counseling. From 2018 to 2019, Dr. Rutherford served on the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services Pain Management Best Practices  Intra-Agency Task Force, which produced a report highlighting the  connection between pain management and the opioid crisis. Dr.  Rutherford served as president of the Kentucky Society of Addiction  Medicine. She is a board member of the Unbridled Project, a nonprofit  advocating for evidence-based solutions to the opioid crisis.   Together with her husband Chris, Dr. Rutherford consistently gives  back to her community. Locally, Bluegrass Family Wellness has sponsored  several Little League teams, the Oldham County Youth Football League,  and East Oldham Middle School. They support several charitable  organizations, including a scholarship for a City Schoolhouse, a  private school in Louisville, KY. Dr. Rutherford and her family are  active within their local church community, as well. Notably, Dr.  Rutherford is a member of the Coalition for a Healthy Oldham County,  the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Society for  Addiction Medicine, the Kentucky Academy of Family Physicians, and the  Indiana State Medical Association.   Like many local physicians, Dr. Rutherford and her team stepped up to  keep their community safe and healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. As  the pandemic unfolded, Dr. Rutherford continued seeing patients in  person and by telemedicine. She treated COVID-19 patients at her  practice and published a peer-reviewed article alongside several  physicians regarding early outpatient treatment for COVID-19. Dr.  Rutherford consistently spoke out about the negative effects of  lockdowns, highlighting impact on individuals battling addiction. Dr.  Rutherford published op-eds on the harm school lockdowns caused  children, successfully advocating for reopening Jefferson County Public  Schools.   Bluegrass Family Wellness, PLLC, is a remarkable example of the  critical role that small, family-oriented medical practices play in  their communities. Local medical practices like Bluegrass Family  Wellness form the heart of towns across Kentucky, regularly stepping up  to support their communities in times of crisis. Congratulations to Dr.  Rutherford, Chris, and the entire team at Bluegrass Family Wellness. I  wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching their continued  growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
