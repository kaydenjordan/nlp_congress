 Mr. Speaker, just think what the media would be  saying about President Trump if he were a Democrat:         He has tremendous energy. He campaigned for 18 months, puts       in 15-hour days, and has the stamina of a bull elephant like       Teddy Roosevelt.        He is courageous, even fearless. Given the amount of hate       directed his way, no doubt he constantly receives death       threats. But that doesn't curtail his public appearances or       seem to worry him in the least.        He has conviction. He practices what he preaches. He       doesn't waffle or waver. And he is obviously not deterred by       media criticism.        He is a great father. Anytime his son or daughter calls, he       picks up the phone. He includes them in his activities.       Clearly, he has a strong relationship with his children.        He is off to a fast start. His Cabinet consists of smart,       experienced, and successful individuals. He already has taken       steps to keep jobs in America, put unnecessary regulations on       hold, and improve health care. Consumer confidence is at a       16-year high.    No, the national liberal media won't print that or air it or post it.  Better to get your news directly from the President. In fact, it might  be the only way to get the unvarnished truth.                            ____________________
