 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking  member for yielding.   In my 1 minute, let me tell you about Hornwood, Inc.--talk about a  survivor. Hornwood is a specialty textile manufacturer in operation 74  years. It manufacturers products for the U.S. military, many specialty  applications, and now components for PPE.   Hornwood's main facility is in Anson County, among the most  economically challenged counties in North Carolina. Hornwood employs  almost 400, the largest employer in that county.   Although it is designated essential, its revenues plummeted as  government shut down the economy. Without a PPP loan, despite being  essential, Hornwood must shut down imminently. It applied for PPP on  the second day, but its application was caught in a snafu and the funds  ran out.   The 2 weeks consumed by the majority's exercise of leverage may well  prove the fatal difference for Hornwood and thousands of other small  businesses, but I am glad we are here finally to finish the job.   To Hornwood and all of the others: Keep surviving.
