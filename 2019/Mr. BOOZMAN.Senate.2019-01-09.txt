 Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the  remarkable career and service of a man who has played an instrumental  role in the growth and development of northwest Arkansas over the last  four decades.   Dick Trammel, a pillar of the community and a leader who has been  involved in almost everything positive that has happened in and around  my hometown of Rogers, AR, has concluded his service at Arvest Bank  after 43 years. He is also ending a 10-year term on the Arkansas  Highway Commission this month.   Dick is a homegrown Arkansan. A native of Pocahontas, he attended the  University of Arkansas where he was a cheerleader for the Hogs football  team and earned a bachelor of science degree in business administration  in 1960. After graduation, Dick returned home to work in the cotton gin  and grain elevator business and became an active member and leader in  Pocahontas and Randolph County.   As we all now know, the 1960s saw the founding of retail giant  Walmart by Sam Walton. As Walmart was headquartered in Bentonville, Sam  was able to entice Dick to relocate to the region and join First  National Bank & Trust Company in Rogers in 1975. First National Bank  eventually became part of Arvest Bank and Dick worked for the company  for over four decades, retiring as executive vice president, member of  the board of directors and board secretary of Arvest Bank, Rogers.   While enjoying a successful career at Arvest, Dick also played an  outsized role in northwest Arkansas. He served as president and board  member of the Rogers-Lowell Area Chamber of Commerce, was a board  member at a local United Way, founded the Single Parent Scholarship  Fund in Benton County, was a charter member of the Northwest Arkansas  Community College Board of Trustees, and served on the Rogers Youth  Center Board of Directors, among so many other philanthropic and civic  endeavors.   He is also a board member of the U.S. Marshals Museum Foundation  which is incredibly meaningful given the importance of the Marshals  Service to the region and the work we have done to help make the U.S.  Marshals Museum in Fort Smith a reality. We worked together not only in  that capacity, but in many other ways to help the region grow as Dick  has spent the last 10 years on our State's highway commission following  his appointment to the panel by former Governor Mike Beebe in 2009.   Just recently it was announced that, through many years of persistent  work between members of Congress from Arkansas and Missouri and the  respective legislatures and State government agencies in both States,  that a multimillion-dollar grant has been secured to complete the Bella  Vista Bypass on Interstate 49. Dick and his colleagues on the highway  commission understood just how important this was for the region and  worked hand-in-hand with the congressional delegation to reach this  outcome.   As Dick's service at Arvest and on the Arkansas Highway Commission  comes to a close, it is only fitting to recognize his enormous impact  on a region in Arkansas that has experienced so much growth and  transformation throughout his career. Throughout all this change, Dick  Trammel has remained a constant source of stability, leadership, and  willingness to do whatever it takes to improve the quality of life for  everyone in the community.   When my brother and I moved to Rogers to establish a medical practice  in 1977, Dick was one of the first people we met. During that time and  over the decades that have followed, he has been a steadfast friend and  mentor. I greatly admire and appreciate his many contributions to a  place we both love and have served in different capacities over the  years.   I wish Dick and his wife Nancy well as he begins a well-deserved  retirement. He has always been dedicated to helping people, and his  lengthy career has demonstrated that commitment many times over. I am  grateful to Dick and his entire family for the way they  [[Page S100]]  have served and led. Because of his efforts, northwest Arkansas is in a  much better place today than we he first called it home.                            ____________________
