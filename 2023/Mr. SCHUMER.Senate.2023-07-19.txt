 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 119, S. 2226,  be considered expired, and the motion to proceed be agreed to.    Madam President, I call up substitute amendment No. 935.    I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the  amendment be dispensed with, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    I call up amendment No. 936 and ask that it be reported  by number.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to  call  [[Page S3130]]  up the following amendments: Murray, No. 300; Kaine, No. 429; Paul, No.  222; Hawley-Vance, No. 838; Cruz-Manchin, No. 926; further, that with  respect to the amendments listed above, at 3 p.m., the Senate vote on  the amendments in the order listed, with no further amendments or  motions in order, and with 60 affirmative votes required for adoption  and that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote.    Madam President, later this morning, it will be my honor  to join congressional leaders in welcoming President Isaac Herzog of  Israel to the Capitol for a joint address to Congress.   Since the founding of the Nation of Israel 75 years ago, he has been  one of America's most important allies and fiercest friends. The United  States was the first country to recognize Israel as an independent  state; and to this day, our bond remains strong, our partnership  essential.   While we have our differences, the United States and Israel are  united in the most profound ways that two nations could be. America's  support for Israel must never waver because Israel will be an essential  partner for the United States in the 21st century.   I look forward to meeting with President Herzog this morning, and I  join congressional leaders in welcoming him to Congress.                                   S. 2226    Madam President, now on the NDAA, last night, the Senate began the  process for floor consideration of the annual Defense bill on a  bipartisan vote, 72 to 25. This morning, we locked in an agreement to  begin consideration of amendments on the floor. We will begin voting  this afternoon, and we want this process to be open and fair, without  being dilatory.   We want both sides to have input, but neither side should derail the  bill. We should avoid the chaos we saw last week in the House that  greatly hindered their NDAA process.   So far, we have avoided that. The process in the Senate has been  constructive and moved along at a good pace. I am pleased to say the  managers' package has 51 amendments--21 from Republicans, 21 from  Democrats, and 9 bipartisan. I hope there will be a second managers'  package with even more priorities for both sides.    The Senate's NDAA process is an example of how, even with all our  disagreements, this Chamber is able to come together to provide for our  Nation's defense, take care of our servicemembers, take care of our  civilian DOD workforce, and invest in modernizing our defense and  intelligence capabilities. If both sides keep working together, I hope  we can finish passing the Defense authorization bill before August. I  think most of us would like to see that happen. There is no  justification for letting it spill into the fall. We have a lot of work  to do before we get there, but we are on track to get it done.   We have every reason in the world to finish the NDAA bill quickly  because there is a lot both sides can celebrate in this year's bill.  Many of the NDAA's provisions might typically fly under the radar  because they seem incremental, but in their totality, they make a huge  difference in our country.   We will make much needed progress on additional new areas, like  outcompeting the Chinese Government. We will take our first steps on AI  legislation. We will boost resources in a major way to tackle the  fentanyl crisis. We will strengthen the bonds with our allies around  the world, especially the UK and Australia.   I hope we will have a vote on the full AUKUS package soon.   On competing with the Chinese Government, I am pleased this year's  NDAA will have over a dozen amendments in the managers' package.   On the fentanyl crisis, the amendment by Tim Scott and Sherrod Brown  will enhance the Federal Government's ability to disrupt illicit opioid  supply chains and punish those who facilitate fentanyl tracking. This  is a major piece of legislation that is going to give the President  more powers to stop any country--China, Mexico--from sending the  precursor materials that are made into fentanyl and kill our children.   Here is what it does: It declares international trafficking of  fentanyl a national emergency--a national emergency. It requires the  President to sanction criminal organizations and cartel members who  traffic this drug. It will enhance the administration's ability to  enforce sanctions violations. It will allow the Treasury to take  special measures to combat money laundering connected to fentanyl, and  much, much more.   Approving our FEND Off Fentanyl Act will be a huge win in the battle  against opioids--one of the worst public health crises in the country.  I thank Chairman Brown and Ranking Member Scott for championing this  measure.   Finally, this year's NDAA will take important steps on artificial  intelligence. My amendment, which I worked on with Senators Rounds,  Young, and Heinrich, will increase data sharing within DOD, increase  reporting on AI's use in the financial services industry, create a  ``bug bounty program'' where ethical hackers help us find  vulnerabilities in our defenses, and much, much more.   The Senate process on the NDAA stands in sharp contrast with what we  saw in the House. In the Senate, Democrats and Republicans worked  together, mindful of the importance to preserve our national security,  while the process in the House, unfortunately, was sadly delayed and at  times derailed by wildly partisan and irrelevant hard-right amendments  that have nothing to do with defense. We have not seen that so far in  the Senate. We should keep it that way.   For all these great reasons for getting the NDAA done, we hope we can  get it done as soon as possible. We will begin voting today on  amendments, and I hope we can keep this process moving along.                     Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 2226     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to ask for the yeas and nays on the substitute amendment No. 935.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess subject to the call of the Chair.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 10:04 a.m., recessed subject  to the call of the Chair and reassembled at 12 noon when called to  order by the Presiding Officer (Mr. Hickenlooper).                            ____________________     Madam President, just for the information of Members, we  are speeding up the vote process. There is the White House picnic  tonight, and we have to get things done by then. So there are going to  be 10-minute votes, and we are going to call questions quite strictly.  Thank you.    Mr. President, again, I remind Members that we now  closed the vote before everybody came, and we are going to keep doing  that. So please stay here, and let's try to get as much done as we can  this afternoon.   Thank you.    Mr. President, we made some good progress this  afternoon. We are going to have our fourth vote now. It will be the  last vote today. The Cruz-Manchin amendment, No. 926, will be the first  vote tomorrow morning. We are going to continue to work on setting up  additional rollcall votes on amendments for tomorrow. Members should be  aware that we will probably have a nice chunk of votes tomorrow if we  can work everything out. We want to move as quickly as we can.
