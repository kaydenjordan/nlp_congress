 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise today urging adoption of my amendment, which  makes clear that nothing in the underlying bill contradicts existing  Federal law regarding acts of international terrorism, providing  support to terrorists, or aiding terrorists.   The underlying bill helps keep our country safe by ensuring the  intelligence community has the resources and authorities it needs to do  its job. It also makes sure the intelligence community can improve and  adapt to today's rapidly changing threats and technologies by improving  the collection and analytic capabilities against our adversaries like  China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.   My amendment makes it crystal clear that our country will remain  tough on international terrorism.   Terrorism continues to be a serious threat to our national security.  This provision strengthens the underlying  [[Page H5903]]  bill by ensuring current law regarding terrorism is not changed, so  terrorists and those who support them can be brought to justice.   Madam Chair, again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I  urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time                                time  2100
