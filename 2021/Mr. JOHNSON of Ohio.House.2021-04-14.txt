 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the U.S.  Anti-Doping Agency Reauthorization Act.   I thank my colleague, Representative Thompson, for his hard work to  get this important legislation across the finish line; and I thank  Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers for yielding time.   The United States Anti-Doping Agency, or USADA, has worked hard to  ensure that our athletic programs are the best in the world, and also  the cleanest. Critical to maintaining that success is ensuring our  athletes are competing fairly, without the use of performance-enhancing  drugs, which is why I have introduced the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency  Reauthorization Act.   USADA must have the resources it needs to ensure the integrity of its  programs and advance the American values of sportsmanship and playing  by the rules on the global stage.   In addition to funding the agency, this legislation adds a special  focus on clean sport training for young athletes and their coaches, and  enables USADA to better coordinate with Federal law enforcement.   With the Olympics and other international sporting events just around  the corner, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.
