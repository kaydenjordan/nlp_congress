 Mr. Speaker, I rise as chair of the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus in opposition to H.R. 3941, which is what I call the  anti-student, anti-family, anti-immigrant act. This bill is another  attempt by Republicans to dehumanize migrants under the excuse of  student safety. Give me a break.   First, this bill does nothing to protect our students. In fact, it  does the opposite. It cuts funding for schools that dare to provide  shelter for those who escape oppression and seek protection in our  country, even if the school is empty or closed down with no students.   Republicans claim they are the party that protects children, but they  are the same party that is directing Texas State troopers to push  migrant children back into the Rio Grande River to drown. They should  be ashamed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this anti-student and  anti-immigrant proposal.
