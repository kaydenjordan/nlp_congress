 Mr. Speaker, this month, I was grateful  to participate in a Congressional delegation of the OSCE Parliamentary  Assembly led by Senator Roger Wicker and Senator Ben Cardin. It was  inspiring to see the extraordinary economic advances of Estonia and  Bulgaria.   In Tallinn, Estonia, we were welcomed by the dynamic Prime Minister,  Kaja Kallas, and the dedicated Foreign Minister, Eva-Maria Liimets.  While in Tallinn, we learned that Russian diplomats had been expelled  in April across the Baltics to join the protest of the Czech Prime  Minister, Andrej Babis, exposing the irrefutable evidence that two  Russian GRU agents were behind the 2014 ammunition depot explosion at  Vrbetice, which killed two persons.   The same two Russian agents named by the Czech Republic are suspected  by British authorities for poisoning former Russian double agent Sergei  Skripal and his daughter in England in 2018. The Czech Republic has  correctly demanded Russia pay for damages.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chalmers and Lori Anne Carr of Titan Farms for  their annual delivery of South Carolina peaches to Capitol Hill.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
