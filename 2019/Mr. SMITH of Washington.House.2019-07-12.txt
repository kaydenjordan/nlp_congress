 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2500.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  offering this amendment.   I do agree with the opponent on this issue, that we have tried to  hold Saudi Arabia accountable. As the gentleman mentioned, we have  countlessly showed them how to better target.   We have tried various things legislatively. We have introduced  legislation. We have done a bunch of different things to try to say we  don't like what Saudi Arabia is doing.   But we have never actually done any of it, because the Trump  administration has decided--and, as the gentleman points out, it wasn't  just the Trump administration--that we are basically all in on Saudi  Arabia. We are simply going to support them no matter what.   The murder of Jamal Khashoggi was appalling, and the fact that Saudi  Arabia felt that they could do it and get away with it is the most  alarming thing. Well, it is not the most alarming thing. The thing that  is more alarming is they were right.   They figured that this administration would do nothing, just like as  they bombed the schoolbus, as they bombed the funeral, as they bombed  all of those civilian targets. As many times as we told them that we  didn't want them to do that, they knew there would be no consequences,  that, at the end of the day, the U.S. was not going to hold them  accountable for that.   And the consequences are grave. As the gentleman points out, it  actually empowers Iran because it sends a message to the world that we  are willing to bomb and kill civilians and participate, however good  intentioned, in what has become the largest humanitarian crisis in the  world.   And it drives people into terrorists' arms because, yes, Iran is a  problem, but ISIS and al-Qaida, I would submit to you, are a larger  problem.   And they use this. They use our blind support for Saudi Arabia and  for this war in Yemen against us.   Madam Chair, this is a good amendment, and I urge its adoption.    Madam Chair, meanwhile, back to a world that  actually exists.   Talking about Ms. Jayapal's amendment, I think it is incredibly  important because there is a problem going forward from the military  that we have seen on many issues. You take it piece by piece--you look  at the nuclear enterprise; you look at the Air Force; you look at how  many ships we want; you look at counterterrorism--and you add up all  the money over the course of the next 20 to 25 years, and we don't get  there.   And this is the worst thing that we can do to our troops is to set up  a group of missions that we don't have the funds to prepare them for.  That is the largest problem that I see. We here in Congress decide that  they ought to be able to do more than they can do, and we don't have  the money to provide for it.   That is why it is so important that we don't do what the minority  leader just suggested we do, which is basically shut down as a body and  say whatever the Pentagon wants, we just give it to them and hope that  they figure it out.   We have a role to play in that process, to make sure that the money  is spent well because--I know this is news to the other side--the  Pentagon hasn't always been right. They haven't always spent their  money well. And that is the understatement of the morning.   So we need to know: Where are they spending the money? How can we  better understand that?   Where the nuclear enterprise is concerned, we are set to spend a lot  of money. I know it is only 6 percent of the defense budget, but 6  percent of the defense budget is a lot of money. We need to better  understand it.   I urge support for the amendment.    Madam Chair, pursuant to House Resolution  476, I offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham).    Madam Chair, it is just me. I am going to  close, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   First of all, I want to echo the comments of the ranking member and  thank our staffs for the work on this.   I don't have the statistics in front of me, but there are literally  thousands of proposals for this bill that are presented at the  beginning of the committee process, working through to the full floor.   Both staffs, Republican and Democratic--I think we are the only  committee in Congress, or in the House, at any rate, that actually  shares staff. We share the budget. We don't just divide it up.   So, when I say thank you, I am thanking the Republican and Democratic  members of staff. They do an enormous amount of incredible work to  produce this product.   I believe, as I will mention later, that we upheld the bipartisan  tradition of this bill, worked with Republicans and Democrats, and  produced a very good product. But we must acknowledge the incredible  hard work that is done by the people sitting behind me, a lot of people  over in the building and a lot of people over there. I appreciate that.   I also appreciate the working relationship that I have with the  ranking member. When I was the ranking member and he was the chair, we  worked together on a lot of issues. We have continued to do so. I  appreciate that leadership, and I appreciate his commitment to the  defense bill.                                time  1030    I think this is a good bill. I just want to mention a few things in  it that are positive.   First of all, at $733 billion--and, again, more on that later--this  is the largest defense bill in the history of the country. But within  this bill, we also focus on cutting waste and dramatically increasing  accountability. I think the taxpayers, and, yes, the troops, want to  make sure that the Pentagon doesn't just spend money, but that they  spend it well.   We finally live up to the rhetoric and we give the widows the money  that they have been asking for. Just about every single Republican  Member of Congress is a cosponsor of this bill--  Joe Wilson is the  prime sponsor--that fully funds widows' benefits. After cosponsoring it  for 9 years, the Republicans were in charge and doing nothing about it,  we actually put it in the bill and we are going to pass it. And yet, to  hear them say that it is somehow a bad thing to basically do what they  have been emptily promising for 8 years, I think, is a very big  positive on the bill.   We have a tenant's bill of rights to protect families and the housing  that we have heard so many complaints about. We step up to try to  protect those families.   We have paid family and medical leave for all Federal employees,  including all DOD employees.   We have provisions to protect our military and our communities from  the dangerous chemicals in PFAS that we have learned so much about.   We make sure that troops get the pay raise that they deserve: a 3.1  percent pay raise.   And, yes, we also have provisions to try to make sure that the  children who are being held by DOD within the migrant community are  adequately protected.   I think that is all important. And yet, for all of that, the  Republicans oppose the bill, and it raises the question: Why?   Earlier on, the chairman quoted me from a few years ago when we  opposed the bill. As I said, opposing the bill doesn't mean you are  against our troops, and I stand by that. Now, it is interesting to note  that a large number of Members on that side at the time said that much  and much more: that to oppose this bill means you are against national  security and against those troops.   To his credit, the then-chairman, Mr. Thornberry, didn't say that.  What he said was: Look, on the defense bill, you can always have a  bunch of excuses for why you don't support it. But, at the end of the  day, if you don't support it, you are not supporting funding our  military and you are not supporting giving our troops what they need.   That is now what, en masse, the Republicans are going to do.   So the question is: Why? What is their list of excuses?   It starts with that top line. And this was their most brilliant  political move.   It has been quoted that Chairman Dunford said that we needed to have  inflation, plus 3 to 5 percent. That was in a newspaper article. I  thought about that. That is not actually what they said. Secretary  Mattis was very clear. Once we got the deal last year to get to $716  billion, he said we need inflation. That is what I remember. But how do  we know that is true?   Chairman Dunford and Secretary Mattis, a year ago, proposed $733  billion. So if they believed we needed inflation, plus 3 to 5 percent,  are they just bad at math? Did they not have a calculator available to  figure out that $733 billion isn't that? No. It is what they said they  needed.   I think we now know why the Republicans at the last minute said: No,  we have to have $750 billion: so they can come up here and claim that  we cut stuff. That is just ridiculous.   There are two great examples.   The distinguished minority leader--it is possible that he is just  this stupid, but I don't think it is true--said that we cut hypersonic  weapons. How much did we cut them by? We increased them by $300 million  over last year.   But, yes, we reduced them. It wasn't actually a hypersonic weapon,  but we made a reduction in the $750 billion request. So you create the  $750 billion request and then you say you are cutting. We are not  cutting, we are increasing. Which is why I say, if we had come in at  $750 billion, they would have said $800 billion and then stood up there  and accused us of everything else that we cut.   And the personnel account is another great example: a $1.2 billion  cut. Last year, in their budget, they cut the personnel account by $1.7  billion because the Pentagon frequently asks for personnel funds that  are not justified. That is our job.   So only in the minds of a Republican can a $733 billion defense  budget, that is an increase over last year, be a cut. There are not  cuts to this budget in that way. We fully fund the military.   And then we hear their argument about one nuclear weapon that we are  not going to field. You heard what they said: it is unilateral nuclear  disarmament.   To cut one weapon when we have thousands of nuclear weapons?   There was no way the Republican Party was ever going to vote for a  bill put together by Democrats. And these people behind me, they worked  their butts off to make this bipartisan. What the minority leader said  is the biggest insult I have ever heard to the members of the staff in  23 years on this committee. To dismiss them as partisan, not interested  in national security is an incredible insult to the hard work that they  do, and nobody in this House, Republican or Democrat, should let a  statement like that stand.   We have put together a good bill. The reason Republicans oppose it is  for purely partisan reasons. And, that is, they want to be able to give  speeches, like the one of the minority leader who said Democrats don't  care about national security. We care about national security. In fact,  I will tell you, our bill isn't just good, it is better than the ones  that the Republican Party have put together.    We believe the Pentagon should be accountable. They said $733  billion. As recently as December of this year, the ranking member put  an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal saying we had to  [[Page H5743]]  have $733 billion. And now, all of a sudden, $733 billion isn't just  not the right number, ``it is socialism,'' ``it is destroying the world  as we know it,'' ``we can't support it.'' That is ridiculous. It is a  partisan argument. It is what the minority does. But it has never been  what we have done on this bill.   I believe in the bipartisanship of this committee. And as angry as I  was, sitting there listening to the minority leader insult all of the  people who have worked to make this bill bipartisan--and you can oppose  it, that is fine--but to say that we don't care about national  security, that we are a bunch of socialists who don't want to work with  Republicans, is a bald-faced lie.   And the last statistic on that is the amendment thing--and I love  this--we made more amendments in order on this defense bill this year  than ever. The Republicans actually submitted a lot fewer amendments  than we did. We submitted 480, they submitted 201. And then we actually  agreed with the overwhelming majority of their amendments and put them  in en bloc packages. They didn't agree with the overwhelming majority  of our amendments, so we didn't put them in en bloc packages, which  gives them the statistic that only one of their amendments was debated.   So by working with them and agreeing with them to include 50 percent  of their amendments--the most amendments ever offered--that is  partisan. And I can't help but feel like they were setting us up. They  didn't want to work with us. No matter how hard we tried, no matter how  many hours we spent working with them, they wanted to come to the floor  today and say that Democrats don't care about national security.   That is shameful. I am going to get over it. We are going to work  past it--I think national security is too important to get petty about  these things--and we are going to keep working together.   The good news is that we have a very good bill. It is accountable. It  doesn't just give the Pentagon money. Yes, we eliminate senseless  discrimination by stopping the ban on transgender troops.   I will say the other side is wrong. They have voted against the  defense bill before. They voted against it in 2010 because we repealed  Don't Ask, Don't Tell. They were wrong then and they are wrong now.  Discrimination in the military doesn't make us safer. Mindless bigotry  doesn't make us safer.   I believe strongly in this bill. The good news is, we got this, we  are going to pass it, even if the other side is going to decide to play  partisan politics.   Madam Chair, I urge support for the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do  now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  McCollum) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Demings, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2500) to  authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2020 for military activities  of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to  prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for  other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  motion to recommit.    We have worked in a bipartisan fashion, and  the worst part about it is they all know that because we spent 6  months--my staff and your staff--working together to produce this bill.   The only petty partisanship on this bill is coming purely from the  Republican Party that will put their partisan desires against voting  for it.   Why?   Because Democrats are in charge. As we have seen time and again on  this floor, no matter how much we work with them and how much we  cooperate with them, at the end of the day, partisanship trumps all.  They will not vote for anything Democrats do, including, by the way, in  this bill we have the largest pay raise for our troops in 10 years, and  Republicans are going to vote against that pay raise.   We have in this bill money for widows. The Republicans have  cosponsored this bill for 10 years, telling us how much they care about  making sure that the widows of our troops get money, and now that we do  it, after 10 years we put it in the bill, they are going to vote  against it just so they can say that Democrats don't support national  security.   There is $733 billion in this bill, the largest Defense bill in the  history of the country, and it is not enough. The response is that it  can always be more. No matter what it is, they are going to say do  more. The Pentagon is apparently the only place in the country where  Republicans feel that you can throw money at the problem relentlessly.   This body has raised pay for our troops every single year, and,  again, I will simply close by saying that we have the largest pay raise  in 10 years in this bill for our troops.   We have worked in a bipartisan manner. It is easy to say: well, I am  going to vote ``no'' and therefore it is partisan.   There is no good reason for it. This should be a bipartisan bill. It  supports our troops, and it supports our national security.   Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from  New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill), who is a Navy veteran who has fought for our  country as well and is a member of the Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  the Clerk be authorized to make technical corrections in the  engrossment of H.R. 2500, including corrections in spelling,  punctuation, section and title numbering, cross-referencing, conforming  amendments to the table of contents and short titles, the insertion of  appropriate headings; and to provide instructions that amendment No.  234 printed in part B of House Report 116-143 be inserted at the end of  subtitle G of title 28, and that the instruction in amendment No. 64  printed in part B of House Report 116-143 be changed from ``page 387,  after line 7'' to ``page 387, after line 15.''
