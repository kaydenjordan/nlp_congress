 Mr. President, I rise to talk about the significance of  today, January 11, the 21st day of the partial government shutdown.   Today, we tie for the longest shutdown in the history of the U.S.  Government. Tomorrow, we will set a record for the longest shutdown.   Today is the first paycheck day where 800,000-plus Federal employees  will not be paid. In fact, some have already started to get their  paychecks because even when there is no pay, the process of producing  the check and the stub continues. So people get paychecks, but there is  a zero on the line, which is sort of like pouring salt in the wound or  adding insult to injury. It is one thing not to be paid, but it is  another thing to be working and then get the stub and have there be a  zero there. People have already reported--some of our air traffic  controllers and TSA professionals and others--that they are starting to  receive those checks.   January 11 is also a time when--I know what it is like in my family.  My wife and I kind of load up on both the charitable contributions and  buying gifts for our family in December, and then that credit card bill  in January is the biggest one we pay all year. Families are receiving  those.   January tends to be among the coldest months of the year, and heating  bills are the highest. We are going to have a cold snap and maybe a  snowstorm in Washington this weekend, and those bills will be high.   January 11 is a time when a lot of families sit around kitchen tables  and write tuition checks for the spring semester for their kids.   It is precisely the worst time to have a shutdown of this kind that  affects more than 800,000 people and jeopardizes their livelihood.   I stand on the floor today to repeat what I said Tuesday night when  many of us stood here and said it is really time to end this shutdown.  The House wants to end it. An increasing number of Senators want to end  it by passing bills that are right here in the Senate, available for  consideration, to reopen the government and to engage with the  President in a meaningful, short-term, and prompt dialogue about border  security and immigration reform.   I wanted to share some of the stories that are flooding into my  office. I will be back on the floor later because at 11 o'clock,  Senator Warner and I will  [[Page S150]]  meet with Federal employees at a community center in Alexandria, and I  will be bringing more stories back to the floor before we adjourn at 1  o'clock today.   Before I share stories, I do want to express appreciation to the  majority leader, to the Republicans, and to the Democrats who joined  together with us yesterday to pass an important bill, S. 24. It is not  as good as getting a paycheck, but it is a bill to tell those who have  lost paychecks or are losing paychecks during this time that when we  reopen, they will be paid.   We have done that in the past. Once we reopened, we figured out a way  to do that. But I felt it was important that on the day people are not  being paid, for them to at least get the signal from Congress, some  certainty, something that they might be able to show to a landlord or  to a bank saying: I am going to get paid.   The Senate majority leader and minority leader worked at the end of  the day to make sure that a UC to pass S. 24 was successful. It was,  and at about 5 o'clock last night, we sent that bill to the House. My  understanding is the House is taking up the bill this morning. I also  applaud Senator McConnell for reaching out to the White House and  speaking directly with the President about the bill. The President  indicated he would sign it when the bill gets to him.   Again, it is not as good as a paycheck, but it adds a little  something on a tough day to tell people that they can rest assured that  when we figure this out, they will be made whole. I do want to express  my appreciation to all for working on that yesterday, but, again, that  is not a cessation of the pain.   I am going to read stories from Federal employees, but I do want to  acknowledge that this is not about just 800,000 employees; it also  affects millions of Americans.   I told a story on the floor Tuesday night about just coincidentally  two Saturdays ago going to four different units of the National Park  System under the Department of the Interior and the National Forest  System under the Department of Agriculture and being turned away by a  gate closed and a sign saying: We are shut down.   That I was turned away was of no moment, but I was interested to  watch other families pull up in their vehicles on a Saturday, spending  time with their kids. Time with the family is precious. You often don't  get a lot of it. Sometimes driving with kids a long way to get to a  national park or something--they are squabbling in the back seat, and  you are really hoping to get there. Watching families pull up and  looking at their faces as they saw that what they hoped to do that day  they couldn't do because it was closed--that made an impression on me.   People were trying to visit the museums here in Washington, and they  couldn't.   Citizens who are falling into hunger, who want to apply for food  stamps--95 percent of the workforce that processes food stamp  applications has been furloughed during this time.   Air traffic controllers are working because they are essential, but  it has to make you a little cranky to get a paycheck with a zero on it.  I can't imagine a Federal employee I would less like to be cranky than  an air traffic controller. I mean, this is very important stuff. You  don't want an air traffic controller sitting in that tower thinking  about anything other than air safety.   If 5 percent of their brain is sort of mad at this shutdown and 20  percent of their brain is focused on ``How am I going to pay the  bills?''--air traffic controllers have shared that they need security  clearances to do their jobs. Do you know that if your credit is  impaired and you start to get hits on your credit report, that could  endanger your security clearance? In some circumstances, it could lead  to your security clearance being taken away. If you are under a court  order to pay alimony or child support, and you can't, regardless of  whether you have a good reason, and there is a court order forcing you  to, that could lead to your losing your security clearance.   You don't want an air traffic controller in the tower worrying about  anything other than the safety of the passengers. If they are mad at  the government for shutting down, and they are anxious about not  getting a paycheck, and they are wondering about how long it will go on  and what the consequences might be, that is not something that makes me  feel comfortable.   This is an issue about Federal workers, certainly, but it is also an  issue about the effect on Americans who need all kinds of services.   Like every office here, my office has been flooded with expressions  of concern. They are saying: Senator, why can't you do something? What  is going on? How long is this going to go on? And I don't have a good  answer for them.   Let me read some stories. I read seven or eight Tuesday night. These  are stories that have come in since Tuesday.   Shane from Alexandria wrote:         I am a veteran and furloughed government employee working       for the Peace Corps. My wife is a disabled veteran, and we       live paycheck to paycheck. I lost my job during the housing       crisis, and we lost our home and then relocated to the DC       area for work. We have worked hard to build our lives back up       and again own a home. Now, that is all in jeopardy again! If       I don't get paid, we can't pay the mortgage, and we will lose       our home. I relocated my family from Florida for a secure job       here and to provide financial stability to my family. Now,       because of a dysfunctional government, I may have to find new       work again, but it may not be in time to save our home.       Please, Please, Please, do what you can to open the       government back up.    Terry from Fairfax wrote:         I am writing you, along with my two other elected       officials, seeking your help in bringing this government       shutdown to an immediate end. Today is day 19--    This was sent to us on Wednesday--       and counting, with no end in sight. The information put out       by the media saying the number of those affected by this       (partial) government shutdown is 800,000; I submit to you it       is much higher than that--especially in the Commonwealth of       Virginia.        Currently, I work for the Department of Homeland Security,       the Transportation Security Administration at Washington       Dulles International Airport. I have the compliance       department at Washington Dulles, enforcing the Code of       Federal Regulations, and have 15 people working for me. We       make sure the nation's transportation system at Washington       Dulles is secure and safe and are exempt from furlough.        Of the 15 people that work for me, most all live paycheck       to paycheck. As you can imagine, with the outlook of no       paycheck coming this Saturday, the morale is starting to go       down and Maslow's hierarchy of needs--    I hope I am saying that right--       is kicking in--that of self-preservation. Their focus is       switching from their work--keeping things secure and safe--to       their family and how they are going to provide for them       (survive).        As for me, I served honorably in the United States Coast       Guard and retired after 26 years. I started working at       Washington Dulles when TSA first stood up and have been here       over 16 years. I am 63 years old. My Coast Guard retired       paycheck is my financial security, something to fall back on,       something I can plan on . . . up until now. I just learned       yesterday there won't be a retired paycheck for Coast Guard       retirees because of the shutdown. The financial security we       worked for is no longer there. This is a breach of trust       between the U.S. Government and every Coast Guard retiree,       and it's wrong!        I have proudly served the American People for more than 42       years, and I have been through every government shutdown       since 1976. This particular one is getting old in a hurry, it       may be the worst, and it needs to stop. For my people at       work, my family at home, and my fellow Coast Guard retirees,       we need your help in ending this shutdown.    Garrett, a Virginian working as a contractor at NASA:         I am a contractor for NASA, I am shut down, and I am not       very happy. This is having a negative financial effect on my       life. I am ok today, but soon in the very next few days when       I have exhausted my vacation, then take leave without pay,       then have to pay for overpriced health insurance; then I will       be in a big pinch. As a contractor we are not guaranteed to       be re-reimbursed for our leave. The last shutdown I lost a       paycheck I never got back, that was like a 2% pay cut. I       won't be able to take sick leave or vacation this year.       SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE, and I am relying on you to make it       happen. We all are. Just think of all the good government       employees that will be forced to leave the government because       it is such a negative place to work.    Just a comment, government employees are being forced to leave the  government.   Today in Fairfax, the Fairfax public school system is having a hiring  fair just for Federal employees. They need substitute teachers, they  need bus drivers, and they need cafeteria workers. So they are doing  the hiring fair to try  [[Page S151]]  to play upon the unhappiness of Federal employees who are out for the  shutdown and don't think they are going to come back to work.   Phil from Chesterfield:         Through no fault of my own I am not being paid [my] bi-      weekly salary . . . tomorrow. This will cause a significant       strain on my family, my church contributions, my shared       health care cost, my retirement contributions. Having a       college age student attend Virginia Commonwealth University,       with winter semester fees for tuition and room and board       totaling [thousands in] out of pocket expenses is extremely       frustrating. I really cannot [go a long time] without a       salary.        Long term policy disagreements (among both parties of our       elected Senators) using federal government employees'       salaries as a token to rally off is not Democracy. This is       not fair to You . . . or a career professional like myself       who works for the United States Government.        I ask you . . . to consider a CR which would fund our       government through a short-term solution until you and your       bi-partisan colleagues can fix a long-term problem. . . .        Nonetheless, my family and I are out of funding Now! I ask       that you publicly announce [what you will do] and help lead       the bi-partisan CHANGE TO HELP Virginians.    A family from Loudoun County--one, a 20-year government employee:         I am scared not knowing when he will get paid. Our 2 young       children should be signing up for spring sports this week,       but we are cutting optional spending. We are eating out of       the pantry instead of going to the grocery store. Real people       are hurting, working and not being paid. It is 800,000 but       the broader fear and economic impact is tremendous.    Opel from Hampton:         My name is Opel and my husband Kenny is an inspector with       the FDA. As you know, he has been unable to go to work for       the past few weeks. I am writing to you to keep our story and       our situation at the forefront of your agenda. Please       continue to push for our Congressional leaders to get the       government open. It is very difficult to try to explain to       our 9 year old son why Daddy isn't going to work, why Mom and       Dad are having trouble paying our bills. This shutdown is       wrong and I feel that it's also wrong for federal employees       to not be able to go to work because a person some people       elected President wants an extreme form of ``security.''       Please Sir, reopen the government. Many people's lives are at       stake.    Daniel from Arlington:         I am a furloughed employee in the Department of Commerce.       My income has stopped. I have become aware that I will soon       be responsible to make payments for my family's healthcare,       my life insurance, and other benefits that are normal       paycheck deductions. So now I have no income, plus unbudgeted       expenses.        I have hard decisions now with regard to paying my rent,       paying for my family's healthcare, and paying for care for my       elderly parents. I have applied for unemployment assistance.       I am trying to find work to survive throughout the shutdown.        I have 5 years of federal service, and I have experienced       furloughs before. Until now, I have not needed to take       resources away from the unemployment system. Until now, I       haven't had to compete in the job market to take a position       away from someone who has no job at all.        I have personally shut down; I am using as little gasoline       as I can, I am only shopping for necessities. I'm cutting       back in every money-saving way I can. This is a disheartening       way to just try to survive.        PLEASE support legislation that will return furloughed       Federal employees to paid work status.    A final story, Joie from Warrenton:         My husband is a highly experienced Ph.D. Economist with the       SEC. I am a disabled (thanks to cancer) Episcopal priest. We       are in free fall not knowing if my husband will have his job       again, and our health insurance we need for my [cancer]. We       need every penny he earns and no job could replace his       compensation. We spent most of our savings paying off my $40K       in cancer and cancer related bills last year. Still, we live       MODESTLY in a 1700 sq foot old farmhouse with no central air/      heat, drive one 13 year old car and . . . [another old] used       Subaru. It's early Thursday morning 1/10 and I'm having a       panic attack wondering if I will lose my dogs if we get       evicted in case this runs a few months and we run out of       savings to pay our mortgage. We have no family support or       back up and a son with anxiety and ADHD issues for which we       spend thousands out of pocket because mental health services       for youth are either unavailable or do not accept insurance.       Please continue to pressure . . . [all your colleagues] to       bring opening the government to a vote. WORKING AMERICANS       need protection!    This is just a sample of the letters we have received. When I come  back from the session Senator Warner and I are doing in Alexandria, I  will bring back more stories. I know that other offices are receiving  these same kinds of inquiries. Even with a guarantee of backpay, for so  many people who live paycheck to paycheck or who have modest savings,  the timing of even missing one paycheck is very, very critical.   The House has already taken action by a strong majority to reopen  government. By my count, just based on what folks have said in this  Chamber, there are at least 52 members of this Chamber who have already  gone on record and said we should take up the House bill and vote to  reopen government. My hope is that when people listen to stories like  this about lost paychecks and the effect on families and when people in  this body understand the magnitude of tomorrow's recordbreaking day,  when we establish the longest shutdown in the history of the country,  as our colleagues are back in their home States over the weekend  chatting with folks, that number of Senators--52--who want to take up  these bills and vote on them will increase and we can end this  suffering that is so unnecessary.   I will say this. I definitely get that there is an important  controversy that needs resolution--talking about border security,  talking about immigration reform. We have been talking about these  issues since I got here. Regardless of your position on how we should  solve them, I think everybody in the body knows--with no immigration  reform done since 1986 and border security funding a perennial topic-- that there is an important issue to resolving this: How much should we  spend for border security? What is the right way to spend the money?  What is the right place to get the money? Can it be done by executive  fiat, or must it be done via congressional appropriations? What are the  immigration reforms that we need, having not done an immigration reform  bill since 1986?   When the President says these are important issues, he is not wrong.  He is right. But as for the idea that even with an issue of importance  on the table that we need to grapple with, people who are unconnected  to that issue have to be victims, have to suffer as we are trying to  resolve that issue, I just don't get it. As for some of those who are  suffering, it is kind of even counter to the national emergency or  crisis that the President is talking about.   For example, the Coast Guard--as was indicated by one of my stories,  from Terry--is one of the Agencies, because it is under the Department  of Commerce, I believe, that is shuttered. They are not a DOD Agency.  So they are not funded. There are 42,000, I believe, Coast Guard  employees. Most are essential and are working without pay, but some are  furloughed. If there is a crisis at the border--and as the President  described that crisis, a significant portion of the crisis is illegal  drugs coming across the border, and we need folks to interdict illegal  drugs--why would we shutter the Coast Guard? The Coast Guard has many  missions, but one of their important missions--and they work very well  on this, in tandem with other Agencies in this country and in other  countries--is the interdiction of illegal drugs. How does it make  sense, if there is a crisis at the border dealing with drug  importation, for the Coast Guard to be shuttered?   So the President's statement that this is an issue that needs a  resolution is correct, but punishing people who are unconnected to the  issue or even punishing some of the very people whom we need to solve  the issue is just the wrong approach. That is why I believe the right  approach is the approach taken by the House--bringing up bills that  were bipartisan bills, that were worked on and voted on either by  Senate committees or on the Senate floor, and saying: Let's just do  these. Let's reach an agreement for the nonaffected Agencies, the  nonimmigration-related agencies, but between now and September 30  reopen government. And let's provide short-term funding, a month or 3- weeks of funding for the immigration and homeland security Agencies,  and let's just make the whole next chunk of time in this body a  discussion, a resolution, and a compromise that will enable us to meet  some of what the President wants and some of what we want--and that is  possible.   I think sometimes the word that goes out from a shutdown or the word  that goes out from some of the news stories, as well, is this: There is  not going to be a compromise that is possible. The sides are dug in. We  can't find an accord.   I just want to remind the body--and the President knows this--that it  was  [[Page S152]]  just last February when 8 Democrats and 8 Republicans worked and  introduced a bill that coupled borders security with protection for  Dreamers. The President now is asking for $5.7 billion, essentially, in  border security. The bill we had in February was $25 billion, over 10  years--$25 billion--which was exactly to the penny what the President  had asked for. It was $25 billion, borders done right. We wanted to  exercise traditional congressional oversight in the then-two Republican  House Congress over how the money would be spent, but the amount the  President asked for wasn't the problem. It wasn't a problem at all--$25  billion in exchange for something else that the President had asked  for.   He had said: We shouldn't protect Dreamers by Executive order; it  should be done by Congress. There should be a statutory congressional  fix.   He is right about that. That is a better thing--to fix it via  statute, rather than to rely on an Executive action that can change  with the whim of each new Executive. He is right about that.   We basically went to him with a proposal, 16 of us, and introduced  the bill: $25 billion, Mr. President, that is what you asked for;  protection for Dreamers, Mr. President, that is what you asked for.   The response from the White House was not to say: ``I don't like that  deal; let me give you a counter,'' or ``Could you add to it?''   Within less than 24 hours, the White House put out a press release  attacking those who put the bill together--even the Republicans--as  proponents of open borders who wanted to end immigration enforcement as  we know it. It was a press release from the DHS that read like it was  somebody's campaign literature rather than the response that you would  expect from a White House or a Cabinet-level official.   But what that offer showed is that there is great willingness in this  body to invest in border security. In fact, even after the President  poured cold water on it, we put that bill on the floor for a vote.  Forty-six out of 49 Democrats voted for it. Forty-six out of 49  Democrats voted for $25 billion in border security, just like more than  50 Democrats in 2013--and I was part of this, as well--voted for more  than $40 billion in border security.   So for folks at the White House wondering whether in a 3-week or  monthlong intense discussion we could find a path forward on border  security and immigration reform, the evidence is out there that, yes,  we can. We can find that path forward, but we ought to open up  government and let those unconnected with the dispute at least go back  to work, at least go back to work and start getting paid. Then, in this  body--which is a great deliberative body, with 100 people who are very  savvy and smart and who could find a deal moving forward--we could find  an answer to this that would enable the President to say he got  significant investments in borders, and it would also enable those of  us who have promoted commonsense immigration reforms to feel like there  was something in there as well.   With that, I am going to yield the floor. I am going to meet with  Federal employees and then return to share some of their stories. My  ask is a simple one: We need to reopen government. We need to lift the  burden of this anxiety over people.   The last thing I will say is, if this backpay bill passes and the  President signs it--and we are going pay people, we are going to  guarantee their pay--why wouldn't we want them to be serving? If they  are going to be paid, wouldn't we want to have them serving Americans  rather than not serving Americans during this time?   With that I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I would just like to take the floor to  sort of continue comments that I began at 10 o'clock this morning. I  left at 10:30 to accompany my Virginia colleague, Senator Warner, to a  roundtable with Federal employees at a community center in Alexandria,  and I just want to share some of their stories.   What Agencies did these employees work for? There was quite a  variety--Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice,  Environmental Protection Agency, FAA, air traffic control, various  groups within the Agriculture Department, Chemical Safety Board,  Department of Labor, and immigration officials. So they were from many  different parts of the government affected by the shutdown.   How did they describe the effect of the shutdown on them? These were  almost all employees who were furloughed and their spouses and  children, in some instances. A couple of them were not furloughed, but  they were deemed essential and were working without pay.   How did they describe the choices they are having to make?   ``I paid this month's mortgage payment, but I am not sure I can pay  the next.''   ``I am a diabetic, and I have to decide which of the medications I  can afford this month.''   ``My kid is in college. I am not sure I can make the entire tuition  payment for the spring semester.''   ``I have had to take money out of my IRA to cover my bills and pay a  penalty for doing that. I am being penalized because the shutdown of  government leaves me no other choice than to dip into retirement  savings that are part of my IRA.''   ``I have had to borrow money from family and friends.''   ``I have had to reduce the money that I pay to help my mother rent  her apartment.''   ``I tried to put my 7-week-old daughter on the Federal health  insurance plan that I get because I work at the Department of Justice,  but because I am furloughed and the HR department is furloughed, when I  tried to put her on the Federal health plan, I wasn't able to do that,  and when she needed medication--thankfully, for nothing life- threatening--I was not able to get that covered by insurance. I finally  worked for a while and was able to find a workaround for it.''   So families described all kinds of ways that they are trying to cope  and all kinds of effects that this is having on them.   I was struck by a common theme: I work for the government because I  love serving people. I love serving the American people. That is why I  chose to do what I did. That is why I moved from somewhere else to come  here. That is how I met my wife or my husband, and we are jointly  committed to public service.   Many of them described: This was sitting on my desk the day that I  left, and I am so anxious that it is still there and undone.   For one of the individuals who works with the FAA, his job includes  certifying helicopter pilots who fly to support the American military  mission in Iraq. He said: I had a big sheaf of those sitting on my desk  when I left the office. These are people who support our military  mission, and they are not getting certified, and they are not getting  authorized to do the work as long as I am furloughed.    Another man talked about his passion for the food stamp program. He  worked with the Ag Department, and he is involved in one portion of the  SNAP program that is certifying new grocery stores to take SNAP  benefits. He indicated that in his unit, which is all furloughed-- because 95 percent of workers supporting the SNAP program are  furloughed--there have now been 2,500 grocery stores that have been  applying just in this short window around the country to be able to  accept SNAP benefits. Often there are food deserts where it is hard for  people who have SNAP benefits to find stores in their neighborhood that  will accept SNAP. There are 2,500 applications stacked up just in the 3  weeks of the shutdown.   He talked about his anxiety: I have got to get back to work to  process these so more places are more accessible to those people who  have food needs.   That passion for serving the public is what is driving them.   One woman indicated she had a great job in Colorado but was able to  get an internship with DHS. So she moved her family from Colorado to  Woodbridge, VA, for an internship, and that internship then turned into  full-time work at DHS, and she said how proud she is to be working at  Homeland Security and how challenging it is to have no pay.   The employees talked about the psychological damage of being deemed  inessential. Who is essential and who is inessential? Why is it that 95  percent of the people who work on the SNAP program are inessential? Is  it that we don't think hungry families matter? Those who are applying  for SNAP benefits when they fall into a situation where they need  food--that is not essential? Why is that not essential?   A lot of the discussion around the table was that, as painful as it  is to be deemed essential and have to work with no pay, being told that  you are nonessential is kind of even more of a ``dis'' to you. So this  was a powerful group for testimony.   I just want to conclude. I know Senator Warner is a slower driver  than me. So I got here before he did. He will be the last to close this  out.   Just the last thing, I got handed pay statements. I brought back--I  don't know--maybe 100 of these, and I am sure not going to read them  all, but it is interesting.   Robert, for the pay period January 5, 2019, which is the pay period  when the check comes in today: net pay, zero.   Jadyne, same pay period: net pay, zero.   Jared, same pay period: net pay, zero.   I saw this one. I really liked this one. Bryan, same period: net pay,  1 cent--1 cent.   These are mostly from air traffic controllers. In my speech earlier  this morning on the floor I said: Is there any group of Federal  employees that you would less want to be angry at work than air traffic  controllers?   If you think about it--and somebody shared this with me--if you are  there in the tower working on air traffic control, you want 100 percent  of your mind to be on keeping everybody safe. What if 5 percent of your  mind is on ``I just got this pay stub, and it is giving me 1 cent, and  I have been working and working overtime''--if that is on 5 percent of  your mind and another 15 to 20 percent of your mind is, ``How am I  going to pay the mortgage payment? How am I going to pay the  babysitter?''   One mother told me: Because I am furloughed, I am not paying the  babysitter, and now I am not paying the babysitter for 2 weeks and that  is affecting her. But I am saying: Please don't take another client.  You have been my regular babysitter for a long time. I am not paying  you this week, I am not paying you next week, and I am not paying you  as long as there is a shutdown because I am at home, but please don't  go find other work because I want to go back to work and I want to hire  you again.   But what babysitter can take that gig--week after week after week not  being paid on the hope that this person might come back to work?   But for some reason, of all of the indignities, these things really,  really stick in folks craws, because it is not as if, when there is a  shutdown, they don't get a paycheck or stub. In some ways, that might  be better than working full time and finding this paper on  [[Page S161]]  your desk or in your email or at your house--$41.75 or one penny.   So Madam President, I know I am preaching to the choir in this group  here, but I just hope as people are back home this weekend and they  hear similar stories, they will realize that immigration reform and  border security are really important, and we have work to do to find  some accommodation that both Congress and the President can accept, but  there is no reason to keep government shut down and sending out  paychecks for 1 cent and inflicting all these various harms on folks  while we figure that out. I would just pray that we stop this shutdown  and reopen government.   With that, I would like to yield the floor to my colleague from  Virginia.
