 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, the signing of the Abraham Accords  today at the White House represents a very historic breakthrough for  peace in the Middle East. I am not saying that this accord alone will  bring peace to that troubled region, but this is the first tangible  progress toward peace in that area in a quarter century.   I met Anwar Sadat at the time of the Camp David Accords in 1978, when  he was present in the Ways and Means Committee room over in the House  of Representatives, and I had an opportunity also to witness, at the  White House, the handshake between Rabin and Arafat in 1993. Both  events seemed to herald a new peace in the Middle East that, quite  frankly, never materialized, and yet we still have peace between Israel  and Egypt and between Israel and Jordan.   Israel has been a country for over 72 years. It is the only democracy  in the region. It is a major economic, military, and political power,  and, of course, it is our greatest ally in the Middle East. It is  overdue for other states, then, and those states that are in that area  especially to recognize Israel and pursue normal relations.   The outdated notion that recognition of Israel's existence should be  withheld until somehow Israelis and Palestinians agree on the details  of a two-state solution has not worked. The two-state solution hasn't  made an agreement more likely, but it has prevented diplomatic  interactions that could be a stabilizing force in an unstable region.   In a polarized time, today's historic accord between Israel and the  UAE and Israel and Bahrain is good news that anyone can celebrate. We  ought to give President Trump great credit for his leadership in this  area. He has delivered in a lot of areas where both Republican and  Democratic Presidents could not deliver in the past.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
