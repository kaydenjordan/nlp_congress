 Mr. Speaker, Haiti is descending into chaos. These  folks just lost their democratically elected government, and the  violent gangs, which were already running rampant in the country, have  basically taken over the country.   Mr. Speaker, this is one of the poorest countries in the world. Its  people are starved, scared, and terrorized. Why are world leaders not  paying more attention? Where is the United Nations? They are not doing  anything. They are not sending any peacekeepers.   We have sent close to $100 billion to Ukraine since Russia invaded.  Of course, I support Ukraine's fight for freedom. I don't support  sending them all our money. We shouldn't be its primary sponsor. We  shouldn't be hypocritical in how we help countries around the world.   What are we going to do if China invades our allies in Taiwan? Do we  have a plan? Heck, no, we don't have a plan.   We need to be smarter with where we send our money and aid. We need a  consistent plan that puts Americans' interests first and addresses  foreign conflict.                            ____________________
