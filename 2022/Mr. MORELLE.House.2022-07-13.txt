Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1224, for five measures.   First, it provides for consideration of H.R. 7900 under a structured  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Armed Services, makes in order a record 650 amendments, and provides en  bloc authority and one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 8296 and H.R. 8297  under closed rules. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate for each  bill equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, provides one motion to  recommit for each bill, and self-executes a manager's amendment on H.R.  8297.   The rule further provides for consideration of H.R. 6538 under a  closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on the Judiciary and provides one motion to recommit.  [[Page H5984]]    The rule also provides for consideration of S. 3373 under a closed  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs and provides one motion to commit.   Finally, the rule extends recess instructions, suspension authority,  and same-day authority through July 19, 2022, and provides the majority  leader or his designee the ability to en bloc requested votes on  suspension bills this week.   Madam Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of meaningful  legislation that I look forward to discussing with my colleagues today.  I would like to start by sharing a few words on the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023.   Our Nation faces real and serious global challenges to our security  every day, and safeguarding our national defense is vital and  necessary. The Russian Federation has launched an unprovoked invasion  of the free and democratic Nation of Ukraine, while an emboldened  Chinese military threatens our allies in the Pacific.   America must be prepared to face these threats by promoting political  stability and diplomatic engagement and ensuring our military is  prepared to meet increased threats to global stability.   I am a proud member of the House Armed Services Committee, and this  year, for the 62nd consecutive year in a row, the committee has marked  up and reported a National Defense Authorization Act to address our  national defense needs.   The fiscal year 2023 NDAA includes critical investments in our  servicemembers, bolsters our position as a leader in technological  innovation to compete with countries like China, and ensures we are  prepared to face the coercions of adversaries who already threaten  global peace and stability.   I thank the leadership of Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers  for delivering a bipartisan bill that prioritizes the needs of our  servicemembers and provides the resources to protect global security  and peace.   Today, we are also considering the rule for the Honoring our PACT  Act. It has been a long road to get here, and I thank Chairman Takano  and Ranking Member Bost for their efforts to get this done.   Back home, I have had the opportunity to meet with toxic-exposed  veterans and their families, and I have heard loud and clear just how  necessary this legislation is for our veterans.   When we send our servicemembers into harm's way, we make a promise  that when they come home, we will take care of them.   Sadly, over 3.5 million veterans were exposed to toxic fumes and  carcinogens while serving our Nation, resulting in life-threatening  lung diseases and cancers. Right now, they are not getting the care  they need due to a disability benefits claims process that is  cumbersome and places the burden to prove toxic exposure on veterans  themselves.                                time  1045    By creating a presumption for disability, this legislation will help  cut through the red tape and ensure nothing stands in the way of  servicemembers receiving their care.   It is time we make good on our promise to ensure all veterans exposed  to toxic substances during their service can access the essential care  and benefits they have earned.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this bill and look forward to  its passage.   Madam Speaker, the rule today also provides for consideration of the  Active Shooter Alert Act, which, frankly, should have passed under  suspension in June. This commonsense legislation would create a  communications network to alert people when an active shooter is in  their community.   It is tragic to think we even need such a system, but sadly, the fear  of a mass shooting has become a persistent dark cloud shrouding our  Nation.   Let's take a moment to reflect on the horrific scene on July 4 when  the Highland Park community was attacked. What should have been a  joyous occasion for families, friends, and community members instead  became a nightmare when a dangerous person wielding a dangerous weapon  fired into the crowd, killing seven and injuring dozens more.   There are those who, yet again, offered their thoughts and prayers in  response to the Highland Park shooting, yet provided no real solutions.  But there are solutions--in fact, this body has passed countless  measures that could have helped prevent such a tragic event.   I have made my position clear--meaningful, commonsense gun reform is  an absolute necessity. To my colleagues who regularly oppose solutions  to gun violence, I ask: What are you willing to do to help protect our  communities?   Let's at least come together on legislation that creates a warning  system for communities when an active shooter is present so more  innocent lives can be saved. We are talking about an alert system, just  like those already in place for disasters like tornados, earthquakes,  and AMBER Alerts. I can't imagine who would be opposed to such a  commonsense step.   I thank the more than 40 Republicans who evaluated the merits of this  straightforward bill and voted in favor this June, and I hope we can  count on your vote again this week.   Any action is better than no action, which is why I am proud to  support this legislation--but we also know it barely scratches the  surface of the many other reforms that are needed, which is why I will  continue fighting for measures to ban assault weapons, limit high- capacity magazines, and enact universal background checks on every gun  sale.   Madam Speaker, I would like to end my opening remarks with comments  on two fundamental healthcare bills included in this rule: The Women's  Health Protection Act and the Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive  Freedom Act.   These bills will empower women and reaffirm their right to make  independent and informed healthcare decisions.   Over the past year we have seen an all-out assault on women's bodily  autonomy. The appalling Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade  was just the beginning. We have seen States undertake efforts to  criminalize a woman's right to make basic family planning decisions.   We have seen a 10-year-old child, a victim of rape, forced out of her  State for the healthcare she desperately needs. We have seen increased  Federal efforts to restrict access to women's healthcare,  contraception, and the fundamental right to privacy.   These astounding restrictions on women are exactly why we need the  Women's Health Protection Act.   The Federal law will codify the provisions of Roe v. Wade and  establish a statutory right to access the healthcare all women need and  deserve.   We also need to pass the Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive  Freedom Act, legislation I proudly cosponsor.   It is a sad state of affairs that we need to codify the fundamental  right to interstate travel in this country, protecting women from civil  and criminal liability, even when seeking an abortion in a State where  it is lawful.   The fact that we have already seen efforts in State legislatures to  prevent women from seeking lawful abortions across State lines  completely contradicts the claim that overturning Roe v. Wade was about  returning the decision to the States.   The radical right has and always will be about restricting women's  rights. It is hard to believe we are living in 2022, not 1722. By  passing this legislation, we are making it clear that this assault on  women's rights cannot stand.   I urge my colleagues to show this country and the world that we  respect women, we trust women, and we support women and their right to  make informed and independent healthcare decisions.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I will make a couple of points on what I think is one of the  most important issues that we will face in this Congress and in the  future years.   Abortion access in America changed overnight after the Supreme Court  took away a woman's constitutional right to make her own reproductive  health decisions. Nearly 34 million people of reproductive age now live  in a State where abortion is banned or severely restricted--one of the  only times that I know of that the Supreme Court of the United States  in our history took away a fundamental constitutional right to more  than half of America. My 86-year-old mother who is a grandmother and  great-grandmother will have had more right over her body and more  decision-making under this decision than her granddaughters and great- granddaughters.   It is unconscionable, and the impact of this decision will have  horrific consequences for millions of people, particularly people with  the greatest burden: low-income individuals, people of color, and  victims of incest and abuse. I am genuinely concerned, as are millions  of people, for women's rights in this country. We refuse to be  complacent, and we refuse to stand silent. We will keep fighting every  single day however I can and however we can. Today that means  supporting the advancement of the Women's Health Protection Act.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), who is a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   While this is not on the agenda, and I will remind people that we  have a rule that stipulates which bills are in front of us, I note with  alarm the suggestion that we ought to change the Constitution when it  comes to the Supreme Court, and for fear that we are undermining the  confidence of the Court, frankly, I am astonished.   How about following the current Constitution?   Forget about amending it.   How about following the one that we have?   I just note that when Merrick Garland was nominated by President  Obama in March of 2016, 293 days his nomination went without any action  in the United States Senate. Amy Coney Barrett was nominated September  26, a mere 6 weeks, 5 weeks before election day. Senator McConnell and  the Senate didn't follow the Constitution which says advise and consent  on nominations sent by the President. They did absolutely nothing with  the nominee Garland. They didn't seek to do anything. In fact, Mitch  McConnell talked about the politics of it.   Talk about undermining the confidence of the American public in the  Supreme Court?    How about that?   Yet when President Trump just 5 weeks before a Presidential election  made a nomination, it was swiftly pushed through.   Undermining confidence in the Supreme Court?   How about confirmation proceedings where Brett Kavanaugh or Neil  Gorsuch both said that Roe is settled law; a precedent for 50 years?   They said it in confirmation hearings. They have said it as Senator  Collins has indicated her vote hung on those words. Yet they had no  intention of following those words. They misled the American public.   Undermining confidence in the Supreme Court?   I am astonished that anyone would even say it.   Frankly, when we talk about this, we know what the agenda here is.  Justice Thomas gave us a clear roadmap of where this is all headed.   Undermining confidence in the Supreme Court?   Justice Thomas urged the Court to reconsider all of this Court's  substantive due process precedence, including the right to  contraception, the right to private consensual acts, and the right to  same-sex marriage, characterizing the entire legal doctrine as  particularly dangerous.   Undermining the confidence of the Supreme Court of the United States?   Now, Justice Kavanaugh, I will say to his credit in his concurrence,  said that the Court won't go that far. But we have heard these same  assurances from Justice Kavanaugh before, and I think they aren't worth  the words on the paper that this is printed.   We should be very, very concerned. We should be concerned that the  American public has lost confidence in the Supreme Court, but not  because of the actions of anyone here or the suggestions here.   How about because of the actions of the United States Senate and the  actions of the Supreme Court itself?   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Allred).                                time  1115     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate the distinguished gentleman and his comments. I note,  just in passing, that Article I authority given to us by the Framers  actually gave us the authority to identify the size of the Supreme  Court.   Constitutional amendments are not Article I. They are an extensive  process that involves ratification. Article I authority, actually--I  think he would make my argument--Article I authority would be the  Congress making the decision on the size of the Supreme Court, which  has been changed many times, from as few as six to as many as nine  judges.    But having said that, and just making that point, let's talk about  some of the real issues that need addressing that, frankly, are before  us, because the size of the Supreme Court is not before us, as  interesting as that conversation might be. Let's talk, instead, about  issues that real Americans face.   While bravely serving our country, many veterans were exposed to  hazards, from burn pits, PFAS, and radiation, toxic exposures that have  caused cancers, infertility, respiratory conditions, and unexplained  chronic illnesses. As many as 3.5 million servicemembers have been  exposed to dangerous toxic fumes.   The cost of war goes far beyond the battlefield, and we have a duty  to uphold our promises to toxic-exposed veterans by investing in the  healthcare they need and so richly deserve.   In their time of need, veterans should be receiving high-quality  care. Instead, they are being burdened with proving that their illness  is connected to their service.   I have had the privilege of meeting with many veterans in my  community, and the families of veterans who have been lost because of  exposure, while they continue the work of having to prove that their  illness is a result of exposure to toxic chemicals, to carcinogens, to  burn pits.   The Honoring our PACT Act is included in this rule, and this  legislation will address the wide range of issues impacting toxic- exposed veterans and their access to earned benefits and care. You can  bet I am voting ``yes.''   That is one of the bills being discussed before us today, and I think  people watching us on television, people watching this later, seeing  clips, would be curious as to why suddenly we are talking about an  issue not on the floor, not before us. But this is, the Honoring our  PACT Act, before us today.   We can all do something to safeguard those who have served in our  Armed Forces and their families by doing the right thing, passing this  rule, and passing the underlying legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I appreciate the comments from my distinguished colleague on  the Rules Committee, Mr. Burgess. But what he points out, in my mind,  reminds me how deeply personal this decision is for women involving  their body and their healthcare.   I would certainly never question his credentials as a doctor or as a  professional, but I have heard from a number of obstetricians and  gynecologists who raise, I think, what are really important questions.   For instance, in some States, the health of the mother is the only  consideration to be given when it comes to an abortion or reproductive  services. Some have raised the question: How long do you wait before  you can make the judgment that that is the only determination that can  be made? If you wait too long, do you actually jeopardize the health of  the mother by waiting so long for fear of violating a State law that  restricts the right of a woman to an abortion?   Then there is the question of miscarriages. Many, many women have  miscarriages. And concerns have been expressed by their doctors of when  we provide care after the fact or during a miscarriage, will there be  questions raised about whether or not that was actually an abortion  instead of a miscarriage? Will we be jeopardizing our careers? Will we  be putting our professional license into question?   These are very difficult questions to answer. I am certainly no  expert in them, but they raise, to me, significant questions.   As many have pointed out, there will be abortions in the United  States. There will be abortions in Texas. There will be abortions in  Mississippi. There will be abortions in every State in this country.   The question is: Are they going to be safe? Are women going to suffer  unduly? Are there going to be deaths of women because they weren't  given access to safe, reproductive care that is ultimately, as I said,  so deeply personal, so deeply involved in their autonomy?   Those are the questions before us. They are deep-seated questions.  They are important questions. But, ultimately, we side with the right  of a woman to make the decision for herself.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to talk about another important piece embodied  in the rule, and it is related to the question of alerts and the Active  Shooter Alert Act.  [[Page H5990]]    It is no secret our country is plagued by gun violence. This year  alone, the Gun Violence Archive counted at least 323 mass shootings. It  is hard to even process that--323 mass shootings in the United States.  We are just halfway through the year.   On May 14, ten Black Americans were targeted in a racially motivated  mass shooting at a local Tops grocery store 60 minutes from my home in  Buffalo, New York.   Ten days later, the deadliest shooting since Sandy Hook took place in  Uvalde, Texas, where 19 kids and 2 teachers were gunned down at Robb  Elementary School.   Just a week ago, on July 4 in Highland Park, Illinois, seven people  at a 4th of July parade were killed by a gunman during a mass shooting  incident. Hard to imagine. So many of us were at parades and activities  just like that in our hometowns. Seven people dead.   I have made my position and others have made their position very  clear on gun reform, that meaningful, commonsense reform is an absolute  necessity. I am committed to fighting for the change that will provide  real change and save real lives, big changes.   But, in the meantime, I think this demonstrates our willingness to  find common ground on solutions. Again, the Active Shooter Alert Act is  bipartisan. It is something we should all be able to get behind on  voting ``yes.''    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I begin by thanking the distinguished gentleman from  Oklahoma. We have the great privilege of serving together on the Rules  Committee. We spend many hours together, and I almost always--almost  always--find myself in agreement with him.   He is thoughtful. He is dedicated to this institution, committed to  the important principles of our democracy and the Constitution, and I  consider it a privilege to be able to serve with him and to learn from  him, and I appreciate his thoughtfulness in this debate as well.   I also thank my colleagues for their words in support of the rule  before us today. A vote in favor of the rule today, in my view, says  volumes about what we value. Support for this rule shows we value our  servicemembers who put their lives on the line for this country each  and every day. When they come home, we will be here to take care of  them.   A ``yes'' vote shows we value our defense preparedness and ensures  our Nation is ready to face the very real and serious global challenges  threatening our security. It also demonstrates a willingness to do the  bare minimum to address gun violence by ensuring our communities can  effectively be able to alert people when an active shooter is in the  area.   Last, but certainly not least, a vote in favor tells women in this  country that we value and respect them. We support their right to  manage their own healthcare.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle can attempt to misdirect  and confuse the issues at hand all they want, but the reality is we are  presenting concrete proposals to address real issues facing our Nation  when it comes to national defense, and I appreciate the bipartisan  support for that, the NDAA, gun reform, women's rights, support for  veterans. I choose to be on the right side of history on these issues.  I am voting ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1224         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 11. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       joint resolution (H.J. Res. 11) proposing an amendment to the       Constitution of the United States to require that the Supreme       Court of the United States be composed of nine justices.
