 Madam Speaker, I have met with many police  officers who serve communities in Texas' 25th District, and I continue  to be inspired by their acts of bravery and dedication to protecting  others.   Now, we are facing a time where there has been a tragic increase in  police officers being targeted and killed while on the job as violent  crime skyrockets across America.   Last year alone, 346 officers were shot in the line of duty, the  highest in 20 years. One of Texas 25th's own, Hill County Constable  Kevin Cordell, was shot multiple times while on a high-speed car chase.  One bullet went through the windshield of his vehicle, struck him in  the head, and exited through his neck. By God's grace, he survived the  shooting and recovered after surgery.   Liberal activists who care more about political agendas than public  safety are making our cities unsafe. Last year, Austin, Texas,  submitted to the radical left's antipolice hatred and cut $150 million  from their police budget. This budget cut put Texas families and  residents at greater risk for longer emergency response times and paves  the way for lawlessness to run wild in the city.                            ____________________
