 Mr. Speaker, Colorado is home to 17,000 Deferred Action  for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, recipients. This program is an  essential help in our dysfunctional immigration system. It allows young  people who only know the U.S. as home to legally reside and work here.   Through my congressional service, I have been moved by the stories of  DACA recipients who have bravely spoken up for their communities and  only want to positively contribute to our country, young people like  Brayan.   Brayan is a business marketing and finance major at Colorado State  University, in my district. He moved here with his family at a young  age. He was only 3. He doesn't even remember making the trek from  Chihuahua, Mexico, to Colorado. He grew up here, attended elementary  and high school here. He didn't even know he was undocumented until he  was in eighth grade.   DACA has allowed Brayan to come out of the shadows and live with a  sense of security rather than anxiety and fear. In Brayan's words, DACA  has put hope in the hearts of the forgotten.   What I want Brayan and others like him to know is: You are not  forgotten, not by me, not by those of us in the community who know you  and love you.   I stand by Brayan's side, and I will fight to ensure that the DACA  program is continued for the 17,000 recipients in Colorado and 800,000  nationwide. The bottom line is that Brayan and others like him belong  here.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to both this rule and the  underlying bill. Instead of coming up with new thoughts or new ideas,  here we have another recycled and careless bill that has been through  this body before that takes away protections for our sick, for our  children, for pregnant women, and for the elderly. It is the wrong way  to go for our country.   This bill is called the Ozone Standards Implementation Act, but it is  actually a political stunt for a special interest, in this case the oil  and gas industry. It will hurt our air, our environment, and, frankly,  have a negative impact on the health of Americans. It will increase  healthcare costs at a time when healthcare costs are already too high.    We see that, the way the House Republicans are trying to jam through  the Affordable Care Act repeal, which I remind my friends passed here  in the House. It is only in the Senate where they are finally realizing  the error of their ways.   In Colorado, 500,000 people have benefited from the Affordable Care  Act, and the number of people without insurance has been cut in half  from 6.7 percent to 2.5 percent. Of course, it is not perfect, and I  hope that now is an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to work  together, rather than Republicans seeking to go at it alone with a plan  that provides less people with healthcare rather than more.   The Affordable Care Act made sure that no one can be denied coverage  for a preexisting condition. That benefited over 750,000 people in  Colorado, including people with cancer and asthma, the rates of which  would both increase if this bill that we are discussing under this rule  were to become law. Yes, that is right. More people would suffer from  asthma and more people would suffer from cancer if this bill were to  pass.   This reckless Republican healthcare bill even eliminated the  Prevention and Public Health Fund at the end of fiscal year 2017,  slashing funding for the Centers for Disease Control by 12 percent,  singling out certain providers, like Planned Parenthood, from even  participating in the Medicaid program; preventing patients from  receiving preventative care services, like cancer screenings and STD  testing and contraceptive care from their provider of choice, often, in  many cases, the only provider in town.   So it is no surprise that we have yet another bill that would  increase healthcare costs before us, lead to more people having to pay  more for what they already have for healthcare.   And here we have a bill that is opposed by the American Lung  Association, the American Thoracic Society. They are all very strongly  opposed to this bill. It is why over 700 healthcare professionals  signed a letter in opposition to H.R. 806 dated July 17, 2017, which I  include in the Record.                                                      July 17, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: We, the undersigned physicians,       nurses, environmental health professionals and other health       professionals, urge you to protect our patients' and       communities' health from dangerous air pollution. Please       oppose any legislation or administrative actions that would       block, weaken or delay work to implement and enforce strong       safeguards for healthy air.        Our patients, families, and neighbors need healthy air to       breathe, particularly those who are at greater risk of       getting sick or dying prematurely due to air pollution,       including children, older adults, and people with asthma,       COPD, and heart disease.        Thanks to the Clean Air Act, the United States has made       enormous progress in cleaning up ozone and particle       pollution. The American Lung Association's 2017 ``State of       the Air'' report found that cities across the U.S. have made       continued improvement in reducing these pollutants, with many       reaching their lowest ozone levels yet. However, 125 million       people still live in areas where they are exposed to       unhealthy levels of air pollution.        Clean Air Act protections must continue to be implemented       and enforced to ensure that all Americans have healthy air to       breathe. In addition, evidence shows that climate change will       make it harder to clean up ozone and particle pollution. The       nation must reduce the carbon, methane, and other pollutants       that lead to warmer temperatures, and work to protect our       communities against the many health impacts of climate       change.        As health and medical professionals, we call upon you to       protect the health of our patients and our communities by       opposing measures that would block, weaken, or delay       protections under the Clean Air Act, or other protections       that reduce harmful air pollution and protect public health       from the impacts of climate change. Our communities are       counting on you.

They are from nearly every State, Mr. Speaker. And looking at this, I  see red states, and I see blue states, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana,  Mississippi, and that is because this is science we are talking about  here.   This bill will increase healthcare costs. That is the economic side.  The human side is it will lead to suffering and even death. That is why  it is important to stop this bill now by stopping this rule from  passing.   Not only will this bill harm millions of Americans, but, in addition,  they have offered it under a way to limit amendments and ideas that  Republicans and Democrats had offered. This rule does allow several  amendments, one of which is mine, and we will discuss that later, but  it doesn't allow for amendments from Democrats and Republicans. They  only made in order 6 of the 11 amendments, including germane amendments  that were submitted to be debated.   For instance, why wasn't Mr. Cooper's amendment, which clarified that  State implementation plans can incorporate local land use policies,  allowed any debate on the floor?   All Members with amendments should be given the opportunity to bring  them to the full House and get a fair up-or-down vote on the merits of  their amendment. That is how we craft better legislation, and that is  how we fix bills, Mr. Speaker.   I assure you, this bill needs to be fixed, because all it does is it  repackages a bunch of bills that make our air dirtier and our health  worse and healthcare more costly, all bills that we have seen here over  the last several years, bringing them all together in sort of a  Frankenstein bill where you assemble all these horrible body parts from  different bills, each of which is bad, creating a huge monster that  will kill people and increase healthcare costs for every American.   Instead of trying to weaken the Clean Air Act, putting Americans'  health at risk, which is what this bill does, we should be talking  about the way to close loopholes that exist in our Clean Air Act; to  make our air cleaner, not dirtier; reduce asthma and cancer, not  increase asthma and cancer.   That is why I am glad that my amendment was made in order. My  amendment is based off of the BREATHE Act, which I introduced with  several of my colleagues earlier this year. It would close the oil and  gas industry's loophole to the Clean Air Act's aggregation requirement.  We will be discussing that in more detail later today, but, very  simply, when you have small sites for oil and gas extraction, they  don't have to aggregate their pollution, even though in the aggregate,  when you have 20,000 wells in a county, cumulatively it can release a  large amount of air pollutants, even more than a larger power plant.  This amendment would simply hold all sources of emission to the same  standard for the impact on the Nation's air quality. I hope that my  amendment will be adopted, it is common sense, so we can improve the  Clean Air Act rather than eviscerate it.   This bill takes apart a law that is one of the most successful in the  history of our country in protecting our most vulnerable and  strengthening our economy. A stronger economy means less sick days from  work, it means less hospital visits, it means less premature deaths.  This bill will increase all of those, sick days, hospital visits, and  premature deaths, because it takes away protections for our clean air.   I am proud to say that between 1980 and 2014, emissions of six air  pollutants controlled by the Clean Air Act have dropped 63 percent. We  should be proud of that. While those six toxic pollutants dropped 63  percent, our gross domestic product increased 147 percent, vehicle  miles traveled increased 97 percent, energy consumption increased 26  percent, our population grew by 41 percent. That shows over the last  several decades how we can have clean air, a healthy population, and a  strong economy--not one at the expense of another.   These emission standards have already generated dramatic public  health benefits. A recent peer-reviewed study estimates that the Clean  Air Act will save more than 230,000 lives, prevent millions of cases of  respiratory problems in 2020 alone. It also enhances our national  productivity by preventing 17 million lost workdays. These public  health benefits translate into $2 trillion in monetized benefits to the  economy.   If this bill were to be scored by that metric, this bill would cost  $2 trillion by eviscerating the protections we have in the Clean Air  Act, but instead of maintaining and strengthening these important life- saving laws, instead, they are delaying the implementation of the ozone  National Ambient Air Quality Standards set by scientists, an update  that is long overdue and has economic benefits of $4.5 billion annually  in 2025 alone. This bill would suspend that, which are particularly  important for the pregnant, for the elderly, for those who suffer from  asthma.   25 million Americans suffer from asthma, 7 million of whom are  children. For many, the condition lasts a lifetime and sometimes can be  life-threatening. In 2014, about 4,000 people died due to an asthma  attack. The connection between air quality and asthma is extremely well  documented and incontrovertible, and it shouldn't be understated.   Clean air is an integral part of quality of life, and we shouldn't be  tearing down protections that simply allow kids or the elderly to go  outside, kids to play outside on a playground in a neighborhood,  without worrying about respiratory problems or asthma.   Another problematic provision of this Frankenstein bill is that it  changes the criteria for establishing a NAAQS from one that is based  solely on protecting public health to one that includes consideration  of technology.                                time  1245    Now, that is the core of the Clean Air Act and necessary to protect  public health. The NAAQS determine what level of air pollution is  ``safe'' to breath. That is just a matter of fact. What is safe is  safe, what is not safe is unsafe. Scientists need to determine that.  This change would allow polluters to override scientists and is  analogous to a doctor making a diagnosis based on how much a test cost.   I don't want my doctor telling me I don't have condition X or Y  because I might have a high cost to treat. I don't think anybody else  does, either. We demand, and we deserve, safe air. We should be safe  breathing the air in our country, period.   The problems go on and on with this bill. I will stop there for now  because the Republicans have wasted enough time even bringing this  Frankenstein bill to the floor that cobbles together a number of other  terrible bills that they have already passed.   Let's move forward with making our air cleaner, not dirtier; with  reducing cancer and asthma, not increasing them; and with reducing  healthcare costs, not increasing them. This bill is the wrong  direction.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump campaigned on the promise of job  creation; however, his budget paints a starkly  [[Page H5934]]  different and darker picture. It cuts job training programs by 39  percent. It would lead to massive job losses with its cuts. In this  body, we talk a little about jobs, but we are 7 months into the 115th  Congress and have failed to pass any major jobs bill.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to say that I have an amendment in my hand  that will generate thousands of American jobs.   When we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to  the rule to bring up Representative DeFazio's bipartisan bill, H.R.  2510, the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act. The bill will  create thousands of new American jobs through increased investment in  our Nation's wastewater infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Issa). Is there objection to the request  of the gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the distinguished ranking member of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his initiative here to actually create some jobs.   Mr. Speaker, the premise of the legislation before us today is that  if we allow more pollution--particularly ozone pollution, which is very  detrimental to the health of asthmatics; I mean, bad for the health of  everyday Americans, but particularly to the 25 million asthmatics,  seniors, and others--the premise is that by polluting the air more with  ozone, we will create jobs.   Now, actually, I have got to agree with the Republicans on this. They  will create more jobs by polluting the air. Pulmonary specialists will  be very busy. And then, oh, the inhaler manufacturers. There has been  some great press about the inhaler manufacturers in the last year,  where they are quadrupling and sextupling the price to price gouge  people. Well, they are going to have a heyday. In fact, I believe they  have endorsed this legislation.   And then we are going to have a whole new group of people working on  the streets in America. It is going to be a whole new entrepreneurial  class. There are actually people in Beijing doing this now. The air is  so polluted in Beijing that on many days they say: Don't go outside.  But, I mean, you have to go outside sometimes, you have to go to the  grocery store, or you have to go to work. They now have a very large  industry of street vendors who sell oxygen; so, as you are about to  collapse on the street in Beijing, someone will sell you a good whiff  of oxygen for whatever they charge for it. We are going to bring that  industry to America. So this bill does have phenomenal potential to  create a whole new bunch of jobs with oxygen street vendors and then,  of course, the pulmonary specialists, the inhaler manufacturers, and  others.   The President actually, as a candidate, said that he would triple the  amount of money that would be spent on clean water State revolving  funds; he would triple it. Now, interestingly enough, the Congressional  Budget Office came out with an analysis yesterday of the President's  proposed budgets over the next 10 years, which theoretically is going  to increase investment and infrastructure. And they said: Actually, not  so much. Actually, in fact, his cuts basically would lead to a  reduction in investment in clean water and a reduction in investment in  ground transportation.   So, instead of tripling the investment and putting many people to  work, the President, actually, is going to cut investment in clean  water in his proposed budget. Now, I know he didn't write the budget.  You know, he has got this rightwing guy running the CBO--Mulvaney,  founder of the Freedom Caucus. But Trump is somewhat responsible for a  budget that has his name on it, even if he didn't write it, even if he  didn't know what was in it, and even if he doesn't know that it  contradicts promises he made as a candidate, which he is not going to  deliver as President.   But, that said, I want to help the President out here. So, this bill  simply delivers on the President's promise to triple the amount of  investment to $25 billion.   Now, do we need it? Heck, yeah, we need it. According to the American  Society of Civil Engineers' 2017 infrastructure report card, America's  wastewater treatment systems got a grade of D-plus--not too good. And  there is a backlog of more than $40 billion in clean water  infrastructure.   The Federal Government needs to become an honest partner with our  cities, counties, and others, who have needs to invest in their  wastewater systems. We did it before when we cleaned up our rivers back  in the sixties, seventies, and eighties with the Clean Air Act, and we  need to do it again. We need the Federal partnership. We need this  investment.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.   Mr. DeFAZIO. And the other good thing is, if we were to spend that  money, according to the National Utility Contractors Association, every  billion dollars--just $1 billion--invested in our Nation's water  infrastructure creates, or sustains, 27,000 jobs. So do the math. The  President can do math. He is a businessman. That would be 540,000 jobs  if we delivered on the President's promise to make significant new  investments with Federal partnership in clean water in America.   So, we can put together health, cleaning up the environment, and  jobs, as opposed to the Republican bill, which deteriorates health,  deteriorates the environment and protections, and won't create any  jobs.    Just one quick quote here: ``The Clean Water State Revolving Fund is  a perfect example of the type of program that should be reauthorized  because it creates jobs while benefiting the environment, and is an  efficient return on taxpayer investment.''   That is from the Oregon Water Resources Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I will conclude as we proceed to this absurdity of  saying, by deteriorating health, we will create jobs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Well, I know my friend actually has a bill on the topic of the asthma  inhalers, and I can tell you, if this bill becomes law, we will need  all the asthma inhalers we can get, so I think your bill will have to  go through.   I would like to inquire of the gentleman why your asthma inhaler bill  isn't included in this package, since we will need to sell more asthma  inhalers if the rest of the bill goes through?    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.    Did the gentleman consider offering that as an amendment  to this bill, your other bill, to allow the sale of those asthma  inhalers?    I yield to the gentleman from Texas.  [[Page H5935]]         Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, our Rules Committee can  waive germaneness. But it would be an appropriate bill to include, as  Mr. DeFazio pointed out, ironically, there are some jobs that this bill  will create: people selling oxygen on the street, pulmonologists, and,  yes, asthma inhalers because more people will suffer from asthma, and  kids with asthma won't be able to spend as much quality time outside if  this bill were to become law.   Instead of continuing this kind of work that raises healthcare costs,  and increases asthma and cancer, we should be focusing on issues that  create jobs we want. We don't want the air to be so bad that there is  somebody selling oxygen canisters on the street.                                time  1300    We want jobs in renewable energy and making our air cleaner, in new  forms of energy efficiency and bringing down people's utility bills  because we use less energy. That is what excites people and that is  what is good for our air.   Instead of focusing on those kinds of needs or, God forbid, shrinking  the deficit or halting the handout of subsidies to special interests,  they are talking about ideas here like this, that further diminish our  standing as a world leader and further diminish what makes America  special and our quality of life.   I hope all Members look in the mirror and think about our health, the  health of our children, the health of our elderly relatives, and those  most at risk. And we ask: How would this bill affect them?   The answer is obvious. It only serves to hurt them. It only serves to  make people sicker. It only serves to increase costs, destroy economic  value, and create additional risk for our environment.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule  and the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, during rollcall Vote No. 384 on H.R. 2786, I  mistakenly recorded my vote as ``no'' when I should have voted ``yes.''

The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Redesignate sections 5 and 6 as sections 6 and 7,       respectively.        Insert after section 4 the following:       SEC. 5. BRINGING REDUCTIONS TO ENERGY'S AIRBORNE TOXIC HEALTH                     EFFECTS.         (a) Repeal of Exemption for Aggregation of Emissions From       Oil and Gas Sources.--Section 112(n) of the Clean Air Act (42       U.S.C. 7412(n)) is amended by striking paragraph (4).        (b) Hydrogen Sulfide as a Hazardous Air Pollutant.--The       Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall--        (1) not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of       this Act, issue a final rule adding hydrogen sulfide to the       list of hazardous air pollutants under section 112(b) of the       Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(b)); and        (2) not later than 365 days after a final rule under       paragraph (1) is issued, revise the list under section 112(c)       of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(c)) to include categories and       subcategories of major sources and area sources of hydrogen       sulfide, including oil and gas wells.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 451, the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Polis) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, since the Republicans are talking about a bill that makes  the Clean Air Act work better, even though, in many ways, that is the  opposite of what the bill does, I have offered an amendment that will  actually do that. It will make the Clean Air Act work better to keep  our air clean so we can breathe more freely, reduce asthma rates, and  reduce cancer rates.   My amendment would very simply close a very glaring loophole that our  current Clean Air Act has--a loophole that every day harms the  freshness of the air and the health of my constituents in my State and  so many others across the country.   My amendment, which is based off of legislation that I have  introduced, along with many other cosponsors, four times, including in  this Congress, called the BREATHE Act, would close the oil and gas  industry's loophole to the Clean Air Act's aggregation requirement.   Currently, oil and gas operations, like the one here, are completely  exempt from the aggregation requirement in the Clean Air Act. Under the  aggregation requirement, small air pollution sources that cumulatively  reduce as much air pollution as major sources, like a power plant, are  actually rounded out entirely of the protections of the Clean Air Act.  Oil and gas is exempt, and they shouldn't be.   While one site like this has emissions that are significant, you can  imagine having 20,000 of these in one county, which we do in my home  State of Colorado, and that cannot conceivably be rounded down to zero.  That is the equivalent of several large power plants. We should look at  them in the aggregate, where they are close to one another  geographically.   The aggregation requirement is actually intended to protect the  public from small air pollution sources that might individually seem  innocuous, but cumulatively account for large volumes of toxic  substances that are put in the air.   We have areas of Wyoming and northern Colorado that have worse air  quality than Los Angeles, not because of one or two or ten extraction  sites, but because of tens of thousands within an immediate vicinity.   The oil and gas industry currently does not have to aggregate or pull  together its small air pollution sources. They round them down to zero.  Rounding one or two down to zero is not an issue. Rounding 20,000 in  one county down to zero leads to dirtier air, higher asthma, higher  cancer rates.   If we round down every fracking pad to zero in an area where there  are 100 of them, zero times 100 is still zero. But if we multiply a  small amount of pollutants times 100, that can equal a great deal of  pollutants, not to mention times 1,000, times 10,000. This provides a  more holistic fix to make sure that our air is clean.   My amendment also adds hydrogen sulfide to the Clean Air Act's  Federal List of Hazardous Air Pollutants, which was originally on the  list but was, in my opinion, wrongly removed by Congress. The Clean Air  Act completely exempts hydrogen sulfide from the list, even though  hydrogen sulfide  [[Page H5959]]  already has been scientifically associated as the cause of a number of  health issues, including nausea; vomiting; headaches; and irritation of  the eyes, nose, and throat.   Hydrogen sulfide often may be released from well heads, pumps,  piping, storage tanks, and flaring, which is what we are seeing here.  In fact, 15 to 20 percent of all natural gas wells emit hydrogen  sulfide, even though control technologies are inexpensive and are  already deployed to curtail those hydrogen sulfide emissions.   This amendment ensures our oil and gas industry takes the measures  that we need to avoid the release of hydrogen sulfide into communities  by adding hydrogen sulfide to the List of Hazardous Air Pollutants and  by listing oil and gas wells as a source of hydrogen sulfide.   My amendment simply makes the Clean Air Act work better. You can't  round something significant down to zero, when you have a lot of them  concentrated in a particular area. Of course, there is an impact on air  quality from 1,000 or 10,000 wells that operate in one county.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would like to point out that the Rules  Committee granted the necessary waivers to allow this amendment to be  considered, as they often do, and this amendment was also considered in  a similar bill last session. That is because it is relevant to the  subject matter at hand. The Rules Committee often waives those  requirements.   This bill, as he pointed out, does two different things, both  appearing in different sections of the Clean Air Act.   My amendment will, very simply, make sure that oil and gas operators  play by the same rules as other industries. It doesn't mean that  flaring won't occur. It will, and it does. For those of us who live in  and around fracking, that is a fact of life. What it means is, whereas,  you have the argument the industry has made that if you have one or two  of these sites and you round the profile of emissions down to zero,  just simply doesn't hold water when you have 1,000 or 10,000 active  wells in a very limited area. We can't round that down to zero. It is  simple math. The profile of emissions from that site is greater than  several large power plants, if you have 10,000 wells.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. McNerney    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5  printed in House Report 115-229.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Strike section 6.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 451, the gentleman  from California (Mr. McNerney) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this is an easy amendment to argue because it makes so  much sense.   I am going to ask to strike section 6 of the bill. Let me read that  section: ``No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to  carry out the requirements of this Act and the amendments made by this  Act. Such requirements shall be carried out using amounts otherwise  authorized.''   In other words, they are going to be carried out without any funds.   Mr. Chairman, I am going to move forward here and make the statement  that the administration and House Republicans continue to add to the  EPA's workload while cutting funding and hampering State and local  agencies from providing the resources needed to protect public health.                                time  1615    This is surely unreasonable. In the case of H.R. 806, it will  continue to obstruct the EPA's ability to advance and improve our  Nation's air and water quality. My congressional district has extremely  poor air quality, which has caused a variety of health issues for my  constituents.   This bill does weaken the Clean Air Act. Specifically, it targets the  implementation and enforcement of air pollution health standards. It  also negatively impacts the budget for programs necessary to ensure  that Americans can breathe clean air.   This bill is in stark opposition to the public's overwhelming support  of the Clean Air Act. According to the Center for American Progress,  the Trump administration's EPA budget, which cuts more than $2 billion  from the Agency's budget, shifts the cost of implementing clean air  standards to the States. All of these cuts would be harmful to the  649,000 children and more than 2 million adults with asthma living in  California.   Every State agency that testified before the Energy and Commerce  Subcommittee on the Environment stated  [[Page H5960]]  that more, not less, money is needed and that the Clean Air Act was  working to protect the public's health and safety.   I represent one of the worst air quality regions in the Nation, the  San Joaquin Valley, and yet the San Joaquin Valley air district has  been a leader in utilizing EPA grants and expertise to achieve  emissions reductions from mobile sources, showing that this funding is  beneficial. The valley continues to set emission levels to record lows  and has reduced air pollution by over 80 percent. This data proves that  the Clean Air Act works and creates a better standard of living for all  Americans.   The American Lung Association issued a State of the Air report for  2017 in the State of California. Most of its 28 counties received an F  for air quality. We should be striving for better air quality.   Grants like the EPA's Targeted Air Shed Grants and Diesel Emission  Reductions Act help thousands of agriculture, trucking, and other  businesses acquire low-emitting tractors, trucks, and other equipment.  This funding generates jobs and manufacturing here in the United  States. These Federal funds have a great track record of benefiting our  region, and it is a good investment.   EPA estimates that for every dollar spent on DERA, more than $20 in  health benefits are generated. That is $20 of health benefits for every  dollar invested. All 50 States have these programs.   I also want to highlight how this bill, combined with other efforts  by the Trump administration, will continue to negatively impact air  quality and public health.   Our States have made tremendous progress and a significant investment  toward addressing climate change and public health. However, the Ozone  Standards Implementation Act would take a step backward, destroying  much of the progress, leading to a greater harm to public health and  our economy.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of  my time.
