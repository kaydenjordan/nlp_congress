 Mr. Speaker, imagine if someone came up and introduced  himself to you and said: ``Hi, I am Nick. I am a school shooter.''  According to those who knew him, Nikolas Cruz, the deranged Marjory  Stoneman Douglas High School murderer, was known to do just that.   He attacked a neighbor's car. He shot their animals. He was known to  vandalize and steal property. He made alarming social media posts and  was expelled from school. There were multiple reports to local police  and the FBI, and many other egregious red flags waving long before 17  innocent lives were taken and another 17 wounded on February 14, 2018.  In the 7 years leading up to the shooting, police visited Cruz' home 39  times--incredibly.   Mr. Speaker, the Parkland shooting should have never happened. Every  warning sign was there. They were not missed. Officials just failed to  connect the dots.   I wish that I could say that this failure is unique to Parkland, but,  sadly, it is not. Nearly 20 years ago, high school junior Brooks Brown  came across a website where a fellow classmate threatened to kill him  and his family. Brown's parents alerted the local police, who were  already aware of concerning behaviors from that website's author and  another involved student.   Within only a few months, these same students, Eric Harris and Dylan  Klebold, would murder 13 and wound 24 Columbine High School students in  what has been called the first modern mass shooting. Again, the red  flags were detected, but the appropriate steps were not taken.   This is not a new phenomenon. In 1966, Charles Whitman sought help  from a psychiatrist at the University of Texas for ``overwhelming  periods of hostility,'' including wanting to, ``go up in the tower . .  . and start shooting people.'' Six months later, he would carry out his  sick fantasy exactly as he described: 16 dead and 31 wounded.   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, this list goes on and on: the Pulse  nightclub, the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, the Boston  Marathon, the Washington Navy Yard, the attack on Congresswoman Gabby  Giffords in Tucson, Sandy Hook Elementary School, the Aurora theater,  Virginia Tech, the Norwegian summer camp, West Nickel Mines Amish  school, the Charleston church massacre, the attack on Republican  Members of Congress at baseball practice, and even the YouTube and  Tennessee Waffle House shooting just a few weeks ago.   Mr. Speaker, all of these horrifying events on this nonexhaustive  list have something in common: every single one of these attacks was  carried out after someone close to the killer observed and reported  concerning behavior to the authorities.   The good news is there is something that we can do to fix this. These  killers were under law enforcement's watch, but a proactive threat  management structure, in large part, does not exist in the culture and  fabric of contemporary law enforcement today.   For starters, our local law enforcement is simply undertrained,  understaffed, underequipped, and have no integrated system in place to  effectively identify and address these types of threats. The lack of  information-sharing capabilities between the local, State, and Federal  law enforcement, school officials, mental health professionals, social  services, and other community-based organizations prevent these key  players from implementing an effective intervention strategy directed  at those who are on the pathway to violence.   For decades, there has been an effective system in place, pioneered  by the Secret Service, that has successfully worked to protect our  Presidents and other public figures. I believe that it is time to take  a page out of the Secret Service's playbook and address this critical  national security issue by implementing their established and proven  threat management process for identifying, investigating, evaluating,  and mitigating threats as a critical means to protecting our  communities.   Currently, threat assessment and protective intelligence is used as a  method for gathering and evaluating information about a person who may  have the motive, intention, and capability to mount an attack against  public figures. The Secret Service will gauge a potential threat,  assess the vulnerability of the targeted individuals, and guide an  intervention when necessary. This proactive process leaves no stone  unturned.   This approach is entirely different from what the FBI and local law  enforcement currently use because it compiles information from a  variety of comprehensive sources to build out a threat assessment, and  it works. Since the 1981 attempted assassination of President Reagan,  nobody has even come close.   If this system works to protect the life of the President, elected  officials, foreign dignitaries, and even celebrities, why couldn't this  also work to protect our children and local communities?   Whether it is a shooting, a stabbing, a weaponized vehicle, or a  bombing, mass casualty events are occurring more and more frequently at  home and abroad. It is more important now than ever that we act.   Incorporating threat assessment and protective intelligence into all  facets of law enforcement will save lives. If we can properly recognize  the warnings and act, we can prevent targeted violence. It is time that  we put an end to  [[Page H4207]]  the politicized gun-grabbing rhetoric and start tackling the real root  of this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline).                             National Police Week     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 15 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, May 18, 2018, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
