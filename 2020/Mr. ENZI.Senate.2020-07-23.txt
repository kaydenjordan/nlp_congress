 Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for July 2020. This is my second scorekeeping  report since I filed the deemed budget resolution for fiscal year 2021  on May 4, 2020, as required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019,  BBA19. The report compares current-law levels of spending and revenues  with the amounts agreed to in BBA19. In the Senate, this information is  used to determine whether budgetary points of order lie against pending  legislation. The Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the  Congressional Budget Office prepared this report pursuant to section  308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act. The information included in  this report is current through July 17, 2020.   Since I filed the last scorekeeping report on June 4, 2020, three  measures with significant enforceable budgetary effects have been  enacted. Two of those measures, the Paycheck Protection Program  Flexibility Act of 2020, P.L. 116-142, and the Emergency Aid for  Returning Americans Affected by Coronavirus Act, P.L. 116-148, were  designated as emergencies by Congress and are not subject to budgetary  enforcement. The third measure, the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, P.L. 116- 149, increased both direct spending and revenues due to its imposed  sanctions regime. Over the fiscal year 2021-2030 period, P.L. 116-149  would increase spending by $21 million and revenues by $28 million for  a total deficit reduction of $7 million.   Budget Committee Republican staff prepared Tables A-G.   Table A provides the amount by which each Senate authorizing  committee exceeds or falls below its allocations for budget authority  and outlays under the fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021 deemed  budget resolutions. This information is used for enforcing committee  allocations pursuant to section 302 of the CBA. Committee compliance  with allocation remains consistent with last month's report with the  exception of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Passage  of the Hong Kong Autonomy Act led to spending in excess of that  committee's allowable levels over the fiscal year 2021-2025 and fiscal  year 2021-2030 periods by $4 million and $21 million, respectively.  Spending in this bill is largely due to increased receipts to the  United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund that are then  spent without further appropriation.   Tables B and C provide the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. The tables show  that the Appropriations Committee is compliant with spending limits for  fiscal years 2020 and 2021. The figures included in Table C reflect  advanced and permanent appropriations that have already been enacted  but will become available for obligation in fiscal year 2021.   Tables D and E display figures related to limits on the use of  changes in mandatory programs, CHlMPs, in appropriations bills. These  $15 billion limits, found in the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution for  fiscal year 2020 and section 207 of BBA19 for fiscal year 2021,  currently show the Appropriations Committee in compliance.   Tables F and G provide the amount of budget authority enacted for  2020 and 2021, respectively, that have been designated as either for an  emergency or for overseas contingency operations, OCO, pursuant to  section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit  Control Act of 1985, as amended. Funding that receives either of these  designations results in cap adjustments to enforceable discretionary  spending limits. There is no limit on either emergency or OCO spending;  however, any Senator may challenge the designation with a point of  order to strike the designation on the floor.   In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I  [[Page S4462]]  am submitting CBO tables which I will use to enforce budget totals  approved by Congress.   Because legislation can still be enacted that have an effect on  fiscal year 2020, CBO provided spending and revenue reports for both  fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021. This information is used to  enforce aggregate spending levels in budget resolutions under CBA  section 311. CBO's estimates show that current levels of spending for  fiscal year 2020 exceed amounts in last year's budget resolution by  $68.6 billion in budget authority and $55.1 billion in outlays--2020,  Tables 1-2. Revenues are $114.8 billion below the revenue floor. As  well, Social Security outlays are at levels assumed for 2020, while  Social Security revenues are $16 million above levels assumed in  budget.   For fiscal year 2021, the current law levels are $1,180.0 billion and  $667.8 billion in budget authority and outlays, respectively, below  allowable levels--2021, Tables 1-2. This spending room will be spent  down as regular appropriations bills are enacted for fiscal year 2021.  Revenues and Social Security levels are at the levels assumed by the  fiscal year 2021 deemed budget for this budget year. Over the fiscal  year 2021-2025 and fiscal year 2021-2030 period, revenues are $5  million and $28 million, respectively, greater than revenue levels  assumed in the deemed budget resolution. These revenue increases are  due to the enactment of the Hong Kong Autonomy Act earlier this month.   CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule (2021, Table 3). This rule is enforced under  section 4106 of the 2018 budget resolution. The Senate PAYGO scorecard  currently shows an enacted deficit decrease of $1 million over the  fiscal year 2020-2025 period and $7 million over the fiscal year 2020- 2030 period due to passage of the Hong Kong Autonomy Act. The budgetary  effects of P.L. 116-142 and P.L. 116-148 are not included in this table  due to the emergency designations included in the acts based on  authorities included in section 4112 of the fiscal year 2018  congressional budget resolution, H. Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress.   This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on May  4, 2020. Since that filing, one point of order was raised. On June 15,  2020, I raised a PAYGO point of order against S. Amdt. 1617, the Great  American Outdoors Act, which CBO estimated as increasing the on-budget  deficit by more than $17 billion over the fiscal year 2020-2030 period.  This point of order was waived by the Senate by a vote of 68-30.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in  the Record.   There being no ojbection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   TABLE A.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE                    (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS                         [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   2020      2021    2021-2025  2021-2030 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and  Forestry     Budget Authority..........    10,430         0          0          0     Outlays...................    10,430         0          0          0 Armed Services     Budget Authority..........        32         0          0          0     Outlays...................        35         0          0          0 Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs     Budget Authority..........       169         0          4         21     Outlays...................       169         0          4         21 Commerce, Science, and  Transportation     Budget Authority..........         7         0          0          0     Outlays...................         7         0          0          0 Energy and Natural Resources     Budget Authority..........         0         0          0          0     Outlays...................         0         0          0          0 Environment and Public Works     Budget Authority..........     8,058         0          0          0     Outlays...................       415         0          0          0 Finance     Budget Authority..........    50,913         0          0          0     Outlays...................    49,452         0          0          0 Foreign Relations     Budget Authority..........         2         0          0          0     Outlays...................        37         0          0          0 Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs     Budget Authority..........         0         0          0          0     Outlays...................         0         0          0          0 Judiciary     Budget Authority..........        12         0          0          0     Outlays...................        12         0          0          0 Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions     Budget Authority..........      -720         0          0          0     Outlays...................      -997         0          0          0 Rules and Administration     Budget Authority..........         0         0          0          0     Outlays...................         0         0          0          0 Intelligence     Budget Authority..........         0         0          0          0     Outlays...................         0         0          0          0 Veterans' Affairs     Budget Authority..........         0         0          0          0     Outlays...................         0         0          0          0 Indian Affairs     Budget Authority..........         0         0          0          0     Outlays...................         0         0          0          0 Small Business     Budget Authority..........         0         0          0          0     Outlays...................         0         0          0          0                                -----------------------------------------     Total         Budget Authority......    68,903         0          4         21         Outlays...............    59,560         0          4         21 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ This table is current through July 17, 2020.

Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington,           DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2020 budget and is       current through July 17, 2020. This report is submitted under       section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional       Budget Act, as amended.        The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other       budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on       September 9, 2019, pursuant to section 204 of the Bipartisan       Budget Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-37).        Since our last letter dated June 4, 2020, the Congress has       cleared and the President has signed the following       legislation that has significant effects on budget authority,       outlays, and revenues in fiscal year 2020:        Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 (Public       Law 116-142); and        Emergency Aid for Returning Americans Affected by       Coronavirus Act (Public Law 116-148).            Sincerely,                                                 Phillip L. Swagel,                                                          Director.        Enclosure.

Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include   $567 million in budget authority and $798 million in estimated outlays. b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the aggregate spending   and revenue levels for 2020 published in the Congressional Record on September 9, 2019, by the Chairman of the   Senate Committee on the Budget pursuant to section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (P.L. 116-37) do   not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts.

Hon. Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2021 budget and is       current through July 17, 2020.
