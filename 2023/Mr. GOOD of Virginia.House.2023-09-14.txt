 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary life of service of 20-year-old Louisa County EMS and  firefighter Mia Ethridge.   Mia was fatally injured in an accident back in July while responding  to a call for help. She tragically succumbed to those injuries on  September 1, 2023.   Firefighter Ethridge leaves behind a great legacy of passionately  serving her community and will be remembered by many for her kind and  welcoming personality.   Stafford Fire Captain Gustavo Leite, who trained Ethridge, described  her by saying: ``She was always there. An incredible young lady with  leadership, she had the heart and the spirit.''   I offer my sincerest condolences to the family, friends, and  community, and my prayers remain with them as they grieve the loss of  her life.   In 2 Corinthians, Chapter 1, Paul writes: ``Praise be to God and  Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God  of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles.''   May her family find comfort in this as they mourn her passing and  remember her life.   It is an honor to recognize the exemplary public servant that Mia  Ethridge was and the selfless devotion she had to helping others.                        Path Forward on Appropriations     Mr. Speaker, the appropriations path forward is  simple, but it requires strong leadership from the Speaker, who must,  one, persuade the Republican Conference to support the return to the  2022 spending levels that he committed to in order to ascend to the  position in January and for which 217 Republicans voted in April; two,  pass our 12 appropriations bills out of the House at the committed 2022  levels, implementing the Republican policy priorities for which we  campaigned and the American people entrusted us with the majority back  in November; three, the passage of those bills represents a good-faith  effort to appropriately fund the government and avoid or quickly end  any pause in affected nonessential spending, and then it is the  responsibility of the Senate to avoid another Schumer shutdown; and,  four, ensure strong, principled, and courageous conservatives are  included on the conference committee to negotiate with the Senate for  the best possible outcome for the American people.   The American people are counting on us. They have entrusted us with  the majority as we ran on returning fiscal sanity to this House and  implementing Republican priorities that would reverse the harms under  which the American people are suffering perpetrated by the Biden  administration.                            ____________________
