 Madam Speaker, every August, I  participate in a bus tour of South Carolina's Second District with my  wife, Roxanne, and dedicated staff from Washington and district  offices.   I especially appreciate scheduler Stephanie Pendarvis for  successfully coordinating her first bus tour in the tradition of Emily  Saleeby.   Our trip consisted of over 20 stops across 5 counties in the  district. It was humbling and inspiring to meet with constituents at  small businesses, schools, chambers of commerce, and manufacturers.   Many of the stops I visited were rapidly growing, including Charter  NEX Films of Columbia, a world leader in high-performance specialty  films, who plan to add 100 more jobs, along with Swiss Krono of  Barnwell, who plan to add 105 jobs. In addition, the Orangeburg County/ City Industrial Park has begun construction to welcome new businesses  and jobs.   I appreciate the Irmo Chamber of Commerce hosting a town hall on the  tour. I am grateful to be accessible and accountable to constituents.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
