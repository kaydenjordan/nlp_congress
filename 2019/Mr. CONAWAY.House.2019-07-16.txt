 Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, before I get to my objections to the  amendment, I want to congratulate the chairman, the majority members of  the committee, as well as the majority staff for the great work they  did in helping us bring a fully bipartisan bill to the floor, which I  fully intend to support.   They also helped us navigate the intricacies of the Rules Committee  so that what we are debating tonight, with the amendments that were put  forward, we will be able to support this bill on the floor tomorrow or  whenever they decide to bring it up. I thank the chairman for the good  work that they put into it.   Madam Chair, I do, though, rise in opposition to this amendment. For  the past several years, the House Intelligence Committee has spent a  significant amount of time overseeing the intelligence community's  ongoing efforts to counter foreign malign influence targeting the  United States. Although Russia gains significant and necessary  attention given the events of 2016, the committee is also concerned  about Chinese, Iranian, and other foreign powers that have designs on  sowing discord in the United States or covertly influencing the  American populace.   The amendment today would establish a foreign threat response center  within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. While I  believe my colleague from Massachusetts offers this amendment with the  best of intentions, it is clearly redundant to existing efforts and  creates an additional and potentially unnecessary bureaucracy within an  organization that may not be best suited to take the lead on these  actions.   This issue is not new. Last Congress, we worked with the gentleman  from Massachusetts in adding a report to the fiscal 2018 and 2019 IAAs  that would examine the necessity of a foreign malign influence response  center. This report remains in the bill, given that it is a 3-year  bill.  [[Page H5898]]    I am not convinced of the necessity of such a center, given the  ongoing efforts by our intelligence community to address this problem.  However, even assuming its necessity, I am concerned that the ODNI may  not be the best place for such a center. Based on our ongoing oversight  efforts, we know that the interagency is taking the threat of foreign  malign influences very seriously. Given the significant  counterintelligence impact to the homeland, it may make more sense to  house such an entity within the FBI.   I don't believe in putting the cart before the horse. It is important  for us to collect all the necessary information in order for Congress  to make an informed decision after significant debate on the merits of  such a center and whether the ODNI is the right home for it. This  debate should happen within the Intelligence Committee. To date, that  debate has not occurred.   This amendment would also set up a board to oversee the work of the  Foreign Intelligence Center, which would then be overseen by the House  and Senate Intelligence Committees. Again, a redundancy that is, in my  estimation, not necessary.   Madam Chair, based on these foregoing reasons, I will oppose the  gentleman's amendment and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to vote against it, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2030     Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I would like to reiterate that the establishment of such  a center should be debated properly within the House Intelligence  Committee. It should also be informed by the report that the gentleman  was successful in adding to the fiscal 2018 and 2019 Intelligence  Authorization Acts, and such debate should focus on the merits of the  center, given existing efforts, as well as whether or not the ODNI  should house the center.   Until that report is finished, and then the debate happens, I would  urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
