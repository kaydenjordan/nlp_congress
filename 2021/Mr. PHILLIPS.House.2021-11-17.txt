 Madam Speaker, I love freedom. I love George  Washington. I keep this book on my desk, ``George Washington's Rules of  Civility and Decent Behaviour.'' I encourage every colleague in this  body--every one of us--to keep this on your desk and refer to it.   I have heard everything talked about today--inflation, Afghanistan,  schools--except the issue we are here for: a censure of a Member of  Congress who issued a despicable video showing the killing of a fellow  Member of Congress.   Worst of all, most despicable of all, the object of the censure said  it was to attract a new generation. Think about that: to attract a new  generation of Americans.   We have to do better, my friends. Come on.   To my friend from Virginia who said, if Democrats had done this, what  would we do? Rest assured, my friends, every one of you, we would do  the same thing because I will never ever allow a fellow Member of  Congress to threaten or distribute a video showing the killing of one  of us, let alone another American.
