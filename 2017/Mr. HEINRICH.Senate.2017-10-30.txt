 Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent due to a family  issue for rollcall votes Nos. 250, 251, and 252. Had I been present, I  would have voted yea on No. 250, cloture on Palk; yea on No. 251,  confirmation on Palk; and yea on No. 252, cloture on McFadden.                            ____________________
