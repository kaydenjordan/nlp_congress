 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Maine  Development Foundation, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary. MDF  is a nonpartisan membership organization that advances sustainable,  long-term economic growth for the State of Maine. MDF works to empower  leaders, strengthen communities, and shape public policy through  trusted economic research.   MDF was created by State statute in 1978 and now operates statewide  across all economic sectors. MDF's 250 members represent private  companies, educational institutions, municipalities, government  agencies, and nonprofit organizations. The MDF board of directors is  made up of no less than 15 members who are elected each year. MDF  operates a number of programs, aimed at increasing economic  opportunities in Maine, including Leadership Maine, FOR/MAINE, Maine  Downtown Center, the Maine Economic Growth Council, the Policy Leaders  Academy, and more.   Leadership Maine, a cornerstone program of MDF, is a yearlong  experience that prepares leaders across the State to help shape Maine's  changing economy. This program has been operating for 25 years and now  boasts over 1,000 alumni. These leaders are each creating an economy  driven by educated, innovative, and engaged individuals. Participants  learn firsthand about important issues facing the State through an  intensive program that gives exclusive access to key community and  business leaders. Each class is comprised of 35-45 leaders from across  the State, from a cross section of the economy. All participants share  a commitment to make Maine a better place to live and to engage in  public service in new ways.   MDF also provides support and staffing for the Maine Economic Growth  Council, a legislatively chartered group that annually prepares the  Measures of Growth report. This snapshot of the Maine economy over a  range of sectors is instructive to policymakers finding the  intersection of economy, community, and environment in securing a high  quality of life for Mainers.   MDF played a critical role in the work and success to date of the  Economic Development Assessment Team, EDAT, a Federal effort funded by  the Economic Development Administration to support job growth and  economic development in Maine's rural communities. Under MDF's  guidance, the EDAT helped fund and establish the Forest Opportunity  Roadmap Maine Initiative, a unique collaboration between industry,  communities, government, education, and nonprofit organizations,  working together to strengthen Maine's forest economy. With MDF's  leadership, FOR/Maine developed a comprehensive action plan and  strategy to support a thriving, innovative, and diverse industry that  provides good jobs in vibrant rural communities for generations to  come.   I am proud to recognize the great work of Maine Development  Foundation over the last 40 years, and I look forward to what the  future holds. I want to thank them for all their work to improve their  community and the State of Maine--your work makes Maine such a special  place to call home.                            ____________________
