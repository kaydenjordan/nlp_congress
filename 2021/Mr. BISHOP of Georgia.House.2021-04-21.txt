 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Shakespeare wrote: All the world is a stage. And all the men and  women, merely players. Each has his entrance and his exit. One man in  his time may play many parts.   So it was with our beloved Alcee Hastings. He was a son, father,  grandfather, husband, civil rights activist, attorney, judge, Member of  Congress, international parliamentarian, colleague, my brother in Kappa  Alpha Psi fraternity, a faithful friend, and a fearless foe.   His performance in each of these roles was always par excellence. His  was a life well-lived. He was authentic, brutally frank, but always a  powerful advocate for marginalized humanity. He did so much for so many  for so long. We will miss him, but the world is a better place because  of the life of Alcee Lamar Hastings.   My wife, Vivian, and I send our heartfelt condolences to his wife,  Patricia, his other family, his staff, and all who mourn his loss.                                time  1915
