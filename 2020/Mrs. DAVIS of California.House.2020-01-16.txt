 Mr. Speaker, when a college makes promises  to recruit students, we expect those promises to be met. Yet time after  time we see colleges closing or losing accreditation, leaving their  students with worthless degrees.   There are currently 240,000 defrauded students waiting for loan  relief, and more than 40,000 of these students are from my home State  of California. These defrauded student borrowers have been needlessly  waiting--many for over a year--to obtain this student loan relief.   The most inexcusable part of this situation is that the Department of  Education, during all this time, could have brought relief to these  students using the original borrower defense rule.   Instead, this administration has decided to create an entirely  worthless rule that, firstly, does almost nothing to help borrowers.  Further, it provides clear preference to the very sham colleges that  are compromising the integrity and the purpose of the original borrower  defense rule.   This recent rule is sending a message to the American public that any  scammer can open up a school, collect money, defraud our students, and  dodge any consequences.   It is outrageous to learn about the hundreds of servicemen and -women  who have tried to improve their professional standings by enrolling in  one of these programs only to end up with a pointless credential and a  lot of unconscionable debt. In these tragic cases, many have not only  expended their GI Bill funding for good but have also lost years of  their lives working hard and studying to gain these futile degrees.   The original borrower defense rule was an honest attempt to address  these grievances and give students their dignity back. Rather, we have  here today a new rule that makes it nearly impossible for students to  truly regain what has been lost due to this large-scale con job.   Mr. Speaker, why are we making it harder for our defrauded students  to recover their lives?   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today is the first step toward  blocking these flawed and misguided changes to the borrower defense  rule from taking effect, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this resolution.                                time  0930
