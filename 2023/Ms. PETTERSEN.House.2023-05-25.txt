 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment,  which would require a certification from the Secretary of the  Department of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General that  this legislation would reduce opioid overdose deaths.   The reason why this is so critical is because we are facing a public  health crisis, and it deserves a public health response.   The current legislation is incredibly problematic for the very  harmful mandatory minimum sentences that would be enacted and would be  very hard to actually address and change in the future.   This is deeply personal for me. Like so many Americans, my mom has  struggled with an opioid addiction. When I was just 6 years old, she  hurt her back, and she came home with bottles and bottles of opioids.   Unfortunately, after her back healed, my mom found herself physically  addicted to opioids. Like so many Americans, she was cut off of her  prescription without access to treatment. My mom said that you fear  nothing more than withdrawal, even death.   Like so many people who struggle with addiction who don't have access  to treatment, she turned to using heroin to stay well.   Ultimately, fentanyl came into the supply chain. It started coming in  in 2016. We saw it hit the coasts first and make its way into Colorado.  Now we have seen it completely take over the drug supply chain.   I know firsthand how absolutely devastating this drug can be for  families. My mom overdosed 20 times that year.   In my fight to keep her alive, I saw firsthand how broken the system  was. I am one of the lucky ones because I was in a position, as a State  legislator, where I could advocate for my mom to get her the help that  she needed.   After being churned in and out of ERs, my mom ultimately was able to  recover. She has now been in recovery for 5\1/2\ years and is an  example of what is possible when we give people the help that they  need.   I absolutely want the person who was my mom's dealer, who would show  up to the hospital and put heroin mixed with fentanyl in her IV, I want  that person to go to jail for a very long time.   If my mom had a mandatory jail sentence, that would have been a death  sentence for her and for far too many people out there.   We are facing a third wave of the opioid epidemic. It has killed more  people than all of the world wars combined.   It is important that we address this, that it is an all-hands-on-deck  to address it at every level, including additional screening at the  ports and the border; additional screening for mail, where we know it  is coming in; public awareness campaigns about the dangers of taking  just one pill with kids who are buying it from social media companies,  unknowingly, and dying from an overdose; accountability with these  social media companies on how we are going to work together to ensure  that kids are not able to buy this on their platforms; increasing  access to residential treatment and recovery services like my mom had  that are far too often not available for those who are struggling with  a brain disease.   Mr. Chair, I absolutely care deeply about this issue. I look forward  to working with all of my colleagues on it, but this is not the right  answer, and that is why this amendment is so important. I ask for your  support, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0930     Mr. Chair, this is important because if we are trying  to  [[Page H2605]]  solve the overdose crisis in our country, let's make sure that this  legislation is actually supported in doing that and go through the  necessary process.   We know from our history in the United States that putting people in  jail, mandatory minimum sentences, has devastating consequences. This  is a public health crisis. We need to come together to address it like  that. We need to go after the cartels. We need to go after the dealers.  We need to make sure that we are supporting people who are struggling  with addiction. I ask for your support.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
