 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Holly Vega, a  resident of my district, who was recently named the 2019 Armed Forces  Insurance Military Spouse of the Year.   Military spouses are unsung heroes that are responsible for securing  the homestead and supporting our servicemembers. And for Holly's  husband, Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega, she is a gift to  their family and to their community.   Holly has been recognized for her generosity, her passion, and her  heart for philanthropy, and for empowering other military spouses  through community service opportunities and volunteerism. Her own  selfless service has extended to the South Tampa Chamber of Commerce,  Military Hearts Matter, and the Girl Scouts.   I am so grateful for the thousands of spouses like Holly whose  sacrifices and stresses are sometimes overshadowed, but whose  contributions to our national defense and our communities are  priceless.   I thank you, Holly, for your passion and your drive to give to those  in need. You indeed are a gift to many, and I salute you.                            ____________________
