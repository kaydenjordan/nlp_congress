 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Cole for the dignity  and respect that he shows each of his colleagues on the Rules  Committee. It is a great honor to be debating this rule with him this  afternoon.   I must, however, rise in opposition to the rule because we only have  six legislative days left to fund the government, and we are  considering only one of the eleven bills that we must pass to fully  fund our Federal Government.   I completely agree with our chair that our country is a beacon of  hope and that we must, indeed, fund our military in the way that they  need in order to continue to provide that beacon of hope and that  strength that we must communicate both to our allies and those who  would do us harm.   Indeed, America is facing significant security threats from a  rampaging Russia, the Chinese Communist Party, and a soon-to-be nuclear  North Korea. Instead of uniting us, however, against those very real  threats, extreme MAGA Republicans are putting Americans at war with  each other with this divisive Defense appropriations bill.   Extreme MAGA Republicans are weakening our military readiness. In the  Senate, Republicans are refusing to allow votes on flag officers, so we  don't have the generals, admirals, and top military officers we need to  lead our troops. Here in the House, instead of passing what should be  and has historically been a bipartisan Defense appropriations bill,  extreme Republicans are inserting the kitchen sink of culture war  issues that we have seen too often.   Indeed, when we talk about women, this bill is another step in their  march toward a national abortion ban. If this bill is enacted, a  servicewoman in a State with a total abortion ban that doesn't have  exceptions for rape would not be able to take leave and get help to  travel to a place like New Mexico where a woman's right to receive the  full access to reproductive healthcare is honored. Fourteen States have  a total ban on abortion. In each of those 14 States, we will find  servicewomen who are honorably serving our Nation.   In addition, this bill sets up minorities and our servicemembers who  are gay, lesbian, and all individuals of the LGBTQ community to  harassment.   At a moment when we know that some of our bases are under threat from  climate change, this bill cuts $714 million from climate resiliency  programs. I have been to our bases in the Pacific islands, and I  recognize that we must have climate resilience if we don't want our  bases to be under water. By giving up on preparing for climate  resiliency, we are giving up a strategic military advantage that we  should take advantage of.                                time  1230    Instead of focusing on how we can improve recruitment from our  diverse communities in America when we are failing to meet our  recruitment goals, this appropriation prohibits funding for diversity,  equity, inclusion, and accessibility.   We know that people of color answer the call to service at  disproportionately higher rates, and those numbers are not reflected in  military leadership. This bill tells my Latino and Native American  communities they are not valued.   Congressman Neguse asked the Defense Subcommittee chair why he would  cut funding for the chief diversity officer, a position that he had  voted to create. The chair responded that it was the best way to get  attention.   That is how we legislate now, to get attention?   Last week, in the Rules Committee, we tried to remedy some of these  awful and unnecessary riders. Republicans voted our amendments down.   All of these divisive riders harm our military readiness and hurt our  servicemembers, servicemembers who put their lives on the line to  protect us. It is never enough to just thank our servicemembers for  their service. We need  [[Page H4394]]  to provide them with the benefits, quality of life, and respect that  all of them deserve.   These extreme provisions are a trend this year, however. Perhaps that  is the reason we have passed only one appropriations bill under  Republican leadership in the House this year.   This Defense appropriations bill is the only one that we appear to be  considering today. We are not considering a short-term funding package  to ensure our government doesn't shut down. We are not considering  something to cover all the appropriations bills.   Today, we are considering the Defense appropriations bill, and it  should be focused solely on national security. It should be about  making sure our Nation has the best and brightest force. It should be  about serving all the individuals who protect us.   We should be unified in making sure our servicemembers have the  resources they need and the respect they deserve. Instead, this bill  attacks access to reproductive healthcare for our servicewomen and  their families. It devalues the minorities, the Latinos, Black  Americans, Native Americans, who serve and are looking for us to help  them address the racism that still exists, unfortunately.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am also thinking about last week's committee hearing  and this discussion about the history of where we were with regard to  the appropriations process. I think there is a very different mood this  year than we had in the last cycle, and that is the fact that Democrats  have never called to shut it down. That is exactly what we are hearing  from Republicans on the other side of the aisle.   We never took that position. We were always trying to work it out,  not shut it down. Even though we might not have passed all the bills by  September 30, we were working across the aisle with our colleagues,  working with the Senate on the other side, so we never had a shutdown.  What we had was constant movement toward an agreement.   Indeed, the passed appropriations bills passed with overwhelming  bipartisan support, both in the Senate and the House. We had hundreds  of Republicans voting with the Democrats to pass the last  appropriations bills.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), the ranking member of the Committee on Rules and my  good friend, who I hold in high regard.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As we just noted, the chair of the committee has once again showed  both his dignity and respect to his colleagues.   I do want to point out that you are right, I did forget about that  72-hour shutdown because it was very brief, and I agree with you, it is  a stupid thing to do. No, I am sorry, I think you said it is a dumb  thing to do, and it is because it causes so much pain for the people  back home. They expect us to do our job, and the primary thing we are  supposed to do is fund our government because it is not just the really  hardworking employees who keep our airplanes flying in the air, who  make sure that our food is inspected so we don't get sick, it is also  the teachers in our schools who receive Title I funding in New Mexico.   So many of my schools receive Title I funding. Those are the schools  that have the fewest resources, so the Federal Government helps them  out to make sure all our children, wherever they live, can get a good  education. Those are the things that will be lost if we shut down the  Federal Government.   I point out that in contrast to the 72 hours, in 1995 under  Republican leadership, 21 days the government was shut down; in 2013  the government was shut down for 16 days; and then in 2018 they shut it  down for 35 days. This is a refrain we hear over and over again. It  happens under House Republican leadership so often as we just saw.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Salinas), a wonderful Member of our freshman class this year.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The concern that we have with the bill with regards to a woman's  right to be able to determine for herself in conversation with her own  faith, her own family, and her own doctors what kind of reproductive  healthcare she wants access to is the fact that this bill would prevent  servicewomen and their families from taking paid leave or traveling to  obtain an abortion or related services if those services are not  provided where she is assigned.   Remember, servicewomen don't get to choose where they live and where  they work. There have already been multiple legal opinions that using  paid leave and traveling and getting assistance to get to a State where  you can get medical care does not violate the Hyde amendment.   Indeed, the Hyde amendment would allow you to get that kind of care  if you were raped. Well, guess what? In 14 States if you were raped,  you cannot get that care. That would violate the Hyde amendment in a  sense when you cannot get access to it.   Last week in the Rules Committee, Representative McCollum told the  story of a woman in Texas who was told by her doctor that she would not  perform a surgical procedure to remove a dead fetus because of the  State's abortion ban. That servicewoman did not have the options she  was entitled to.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the Record the  2023 New York Times article: ``As Abortion Laws Drive Obstetricians  From Red States, Maternity Care Suffers.''    Because what has changed is that now we have 14  States that have total bans on abortion, so we must do more to honor  our commitment to our servicewomen.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. McClellan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), our ranking member on the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I think what Americans know is that for too long, Republicans have  been protecting the rich and the corporations who do not pay their  taxes. When we start talking about spending, we need to talk about what  we are spending that money for.   Democrats are investing in rural America. They are investing in our  children. They are investing in our infrastructure. What are  Republicans doing? Yes, they are adding to that deficit. Republicans  put $2 trillion on that credit card in tax cuts for the rich.   The leader they worship, Donald Trump, put $7.5 trillion onto that  deficit. The very first bill they brought to the floor of this  Congress, what did it add? $114 billion to that cut.   That is what we need to talk about, not just how they want to cut  investments and important things like heating for our families who need  it, our seniors, and our veterans. What are they doing? They are trying  to make sure that they don't have to tax the rich and wealthy  corporations. Many, as we heard last night, don't pay anything in  taxes.   Yes, we do want to talk about Social Security. I am so glad the chair  brought this up because, Mr. Speaker, Republicans often swear that they  are not going to cut Social Security and Medicare. Last night, when we  met on the continuing resolution, there is an 8 percent cut across the  board for everything but defense and veterans. Their continuing  resolution has a 66 percent cut to heating assistance. They have said  border security is their top priority, but the very CR we are scheduled  to consider cuts funding for DHS by over 8 percent.    While they claim they won't cut Social Security and Medicare, their  own continuing resolution, the language in the bill itself,  demonstrates that nothing is sacred to them.   I am going to offer my friends, my dear friends, a chance to show the  American people that they are serious about preserving Social Security  and Medicare.   I urge you all to join us in defeating the previous question. If we  defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to  provide for consideration of a resolution which plainly states that the  people's House won't cut a single cent from these crucial programs that  so many of my constituents, so many of your constituents, rely on.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Mullin) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I think what we need to do is look at this appropriations bill, look  at where we are in our discussions about funding the government and  recognize that nothing exists in a vacuum.   Last night, as we were talking about the Committee on Appropriations,  we were talking about the extreme cuts that are being made, and we know  that our military, when they sort of show up at our bases, they are not  showing up at a base that is not connected to the rest of the places  they live in.   In Clovis, New Mexico, where we have Cannon Air Force Base, and in  Alamogordo, where we have an Air Force base, those communities are  connected, and we need to recognize that the other bills that they are  looking at are going to cut funding in a way that is going to hurt our  readiness.   The Agriculture appropriations bill is a good opportunity to talk  about this. The bill that they have brought forward would fund world  development programs, right? Nope. That is going to get cut. It would  also cut nutrition to women, infants, and children. It would cut the  funding we need for our ranchers and farmers.   Indeed, the cuts that they are proposing would be $8 billion in cuts,  in the Agriculture appropriations bill. This would bring the funding  level for the Agriculture appropriations bill to a level not seen since  2007.   The bill would cut broadband programs by 23 percent. It would hurt  something that is incredibly important to my district, which are rural  electric co-ops that serve 268,403 residents. Well, those rural  electric co-ops, they serve people throughout our districts, and they  serve our military bases. We must fight these kinds of threats.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, we cannot talk about readiness; we cannot  talk about what we need to do in this country to support our military  if we don't talk about our servicemembers and what we must do to  protect them and to respect them, because they are protecting us.   So when we are talking about our servicewomen, we must remember the  number of servicewomen who are serving. It is about 20 percent right  now, and the number of women who are serving in those 14 States which  have a total ban on abortion is significant. It is 80,000 women--80,000  women, who, if something happens to them like what Representative  McCollum discussed, they could die of sepsis.   For those of us who have given birth, for those of us who have had to  make really difficult decisions about our health and how we are going  to deal with the complications of pregnancy, we feel it viscerally,  because we know that it is such a wonderful thing to give birth, but it  is such a dangerous thing to be pregnant.   And what they would do to our servicewomen is deny them the ability  to  [[Page H4401]]  go to a State like New Mexico when they want reproductive healthcare  services.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
