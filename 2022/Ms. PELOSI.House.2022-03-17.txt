 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  congratulate him on his leadership. The connection between human rights  and economics is a connection that many of us have seen for a while.  When it comes to some countries, for example China, when I was trying  to get an adjustment in trade with China based on human rights, I was  told, Oh, blah, blah, blah. But I said then and I say now of Russia, if  we do not speak out for human rights because of commercial interests,  we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights in any small  country in the world if these big countries are left off the hook.   Madam Speaker, as we convene today, war rages in Ukraine. Yesterday,  the Congress had the great honor and privilege of receiving a virtual  address by President Zelenskyy, whose heroic leadership has rallied his  nation and inspired the world. Our Members were very moved by his  powerful remarks as well as the heart-wrenching footage he shared  showing the terror and brutality which Putin has unleashed in Ukraine,  including committing war crimes against children.   So it is with great respect for President Zelenskyy's leadership and  with unwavering support for the people of Ukraine that the House today  takes another strong step to punish Russia for its war crimes.   It is my hope that this legislation receives strong bipartisan  support, and I thank the chairman, Mr. Neal, and the ranking member,  Mr. Brady, for working together to make that a reality because it is a  recognition that is worthy of the valor and courage of the people of  Ukraine.   The unimaginable courage, resilience, and determination of the  Ukrainian people has been on full display, as they fight to not only  protect their homeland but to defend democracy itself. The assault that  Putin is making on Ukraine is an assault on democracy writ large. He is  so cowardly and so insecure; he can't stand to see a democracy across  the way from Russia for fear that the Russian people will see a better  way instead of his autocracy. And so the Ukrainians are fighting for  democracy writ large.   Yet, tragically, Putin has repeatedly responded by accelerating  brutality, indiscriminately bombing major cities, attacking civilians  attempting to evacuate the violence, and even murdering mothers and  babies in a maternity hospital.   Russia's cruel and unprovoked invasion has already forced nearly 3  million Ukrainians to flee their homes, creating what the United  Nations has called the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since  World War II.   Because Putin shows no sign of ceasing his horrible aggression, the  Congress today will take another step, in lockstep with the Biden  administration and many of our allies, to tighten our stranglehold on  the Russian economy.   The legislation the House will pass today represents an intense  action to further isolate Russia and decimate its economy. Madam  Speaker, I thank Mr. Brady and Mr. Neal for giving us this opportunity.  [[Page H3807]]    With this bill, the United States will suspend permanent normal trade  relations with Russia, which means they will no longer enjoy  preferential tariff treatment, take steps to review Russia's access to  the World Trade Organization, and reauthorize and strengthen the Global  Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, so that we can impose even  further individual sanctions.   In doing so, we will make it as difficult as possible for Russia to  do business with the United States and our allies, and we will also  suspend normal trade relations with Belarus for its shameful complicity  in Russia's aggression.   Congress and the country salute Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal  and Ranking Member Kevin Brady, who led the way to steer this  legislation to the floor and garner strong bipartisan support for its  passage. I would also like to thank Congressman Lloyd Doggett and  Congressman Earl Blumenauer for their relentless leadership in showing  that the House was ready with this legislation so we could act quickly  and decisively and have the improving touches that Mr. Brady and Mr.  Neal added to it.   The legislation we pass today builds on swift, devastating sanctions  already being imposed on Russia by America and our allies. We take this  step with extraordinary unity not only within Congress on a bipartisan,  bicameral basis, but also between the Congress and the administration.                                time  1430    And we do so with historic coordination with our neighbors abroad, as  the members of the G7 and European Union have all agreed to revoke  most-favored-nation status from Russia.   On behalf of the Congress, I salute President Biden for unifying our  allies so that we could move together with this crushing blow. And we  will continue working together to make Putin accountable for his  despicable crimes as he violates the sovereignty and territorial  integrity of Ukraine.   What Putin is doing in Ukraine, bombing civilians, targeting  children, is outside, Madam Speaker, the circle of civilized human  behavior. He is committing war crimes and he must be held accountable.   Madam Speaker, I urge a strong, bipartisan ``aye'' vote.
