 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  Tom Lowry of Taylorville, my friend, who passed away last Sunday.   In 1971, Tom opened a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in our  hometown and operated it until he retired in 2015. Tom will be  remembered in the community for his dedication to running the KFC and  making everyone who walked through the door feel like family.   For a long time, he was also on the board of directors at First  National Bank.   But I am going to remember Tom the most because he was my neighbor.  After every single snowfall, since I lived right by him, and all of us  on the same street, we would never have to wake up to an unplowed  driveway because that is just what Tom did.   I am going to miss seeing Tom with his dog on his golf cart rolling  down our street, but he is also going to be mostly remembered for the  love of his kids and grandkids.   His passing is a loss for Taylorville and everyone who had the  pleasure of knowing him.   Shannon and I send our thoughts and prayers to his wife, Fran; his  kids, Cheryl and Jerry; his grandkids, Joel, Anna, and Jillian; and his  sister, Gloria.   Tom, we will miss you, man. May you rest in peace.                            ____________________
