 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to  the remarkable life of Larry Leong Hong, who passed away peacefully on  April 20, 2018, surrounded by his loving family.   Born in China in 1922, his family immigrated to Burma when he was an  infant, to seek better fortune. Larry was the oldest son of six  children; he had three sisters and two brothers. His family sent him  back to China to get his schooling and to learn about his heritage and  his culture. At age 13, shortly after he returned home to Burma, he  left to seek a better future for himself and for his family. He came by  himself to America, to the Golden Mountain, where it was believed the  streets were paved with gold.   In 1935, when he arrived in America, he found no streets paved in  gold bricks. Instead, he found a country in the grips of the Great  Depression, and life was hard. But that did not deter him. He worked  hard at the family restaurant. Larry learned the value of hard work,  determination, and self-sufficiency. He worked in the restaurant until  the clarion call of World War II. In 1942 Larry joined the war effort,  working at a factory as an engine lathe operator and was promoted to be  an inspector until he was called to serve. Larry--also known as Wing Q.  Hong--was inducted into the Army of the United States on March 2, 1943.  He was an infantryman and rose to TEC 4 as a cook. He served in the  European theater, landing with his regiment in Normandy and went on to  serve in Ardennes-Rhineland, Northern France, and Central Europe,  serving as the acting mess sergeant for the officers. He was honorably  discharged on October 19, 1945. He was awarded the Good Conduct Medal  AR 600-68 and the EAMETO Medal with one Silver Service Star. This  patriotic and hard-working immigrant started a tradition of service to  his country. All of his descendants and their spouses served this  Nation, either in Active Duty as members of the military or as  civilians. Upon discharge, Larry returned to civilian life and went  back to the restaurant business. Two years after his discharge from the  Army, his only son, Kenneth, was born.   He met the love of his life, Annette Moy, at the restaurant in which  they both worked, and they were married in 1942. This was a love affair  that lasted for almost 62 years, until his beloved wife passed in  January of 2000. Even though Larry came to America by himself, as a  young teen, when he married Annette, he married into the Moy Clan--very  large, very tight-knit, and very loving family. He learned through  Annette the value and the strong bonds of family. Larry was devoted to  his immediate and extended family. He was generous, strong, dependable,  and stable. He and his wife were the anchor for their very large  family.   The family took every opportunity to gather together, whether it was  to celebrate a holiday, to celebrate a special milestone or just to get  together for a picnic. They were fun, and of course these gatherings  always featured good food. Each weekend the extended family came  together at one of the sisters' house to play mah-jongg, while the  young children went to sleep to the sound of the click-clicking of the  mah-jongg game. Larry loved good Chinese food; he especially loved  lobster and Chinese-style chicken.   Larry was a fighter. He met several challenges throughout his life,  and each time he fought it--and he won. His love of family, his love of  food, his strength, and his fighting spirit will be missed.   Larry is survived by his son, Kenneth Leong Hong--wife Belkis--of  Gaithersburg, MD, and his only granddaughter, Denise Williams--husband  Dan--of National Harbor, MD.                            ____________________
