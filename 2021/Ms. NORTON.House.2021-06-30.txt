 Mr. Speaker, as chair of the subcommittee that helped  write today's INVEST in America Act, I want to emphasize that this bill  breaks with previous Transportation and Infrastructure bills generally  passed every 4 or 5 years. Until today, we have simply updated the bill  first passed during the Eisenhower administration.   However, today's bill, for example, for the first time tackles  climate change in recognition that transportation leads as a source of  greenhouse gas emissions. The need to reduce burning fossil fuels is a  priority in this  [[Page H3509]]  bill to move us more quickly to zero emissions.   I am particularly focused on transportation infrastructure  alternatives, like those here in my district, the District of Columbia,  particularly transit, especially Amtrak, and establishing a pilot  project for reduced transit fares for low-income riders.   Perhaps most important, this bill fundamentally reverses course by  actively discouraging expansion of roads for the first time. This  limitation is in recognition of climate change. Instead of  incentivizing more miles of roads for cars, this bill encourages safer  roads for walking, biking, and scooters. Today's bill repairs existing  roads with climate-resilient materials rather than building new roads.   The INVEST in America Act changes course altogether in the interest  of 21st century transportation realities from climate change to rapidly  emerging alternatives to cars as forms of travel and mobility.   The 54 percent increase in funding for this bill is in keeping with  the road to change course on transportation and infrastructure.
