 Madam Speaker, I support the  legislation.   I am grateful that President Donald Trump has succeeded with an  agreement to address the destructive impact of the Wuhan virus. Our  families, small businesses, and hospitals need this support to maintain  jobs now more than ever.   The Paycheck Protection Program has been successful in supporting  small businesses in maintaining jobs, already saving 30 million jobs. A  real-world example of success was on Fox Business News last week with  Melissa Francis interviewing Bill Dukes of the Blue Marlin restaurant  in Columbia, praising Scott Hagler of the Security Federal Bank for  saving jobs.   This agreement will help families but, sadly, there was a delay  because of partisan politics, letting no disaster go to waste.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
