 Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare has failed the  American people destroying jobs. All across South Carolina, premiums  have skyrocketed, small-business jobs have been terminated, and our  State is now down to a single insurance provider on the exchange. This  is not what families were promised 7 years ago.   With the American Health Care Act, House Republicans have delivered  on the commitment to give Americans a healthcare system that increases  choice, creates jobs, and puts the patient back in control. This bill  protects  [[Page H2300]]  those with preexisting conditions, returns power to the States, allows  young adults to remain on their parents' insurance until they are 26,  and increases consumer choice. This is a critical first step of three  to repeal and replace ObamaCare.   I am grateful that the American Health Care Act is supported by the  NFIB, the Susan B. Anthony List, Americans for Tax Reform, the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, the National Taxpayers Union, the Institute for  Liberty, the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, and dozens of  other advocates promoting creating jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
