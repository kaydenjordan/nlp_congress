 Mr. Chairman, I thank the full committee chairman for  giving me this time.   Mr. Chairman, I am proud, on behalf of the people of the First  District of Illinois, to rise today in support of H.R. 987, which  includes my legislation, the Protecting Consumer Access to Generic  Drugs Act.   My legislation included in today's package prohibits the practice of  pay-for-delay where brand-name companies compensate generics to prevent  the entry of cheaper drugs into the market.   I have long stood against these anticompetitive deals that limit  competition and force consumers to pay more for their medications.   This disgraceful and deceptive practice ends now. I stand with my  colleagues to stop drug companies from continuing to rig the system in  an attempt to take advantage of hardworking Americans.   My legislation will take a meaningful step toward bringing this  behavior to a screeching halt and holding drug companies accountable  once and for all.   With today's package of prescription drug bills, we are making  progress toward addressing the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs  and are making good on our promise that no American should be forced to  make the choice between paying their bills and buying their pills.
