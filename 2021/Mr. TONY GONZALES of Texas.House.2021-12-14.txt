 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition  to the previous question and to further highlight the failed border  policies inflicted on the American people by President Biden's  administration.   Border security is national security. My district is over 820 miles  of the southern border, over 40 percent of our entire border with  Mexico.   Every day, I see the challenges my constituents face because this  administration has failed to protect them and failed to prioritize  their safety as American citizens.   Every day, I hear from Border Patrol agents about the struggles that  they face because of a lack of resources and their demanding work  schedules.   Every day, I talk to constituents and border-town mayors who share  their troubling experiences in dealing with burglaries and high-speed  car chases.   Enough fentanyl has been seized at the border to kill every American  in the United States.   Enough is enough. The Biden administration's failed policies and  open-border rhetoric have led to a historic  [[Page H7648]]  surge in illegal immigration. We need to find a permanent solution that  combines border security and legal immigration. So long as I am in  Congress, I will fight every day to ensure that we secure the southern  border.
