 Mr. President, I recognize Jordan J. Corbett on the  occasion of his 101st birthday on November 25, 2023.   J.J. grew up in Pierce, FL, and attended Union Academy in Bartow. In  1943, after a semester at Bethune-Cookman University, he was drafted  into the U.S. Army to fight in World War II. He was one of the first  African Americans to train as a paratrooper and was a founding member  of the 555th ``Triple Nickles'' Parachute Infantry Battalion. The 555th  was part of Operation Firefly, tasked with parachuting into rough  terrain in the American Northwest to put out fires started by the  Japan's deadly fire balloons. Not only did they help protect the  homeland and deter future balloon attacks, they pioneered many of the  procedures of today's smoke jumpers who help put out wildfires.   After the war, J.J. earned a degree in mathematics from North  Carolina Agricultural and Technical College where he played football,  was editor of the yearbook, and was active in Omega Psi Phi fraternity.  Upon graduation, he returned to Bartow, FL, to teach math and coached  at his high school alma mater, where he met his wife Ava.   He served 12 years on the Polk County School Board and 14 years on  the board of the Citrus and Chemical Bank. He is a two-time Florida  Track Coach of the Year and a member of the Florida Athletic  Association Hall of Fame.   J.J.'s life of service and perseverance is an inspiration to us all.  I extend my best birthday wishes to J.J. and his family.                            ____________________
