 Mr. Speaker, I rise to give a voice to millions of  Americans who are at risk of being overlooked in our Nation's response  to the opioid epidemic, America's youth.   Our Nation's opioid crisis knows no boundaries of geography or  demographics, and age--age--is no exception. One of four individuals  under the age of 20 has been prescribed opioids at some point in life,  and 2.2 million young people between the ages of 20 and 24 abused  opioids in the last year.   Opioid abuse early in life often leads to poorer academic  performance, more negative health outcomes, and higher rates of future  drug use.   In order to prevent the next generation of drug abuse, we have to  ramp up our investment in critical programs like drug-free communities  grants and substance abuse prevention and treatment block grants.   We can also help young people build resilience by supporting our  school-based health centers, where students are able to get healthcare  in a convenient setting. When students are empowered to meet with  healthcare providers, ask questions, and receive needed care, they can  become powerful advocates in turning the tide of this epidemic around.                            ____________________
