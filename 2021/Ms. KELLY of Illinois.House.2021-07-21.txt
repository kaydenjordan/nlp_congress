 Madam Speaker, today marks the 200th day of  this Congress and of House Democrats working for the people.   Working together with the Biden administration, we have put our  economy back on track, curbed the spread of COVID-19, and put money  into the pockets of our constituents. It was only Democrats that voted  for the American Rescue Plan, which helped create 3 million jobs,  deliver stimulus checks, and extend the child tax credit.   The American Rescue Plan also delivered on one of my most urgent  priorities, ending the maternal mortality crisis. Allowing States to  extend Medicaid coverage for postpartum care from 60 days to one full  year postpartum will save lives.   Outside of the recovery package, we have continued working on other  priorities, like advancing a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and  passing commonsense gun violence prevention measures to protect and  improve the lives of everyday Americans.  [[Page H3768]]    Madam Speaker, in just 200 days, we have accomplished so much, but  rest assured, we are just getting started.                            ____________________
