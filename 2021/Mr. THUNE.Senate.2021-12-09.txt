 Madam President, one thing you can say for the Democrats  so-called Build Back Better plan is that it provides a never-ending  supply of bad proposals to talk about. And the bad Build Back Better  measure I want to discuss today is Democrats' plan to double the size  of the IRS--yes, double the size of the IRS.   The IRS is not exactly the most popular government Agency, and with  good reason. The Agency has gained for itself a reputation for poor  taxpayer service and, most seriously, for mishandling the confidential  information--taxpayer information it has access to.   In fact, the IRS was subject to a massive leak or hack of private  taxpayer information mere months ago--information that somehow ended up  in the hands of advocates at ProPublica. And neither Treasury nor the  IRS has provided meaningful followup about the data breach, much less  any accountability.   For months, Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee have pressed  the administration for details about the breach of private taxpayer  information. I would have hoped by now that my friends on the other  side of the aisle would have shown similar concern for the privacy of  the American taxpayer.   And who could forget the IRS scandal during the Obama administration,  when the IRS targeted a number of organizations based on their  political beliefs?   Those are two notorious examples of IRS misconduct, but there are  plenty of others.   The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration has repeatedly  found instances of IRS agents violating taxpayer rights. And then there  is the Agency's record of irresponsibility or incompetence, or both-- losing track of laptops that may have contained sensitive taxpayer  information, rehiring employees who'd been fired for bad behavior, work  delays due to a lack of simple printer maintenance, hanging up on  taxpayers who call the IRS for information.   Customer service departments, in general, can be frustrating, but at  least at many companies you can reach an actual person in a fairly  reasonable amount of time. If you call the IRS, you have a 1-in-50  chance of reaching a human being--1 in 50.   I could go on, but suffice it to say that there are good reasons why  Americans tend not to be big fans of the IRS and why they think this  Agency already has too much power.   But Democrats would like to double the size of the Agency. The  Democrats' bill would add 87,000 new IRS employees--87,000. That's  enough employees to fill an entire football stadium with some left  over; 87,000 is more than the population of Rapid City, SD, the second  largest city in my home State.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that increasing the size of  the Agency in this way would result in significantly higher audit rates  of American taxpayers. Many of those audits would hit middle-income  taxpayers and small businesses; in other words, individuals without  easy access to an army of accountants to help them navigate the process  and ensure that their rights are protected.   Democrats' primary reason for the IRS expansion is to raise revenue,  to help pay for their partisan tax-and-spending spree. They claim that  hiring all these new IRS agents and employees will allow them to close  or reduce the tax gap--the difference between taxes owed and taxes  paid.   But there are a couple of problems with that. In the first place, it  is extremely doubtful that they will be able to raise the money they  claim they will be able to raise. In fact, the Congressional Budget  Office doesn't even score hoped-for revenue from enforcement since it  considers the acquisition of that revenue to be so uncertain.   And even if Democrats are able to raise a meaningful sum from  increased enforcement, what exactly is it going to cost Americans for  Democrats to recapture this money?   Increased scrutiny and costly audits of law-abiding taxpayers. IRS  intimidation and harassment.   And just in case anyone thinks I am exaggerating about that  intimidation, I would note that a provision in the House version of the  Democrats' reckless tax-and-spending spree would repeal a measure  requiring written approval of a supervisor before an IRS agent can  access--or I should say, can assess any penalties.   The provision was intended to prevent overreaching IRS agents from  threatening Americans with unjustified penalties. And it is hard to  imagine why Democrats are trying to repeal this measure if they are not  trying to pave the way for much more aggressive IRS pressure and  enforcement.   And I haven't even mentioned the provision that was in Democrats'  proposal for a long time and which some Democrats, including the  President's Treasury Secretary and other administration officials,  would still--still--like to see included, and that's a provision that  would empower the IRS to snoop on the details of Americans' bank  accounts.   Under one version of this provision, the IRS would be able to sift  through the bank records of any American with just $600 in annual  transactions. In other words, the IRS would be able to look through the  bank records of just about every American and find out just how much  you spent on Starbucks or your last doctor's bill or that new winter  coat.   It is staggering that the Democrats could even contemplate giving  that much power to an Agency that has a track record of mishandling  sensitive taxpayer information. But that is the kind of power the  President's Treasury Secretary, for one, would like this Agency to  have.    With their so-called Build Back Better plan, Democrats are proposing  a massive expansion of government, and we are apparently just supposed  to take it on faith that the government will be able to handle all  these new responsibilities.   Well, I have to say, I--and I would say many other Americans--have my  doubts. And the IRS provides a perfect example of why.   The IRS can't even properly handle the staff and responsibilities it  already has, and yet Democrats think it is a good idea to double the  size of this Agency and give it new enforcement powers and, if some  have their way, expanded access to Americans' personal information.   Doubling the size of the IRS is a terrible idea, and it is one more  reason why Build Back Better is a bad deal for the American people.   I yield the floor.
