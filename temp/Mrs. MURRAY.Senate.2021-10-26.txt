 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do have  good news for my colleague and everyone looking for information about  the safety of vaccines: The CDC already collects and publicly releases  data like what this bill proposes. So anyone who is curious about  whether they should get a COVID-19 vaccination can go to the CDC  website right now at cdc.gov.   And some more good news: The data overwhelmingly shows these vaccines  meet FDA's rigorous standards of safety and effectiveness.   So now that that has been cleared up, I hope instead of wasting any  more time on bills like this--bills which threaten to undermine public  confidence in vaccines and trust in our public health experts by  ignoring the thorough work they already do to provide clear, scientific  data--we can instead focus on what we can all do to finally end this  pandemic, which has now killed over 730,000 people and counting, and  rebuild our country stronger and fairer.   I object.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letter in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           U.S. Senate, Committee on Health, Educaiton, Labor and             Pensions,                                  Washington, DC, October 26, 2021.      To the Secretary of the Senate:        PN796, the nomination of Jose Javier Rodriguez, of Florida,       to be Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training,       Department of Labor, having been referred to the Committee on       Health, Education, Labor,  [[Page S7364]]       and Pensions, the Committee, with a quorum present, has voted       on the nomination as follows--        On the question of reporting the nomination without       recommendation, 11 ayes to 11 noes.        In accordance with section 3, paragraph (1)(A) of S. Res.       27 of the 117th Congress, I hereby give notice that the       Committee has not reported the nomination because of a tie       vote, and ask that this notice be printed in the Record       pursuant to the resolution.                                                      Patty Murray,      Chair.                            ____________________
