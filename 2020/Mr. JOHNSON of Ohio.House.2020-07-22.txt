 Madam Speaker, for those wondering what it is  like to be a Black police officer amid the violent demonstrations that  continue in cities across our country, consider what Portland Police  Officer Jakhary Jackson said about the rioters in his own words.   ``It's been very eye-opening. It says something when you're at a  Black Lives Matter protest and you have more minorities on the police  side than you have in a violent crowd, and you have White people  screaming at Black officers.''   Let me repeat Officer Jackson's words once more, because you will not  hear any of this from our national media. Once again, here are the  words of a Black police officer facing a violent mob of predominantly  White anarchists.   ``It's been very eye-opening. It says something when you're at a  Black Lives Matter protest and you have more minorities on the police  side than you have in a violent crowd, and you have White people  screaming at Black officers.''                            ____________________
