 Mr. Speaker, as the Representative of the State with one of  the largest exclusive economic zones in our country and as the  Representative of the State that sits in the middle of the Pacific  where we are seeing increasing  [[Page H7117]]  overfishing, including the use of these techniques throughout our  Pacific, I rise in very strong support of the Driftnet Modernization  and Bycatch Reduction Act. This bipartisan legislation is necessary to  transition fairly an important West Coast fishery away from the use of  large mesh driftnets.   I want to commend, in addition to Senator Feinstein and the  Republican cosponsors, Congressman Lieu on our side for his work on the  bill in the House.   Yes, this fishery is small, with less than 20 participants, but it is  one of the most destructive. The use of mile-long driftnets results in  over 70 species caught in volume as bycatch.   The problems with this practice are nothing new. Beginning in the  1980s, Congress and the Republican and first Bush administration  recognized its destruction and worked together to reform the practice,  culminating with the near complete global moratorium on the practice.   Today, the large mesh driftnets that continue to be used in Federal  waters along the West Coast are the last of their kind in the Nation.  This bill closes that loophole and phases out the practice.                                time  0930    Fortunately, new fishing technology has been developed that catches  swordfish at a profitable level without the huge levels of bycatch  associated with driftnets. That is good for fishermen, good for  consumers, and good for the marine environment.   All West Coast States have already acted to prohibit this type of  fishing from their shores and their oceans. It is time we, at the  Federal level, act to do the same to ensure the sustainability of this  fishery and the sustainability of the bycatch fisheries. Transitioning  away from large-mesh driftnets is supported by recreational fishermen,  conservation groups, seafood purveyors, and consumers, and it just  makes sense.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bipartisan, bicameral bill.
