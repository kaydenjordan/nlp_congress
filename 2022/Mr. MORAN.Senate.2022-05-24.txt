 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in April, more than 234,000 migrants were  apprehended at the southern border. This is an alarming number, and it  is the highest monthly total in 22 years.   We have a humanitarian, public health, and national security crisis  happening at the border. The Department of Homeland Security is bracing  for an even bigger surge in the weeks and months to come, with the  possibility--the estimates of 18,000 new people showing up every single  day.   The Biden administration continues to be absent in this crisis, and  instead of offering constructive policies, they are removing ones that  are helping prevent even more people from entering our country.   Last week, the court made the decision to require title 42 to remain  in place. The reality of ending it would  [[Page S2653]]  create an even greater border emergency. Yet the Biden administration  is appealing the court's decision.   A recent POLITICO-Harvard poll found that 55 percent of Americans  oppose ending this title 42 prohibition. President Biden and Vice  President Harris have refused to take any leadership on this issue. Not  only have they attempted to repeal title 42; President Biden's first  order of business after taking office was to repeal nearly every  immigration policy of the previous administration.   Repealing policies like title 42 without any plan of action will  leave our border agents with an unmanageable task of apprehending,  vetting, and documenting hundreds of thousands of migrants while trying  to stop drug and human trafficking.   In my conversations with border agents, they describe just how hard a  task they have. The cartels have learned that flooding the border with  migrants provides a distraction that affords them a better chance of  successfully bringing drugs across the border. It is no wonder that  fentanyl seizures at the southern border increased 48 percent in April  2022 from the previous year of April 2021.   Our border agents and officers are being asked to be caretakers, law  enforcement officers, medical professionals, and so much more. They  have a tireless and thankless job. I visited the border in April of  last year to meet with the Border Patrol, the DEA, and the FBI and to  hear firsthand about how the crisis affected their operations. They  shared how handling a large surge of migrants has made it extremely  challenging to carry out their mission to stop and disrupt transitional  criminal organizations from drug trafficking.   These agents were sounding the alarm in April of 2021 when border  encounters totaled 178,000. Now, compare that to the 234,000 migrants  crossing the border in April of this year.   I have consistently worked to increase resources to our Border Patrol  agents. We must prioritize additional border security measures that  include a physical barrier and investments in new technologies. We must  also enforce our immigration laws and work to reform our immigration  system so that we reward those who follow the law and disincentivize  illegal crossings.   While title 42 will remain for now, the Biden administration plans to  continue to fight this ruling and has almost zero constructive plans to  help improve the crisis at the southern border.   One thing is for certain, our Border Patrol agents are doing an  incredible job. And I want them to know they are supported in the U.S.  Senate, and we thank them for their service our Nation.                 recognizing C.W. Porubsky Grocery and Meats    Mr. President, today I recognize a Kansas business that has served  Topeka, our State capital city, for more than 75 years with hot bowls  of chili, cold-cut sandwiches, spicy pickles, and warm conversations.   To someone from out of town, Porubsky's Grocery and Meats doesn't  seem like much, but to railroad workers, Topeka locals, and legislators  from the statehouse who frequent Porubsky's, it was the best place in  town to grab a delicious meal and receive a friendly welcome.   Opened in 1947 by Katie Porubsky and her son Charlie Porubsky, C.W.  Porubsky Grocery and Meats was an iconic restaurant in Topeka and had  fans around the country. While the grocery store portion was originally  the driving force behind the business, it is best known for being a  spot to meet folks for lunch.   Gourmet magazine summed it up as well as anyone when it stated that  ``Porubsky's is not just a place to eat. It is a destination in  itself.'' Charlie Porubsky's sons, Matthew, Charlie Jr., and Mark,  alongside the Porubsky daughters, Cecelia Pierson and Teresa Thomas,  have kept this business alive and have made their homes in Topeka.   Over the years, the restaurant has developed a reputation of having  some of the most delicious chili in the area. The start of chili season  is a day their loyal customers look forward to year in and year out.   My personal experience with Porubsky's dates back to my time in the  Kansas Legislature. Several of my fellow legislators and I would make  the trek to Porubsky's during legislative breaks. Meeting from January  through June meant that we had at least 3 full months to truly enjoy  Porubsky's hot pickles and spicy chili. With meats and cheese trays  displayed, the restaurant was a warm respite from the cold and a  welcome break from our political and governmental dealings.   Even today, as I travel across Kansas, I have a habit of altering my  plans so that I can have a ham salad sandwich with three slices of  cheese and a cold Coke at Porubsky's and enjoy the warm family  hospitality. When my flight from DC to Kansas at the end of the week  lands early, I have the chance, during that 2-hour drive home, to make  the trek across the Kansas River and up to North Topeka to go to  Porubsky's. And I will find wonderful people, great food, and a sense  that I am home, where all the talk is not about politics and not all  the Washington, DC, insider conversation; it just feels like you are  around real people and real Kansans.   While Porubsky's and many family-owned establishments like it lack  the bells and whistles of nationwide chains, the underlying quality  that truly matters is the collection of people it takes to make it  work. The value of places like Porubsky's can't be measured in economic  profits or Yelp reviews. What the Porubsky family has been serving up  for decades is more than just tasty sandwiches; it is a place where you  can go to know people and to be known--and known so well that your  sandwich is made before you even make it to the counter to order it.   Squeezing into a seat at the restaurant, it doesn't matter if you are  a Republican or a Democrat. It doesn't matter where you come from. At  places like Porubsky's, everyone is welcome.   While I am sad to see Porubsky's close their doors after decades--75  years--of service, the Porubsky family themselves and their famous  grocery will never be forgotten. I knew Charlie and Cecelia's mom and  dad, and I know Charlie and Cecelia well today. I thank them for being  such good friends and for looking after my well-being and that of  thousands of other customers over so many years.   I yield the floor.
