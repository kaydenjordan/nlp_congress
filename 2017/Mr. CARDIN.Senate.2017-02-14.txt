 Mr. President, I would like to express my support for the  nomination of Linda McMahon to the position of Administrator of the  U.S. Small Business Administration.   Linda McMahon is an interesting candidate for this position. As the  cofounder and former CEO of the WWE, she built a small regional  business into an entertainment behemoth. Along the way she struggled to  meet payroll, market the business, learn State and Federal regulatory  regimes, manage a traveling workforce, learn new media platforms, and  navigate new revenue streams.   Each of these accomplishments is impressive. But what makes Linda  McMahon unique for this role is the fact that, on her path to success,  she made serious enough mistakes that she was forced to declare  personal bankruptcy and apply for government assistance. I think having  an Administrator who has started her own small business and met and  overcame significant challenges along her way is of tremendous value.  Having been in the trenches herself, she will really be able to  evaluate the efficacy of current small business programs, and she may  very well be able to suggest substantive improvements or even new  directions.   I was also particularly impressed with Mrs. McMahon's performance  during her confirmation hearing. When she knew the answer to a question  posed by a Senator, she answered it. When she didn't know the answer,  she said so. She appeared to have an open mind about issues and struck  me as sincerely interested in working on all issues with all of the  Senators, regardless of political or geographical affiliations.   Linda McMahon has expressed her interest in helping small businesses  thrive. She understands how difficult it can be for entrepreneurs to  access capital. She knows that small businesses have a hard time  competing for Federal contracts. She knows that small business owners  sometimes need advice and guidance--and she believes in the value of  training and support programs.   I support Linda McMahon's nomination because, not only is she  interested in having the job of Administrator, she appears to have  genuine interest in doing the job. She clearly enjoys using her  business skills and experience to mentor entrepreneurs, and I believe  that she will apply her tenacity to protecting and hopefully improving  Federal support systems for America's entrepreneurs.
