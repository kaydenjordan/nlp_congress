 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome to Washington the  newest Member of the Nebraska delegation, U.S. Senator Pete Ricketts.   Senator Ricketts has just finished 8 very good years as Governor of  Nebraska. During that time, he steered the State through challenges,  including a dramatic period of historic flooding and a global pandemic.   Through it all, he led Nebraska to the best performance of any State  during the COVID pandemic, according to Politico.   Across his 8 years as Governor, he helped run State government more  like a business, delivered historic tax relief, and rolled back  unnecessary State government regulations.   Nebraska is fortunate to have his experience working for us now over  in the Senate. The Nebraska delegation is excited to have him on the  team, and we look forward to fighting together for the Cornhusker  State's priorities here in Washington.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  resolution condemning socialism.   I have seen the victims of socialism firsthand. Many of those victims  have found refuge in Nebraska. Vietnamese is the third most spoken  language in Nebraska due to immigration in the 1970s, and members of  the Falun Gong have found freedom from religious persecution by the  Chinese Communist Party in our great State.   History shows us that when socialism is tried, it leads to three  things: poverty, devastation, and ultimately communism. As Vladimir  Lenin once said, ``The goal of socialism is communism.''   Socialist regimes continue to commit atrocities around the world.   In North Korea, there are an estimated 180,000 prisoners today. Many  of them are subjected to torture and extreme manual labor.   In Venezuela, police and security forces killed more than 19,000  people between 2016 and 2019 for ``resisting authority.''   In Cuba, journalists, bloggers, and artists are routinely jailed for  speaking against the regime. The list goes on and on.    Socialism is the enemy, not just to free enterprise, but to human  rights.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
