 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding.   The current economic crisis facing our Nation is troubling but not  surprising. Skyrocketing inflation, rising gas prices, and growing  unemployment are the results of a White House that fundamentally  believes more government is the solution.   To be clear, President Biden's massive tax-and-spend policies  constitute a losing formula, which will drag our Nation deeper into  debt and government dependency. The April jobs report is a testament to  this.   A record 8 million jobs are available. However, only 266,000 were  filled last month because Biden is promoting government control rather  than the sustainable income of a job.   Job creators across Pennsylvania, in the hospitality, energy,  manufacturing, agriculture, and many other industries, say the same  thing: They are struggling to find workers.  [[Page H2598]]    Biden's policies are detrimental to our economic recovery and are the  last thing America needs. Even more frustrating, the solution to get us  back on track has been present all along: reopen the economy, stop  piling debt on our children, and get Americans back to work.   It is time that President Biden recognizes that Big Government is the  problem, and only the ingenuity and resilience of the American people  will lead us to prosperity.   Now more than ever, our government needs to get out of the way and  allow Americans to reclaim control of their lives and their government.
