 Madam Speaker, it is no secret that America is facing  many crises today, most unnecessary, on the border, fuel, inflation,  even baby formula shortages.   But one thing that is not being talked about a lot is that we have a  worldwide shortage of urea, which is a component in fertilizer, as well  as fluid called DEF used in diesel engines for trucks, tractors, et  cetera, made after 2010.   It is very important that we have this essential element because if  we don't have our trucks and tractors and even trains running, then we  are going to have even bigger supply crises than what we have now.   China and Russia are two of the major exporters of this urea product,  and they are actually cutting their exportations of them in order to  take care of themselves.   What we need to do in this country is step up our own production once  again. After Hurricane Ida--down on the Gulf Coast a few years ago-- caused suspension of operations of some of these plants that we have,  we have to get it back going again because we need urea for  our fertilizer to continue to grow food and to have our diesel engines  that require DEF, the diesel exhaust fluid, to keep going and deliver  the items we need.    Why do we need yet another crisis of running out and messing up the  supply chain?                            ____________________
