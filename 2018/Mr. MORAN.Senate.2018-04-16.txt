 Mr. President, thank you for your remarks on the floor  earlier this afternoon. I rise to have the Senate consider and to have  a conversation about S. 140, a package of three bills that will have  positive benefits on Indian Country.   Two bills in the package--the Senator from Arizona was talking about  one of them. Two bills in this package, S. 140, the White Mountain  Apache Water Rights Quantification Act, sponsored by Senators Flake and  McCain, and S. 249, a bill to provide that the Pueblo of Santa Clara  may lease for 99 years certain restricted land, sponsored by Senators  Udall and Heinrich of New Mexico, have already received unanimous  consent from the Senate.   The third bill in the package, the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act, was  attached as a message from the House to S. 140 in January. I am the  sponsor of this legislation in the Senate, which should be  noncontroversial in a chamber where Members of the Senate profess to be  supportive of Tribal sovereignty. This concept has been around since  2005, and I became interested in this topic and introduced legislation  in 2013--now 5 years ago.   I suppose all of us, from time to time, may introduce legislation  that is a messaging point or a talking point. In this and in most every  other case, when I introduce legislation I work hard to see that it  becomes law. I work in a bipartisan way to bring Republicans and  Democrats together and for rural and urban Members of the Senate to  work together. This is an example of that. There is nothing about this  legislation that is a messaging to Tribes or to others. It is not an  introduction of a piece of legislation designed to make a point. It is  a piece of legislation designed to become law.   This bill has passed the House and is now pending here in the Senate  today. I hope to use this opportunity to convey to my colleagues that  this legislation is not a radical proposition but rather a restoration  of the sovereign status of Tribal governments. Indeed, by moving  forward with this legislation, we can enshrine the status quo that  existed for 70 years after the passage of the National Labor Relations  Act, until the National Labor Relations Board stripped Tribes of their  government status under the NLRA. By making explicit that Tribal  governments are distinct and sovereign and capable of making their own  decisions, we will correct a decade-old error made by the NLRB.   (Mr. YOUNG assumed the Chair.)   The Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act is simple and narrow. It amends the  NLRA to exempt tribally owned entities operated on tribally owned  lands--no more, no less. Businesses owned by individual Tribal members  or operations off Tribal lands still remain subject to the scrutiny of  the NLRB.   Many of those who have expressed opposition to this bill will say: I  support Tribal sovereignty--but. If you have to qualify your support  for Tribal sovereignty in order to protect your own interests instead  of the Tribes, then, no, you really don't support Tribal sovereignty.  Tribal sovereignty is something we believe in. Tribes of Native  Americans--those who inhabited this country before our ancestors  arrived--were granted sovereignty over their own businesses decades or  generations ago.   Senators have voiced on the Senate floor that this is not about  sovereignty but about an attack on labor. That is simply not true. One  accusation is that this bill is truly an attack on labor because it  doesn't provide exemptions from other Federal legislation. If my  colleagues are objecting to this bill because of its narrow scope, then  will they support making it broader? I think the answer to that is  clearly no. If they are serious about that, then let's have a  conversation.   I am not new to Tribal issues. My introduction to this topic began  when I was elected to the Kansas State Senate a long time ago now. I  was a freshman member. I happened to have a law degree and was assigned  by the leadership of the State senate to conduct negotiations and to  chair a committee on Indian gaming in Kansas. I spent the next 2 years  in front of a Federal district judge, negotiating an agreement under  IGRA for Indian gaming in Kansas.   Other examples of our efforts include the passage of general welfare  exclusion legislation with Senator Heitkamp of North Dakota that passed  this Senate and became law several years ago now. Again, it was trying  to make clear that Tribal decisions made on behalf of Tribal members  are much better decisions than those made by Congress but especially by  those made by agencies and bureaucracies--in that case, the IRS; today,  the National Labor Relations Board.   We have also worked on other issues related to Tribal interests,  including a Carcieri fix and the ability to bring land into trust-- issues that are important to Tribes across the country. My point is,  this is another piece of legislation in a series that the Senate has  pursued in which we are doing right by those who preceded us as our  ancestors settled in America.   I don't think that the critics of this bill want Tribal governments  exempt from the other statutes either. No, the objection isn't about  the sovereignty granted by this legislation. It is not that it doesn't  go far enough; it is what it does grant sovereignty for.   I would ask my colleagues: If the Senate denied Tribal sovereignty in  this instance, what Tribal rights are going to be targeted next? The  point is, if you are for sovereignty, you are for sovereignty in all  circumstances, and you don't have the ability to choose. It is based  upon a legal and moral obligation that we have to Tribes here in the  United States.   Others have criticized this legislation. They have said that non- Tribal members cannot vote for Tribal governments, and therefore this  is different from States. Again, this legislation puts Tribes in the  same position, under NLRB, as States and other local units of  government--but that is not true either. A person living in the  District of Columbia, who works in Virginia, is subject to Virginia  labor laws without having a say in forming those laws.   In 2013, there was an issue of Tribal sovereignty on the U.S. Senate  floor. It was broader than that. It was VAWA--the Violence Against  Women Act. I supported its reauthorization, which included new  authorities for Tribal governments to protect Native American women  when they are harmed by  [[Page S2134]]  non-Indians. With VAWA's passage, Congress placed our trust in Tribes  to exact justice in the circumstance of domestic violence and violence  against women.   The point here is that we rightly determined that Tribes should have  the ability to punish Indian and non-Indian violent offenders, but  today it is being argued that we can't trust them to treat Indian and  non-Indian employees justly.   I remember the allegations against my colleagues who voted against  VAWA were that they were not supportive of Tribal sovereignty. Those  who oppose this bill today are subject to exactly the same criticism.   There is also an assumption being made that employees of tribally  owned entities are being treated poorly or will be treated poorly if  this legislation passes. The majority of Tribes are located in rural  areas, where the labor pool is often inadequate. It is to the Tribes'  advantage to treat their employees fairly in order to retain them. As a  matter of fact, many Tribes have the highest wages and provide the best  benefits in their region. Tribal jobs are coveted because prospective  employees know what they stand to gain by their employment.   The idea that Tribal government enterprise workers should be treated  as commercial rather than governmental workers doesn't hold up. A  Tribal casino worker is no less of a government employee than an  employee of a State-owned-and-operated enterprise that includes liquor  stores, ski resorts, and, yes, casinos.   In 2015, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee held legislative  hearings on the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act--the legislation we are  considering today--and testifying before the Committee was Robert  Welch, chairman of the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians in California.  Despite being a unionized Tribe--employees of the tribally owned  facilities are union members--Chairman Welch testified in support of  this bill.    Many Tribes welcome labor unions. That is fine. The point is, it is  their decision. The Tribal decision is where this issue rests. The  point of this legislation is it is up to the Tribes to decide, not the  NLRB.   More than 160 Tribes and Tribal organizations support this  legislation and have worked hard to see its passage. They support it  because the principle of Tribal sovereignty is critical to their well- being.   The vote I seek today is not a partisan ploy. I have worked to pass  this legislation without a recorded vote. I have taken to the floor to  do live UC requests on a number of occasions but have been met with  objections. I have worked to get this legislation included in  appropriations bills, but it was always forced out at the last minute.   In recent bipartisan legislation, Republican leadership, Chairman  Hoeven, and I were open to attaching both NAHASDA and TLSA, but TLSA's  inclusion was deemed unacceptable. This is not about making anybody  cast a difficult vote. We have tried to do this in a way that  eliminates that option, that necessity. We had two victories lined up  for Indian Country--NAHASDA and TLSA--and we got nowhere because of  opposition to Tribal sovereignty. That brings us to where we are today  on the Senate floor. It requires a Senate vote that will take place in  a little more than half an hour.   It is important to note that Tribal sovereignty enjoys bipartisan  support. Nearly two dozen Democrats, including Members of the House  Democratic leadership, supported this legislation in January when it  passed the House, and we have strong bipartisan backing in the Senate  as well. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs reported this out by  voice vote last summer. Democratic colleagues of mine have spoken in  favor of it.   The late Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii wrote in 2009: ``Congress  should affirm the original construction of NLRA by expressly including  Indian tribes in the definition of employer.'' Senator Daniel Inouye  continues to be held in high regard in the U.S. Senate for his work in  the U.S. Senate, for his service to his Nation, and for his firm  commitment to Tribes and to Native Hawaiians. Again, Senator Inouye,  who is no longer with us, said: ``Congress should affirm the original  construction of the NLRA by expressly including Indian tribes in the  definition of employer.''   What this bipartisan consensus demonstrates is that this is not about  labor. This is about the ability of Tribal governments to be treated  equally as other levels of government and to provide vital services to  their people without fear of work stoppages.   Jefferson Keel, president of the National Congress of American  Indians, wrote in February:         Tribes make an array of public services available to their       tribal citizens and other local residents: law enforcement,       fire and EMS departments, schools and hospitals, and natural       resource management.    These are things Tribes do on a daily basis for Tribal members and  for residents.         All tribal governments play critical roles in ensuring the       safety, health, and stability of tribal and surrounding       communities.    He goes on to write that in 1935, Congress ``did not want the kind of  labor strife and work stoppages that could paralyze federal, state and  local governments, jeopardizing public health and safety in the  process.''   Eighty years later, why it is that every other form of government in  this country is treated one way and Tribes another? That, my  colleagues, is not right. Why do Tribes have to accept others  determining their workplace rules but not their counterparts? Why is it  that the well-being of Native Americans on reservations, who rely on  these services, might be placed at risk? But most importantly, why  would we deny sovereignty when Tribes are entitled to it?   Senator Udall, my friend and colleague from New Mexico, who serves as  our committee's vice chair, the ranking member, understands the  importance of self-governance. He recently said: ``Decisions made by  Tribes for Tribes produce the best outcomes for their unique  communities.''   Is there a U.S. Senator who doesn't believe that decisions made at  home are better because we are all unique? We have unique circumstances  in every State across the country and in every community. Local folks  can make better decisions about what makes sense in their local  community. We know that for our constituents; we should know that for  Tribal members. Again, Senator Udall said: ``Decisions made by Tribes  for Tribes produce the best outcomes for their unique circumstances.''   What we will be voting on shortly is really a question of whether the  Members of this Chamber--U.S. Senators who swore to uphold the  Constitution and fill their responsibilities--believe that Tribal  governments, elected by their members, possess the right to make  informed decisions on behalf of those they represent. I say they do,  and I hope that most of my colleagues--in fact, I hope all of my  colleagues agree with that sentiment.   We have been working at this legislation for 5 years now. Decisions  will be made 30 minutes from now that will have a huge consequence,  perhaps not on me, perhaps not on many of my constituents but on Tribal  leaders and the individual Tribal members who elected them to make  decisions on their behalf. We would be offended if people intruded on  our abilities to make decisions for our constituents, and Tribal  leaders are no different.   This is important legislation. It is not political. It is about  making the right decision for the right reason so that good outcomes  can benefit all Americans--all who live here in the United States--and  I ask my colleagues to seriously consider and, ultimately, vote for  this bill, S. 140, which includes the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I would like to take a few moments of the  Senate's time this evening to recognize servicemembers who take time  away from core missions serving our Nation to support Members of  Congress to facilitate a healthy and balanced exchange with the  Department of Defense. We work in an environment in which we are  surrounded by these dedicated individuals in our Armed Forces. They  educate us, prepare us, and do their very best to make sure the members  of this body can strive to do their work in the most effective way  possible. The vast majority of their efforts go without proper  acknowledgement. I speak today to ensure that we recognize one of the  hardest working and dedicated individuals among them, LTC Charcillea  Schaefer. As an American soldier, she has dedicated her life to serving  our country, and for the past 3 years, she has successfully supported  me and other Members of Congress.   I have been able to work with Charcy by virtue of the U.S. Army  Congressional Fellowship Program. Through this program, she was  assigned to the U.S. Army's congressional budget liaison office, where  she worked alongside Senate appropriators and Army leaders in the  Pentagon. Charcy directly improved the relationships between Members of  Congress, their staffs, and Army leaders with her ability to build  trust and gain confidence among those who relied on her. Her accurate  and timely responses to the Subcommittee on Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies had a significant impact on the  subcommittee's ability to establish priorities and craft appropriations  legislation that better serves our military, their families, and our  veterans.   Charcy was skilled in translating the military construction needs of  the Army such as military hospitals, barracks, and clean energy  initiatives. She also helped Members understand the impact new  construction and facility upgrades would have in direct support of  combatant commands and their missions. Charcy was influential in  assisting the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs,  and Related Agencies support one of our Nation's most sacred and  cherished treasures, the Arlington National Cemetery.   Charcy is trustworthy and dependable, she made a difference, and I am  grateful for her support.   On behalf of Kansans and the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies, I offer  sincere gratitude to Charcillea Schaefer of Centreville, VA.   Charcy, ma'am, thank you for a job well done. I wish you nothing but  the best in your future endeavors and service to our Nation.                            ____________________
