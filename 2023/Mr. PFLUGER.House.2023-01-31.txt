 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr.  Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 497, Freedom for Health  Care Workers Act. I would also like to offer my condolences to my  colleague on the other side of the aisle for the loss of his mother. I  think that, you know, in a stark contrast of what CMS is doing to  mandate this, which is the only vaccine that is mandated, what we  should be doing is investigating the origins of COVID, the billions of  dollars that have been spent, the countless lives that have been lost.   I am proud to serve on Energy and Commerce, to be the only rural  Texan serving on that committee. Growing up in rural Texas, it gave me  a strong appreciation for healthcare, for workers just like my  colleague's mother, the heroes that were on the front line during  the pandemic and those that have served as doctors and nurses in Texas,  quite literally, saving lives every single day.    We are facing a massive shortage of healthcare workers throughout our  Nation, and, unfortunately, this crisis is amplified in rural America.   Rural healthcare workers and providers are among the most negatively  impacted by the President's tyrannical COVID vaccine mandate, which  remains in effect for Medicare and Medicaid-certified providers.   The Biden administration should not be forcing American workers to  take the vaccine or face the possibility of losing their job. Instead,  they should be listening to the reasons that so many people in my  district, throughout the State of Texas, and throughout the country,  quite frankly, may not want to take it. That choice should not have to  be made. Unfortunately, the overreach never ends.   Republicans are standing up today to free our healthcare heroes from  this unconstitutional mandate. I am proud to join Representative Jeff  Duncan on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.
