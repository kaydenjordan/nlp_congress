 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 1-year  anniversary of the overturning of the Roe v. Wade decision.   A year ago, the Supreme Court has decided to allow the States to  handle the issue of abortion themselves, ending more than 49 years of  heartbreaking Federal precedent.   When we celebrate pro-life victories like this, we should not do so  in a way that causes emotional pain to those women who have had an  abortion; nor should we back down from being unapologetically pro-life.  I believe that abortion as a matter of convenience or everyday birth  control is flatout wrong.   I would like to recognize the contributions of pro-life pregnancy  centers throughout our Nation that offer compassionate support and care  to women as they choose to become mothers and bring life into this  world.   The Palmetto Women's Center in my district is focused on uniting  hope, health, and healing to women as they bring children into the  world. The center is working to lower the number of abortions in South  Carolina and supporting women as they choose life for their children. I  applaud the work that pro-life centers are doing, and I will continue  to be an advocate for all that they do.   Although giving the power on how to handle the issues of abortion  back to the States through the favorable Dobbs ruling is a big win, it  does not mean the work of the pro-life movement is done. Action at the  State and local level will only grow in importance in the coming years.  I will continue to be a voice for the voiceless.
