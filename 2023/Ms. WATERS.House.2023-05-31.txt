 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this bill to prevent a  catastrophic default, which would jack up interest rates, eliminate  700,000 jobs, raise mortgage rates to over 8 percent, cut housing  vouchers, and hurt small businesses and consumers.   All of this, because Republicans, who added $6.7 trillion to the debt  under twice-impeached former President Trump.   Republicans claim they care about debt reduction.   But their leader, former President Trump said, ``I'm the king of  debt. I'm great with debt. Nobody knows debt better than me.'' He said  this to Norah O'Donnell in an interview on CBS.   Very recently, Trump said, ``I say to the Republicans out there-- Congressmen, Senators--if they don't give you massive cuts, you're  going to have to do a default.''   Democrats support this bill because we refuse to allow our country to  default on its debt.
