 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join 1.3 million fellow  Mainers in celebrating National Forest Products Week.   Mr. Speaker, our great State is 90 percent covered by healthy,  sustainable forests which support more than 30,000 good-paying jobs.  Now, nationally, our working forests support 930,000 hardworking  Americans who manage the forests, who harvest the trees, and who  transport the wood to paper mills and energy plants across our great  Nation.   Every day, products like paper and lumber and pet food bags and  toothpicks and pencils make our lives better. And the best part, Mr.  Speaker, is that these trees grow back after we cut them, so this  entire green, sustainable industry creates good-paying jobs generation  after generation.   Now, Democrats and Republicans must do everything humanly possible to  help make sure our forest products industry is healthy and thrives. And  to that end, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank everybody in this Chamber to  make sure that we continue to treat biomass fairly in our regulations,  make sure biomass is carbon neutral. This will avoid unnecessary and  costly regulations being imposed on our mills, factories, and energy  plants.                            ____________________
