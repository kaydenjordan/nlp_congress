 Mr. Speaker, it reads like a page out of George  Orwell's ``1984:'' spies, secret courts, and searches of Americans  without a warrant. It is clear: Big Brother is watching us.   Most Americans may not be fully aware of what is taking place behind  closed doors of government spy agencies, but the reality is our  government is spying on ordinary, everyday Americans.   How?   Through an old piece of legislation, originally signed into law by  President Carter in 1978, called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act, or FISA.   FISA allows our government to spy on foreign agents, including  terrorists, primarily overseas. The government collects all of this  information and puts it into a database. If they want to use or search  the database, they go to a secret court, and that court issues a secret  warrant to search the database.   This court operates behind closed doors and issues those secret  warrants to go after--remember--bad guys overseas.   As the subcommittee chairman of terrorism, I have no problem with our  government going after terrorists who seek to harm Americans.   What I do have a problem with, Mr. Speaker, is the government uses  these databases that they seize and then looks in those databases about  Americans and their activities, violating their Fourth Amendment rights  because they don't have a warrant to go into these databases to look  for Americans. Remember, they are searching for terrorists.   Here is what happens: While seizing the communications of a suspected  foreign agent--maybe an al-Qaida terrorist talking to another al-Qaida  terrorist--the government, incidentally, picks up communications of  American citizens. These communications may not have anything to do  with terrorism.   This data is kept. The government puts it in their database, and they  say it is legal. This information on Americans was seized based on this  secret warrant of foreigners issued by a FISA judge.   Occasionally, the government then decides to go into this database  that was inadvertently seized--as they call it--without a Fourth  Amendment warrant on Americans, and checks to see how many times an  American name, or other identifying information, comes up. If they find  something, they use this data on the American citizen.   Now, Mr. Speaker, they still don't have a warrant to search  Americans' information, even if it was incidentally collected.   They search this database to see, for example, if Bobby Oglethorpe is  committing a crime in the United States, maybe having nothing to do  with terrorism. Maybe it is a robbery, maybe it is an IRS fraud, maybe  it violates other laws of the United States. But, remember, they are  looking for that without a warrant.   They seize the information, and, quite frankly, we don't know how  many times they seize this information on Americans.   Our Judiciary Committee has continually asked the intelligence  community: How many times have you searched? They refuse to tell us how  many searches and seizures there are on Americans in that database.   Very suspicious, isn't it, Mr. Speaker?   According to The Washington Post, 90 percent of the account holders,  whose communications were collected, were not targets. The bad guys  overseas, they were Americans: 90 percent of them.   Nearly half of the surveillance files contained names, email  addresses, and other details that the NSA marked as belonging to  American citizens or residents.   So, what information are they getting?   They get communications, texts, and emails.   Without a warrant, remember, secret courts issuing secret warrants,  and they don't tell anybody about it.  [[Page H9796]]    Under section 702 of the FISA legislation, this warrantless search of  Americans is legal. But this, in my opinion, violates the U.S.  Constitution.   As a former judge, I am very concerned about the loss of our Fourth  Amendment right of privacy in the United States, based on this  unconstitutional law. The Fourth Amendment is sacred to this country  and to the Founders who drafted it. It is up to Congress to uphold  Americans' Fourth Amendment rights.   Despite intense debate in the House Judiciary Committee, I am still  concerned the House leadership is planning to reintroduce and  reauthorize the FISA legislation and not have these reforms to protect  Americans' privacy. A reauthorization of FISA with weak language only  seeks to put Americans' privacy at stake and violates the U.S.  Constitution.   Any 702 reauthorization should simply require that if you want to  look at the data that was incidentally seized on Americans, get a  search warrant or stay out of that data; otherwise, it violates the  Constitution.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as ISIS loses ground in Syria and  Iraq, we must remain vigilant. There is a growing terrorist threat in  Africa. Between January and September of 2016, the African continent  suffered at least 1,426 incidents of terrorism-related violence.   Terrorism is a major challenge to peace, security, and development in  Africa. Recently, the threat has grown to directly impact U.S.  servicemembers serving in Africa.   Last May, a Navy SEAL was killed in an operation against al-Qaida  affiliate al Shabaab, the first U.S. servicemember killed in action in  Somalia since the 1993 infamous Black Hawk Down incident. Last month,  an ambush by Islamist militants in Niger left four U.S. Green Berets  killed. Recently, the U.S. conducted its first airstrikes against ISIS  in Somalia.   Mr. Speaker, the writing is on the wall. The terrorist cancer in  Africa is metastasizing. It is on its way to becoming a full-blown  threat to African and American interests.   Having been displaced by war in Syria and Iraq, ISIS is finding a new  home in Africa to carry out its reign of terror, and we must be mindful  and vigilant.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
