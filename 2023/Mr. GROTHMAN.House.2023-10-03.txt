 Mr. Speaker, I will address some of the votes that took  place on the floor last week, in particular the vote regarding a  continuing resolution designed to keep the government open that was  taken here last Friday.   The effort to keep the government open failed 232-198. Every Democrat  voted against that resolution to close the government. What I am going  to address is the fact that 21 Republicans voted against keeping the  government open at that time. The press, particularly The New York  Times, probably other organizations as well, referred to those 21  people as hardcore conservatives.   As our country goes under, some people are going to blame the  executive, some people will blame Congress, some people will blame the  courts, but a lot of it has to fall on the utterly incompetent press  corps of this country. Hard-line conservatives?   Let's look at the bill that we wanted to have to keep the government  open last Friday. First of all, a continuing resolution is primarily  about spending, and that spending bill cut spending, discretionary  spending, on all but veterans, the border, and defense, by 30 percent.  In other words, across-the-board, you put everything else together,  discretionary spending on the Department of Education, the Department  of Commerce, the Department of the Interior, the State Department,  energy, the legislature itself, a 30 percent reduction in spending.   How in the world can you say the people who voted for the 30 percent  reduction in spending are not conservative? How in the world can the  press corps refer to the people who voted against a 30 percent  reduction in spending as the hard-line conservatives?   We all know part of that bill was not just focused on government  spending. Probably the biggest crisis facing America today is the  massive group of people coming across the southern border, over 200,000  a month. In addition to that, we have all the unaccompanied minors,  8,000 to 10,000 children, coming across the southern border with no  adult accompanying them at all.   In that bill, we also tried to add 22,000 new border agents, end  catch and release, so people showing up at the southern border would be  kept in Mexico, and the policy of inviting unaccompanied minors into  our country. In other words, we were dealing with the  immigration crisis.    We had two parts of the bill: A 30 percent reduction in discretionary  spending on so much of the budget and, in essence, closing down the  border to prevent all of these people coming here illegally, as well as  to prevent the drugs coming across that kill over 100,000 Americans a  year. The press corps in this country has the nerve to say that the  people who sided with the Democrats to kill this bill are hard-line  conservatives.   I call upon the slumbering press to wake up and pay attention to what  is in these bills and tell us exactly what you mean by hardcore  conservatives if they vote against the bill.   There may be a variety of motivations to vote against a bill. There  may be personalities. Maybe you want to fancy yourself a hardcore  conservative and you count on utter incompetence in the news media.   I beg the press corps in the future to pay attention to what is in  these bills  [[Page H4961]]  and only use the phrase ``hardcore conservative'' to describe people  who are voting for hardcore conservative bills.   The next thing that I think we should point out here today and the  importance of having that large reduction in spending--and I don't mean  to bore you with numbers--is the degree to which, on a daily basis, our  country gets in worse and worse shape. That is because the interest  rates go up. That is no vote that we take here in Congress. I mean, we  fight trench warfare here on a variety of bills. Sometimes the bills  are just minor bills that have a few million dollars in them. In the  last 2 days, because of an increase in interest rates, the amount of  money we are going to have to spend on interest, just interest in the  next year, went up $12 billion.   Since April, when interest rates were like 3\1/2\ percent, the cost  in interest has gone up over $100 billion. We have serious problems  here, and the costs in interest should also be reported by the press.                            ____________________
