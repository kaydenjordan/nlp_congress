 Mr. Speaker, Oklahoma native, Christopher  Horton, is one of the namesakes of H. Res. 107 which passed the House  yesterday.   Army Specialist Christopher Horton served in the Oklahoma National  Guard's 1st Battalion, 279th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Brigade.   Horton grew up in Collinsville, Oklahoma, and was an exceptional  sharpshooter. Horton was killed in action on September 9, 2011, in  Afghanistan while serving in Operation Enduring Freedom. His bravery  and patriotism are remembered today as his legacy is enshrined 8 years  later.   Family members of fallen heroes hold a special place in our society.  The program started with this legislation will give family members of  our fallen heroes the unique opportunity to experience our government  up close with a 12-month fellowship in Congress. A front-row seat to  the legislative process is a valuable asset to a person deciding where  they want to go in their career. These yearlong fellowships will allow  the family members of our fallen veterans to become a part of the same  democracy that their loved ones fought to defend.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the passage of this bill and the bipartisan  work of my colleagues, Trent Kelly and Mikie Sherrill, as well as the  tenacious perseverance of both families of the fallen soldiers.                            ____________________
