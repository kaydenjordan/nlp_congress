 Madam President, today, President Trump's nominee for  the Supreme Court will be making the rounds in the Senate. I will be  meeting with him this afternoon. Several members of the Judiciary  Committee will be meeting with him over the course of today and the  rest of the week, as will some other Members.   I hope he comes prepared to answer direct questions about his  writings,  [[Page S5737]]  speeches, opinions, and judicial philosophy. The nominee has weighed in  on a number of legal issues publicly and in his role as a circuit  judge. There is little reason why he should be unable to answer direct  questions about his judicial philosophy, his record, and already  decided cases.   I also hope that he is willing to shed some light in the areas in his  record that remain opaque. The Senate and the public have been able to  see only a tiny fraction of the nominee's extensive written record  because, unfortunately, the Republican majority continues to block  access to the great bulk of these documents. I will ask our  Republicans: What are they hiding?   We did make a little progress last night after the Parliamentarian  ruled that the rules of the Senate allow every Senator to see the  committee documents. Chairman Grassley graciously agreed that any  committee member could see them without muss or fuss. So we very much  appreciate that.   The next Supreme Court Justice, whether it is Judge Kavanaugh or not,  will have immense influence over the lives of every American for  generations to come. Most Americans think this is sort of an abstract  or political argument. It is not.   The actual rulings of Kavanaugh will affect just about everyone's  life in America in very significant and material ways. The next Supreme  Court Justice may someday determine whether the President must comply  with a duly issued subpoena. The next Supreme Court Justice may someday  soon determine whether Americans with preexisting conditions will be  able to afford healthcare. The next justice someday soon may determine  just how much States can restrict a woman's constitutionally guaranteed  right to make her own medical decisions, to say nothing about labor  rights, civil rights, voting rights, environmental protections, and  more.   All of these things, part of the wellspring of America, are affected  by the Supreme Court's rulings. As we know, Judge Kavanaugh will be a  crucial vote on just about every one of those issues with the 4-to-4  division on the court today.   Judge Kavanaugh, in his meetings with Senators today and the days  ahead, has a responsibility--a responsibility--not to duck, not to hide  behind false legal shibboleths or say: Oh, I just can't discuss this; a  case might come before me. He has a responsibility to inform the Senate  as to his beliefs and philosophy so that the Senate can conduct its  constitutional duty to advise and consent.                                  Healthcare    Madam President, on another matter, it seems that every day we read  about a new danger to our healthcare system caused by President Trump  and his party in Congress. Only a few days ago, it was announced that  the court case that concerns the constitutionality of protections for  Americans with preexisting conditions, Texas v. United States, will  begin on September 5.   Remember, President Trump's Justice Department has refused to defend  protections for preexisting conditions in court. What an abomination.  Just about every American has someone in their family--many in their  immediate family--who has an illness. Someone might have diabetes.  Someone might have asthma and, God forbid, something worse. Those are  preexisting conditions. That family will not be able to get health  insurance. That family risks that their present insurance will expire  and they will not get anything new.   This administration is trying to take away that protection so  important to so many Americans. That is what is happening, so Senators  Manchin and Casey have introduced a resolution asking the Senate legal  counsel to step in to defend the law since the administration will not.  I hope we get a vote on that resolution soon. I don't see how anyone  couldn't be for it.   Sadly, the Justice Department's decision to abandon protections for  preexisting conditions is far from the only example of President  Trump's repeated sabotage of our healthcare system. Over and over  again, he has tried to undo the healthcare Americans have without even  understanding what he is really doing.   On day one, President Trump issued an Executive order aimed at the  healthcare law. It was the very first thing he did. He then proposed  legislation with congressional Republicans to repeal the healthcare  law, devastate Medicaid, and eliminate protections for tens of millions  of people with preexisting conditions. That failed, but congressional  Republicans managed to repeal the coverage requirement in their tax  bill, of all places, and put nothing in its place, causing unnecessary  premium increases across the country.   Americans know, as their premium increases gallop upward, that it is  Republicans in the Senate and President Trump in the White House who  have caused this to happen. Now he continues to do that. He has  expanded the availability of junk insurance plans that bait Americans  in with lowest rates while providing only the flimsiest of coverage.   Again, if these junk insurance plans become the law, the rule, the  mode, so many people will lose their ability to protect themselves when  they have preexisting conditions.   These actions by President Trump, aided, abetted, and encouraged by  congressional Republicans who either agreed with him or failed to  challenge him meaningfully, have had devastating results for so many  Americans.   Premiums have risen by double digits in a bunch of States, the direct  result of Republican sabotage. And the insurers themselves--they are  the ones who have raised the rates, but they say: Hey, it is  Republicans in the House, Senate, and the White House who are causing  it. Those insurance industries don't tend to favor Democrats, but they  have to protect themselves and their clients.   Prescription drug costs continue to rise. After promising tough  action on prescription drugs, the President and congressional  Republicans have hardly lifted a finger. The United States is now  last--dead last--among industrialized nations in maternal mortality.  The United States is the only industrialized country in the world with  rising maternal mortality rates. Despite all of our advances in  genetics, nutrition, and surgery, the United States is getting worse at  caring for mothers. We should hang our heads in shame about that. We  should do something about it.   Come on, Republican colleagues. Your voters are no different from our  voters and independent voters. They care about good healthcare at an  affordable cost. Please, do something about it. Join us.   But instead of grappling with these problems and proposing solutions,  President Trump and congressional Republicans just launch attack after  attack after attack on our healthcare system, particularly women's  health. That worked in the 2016 campaign because they said that they  had a plan to replace it with something better. No plan--no plan  emerged. And it is not working for them now. It is just not working for  them.   The American people overwhelmingly prefer Democrats to Republicans on  healthcare, and healthcare is the No. 1 issue in State after State  after State. So for their own political benefit, Republicans in the  Senate and in the House ought to wake up--wake up--because the old  playbook that may have worked in 2014 and 2016 when you weren't in  charge--it was a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate for part  of that time--ain't no more. You are in charge, and you put nothing in  its place--nothing. There is just negativity.   In poll after poll after poll, the American people say that  healthcare is the No. 1 issue. They don't want to go back to a time  before we offered protections for Americans with preexisting  conditions. They don't want to go back to a time when insurance  companies charged women and seniors and older Americans more for the  same exact coverage. They don't want to go back to a time when  insurance companies could deny maternity care, mental health treatment,  prescription drug coverage, and more, but that is where President Trump  and our Republican colleagues want to take us. I say to all those blue- collar folks who voted for President Trump: He promised you better  healthcare. Is he delivering it? Go look at your bills. Go look at  healthcare. If he is not, maybe you will help bring some change to  Washington--real change--so that your  [[Page S5738]]  healthcare costs will be lower and your healthcare will improve.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
