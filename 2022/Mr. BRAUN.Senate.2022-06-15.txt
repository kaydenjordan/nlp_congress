 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it has come  to my attention recently on a couple of the nominees whom the Federal  Mine Safety and Health Review Commission is entertaining--this body has  been rife with allegations of abuse of power and a hostile work  environment, resulting in several whistleblower complaints. Several of  these allegations would have occurred during both Mary Lu Jordan's and  Timothy Baker's previous tenures at the Agency.   The Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission was created  under the Mine Act, which declared that the industry must view the  health and safety and consider it the most precious resource of the  miner. The Agency does not have its own Office of Inspector General to  review these considerations. I think it probably needs one. This has  led to ongoing efforts by both House Oversight and Senate Republicans.   It is important to shine a light on Agencies like this, the Federal  Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, that have little to no  oversight currently.   So, until I am satisfied--and I think others as well--that we look  into that, that we vet those concerns, and have some type of interim  oversight, I do object.
