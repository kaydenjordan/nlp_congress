 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of the  amendment put forward by my good friend, Representative Cicilline, to  lift the antiquated and failed prohibition on defense article and  service transfers to our Eastern Mediterranean ally--the Republic of  Cyprus.   In 1987, the U.S. Department of State placed the Republic of Cyprus  on a list of countries to which sales and transfers of defense articles  and services is prohibited under the International Trade in Arms  Regulations. The reason for the prohibition has never been clear.  However, it appears to have been imposed in the erroneous belief that  it would somehow encourage Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots to  resolve the nearly 45-year division of the territory of Cyprus.   Unfortunately, no progress toward a peaceful and just settlement has  occurred since the prohibition was imposed in 1987. The lack of  progress is due to Turkish stubbornness most recently demonstrated by  Turkey's insistence on antiquated and obstructive stances, such as the  Treaty of Guarantee, which would allow for future unilateral Turkish  military interventions and is completely unacceptable and contradicts  the governing principals of a European Union member state.   It is time to lift the arms prohibition on the Republic of Cyprus. It  is in the best interests of the United States for the Republic of  Cyprus to look to the United States, and not any other nation, to  procure its defense articles.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
