 Mr. Chair, I thank Representative Norman, my good  friend from South Carolina, for introducing this amendment and for  yielding me time.   Mr. Chair, I submitted an identical amendment to this one, and I am  glad to see it is being considered today.   This amendment would hold the BLM director, Tracy Stone-Manning,  accountable for her disastrous policies and rightfully reduce her  salary to $1. Ms. Manning has been using the Bureau to push her own  radical environmentalist agenda at the expense of Montanans and all  Americans.   Director Manning has repeatedly and intentionally violated Federal  statute by issuing rules that are completely at odds with the Taylor  Grazing Act.   The Taylor Grazing Act lays out best range management practices and  clearly states that the purpose of the law is to: ``provide for the  orderly use'' of public land in order to ``stabilize the livestock  industry.''   Earlier this year, the BLM issued a Conservation and Landscape Health  Rule that clearly violates the letter and the spirit of the law by  designating multiple use public land under conservation leases for  bison. Allowing bison to graze on allotments that should be leased for  cattle grazing has been a severe blow to Montana's ranching industry.   Director Manning has also continuously ignored the concerns of local  landowners and those most affected by her harmful policies by failing  to hold public hearings outside of the large cities.   Director Manning flagrantly dismissed Montana agriculture groups'  concerns in the decision-making process for American Prairie Reserve's  bison grazing proposal and granted special provisions for one lessee  that no one else in the country has experienced. Her Bureau also  refused to collaborate with the relevant State agencies and declined to  hold sufficient opportunities for local engagement.                                time  2120    This is a process we have seen far too often with the Bureau of Land  Management under her leadership, creating harmful rules and refusing to  take input or provide engagement opportunities for those who are most  impacted by those rules.   Director Manning has also refused to follow the congressionally  mandated quarterly requirements for Federal land leases. Under this  administration, we have seen the fewest acres leased for oil and gas  since World War II, with only one of those lease sales taking place in  Montana. This directly contradicts Congress' directive and a Louisiana  district court's reversal of the administration's leasing moratorium.   At the same time, Americans continue to face rising energy costs and  persistent inflation. Intentionally  [[Page H5339]]  stalling onshore and gas production is a dereliction of duty and a slap  in the face to hardworking Americans, especially those who rely on  these public lands to keep their economy afloat.   This climate of zealotry and blatant disregard for the rule of law  has been evident with Director Stone-Manning for a long time. She  collaborated with tree-spiking ecoterrorists at the start of her  career, and there is no reason to believe that her views have  substantially changed.   Mr. Chair, for all of these reasons and many more, Director Stone- Manning needs to be held accountable. Congress cannot stand by idly  while these climate extremists use our Federal agencies to destroy  local economies and the livelihood of everyday Americans.   This amendment will put all of Biden's disastrous energy heads on  notice and force them to finally follow the rule of law that Congress  passed nearly 90 years ago.    Mr. Chair, possibly we will shed some light on some  allegations and problems that would raise to the level that the  gentleman would support for removing the salary from Ms. Haaland.   Prior to joining the current administration, Secretary Haaland had  close ties with the Pueblo Action Alliance, a New Mexico-based  organization known for its involvement in environmental and social  justice extremism.   The Pueblo Action Alliance argues that America's economic and  political systems must be dismantled and believes that America is  irredeemable because there is no opportunity to reform a system that  isn't founded on good morals or values. That is who she associated  with.   However, we are not done yet. Secretary Haaland's daughter is now  employed with Pueblo Action Alliance, participating in lobbying trips  to Washington, D.C., and protests, calling for the stop of all oil and  gas development. This relationship raises questions about the influence  this organization may have on the Secretary's decisionmaking within her  role.   In January, the Department received a FOIA request for all  communications between Secretary Haaland's daughter and the Department  of the Interior officials describing her lobbying efforts. The  Department has still not produced the requested information, failing to  meet their statutory obligations.   Secretary Haaland's husband has also consulted for and previously  been employed by an organization that receives a significant portion of  its funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Bureau of Indian  Affairs falls under Secretary Haaland's purview as Secretary of the  Interior, presenting another clear conflict of interest. Extremely  convenient.   In light of these alarming factors, it is my firm belief that  Secretary Haaland is ill-suited for the position of Secretary of the  Interior, and I hope that this amendment will be adopted.    Mr. Chair, just to shed a little bit more information  on the subject that I was speaking of, it is very difficult to prove  wrongdoing when the person who has committed the wrongdoing will not  provide the documentation for which the oversight can be conducted.   You can't see the documents, so you cannot see exactly what  arrangements have been made between her daughter, the lobbying efforts  that took place. We certainly can track, though, that her husband is  working for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, being compensated by them. If  we don't do anything except create the perception around this place of  integrity, we have to do a better job, and that has not even been  created.
