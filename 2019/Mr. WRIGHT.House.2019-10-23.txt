 Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  seem to think it is appropriate to conduct an impeachment inquiry  behind closed doors, shutting out the American people.   They have denied Republican Members of Congress the right to fully  participate in the inquiry process but expect them to cast a vote to  impeach a duly elected President of the United States without seeing  all the facts.   In addition to all that, Democrats denied us the right to vote on a  resolution to censure Chairman Schiff for his deception of Americans  day in and day out.   This morning, I joined dozens of my colleagues as we stormed into the  SCIF demanding transparency, shedding light on this corrupt process.  Instead of having a conversation, Chairman Schiff abruptly ended the  deposition, taking the witness with him out of the room.   The Speaker of this House is putting her hatred of the President  above what is best for her constituents. She is harming the entire  Nation by conducting this inquiry in such a manner.   Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. We are better than this; our country  is better than this; and the American people certainly deserve better  than this. They deserve better than an impeachment inquiry in a secret  room based on assertions of a phantom whistleblower.                            ____________________
