 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  legislation. I first thank the chairman and the ranking member for  focusing our efforts with this piece of legislation on the threats, the  most complex threat environment that we have faced, I believe, in our  history, and getting rid of things that distracted us, like a vaccine  mandate where we saw elite military forces having to make a choice that  I believe was unconstitutional. I believe that focus is so necessary  right now.   For those that are in Killeen, Texas, in the Fort Hood area, which is  home to the largest Active-Duty armored military installation in the  free world, you have much-needed military construction funds that are  coming to you to enhance your readiness.   For those at Goodfellow Air Force Base, we are proud of the 12,000  airmen, soldiers, sailors, marines, and guardians that are trained  there every year in the preparation of intelligence.   We have to remain focused. It is a complex threat environment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this piece of  legislation and the most solemn duty that we face, which is supporting  our military men and women and their families.
