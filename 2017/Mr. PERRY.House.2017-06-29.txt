 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for making sure  this bill gets to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I am registering my support for Kate's Law and H.R.  3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals--for Criminals--Act. I support  these bills for the sake of Kate Steinle and every single one of those  who share her tragic fate.   She was murdered in broad daylight by a violent, criminal illegal  alien. This was an easily preventable and heartbreaking crime, and we  simply cannot fail the American people by refusing to act on these  bills.   The government's first responsibility is the security and protection  of our homeland, a duty that should not be abdicated or yielded based  on convenience.   In 2011--2011--a GAO study found that aliens committed more than  25,000 homicides, more than 69,000 sexual offenses, 14,000 kidnappings,  42,000 robberies, and 213,000 assaults, among other offenses. Every  single one of these is too many.   Very few things in this world we can get at 100 percent, but these  are 100 percent preventable if these people would not have been here.  These are preventable crimes, completely preventable, and we must stop  the willful neglect of complacency by government officials who refuse  to enforce existing--this is not new. This is existing law we are  asking them to enforce, we are requiring them to enforce.   According to a March 2017 Washington Times article, nearly 500  jurisdictions have sanctuary policies that block--that block--that  limit ICE from apprehending criminal aliens.   A January 2017 article from the Washington Examiner reported that,  from January 2014 to September 2015, sanctuary jurisdictions rejected  17,000 ICE detainers. Those are 17,000 criminals that are out on the  street that we know about that we let go.   Adding insult to injury, these sanctuary jurisdictions seek Federal  funds to help them defy Federal law enforcement efforts to remove the  dangerous criminal aliens from the streets.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to put Americans first, and we support the  restoration of law and order by supporting these proposals.
