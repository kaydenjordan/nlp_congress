 Mr. President, the travel section of the New York Times on  Sunday, October 6, 2019, included a lengthy article about the  extraordinary music of Cuba and the rich culture that has developed  over many generations around the creation and performance of music in  that country. The article is too long to insert into the Record, but I  encourage all Senators to read it as it describes in colorful detail  the unique creativity, ingenuity, and complexity of Cuban music that  derives from the infinite variety of sounds, instruments, artistry, and  talents of Cuban musicians drawing on their African, Haitian, and  European heritage.   I mention this because it is illustrative of the many aspects of  Cuban society today that Americans should be able to experience for  themselves. The Cuban people, who endure many hardships, are as  resilient, ingenious, and hard-working as any people I have met.  Despite an economy broken by mismanagement that discourages private  initiative, a one-party political system that punishes dissent, racial,  and gender inequality, and only dreams for a better future, they know  how to enjoy life's pleasures and to make strangers feel welcome.   Unfortunately, rather than encouraging Americans to travel to Cuba to  experience Cuban society and build relations with the Cuban people, as  we do with people living under other autocratic governments, President  Trump has slammed the door.   Egged on by a handful of Cuban-American hardliners in the White  House, the State Department, and Congress--few, if any, of whom have  ever set foot in Cuba--the President has adopted a bankrupt approach  toward that country that is steeped in hypocrisy.   These are the same people who for years have unreservedly supported  [[Page S6151]]  spending hundreds of millions of dollars on TV and Radio Marti, despite  abundant evidence that they were little more than anti-Cuba propaganda  broadcasts masquerading as objective journalism. Finally, thanks to a  recent investigation, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting has new  leadership and reforms are underway. Those reforms should include  relocating the Office to Washington, DC, where it would be less  vulnerable to the political interference and ideological influence that  has plagued it in the past.   Every few weeks or months, this White House devises a new way to  ratchet up pressure on the Cuban Government and, in doing so, cause  greater hardship for the Cuban people on whose behalf the White House  professes to act. The latest was announced last week, when the Commerce  Department said it is revoking licenses for aircraft leases to Cuban  airlines and will deny future applications for aircraft leases. It will  also expand sanctions to cover more foreign goods containing as little  as 10 percent U.S. content.   Since this, like other sanctions against Cuba, will backfire, there  is only one rational explanation: The White House, and their enablers  in Congress, care little about the impact of these punitive policies on  the Cuban people. They are motivated by personal and ideological  animus.   The White House has imposed onerous restrictions on travel by  Americans who want, and have a right, to visit Cuba as they can to  every other country, except North Korea, and by Cubans who want to  visit or resettle in the United States. Just to apply for a U.S. visa,  Cubans must now travel to a third country at a cost of hundreds of  dollars that very few can afford. Cuban entrepreneurs, whose fledgling  small businesses depend on American customers, have seen their incomes  plunge as visits to Cuba by Americans have fallen by 50 percent.   For the first time that I can remember, Cubans with claims of being  threatened and arrested for their political activism in Cuba and who  have requested asylum in this country have been locked up in U.S. jails  and deported.   The White House has severely limited remittances, on which many Cuban  families depend. President Trump apparently believes it is his  prerogative to dictate to Cuban-Americans how much--or how little--of  their hard-earned income they can send to needy relatives.   The State Department ordered the departure of U.S. Embassy personnel  from Havana and Cuban Embassy personnel from Washington, which has  brought diplomacy to a virtual halt. Discussions on a wide range of  topics, from public health to climate change that began under President  Obama have all but ceased, and our top diplomat, Secretary of State  Pompeo, has nothing but praise for a failed policy that is completely  at odds with the mission of his Department. Exhaustive investigations  have not produced any evidence that illnesses suffered by U.S.  Government personnel in Havana that triggered the ordered departure  were caused by the Cuban Government, as some initially charged. Yet, 3  years later, our Embassy is barely functioning with a skeleton staff,  and the State Department has done nothing to try to mitigate the  adverse impact this is having on our relations with Cuba.   Under President Obama, negotiations began to seek a resolution of the  thorny issue of expropriated property claims. The Trump White House  summarily abandoned that process and has instead encouraged lawsuits  against American companies that want to do business in Cuba, if doing  so involves property confiscated during the Cuban revolution 60 years  ago. Airports, seaports, warehouses, hotels, homes, and restaurants,  many of which were once owned by Cuban elites who profited off the  spoils of the U.S.-supported Batista dictatorship, are now off limits.  This is a legitimate issue that needs to be addressed, but tying up  U.S. courts for years and hurting American companies is not the way to  do it.   The White House has insisted that each of these and other punitive  actions is designed to bring democracy to Cuba and human rights to the  Cuban people. And I have little doubt that creative minds in the White  House will conjure up additional sanctions in the coming months. None  of them will achieve those goals or anything positive for Cuba or its  people.   Anyone who knows Cuba, and who knows the Cuban Government,  understands the fallacy of the White House's approach. I wish it were  otherwise, but human rights have not improved since President Trump  announced his punitive policy 3 years ago. In fact the situation is  worse, as the recent re-arrests of Jose Daniel Ferrer, Berta Soler, and  other dissidents illustrates. As access to the Internet in Cuba has  increased, so has persecution of critics of the government. With only a  handful of staff at our Embassy in Havana, there is no one to regularly  interact with the Cuban dissident community or their families.   Cuba is no closer to being a multi-party democracy than it was 3  years ago, nor is the Cuban Government any closer to withdrawing its  support for Nicolas Maduro despite his corrupt, abusive, and disastrous  reign in Venezuela. So yes, we have profound disagreements. But while  the administration continues to tighten the screws on Cuba, making the  lives of the Cuban people even more difficult, President Trump sings  the praises of other foreign dictators and pretends to be concerned  about corruption in Ukraine.   He called Egypt's President al-Sisi a great leader. He invited  President Erdogan to the White House. He admires Vladimir Putin and  Roberto Duterte. He has spoken endearingly of Kim Jung Un, and he has  praised Xi Jinping and the Saudi Crown Prince. How can one possibly  reconcile embracing these ruthless, corrupt strongmen while at the same  time throwing the book at Cuba, a tiny, impoverished country that poses  no threat to the United States and whose people want closer ties with  the United States?   This is what happens when national policy is subverted by local  politics, when promises derived from campaign contributions take  precedence over the national interest, when family grievances and the  personal vindictiveness of a few with political influence trample on  the aspirations of the majority of Americans.   This administration's policy toward Cuba is no different from past  failed attempts to force the Cuban Government to transform itself into  a democracy, or to incite the Cuban people to rise up and overthrow it.  It has not worked, and it won't work. And in the meantime, the Russians  are eagerly filling the vacuum, only this time it is 90 miles from  Florida, not 6,000 miles away in Syria. Russia's Prime Minister  Medvedev visited Cuba just 3 weeks ago.   No one is saying that we should provide aid or sell weapons to the  Cuban Government the way this administration does to despotic  governments in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines.   No one is saying that we should not criticize the Cuban Government  for its repressive policies and its abuse of those who speak out for  greater political, economic, and journalistic freedom.   No one is saying that we should excuse Cuba's support for Maduro or  for the corrupt and repressive Ortega Government in Nicaragua.   What we are saying is that pursuing a policy that has failed for more  than half a century is nonsensical, indefensible, and wrong. It has  achieved none of its objectives, while it is harming the Cuban people  and infringing on the rights of the American people.   And if we are serious about controlling the spread of deadly viruses;  mitigating the effects of climate change; combating organized crime,  drug trafficking, and human trafficking; protecting fisheries and other  marine resources; addressing the causes of migration; expanding export  markets for American companies; and countering the influence of Russia  and China in this hemisphere, we need to engage with every one of our  neighbors whether we agree with their policies or not.   I hope the new National Security Advisor will review this policy. I  hope he will put it to the test of time and common sense. I hope he  will assess whether it is achieving its objectives and whether it is  serving our national interests. I hope he will ensure that the right  people, who will put the national interest first, are the architects of  our policy toward Cuba. And I hope he will consult widely on ways to  improve our  [[Page S6152]]  policy, rather than rely on a handful of extreme voices that are not  representative of the majority of the American people or the majority  of Members of Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today is World Polio Day, and I want to  comment briefly about the funding to support global polio eradication  efforts in the Senate version of the fiscal year 2020 Department of  State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which was reported  unanimously by the Appropriations Committee on September 26.   Polio is a highly infectious, crippling, and potentially fatal  disease. While there is no cure, there are safe and effective vaccines.  The global strategy to eradicate polio, therefore, focuses on  preventing infection by immunizing every child until transmission stops  and the world is polio-free.   Through the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, the  United States provides financial support and technical leadership  around the world to support the eradication strategy. USAID focuses  specifically on recognizing and raising the importance of identifying  and reaching mobile populations, cross-border coordination,  communications, and the need for more women vaccinators and community- based disease surveillance.   Since global polio eradication efforts began 30 years ago, when cases  numbered 350,000 annually, polio has been eliminated in more than 120  countries and remains endemic in only three--Afghanistan, Nigeria, and  Pakistan.   While significant progress has been made, much work remains. Cases of  polio persist in insecure areas and in countries with porous borders  and large migratory populations, posing considerable obstacles to  eradication. However, while there have been real setbacks, and the goal  posts continue to change, complacency is not an option.   To that end, the Appropriations Committee has recommended $61 million  in fiscal year 2020--an increase of $2 million over last year--for  USAID's polio eradication activities. Increased resources are necessary  to get over the finish line in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan, and  to demonstrate the continued U.S. commitment to polio eradication. It  is our hope that this increase will cause other donors to follow our  example.   I am not alone in my support for these activities. The State and  Foreign Operations Subcommittee heard from more than 20 members,  Republicans and Democrats, requesting funding for global polio  eradication efforts in fiscal year 2020.   So while many Senators have advocated for this critical funding, I  want to be sure that all 100 Senators are aware of these efforts which  are essential to achieving a polio-free world.                            ____________________
