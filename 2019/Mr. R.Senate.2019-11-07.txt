D. James, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. It  is a good-news project regarding the preservation of an important piece  of the history of the Northwest Territory and my home State of Ohio. It  is called the Barker House. It is a historic home that dates back  almost 200 years. It was built by the owner's father, who was a  Revolutionary War officer and a famous early settler and pioneer  architect in Ohio. A number of historic homes of his were built along  the Ohio River, and this is one of them that is still left standing.  Colonel Joseph Barker, Sr., was his name, and he is one of our most  famous early pioneers in Ohio.   The House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in  1979 for its historic significance. In fact, Joseph Barker, Sr., and  the houses he built play an important role in a new, award-winning book  by the great historian David McCullough, ``The Pioneers,'' and it tells  the story of the Northwest Territory and the founding of Ohio in the  wake of the Revolutionary War. In ``The Pioneers'' book, Colonel  Barker's stately homes were an anomaly out on the frontier. His own  home was described as ``a large, brick house in the Federal style, with  a handsome front door, flanked by recessed side windows and an  elliptical fanlight overhead. . . . [O]nce completed the whole house  was painted white, and soon became, as intended, a `distinguished seat  of hospitality.'''   This also describes the historic Barker House we are trying to  preserve.   These houses brought a level of architectural refinement that stood  in sharp contrast to the log cabins on the rugged landscape where these  pioneers were settling.   The Barker House is currently owned by the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers. It is owned by them because it sits right next to the Willow  Island Locks and Dam on the Ohio River. The house was used as office  space by the Corps back in the 1960s, and today, the house is still  standing. It is vacant, in bad shape, and unsafe to enter, but it is  savable.   I visited this historic Barker House back in September of 2018. I  learned then that the Corps was proposing to demolish the Barker House.  They then considered a proposal to move it brick by brick to a new  location off of Army Corps' land. Neither made sense.   That is when I met Jack Haessly, who led a group--along with Wesley  Clarke, Bill Reynolds, Bob Ferguson, and others--a local Barker House  friends group who said they would be willing to raise the money to  restore this home on its historic site overlooking the Ohio River. They  wanted to make sure it would be accessible to visitors there and made  into a museum.   I immediately called the Secretary, D. James of the Army Corps,  and  [[Page S6466]]  asked if he would reconsider the decision to demolish this historic  home. After hearing the story of the house and the details of the  group's plan to preserve it and after getting an assessment from the  Army Corps, Mr. James agreed to reverse the Corps' decision and to work  with us on preserving the home. He deserves great credit for that.   Congressman Bill Johnson, who represents the area, has also been an  excellent partner in pursuing these sensible solutions.   Right now, we are working on developing legislation that I hope to  introduce soon to convey the house and the surrounding land to the  friends group. We have made a lot of progress so far. Just last week,  the Corps completed drawings of the specific parcel proposed to be  conveyed, which also includes the creation of an access road so that  the house can be visited and enjoyed by the public. We appreciate the  Ohio Department of Transportation and Director Jack Marchbanks for  working with us on the road access. The road access issue was critical,  and ODOT was very helpful. The Ohio State Historic Preservation Office  has also jumped in and played a constructive role.   This is an example of a true public-private partnership, made  possible by Secretary James. I want to thank him, the Army Corps, his  team, the Barker House friends group, the Ohio Historic Preservation  Office, and ODOT. All of them are partnering with us to ensure that  this historic structure remains standing so it can tell the story of  our rich history for generations to come.                                   S. 1431    Mr. President, I am on the Senate floor today to talk about the  opportunity we have here in Congress to make substantial reforms to  address an issue that keeps a lot of Americans up at night, and that is  whether they are going to have enough money in their retirement.   I chair the Finance subcommittee that handles retirement and pension  issues, and I have worked to pass bipartisan legislation with then- Congressman Ben Cardin, now-Senator Ben Cardin, over the years. That  legislation has helped people save more in their IRAs and 401(k)s and  other retirement plans, but we still have a long way to go. In fact,  according to a recent study by Northwestern Mutual, two-thirds of  Americans believe they will outlive their retirement savings. People  are right to be worried.   Right now, way too many workers don't have access to a retirement  plan at all, and too many Americans who do have a plan are not saving  enough. Fewer than half of the employees at businesses with fewer than  50 workers have access to a plan, and only 34 percent of them  participate. That is where the major problem is. These are workers at  mom-and-pop shops, small manufacturers, and countless other employers  who make up the backbone of our economy.   We can and should do more to make sure these small business employees  are set up for retirement so that they can find peace of mind in their  retirement. What is more, only 22 percent of part-time workers today  have access to a plan--only 22 percent. More Americans can have access  to a retirement plan just by our making some simple changes in law.   A lot of Americans that do have a plan haven't saved enough, so they  are at risk of having their savings be inadequate for their increasing  lifespans. People are living longer, so this is a bigger problem.   Social Security is absolutely essential. It is great that that safety  net is there. It is necessary to cushion the retirement incomes for  Americans. But the average payout from Social Security is 1,400 bucks a  month. Try living on that. It is tough. A lot of people have a hard  time with that, so they need these extra retirement savings.   The lack of adequate retirement savings is made worse by the fact  that we have more and more baby boomers who are retiring, so we have a  bigger group in this category. And people are living longer. That is a  good thing, but it creates an additional challenge with regard to  retirement savings.   For all these reasons, we need to overhaul the laws governing the  private retirement system to help more people get access to workplace  savings plans, encourage savings to help our economy overall, and make  sure people don't outlive their savings in their retirement.   The good news is that we have that package before us right now here  in the Senate. It would go a long way toward making these changes. It  is called the SECURE Act, and it has already passed the House of  Representatives 5\1/2\ months ago by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of  417 to 3--that is right, 417 to 3. That never happens around here. This  is totally bipartisan. It is one of these issues where we would have an  opportunity to pass it and then send it directly to the President for  his signature, and he has said he would sign it. We are divided on so  many issues in Washington today, but this is one where we have a rare  chance for a truly bipartisan solution to a problem that is affecting  people in every single State represented in this body.   Today what was called a live UC was tried. It was an attempt to get a  vote on the SECURE Act--this legislation I am talking about--with five  amendments on each side. I support that, and I supported my colleagues  today who came forward to offer that. The amendments they outlined as  our five Republican amendments all make sense to me. Then the Democrats  were told: You should offer five amendments also. You all pick them.  Unfortunately, it was objected to by the other side. That didn't  surprise me because for the past 5\1/2\ months, some of us have been  trying to get this legislation done, and there are big concerns on both  sides of the aisle, but we are at a point now where we know, having  raised this live UC, that we continue to have this stalemate. After  5\1/2\ months, I think it is time for us to move forward on these  reforms.   Again, I like the amendments that were proposed today. As an example,  I agree that allowing 529 plans to be used for homeschooling expenses  makes sense. It is a reform Congress should take up, but this  underlying bill that almost every Republican in the House supported,  even without this provision, is one we also ought to take up. As  difficult as it is for us to give up on amendments on both sides, if  that can't be done because it gets blocked, then let's go ahead and  move the underlying legislation, the SECURE Act.   It is a worthwhile piece of legislation. It helps in a category where  we need help badly; that is, small businesses. They have an easier time  setting up retirement plans under the SECURE Act because the bill  increases tax credit for small businesses. In general, you get $500 now  for starting a retirement plan. That would be raised to $5,000. That is  a tenfold increase. Again, small businesses, where a major gap in  retirement plans are found, say that would be a significant incentive  for them to set up a retirement plan.   Second, it provides an annual tax credit to small businesses that  introduce automatic enrollment features into their plan. Small business  employees will have to opt out of saving for retirement as opposed to  opting in. These autoenrollment features are fantastic. The average  participation in a 401(k) in a midsize business is about 75 percent of  the employees. If it is autoenrollment, where you automatically enroll  unless you opt out, it is about 95 percent. This makes a lot of sense  to me. That is an innovative change in this legislation.   Third, it streamlines a lot of the existing regulations associated  with administering a plan so small business owners who already have a  lot on their plates can have an easier time focusing on retirement for  their employees rather than bureaucracy and redtape.   Perhaps most important to me, the bill allows small businesses to  participate in what is called open MEPs--open multiple employer defined  contribution plans. These are plans that allow businesses--some of  these small businesses we talked about earlier--even if they are not in  the same industry, they can come together to work together to set up a  joint plan for their employees. That becomes much more effective for  small businesses because they can share the administrative costs and  share some of the liability expenses. It has a lot of benefits for  these small employers and will result in more people I represent  getting a retirement plan.   In all, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this reform alone  would lead to 700,000 new retirement accounts for small business  workers who need access.  [[Page S6467]]    In my experience, that security really works. I grew up in a small  family business. My dad started his own business. When he had five  employees and my mom was the bookkeeper, he said they were going to set  up a retirement plan. It was called a profit-sharing plan at the time.  It was before a 401(k). They had no profit the first few years, so it  was a little awkward, but when they finally started making money,  everybody had a stake. Everybody got a little bit in their retirement  nest eggs. When 401(k)s came in, they immediately started a 401(k) plan  as well.   I meet people today whom I have known my entire life who turned a  wrench their whole careers as a lift truck technician--a lift truck  mechanic--who have a retirement savings plan now because of that. They  have a nice nest egg of about $500,000 to $600,000 that they were able  to accumulate. So I know this works. I know small businesses have the  opportunity to do more for their workers if we help them more here in  Washington. I am committed to trying to get this done.   Another important part of the SECURE Act has to do with older  Americans. It says we should raise the age limit that forces older  American workers to start depleting and paying taxes on their  retirement savings. Currently, at 70\1/2\ years old, you have to start  taking money out of your retirement plan. You have to do that whether  you are working or not. Many people at that age are still working. My  dad was still working at 70\1/2\. It drove him crazy that he had to  take money out while he was still working. He wanted to keep building  it up. So in this legislation, we say let's expand that to age 72.   Then, as important, the bill actually lifts the current prohibition  on IRA contributions by people over 70\1/2\. That means people can make  the choice if they want to keep investing in their retirement for as  long as they see fit. Remember, somebody who makes it to 70\1/2\ is  likely to live into his or her nineties. So there is still a lot of  time in retirement where you need to have that funding. That kind of  flexibility is how we allow people to manage their own retirement  savings that makes sense.   The SECURE Act is good for small businesses and good for older  Americans, but the reforms don't end there. It has a number of other  good provisions. In fact, one is particularly urgent. It reforms the  pension nondiscrimination laws I authored alongside my friend Senator  Ben Cardin. Our legislation is very simple. It says we have a glitch  right now in current law. We introduced it as separate legislation  earlier this year, but it has now been made part of the SECURE Act. It  is a critical piece of legislation to pass because if it doesn't pass-- and pass soon, like by the end of this year--400,000-plus Americans are  going to have their benefits frozen in their defined benefit plans. It  will affect 400,000 people through no fault of their own.   In recent years, many companies have transitioned from the  traditional defined benefit plans--think of that as a pension plan--to  a defined contribution plan like a 401(k). Some of them have elected to  grandfather existing employees by closing down their traditional DB  plans but allowing those who are there to continue to have the  benefits. Unfortunately, what happened is, as they build up seniority,  one of the rules in our current testing under 401(k) and profit-sharing  plans and defined benefit plans has come into effect. Inadvertently, it  has resulted in these plans not being able to continue to approve  benefits. It wasn't meant to work that way, but it has for a lot of  these people who are in these plans. As a result, again, 400,000  autoworkers are at risk of losing their benefits through no fault of  their own. Tens of thousands of other workers have already been  affected by these flawed rules.   We have to fix this. We tried to pass this by unanimous consent this  fall. This provision has no objection on the Republican side or the  Democratic side. Yet we were not able to get it done because some would  like to make it remain as part of the SECURE Act and be sure the SECURE  Act gets passed. The way to do this is let's pass the whole thing. The  SECURE Act makes sense. This particular provision is urgent. Let's not  wait. Do it now to help those 400,000 Americans representing States all  over the United States who are represented in this Chamber.   Let's pass the SECURE Act. It is a bill that does a lot to put us on  the right path. Does it do everything? No.   Senator Cardin and I introduced a comprehensive bill called the  Retirement Security and Savings Act. We go further in a lot of these  regards than we talked about today. That is a bill that requires more  hearings and a markup and more consideration.   In the meantime, let's do what we can. Let's provide more certainty,  more flexibility, and more retirement savings. I am hopeful we can pass  this broader legislation I have with Senator Cardin soon. In the  meantime, let's take advantage of the chance right here in front of us.  Let's be sure we boost the retirement security to the American people  through the SECURE Act. I hope my colleagues will all join me in this,  and we can pass this legislation as the House did--on a strong  bipartisan basis--and get it to the President for his signature.   I yield the floor.
