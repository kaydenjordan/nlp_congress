 Mr. Chair, the machine glitched. Had I been present, I  would have voted ``aye'' on rollcall No. 477.                   Amendment No. 47 Offered by Mrs. Boebert     Mr. Speaker, America's energy is critical toward our  economy, toward people of all income levels. Energy is the cornerstone  of either a strong economy or a hyperinflation one like we are seeing  now. Either government spending or the cost of energy or both are the  reasons why we are where we are these days.   Important things we could be doing are building more nuclear power  plants and offering more hydroelectric power as well as natural gas,  which we have so abundantly in this country.   Now, there are a lot of people worried about CO2, which is  only 0.04 percent of our atmosphere, but let's play along for a moment:  nuclear energy, zero CO2; hydroelectric power, zero  CO2.   What do we have happening? They are trying to, and successfully in my  district, get rid of hydroelectric dams that are already built and make  low-cost, 24/7 power.   They are after nuclear power plants until recently. California just  got a  5-year extension on its nuclear power plant. Otherwise, it was slated  to close in 2024 and 2025 its two reactors.   We can't afford to lose energy that is 24/7 available power for our  economy, for our sustenance. We need to build more.                            ____________________
