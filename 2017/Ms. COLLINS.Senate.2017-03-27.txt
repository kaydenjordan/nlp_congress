 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today in favor of the resolution  of ratification for Montenegro's accession to the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, better known as NATO.   Many of my colleagues are unaware of the fact that the State of Maine  has a special relationship with Montenegro. It is through the National  Guard State Partnership Program.   I thank the majority leader, Senator McConnell, Chairman Corker,  Senator McCain, the Democratic leadership, Senator Johnson, Senator  Murphy, and all of those who were instrumental in bringing this  resolution to the floor for consideration today.   Montenegro's accession to NATO will serve the strategic interests of  the United States, it will help to promote stability in the Balkans,  and it will make us safer. Montenegro has already proven its support  for American interests, having sent troops to Afghanistan in support of  NATO- and U.S.-led operations there. Although not yet a member of the  European Union, Montenegro also voluntarily joined the EU sanctions  regime against Russia in response to Moscow's illegal annexation of  Crimea and destabilizing actions in eastern Ukraine. Most important, I  have great confidence that Montenegro will meet the collective defense  obligations of NATO membership.   For the past 10 years, with the assistance of the Maine National  Guard through the State Partnership Program, Montenegro has worked hard  to reform its military and to strengthen the rule of law to come into  compliance with NATO requirements, as defined in NATO's Membership  Action Plan. Even today, Maine National Guard members are deployed to  Montenegro to assist its Ministry of Defense in furthering its  integration into NATO standards and processes.   I want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to all of  the  [[Page S1993]]  members of the Maine National Guard who have participated in this  operation, including the former and current adjutant general, GEN Bill  Libby and GEN Doug Farnham, as well as our current guardsman stationed  in Montenegro, Army CPT Nicolas Phillips. All of them have worked very  hard during the past 10 years to help Montenegro get ready for this  highly significant moment.   We must be clear-eyed about the fact that the Russian Federation has  undertaken an extensive overt and covert campaign to derail  Montenegro's bid to join NATO. These efforts include a brazen plot to  disrupt Montenegro's elections last October and to turn the public  against the pro-NATO ruling government there. According to Montenegro's  special prosecutor assigned to the investigation, at least two Russian  intelligence officers actively participated in this plot, which  fortunately was disrupted.    Ratifying Montenegro's NATO membership demonstrates our firm resolve  against Russia's efforts to deny other countries the opportunity to  participate in NATO free from outside interference. That is why the  Supreme Allied Commander for Europe and NATO testified just last week  before the Senate Armed Services Committee that it is ``absolutely  critical'' that Montenegro join NATO.   As President Trump prepares to travel to the NATO leaders' summit in  Brussels at the end of May, I can think of no better action for the  Senate to have taken ahead of his visit than our action tonight to  finally ratify Montenegro's membership in NATO. In the meantime, I also  look forward to the continued special relationship between Montenegro  and the great State of Maine.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
