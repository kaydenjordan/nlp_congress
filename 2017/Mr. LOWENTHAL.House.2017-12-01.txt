 Mr. Speaker, I want to quote from one of my colleagues  from California: ``Eliminating the State and local tax deduction would  assure that almost all of the bill's tax cuts would be distributed to  other States, leaving California with the bill.''   That was from my Republican colleague, Darrell Issa.   Mr. Speaker, he was right on this. The Republican tax plan is cruel  in so many ways. But perhaps the worst provision specifically targets  States like California, New York, and New Jersey.   Our States have stepped into the breach left by the Federal  Government. We have raised taxes to pay for infrastructure. We have  raised taxes to pay for hospitals. We have raised taxes to pay for  schools.   Now the Republicans want to punish us?   Mr. Speaker, this is a political game, plain and simple. Californians  are smart enough to see through it.                            ____________________
