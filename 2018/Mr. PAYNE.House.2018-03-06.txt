 Mr. Speaker, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause  of death for men and women combined. It is a silent killer because the  disease often has no signs or symptoms. Each year, more than 50,000  Americans die from colorectal cancer even though it is mostly  preventable and treatable if caught early.   Six years ago today, my father, the late Congressman Donald Payne,  died from colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer screening just wasn't  something people of his generation did.   Mr. Speaker, my father might have lived had he gotten tested for  colorectal cancer. That is why each year I sponsor a resolution to  recognize March as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, a time  to educate the public about the disease and the need for screening.   By educating people, increasing research funding, and making Medicare  coverage better for seniors, we can save tens of thousands of lives  each year.   I would rather not have to make this 1-minute speech every year, to  have my father still be a Member of Congress from the 10th  Congressional District.                            ____________________
