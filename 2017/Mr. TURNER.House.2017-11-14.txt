 Madam Speaker, today I rise to thank and honor an  integral member of my community, Director Glenn Costie of the Dayton VA  Medical Center, and congratulate him on his retirement.   Director Costie turned the Dayton VA into one of the top medical  facilities for our veterans in the country. Director Costie's success  as a director of the VA Medical Center in Dayton has gained him  national recognition. He has been sent throughout the country to save  multiple VA medical facilities plagued with issues, particularly  including veteran patient backlogs.   Furthermore, Director Costie has worked tirelessly to integrate the  Dayton VA into our community to serve our veterans in a way that it  hadn't in several decades. Director Costie's time at the VA has been  dedicated to bettering the lives of our veterans.   I was very honored to work with Director Costie on the issue of  bringing creative housing options for Dayton's veterans, a place known  as Lyons Place II. We also worked together on the successful campaign  to bring the VA National Archives to Dayton.   Director Costie's leadership and expertise will be deeply missed at  the Dayton VA. I wish to thank him, give him all the best, and look  forward to what he will be doing in his leadership in the future in our  community, and I thank him again for everything he has done for Dayton  veterans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2810, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.   I strongly support this bill, and I want to personally thank our  chairman, Mac Thornberry, for his work in trying to get a higher top  line for defense. This bill comes in higher than the President's budget  request, but it is in line with both the appropriations and the budget  document that came out of the House.   This bill authorizes $634.2 billion in the base budget, a much-needed  increase over the original budget request, and fully supports many of  the unfunded requirements identified by the Department that totaled  more than $30 billion. The $634.2 billion authorization is essential.  Anything less dramatically handicaps our ability to restore military  readiness over nearly a decade of neglect.   This increased base budget funding for fiscal year 2018 begins the  long process to rebuild our military's full spectrum readiness from  years of deferred modernization brought on by the failed assumptions  from the previous administrations's Budget Control Act and  sequestration.   Within the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee's jurisdiction,  this bill authorizes over $12 billion in additional funds to address  unfunded modernization requirements and critical capabilities gaps.   If we do not begin, with this budget, to set favorable conditions to  start to reverse the high-risk defense posture we currently have, we  will significantly jeopardize our military's advantage that we have  taken for granted in past conflicts and steady-state operations.   As such, the bill recognizes the importance of land forces in current  and future operations and authorizes over $2 billion to accelerate  armored brigade combat team modernization, to include additional Abrams  tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles.   The bill authorizes strike fighter capability and capacity shortfalls  and authorizes over $3 billion in additional funding to procure new  fifth-generation aircraft and modernize our fourth-generation fleet.  These projects address unfunded requirements for the Air Force, Navy,  and Marine Corps.   The bill also continues to address the needs of the National Guard  and Reserve components by authorizing an additional $250 million for  their equipment and modernization.   This bill prevents the Air Force from reducing critical ISR  capabilities.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
