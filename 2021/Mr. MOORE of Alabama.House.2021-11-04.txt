 Madam Speaker, President Reagan said it: The  government's idea on the economy is when it is moving, you tax it; if  it keeps moving, you regulate it; when it fails, you subsidize it.   If the government would stop taxing and regulating, we wouldn't need  the subsidizing. The Democrats are the champions of Big Government  because they would rather gain power through taxes and regulations than  see our economy actually grow. That is what their tax-and-spend agenda  is all about, it is power.   Today, the Biden economic crisis is raging, yet President Biden and  Speaker Pelosi are pushing the made in America tax that will only  aggravate the crisis facing all of America. The made in America tax  policy will drive up taxes on U.S. firms and workers both at home and  in every country they do business in around the world.   This bill would also create a complex, parallel tax system that  punishes investment in American production, permanently stop key  domestic mineral development, and allow China to continue to have a  monopoly on critical mineral markets.   The Democrats' made-in-America tax would give more power to  Washington, but make it better for a foreign company or a foreign  worker than for an American worker.   We need leaders in Washington who will put Americans first.                            ____________________
