 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the work  Congress is undertaking to make historic investments in our Nation's  infrastructure and create millions of good-paying jobs in communities  across our country, coast to coast, communities just like mine.   Cities like Toledo, Sandusky, Lorain, Lakewood, Cleveland, Parma, for  too long have received far fewer resources than are needed to keep pace  with life in this 21st century.   As we look around our country right now, we bear witness to historic  water shortages in Lake Mead. On the other hand, in my region of the  country, we have historic high water levels in the Great Lakes.  Meanwhile, we have raging wildfires in California. We have watched  power blackouts in Texas; torrential rains and flooding in New York  City, in Dearborn, Michigan, and rural farmlands outside Nashville; as  well as hurricanes that have been ravaging States throughout the Gulf  of Mexico.   Truly, in this new century, we must set a firmer course to sustain  life in our country and, yes, sustain life on Mother Earth herself.   As a Representative from the Great Lakes, I can say without a shadow  of a doubt that Lake Erie and the economies and people who truly rely  on it face growing environmental challenges unlike any we have seen  before.   The Great Lakes are the largest source of freshwater on Earth, and  surely on this continent. They are responsible for transporting our  Nation's heavy manufacturing materials from ports to factories, support  our commercial and defense capabilities, and serve as the lifeblood for  our industrial heartland.   But the changing climate is impacting these majestic waters,  requiring sizable investments to correct and overcome.   Recently, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  included $350 million for a new state-of-the-art--get ready--Great  Lakes heavy icebreaker for our region. Some Members of Congress said,  ``Oh, you have ice?'' Let me tell you, in the winter, yes, we do. This  investment will ensure that for decades to come the thousands of miles  of shipping lanes of the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence Seaway, our  Nation's longest coastline, are navigable, and that the materials that  make our country run are able to be delivered and that our freshwater  bounty is preserved for the future.   I want to especially thank Chairman Peter DeFazio of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for taking up this request  from our bipartisan House Great Lakes Task Force.   As co-chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water,  our members delivered the funding bill necessary to turbocharge  investments in coastal resiliency across our country; in home  weatherization programs, as climate changes from coast to coast; to  modernize the Soo Locks, essential for industry as well as the defense  of this Nation; and to focus on next-generation energy, solar energy  technology, and technologies we are inventing. In hydrogen, in various  types of thermal water technologies there is so much where America will  lead the world in inventions for the future.   To succeed, we have to make sure these investments make it through  this Congress and that infrastructure investment makes it to President  Biden's desk. Old infrastructure is crumbling, as our climate is  changing, and we are running out of time.   We know that a functioning Soo Locks system between Lake Superior and  the rest of the Great Lakes, for example, supports more than 11 million  jobs. That is a ``wow'' by any measure.   And we know that clean energy technologies, like solar and wind, are  vital to powering our Nation and producing clean and affordable energy,  and building our future right here, right now at home.   In northern Ohio, we have brilliant workers at innovative companies  like Toledo Solar and First Solar that are developing the revolutionary  solar panels that will power homes, businesses, and factories in every  corner of our Nation.   We are literally building the change forward right now, providing for  our domestic energy security and independence.   But companies like these need workers, and workers need training, and  that is what the infrastructure and jobs bill will allow us to do,  build back better for America's tomorrow, as President Biden knows we  must.   We are talking about good-paying, middle-class jobs. We are talking  about investing in climate resilience and environmental conservation  that restores communities, puts people to work, and ensures our  families have wages that meet their needs and allow them to buy the  vitals they need for life.                            ____________________
