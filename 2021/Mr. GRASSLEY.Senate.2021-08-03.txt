 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor because I am greatly  concerned as to whether the Department of Justice is committed to  fighting the violent crime committed by the gang known as MS-13.   MS-13 is a violent gang that operates on the streets of the United  States and throughout Mexico and Central America. MS-13's informal  motto is--can you believe this--``kill, steal, rape, and control.''   Under the Trump administration, the Department established a task  force to fight the murders and other serious crimes committed by MS-13  gang members, but the Department of Justice hasn't released any news or  updates on this task force, called Task Force Vulcan, since way back on  January 14 of this year. Right before President Biden's inauguration is  when that January 14 date was. So you can see we haven't seen anything  since this President has been sworn in. So we have no idea what the  Department of Justice is doing to combat MS-13.   From 2017 to 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection found or  arrested over 3 million people, averaging about 750,000 people a year.  In that same time period, Border Patrol apprehended an average of 294  MS-13 gang members every year.   This year, however, Customs and Border Protection has already  encountered or arrested over 1.2 million, well above the previous  averages. But, this year, Customs and Border Protection has only  apprehended 71 MS-13 members trying to enter the United States,  suggesting many dangerous MS-13 gang members are successfully sneaking  past Border Patrol as agents are focused on dealing with unaccompanied  children at the border or asylum seekers.   One Border Patrol chief in Laredo stated that MS-13 members are using  the high number of migrants entering the United States to blend in and  get past agents. We know MS-13 is still trying to sneak into the  country; however, they are just more successful now.   Customs and Border Protection is still arresting MS-13 members when  they can identify them. In April alone, Customs and Border Protection  arrested an MS-13 member who was a convicted felon with an outstanding  warrant and one female MS-13 member traveling with a convicted  murderer.   Here, next to the Capitol, police in Maryland arrested an MS-13  member after he lured a 15-year-old girl into an apartment and tried to  rape her.   So even if Border Patrol agents in the field and local police are  doing their best to stop MS-13, we still don't know what the Department  of Justice is doing about MS-13 since they haven't released any updates  on Task Force Vulcan since January. We don't even know if Task Force  Vulcan still exists. This is a problem because we know MS-13 is  ruthlessly operating on American streets.   Congress and the American people deserve to know what the Department  of Justice is doing to keep our streets safe and to keep us safe from  dangerous criminal organizations like MS-13. So I will be seeking  answers to this question from the Department of Justice. It is a pretty  basic question: Do you have anything to update the American people  about? We should know what the status of all this is.                                  H.R. 3684    Mr. President, on another matter, President Biden and his allies in  Congress are champing at the bit to grease the wheels for a partisan  $3.5 trillion spending spree before they leave for the August break. At  a time when our national debt is set to exceed levels not seen since  World War II, this is not only irresponsible, but dangerous.   Hard-working Americans are already paying the price for excess  spending in the form of inflation, with prices rising throughout the  economy. And, of course, poll after poll shows Americans are becoming  increasingly concerned about inflation.   Instead of adding to these concerns in the pursuit of wish-list  priorities, Congress should focus on addressing the real priorities of  the American people. For instance, we should be taking action to  address the crisis at our southern border. In June, U.S. Customs and  Border Protection encountered 188,000 people. That is up 471 percent  from the same time last year.   As a result of the Biden administration's irresponsible immigration  policies, Customs and Border Protection has encountered over 1.1  million illegal  [[Page S5705]]  immigrants at the southern border during this fiscal year. That is five  times larger than the population of Iowa's capital city, Des Moines.   The crisis is undeniable. The Senate Democrats are trying hard to  deny it. Instead of taking action to secure our borders and deter  illegal immigration, Senate Democrats are attempting to use a reckless  tax-and-spending bill to offer amnesty to millions of illegal  immigrants living in the United States.   It is deeply irresponsible. It will only encourage more of this  illegal immigration, and it will only make the border crisis worse.   Illegal immigration isn't the only crime cascading over the border.  Mexican cartels are pouring record high amounts of hard drugs-- methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl--across the border with  impunity.   Fentanyl has become the choice drug because it is highly potent and,  of course, highly profitable, particularly for the cartels. A tiny  amount, even as small as a grain of salt, can result in an overdose  and, of course, in death. Fentanyl is increasingly laced into other  drugs, which heightens potency, often without the user even knowing it.   In 2020, over 93,000 Americans died from drug overdoses. That is  almost the entire population of Davenport, IA. The primary driver of  this surge in overdose deaths is fentanyl coming in from  Mexico. Instead of working on curbing cartels at the border and cutting  off their extensive power in the United States, Senate Democrats choose  to bury their heads in the sand and pretend that fentanyl isn't deadly.    The border crisis is, then, very obviously a drug crisis.   And on top of that, police departments across the country are still  having a hard time getting enough officers. Violent crime is soaring.  Homicide rates are through the roof.   Iowa families don't redecorate their houses when the plumbing is  leaking.   These issues are dinner table issues. So Congress must focus on them,  instead of on reckless and partisan spending proposals that are going  on in the U.S. Senate now by the majority party.                             Taxpayer Information    Mr. President, in the past few weeks, there has been a lot of talk  about increasing IRS enforcement to bring in more money to the  government. That would be fine if we could trust the IRS to keep  taxpayer information safe and secure and actually using that  information to enforce the Tax Code.   Now, unfortunately, that notion is waffling on pretty shaky ground at  this very moment.   In June, the nonprofit journalism web page ProPublica began  publishing stories that appear to contain confidential taxpayer  information that might have come from the IRS. Unfortunately, attention  is focused more on the private tax affairs of the victims of these  actions than on the apparently illegal actions taken to produce the  data that forms the basis of these ProPublica stories.   By law, the confidentiality of taxpayer information is sacrosanct.  That comes from section 6103 of the Tax Code, a section that was put in  law in the 1970s, I believe, to see that what Nixon did to use the IRS  to go after his enemies never happened again.   So why is this information sacrosanct? Because a Federal income tax  return contains some of the most sensitive information that there is  about our fellow Americans. A tax return is essentially a blueprint for  how families and individuals live their lives. Aside from detailing  where and how taxpayers support themselves and earn money, tax returns  potentially detail what charities, including even religious  institutions, that a taxpayer supports. Tax returns can also detail  where and how they take care of their children, their medical status,  and lots of other deeply personal information.   In part to promote tax compliance, Congress decided that in exchange  for collecting sensitive information needed to enforce the Internal  Revenue Code, the IRS must treat this information carefully and protect  it from unauthorized access and disclosure. That is what section 6103  is all about. It carries with it significant criminal and civil  penalties for any violations of those terms.   Nevertheless, the ProPublica stories published in a series entitled  ``The Secret IRS Files Inside the Tax Records of the .001%'' are  plainly derived from the confidential taxpayer information.   The folks in charge of enforcing the Tax Code quickly recognized that  they had a big problem here. That very morning, IRS Commissioner Rettig  was testifying before the Senate Finance Committee and said that he  appreciated the confidential nature of the information collected by the  IRS and how very important it is that people are able to trust the IRS  with that information.   Commissioner Rettig isn't the only Treasury official to express that  concern. When asked about this apparent abuse of taxpayer information  at the Finance Committee hearing on the President's fiscal 2022 budget  request, held on June 16, Treasury Secretary Yellen said she agreed the  situation was very serious and that the matter had been referred to the  Justice Department.   The week before, appearing before a different Senate Committee,  Attorney General Garland also said this was a very serious matter and  that people are entitled to the privacy regarding their tax  information.   I agree with Commissioner Rettig, Secretary Yellen, and Attorney  General Garland that the apparent leak of confidential information is a  very serious issue.   For one thing, we don't know exactly where the information came from.  Was it a leak? Was it a hack? We don't seem to know. We also don't know  the full scope of the information at risk.   According to ProPublica, it has ``obtained a vast trove of Internal  Revenue Service data on the tax returns of thousands of the Nation's  wealthiest people, covering more than 15 years.''   Let me say that again. ProPublica claims that it has thousands of tax  returns   Americans know the risk of having their private information unsecured  in the wind. They know the risk, for example, of fraud and identity  theft. And, of course, Nixon's political enemies knew the risk of  letting the IRS run loose.   According to the most recent IRS Electronic Tax Administration  Advisory Committee Annual Report to Congress, issued in June of 2021,  185,000 identity theft affidavits were filed with the IRS in 2020. The  report also notes that due to pandemic relief, higher levels of  identity theft are expected during the 2021 filing season.   Sure, in this case, ProPublica has decided that the wealthiest  individuals are the ones worth targeting. But again, we don't know the  full scope of the information that is at risk. Maybe you are not the  owner of a sports team or the head of a multinational company or  haven't built a vehicle in which you have recently traveled to outer  space. The unauthorized access and disclosure of taxpayer information  should be a concern to all taxpayers. If someone can expose the most  private and sensitive information of the Nation's wealthiest citizens,  they can do it to anyone.   Regardless of what anyone thinks about the known victims of this  disclosure, no one should be absolutely confident that their  information hasn't been compromised.   As soon as the apparent disclosure of taxpayer information was known,  I pressed authorities in the executive branch to take action. I  questioned Commissioner Rettig about it during the Finance Committee  hearing that very day. Three days later, I sent a letter with Leader  McConnell and Finance Ranking Member Crapo. I sent this letter with  those two individuals to Attorney General Garland and FBI Director  Christopher Wray, asking them to take action on this very important  matter.   In part, the letter reads:         Find those responsible for these disclosures and ensure       they are punished as directed by law. Unless you do, ordinary       Americans will fall victim to these politicalized and       criminal disclosures, and trust in the IRS and our tax system       will continue to erode.    That is the end of the quote of the letter I sent with Leader  McConnell and Finance Ranking Member Crapo.   On the same day, I joined every other Republican on the Finance  Committee on a letter to the Treasury inspector general for the Tax  Administration, asking for an immediate investigation.   Following Treasury Secretary Yellen's June 16 appearance before the  Finance Committee, I also submitted several questions to her in  writing. My  [[Page S5706]]  questions asked pretty simple questions about the scope of the leak and  the hack and whether or not anyone with advanced knowledge of the first  ProPublica piece had reached out to the Treasury or to the IRS.   On June 16, I sent a letter to Attorney General Garland and FBI  Director Wray, with other Judiciary Committee Republicans, seeking a  briefing and a confirmation that the FBI or the Department of Justice  is investigating. Now, as usual, I have not received a single response  to any of my written inquiries.   There appears to be a massive flaw somewhere in our system of tax  administration. Our job, through constitutional oversight, is to  determine exactly what this situation is, how it happened, and how we  can fix it.   Unfortunately, it appears that some are using the apparent illegal  disclosure of taxpayer information and the violation of taxpayer rights  to advance a partisan agenda. That probably doesn't surprise a lot of  people, that politics would be involved in this.   It is important to note that the ProPublica pieces aren't talking  about tax evasion but, generally, tax avoidance, which is a legal  minimization of taxes owed.   On June 24, ProPublica published a story about Roth IRAs, using the  information of a wealthy tech investor. The purpose of this story was  to show that this investor ``and other ultrawealthy investors have used  them to amass vast untaxed fortunes.''   The next day, on June 5, ProPublica published a story highlighting a  senior Democratic Senator's legislation intended to crackdown on large  Roth IRA accounts, the same type of accounts criticized in the previous  day's articles.   And you are talking about abuse of Roth IRAs? It is in the law.   A different ProPublica story seemed intended to wield private  taxpayer information to affect the outcome of an election.   Now, listen to this. On June 16, ProPublica published a story  containing taxpayer information of a candidate in the Democratic  primary to be the next district attorney of Manhattan. It seems to me  like somebody is using political things to hurt people in their own  political party.   Given how concerned many of my colleagues have been about potential  election interference, I am really very shocked that this story  completely missed their attention.   If a candidate's confidential, legally protected information is  somehow disclosed less than a week before an election, especially when  we don't know the ultimate source of the confidential information or  how it was even obtained, shouldn't that raise a red flag to a lot of  people in this town or does it only matter depending upon who the  candidate is?   Finally, I want to address ProPublica's role in this situation.   Although they may be very well-intentioned, in my opinion, they are  facilitating an abuse of power by publishing stolen confidential  information of individual citizens who are, by all appearances,  complying with their legal obligations. They think they are informing  the public of information they need to know. They are really telling  the public that their tax return information is not private. That could  have serious consequences for the proper administration of our tax laws  that are based on the proposition that people are going to give honest,  correct information because they know it is going to be public and  because they owe taxes and they are honest people.   Plainly, this isn't about tax cheats who broke the law; it is about  certain people not paying what ProPublica thinks they should pay  regardless if they are paying every dollar that the law requires that  they pay. So it is really about promoting changes to tax law that  ProPublica and certain Members of this body would support. The identity  of specific taxpayers that we know have had their information violated  is not an excuse.   The notion that taxpayers' information--every taxpayer's  information--should be protected is not a view only held by this  Senator. I have quoted the Treasury Secretary; I have quoted the  Attorney General--all holding that same view.   The use of this information to advance partisan objectives and,  apparently, to influence an election should concern all of us. We need  to get to the bottom of what happened. We need to know what taxpayer  information is at risk, how many taxpayers have been compromised, and  then determine what we can do going forward.   So I implore Secretary Yellen and Attorney General Garland to respond  to my questions and my letters so that we can get on with our very  important work.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
