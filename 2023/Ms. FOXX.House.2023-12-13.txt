 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1147.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1147. It is Christmastime  across America. For many, the season brings with it the annual return  of cherished Christmas traditions, such as leaving milk and cookies out  for Santa Claus and his reindeer to enjoy.   As for my family, our traditional choice of dairy has always been  whole milk. We want only the most nutritious option for Santa.    The nutrients in whole milk, like protein, calcium, and vitamin D,  provide the fuel Santa needs to travel the whole globe in one night.  Whole milk is the unsung hero of his Christmas journey.   Protein helps build and repair Santa's muscles. Hoisting heavy sacks  of gifts up and down the chimney is no easy task.   Calcium is vital for strong bones. It is calcium that keeps Santa  strong and sturdy as he dashes from rooftop to rooftop.   Vitamin D is essential to a strong immune system. Santa absolutely  needs one as he braves the cold, wintry night. You see, it is not just  the magic of the season that helps Santa deliver presents worldwide, it  is also the fortifying nutrients in whole milk.   Reflecting on Christmas traditions this year begs the question: If  whole milk is a good option to fuel Santa's extraordinary Christmas Eve  journey, then why isn't it an option for American schoolchildren in  their lunchrooms?   That is why I support Representative G.T. Thompson's Whole Milk For  Healthy Kids Act, a bill allowing unflavored and flavored whole milk to  be offered in school cafeterias.   Since 2012, the National School Lunch and Breakfast Program has  allowed only low-fat and fat-free milk options for American  schoolchildren. This means 2 percent and whole milk have been excluded  from the daily diets of an entire generation of kids.   The USDA intends to finalize another rule which will further limit  milk options. Anti-milk advocates advance one main argument against  whole milk: that whole milk is bad for kids.                                time  1400    Rather, milk has 13 essential nutrients that are needed for children  to live healthy lives and succeed in school. It is an essential  ingredient to growth and development. Research shows that whole milk is  associated with a neutral or lower risk of heart disease and obesity.   Moreover, the USDA contradicts itself by limiting milk options for  young children. On one hand, it recognizes that children are at risk of  underconsuming dairy, yet on the other, it creates policies that will  only exacerbate the problem.   If Americans have learned anything from these past 3 years, it is  that scientific authorities tend to contradict themselves. The truth is  that whole milk is a significant source of vital nutrients for  children's growth and development. The Federal bureaucracy should never  stand between your children and a nutritious lunch.   The Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act isn't about advocating for one  type of milk over another. It is about providing parents, schools, and  food service providers with the option to choose what is best for our  children's nutrition.   This act does not aim to diminish the importance of other milk  varieties. Rather, it seeks to restore the availability of a wholesome,  natural option that has been a staple for generations. This bill is  about choice. It is a chance to empower parents and schools to make  informed choices about what goes into our children's diets.   Whether it is a nutritional foundation for Santa's journey or your  child's math homework, let's not discount the benefits of whole milk.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would just like to tell my colleague something  that I think will be easy to remember about why we are doing this.  Scientists/experts built the Titanic, and amateurs built the ark.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, we are very concerned about waste. One of the reasons  there is so much waste is because whole milk is not allowed, and  children don't like the taste of skim milk.   We are putting children first. We are not excluding soy drink. It is  not milk. It is a plant-based food. It isn't milk, so you can't call it  soy milk. You can call it soy drink.   It was under our first African-American President in this country  that this was designed this way. The First Lady pushed through these  rules and regulations to exclude whole milk, which, by the way, my  colleague says has an enormous amount more fat.   The fat content of whole milk is about 3\1/2\ percent. We are  foisting on children 1\1/2\ percent milk, which doesn't have a very  good taste to many of them. We are excluding them from 3\1/2\ percent.  We do not exclude soy drink. This is about inclusion and equity. We  want people to be able to drink the kind of milk they want to drink.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the author of this legislation.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Miller), who is the vice chair of the Education and the  Workforce Committee.    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record two scientific articles.   [From the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy]  Dairy Foods, Obesity, and Metabolic Health: The Role of the Food Matrix                       Compared with Single Nutrients                          (By Dariush Mozaffarian)                                 Introduction         Conventional dietary guidelines from around the globe have       focused on individual nutrients to maintain and improve       health and prevent disease. This is due to the historical       focus, developed in the last century, on single nutrients in       relation to clinical nutrient deficiency diseases. However,       this reductionist approach is inappropriate for translation       to chronic diseases.        A look back at the history of modern nutrition science       provides important perspectives on the origins of the       reductionist approach to nutrition. In 1747, the British       sailor and physician James Lind tested whether citrus fruits       prevented scurvy, but it was not until 1932 that vitamin C       was actually isolated, synthesized, and proven to be the       relevant ingredient. The period of the 1930s to 1950s was a       golden era of vitamin discovery, when all the major vitamins       were identified, isolated, and synthesized, and shown to be       the active constituents of foods relevant for nutrient       deficiency diseases such as pellagra (niacin), beriberi       (thiamine), rickets (vitamin D), and night blindness (vitamin       A). This scientific focus on nutrient deficiencies coincided       with global geopolitics, in particular the Great Depression       and World War II, which accentuated concerns about       insufficient food and nutrients. For example, the birth of       RDAs was at the National Nutrition Conference on Defense in       1941, which focused on identifying the individual nutrients       needed to prevent nutrient deficiencies in order to have a       population ready for war. Together, these scientific and       historical events led to the concept of food as a delivery       system for calories and specific isolated nutrients.        It was not until the 1980s that modern nutrition science       began to meaningfully consider nutrition in association with       chronic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes,       cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer. Intuitively, the       reductionist paradigm that had been so successful in reducing       the prevalence of nutrient deficiency diseases was extended       to chronic diseases. Thus, saturated fat became ``the'' cause       of heart disease, whereas now, excess calories and fat are       ``the'' causes of obesity.        What recent advances in nutrition science have       demonstrated, however, is that although a single-nutrient       focus works well for prevention of deficiency diseases, such       as scurvy or beriberi, this approach generally fails for       chronic diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD),       stroke, type 2 diabetes, or obesity. For such complex       conditions, the focus should be on foods.                           Calories in/Calories out         The US obesity epidemic is a recent phenomenon, starting in       the mid-1980s, and the rise of obesity globally is even more       recent. The strategies to address this epidemic have not yet       caught up with advances in nutrition science. Most current       dietary recommendations and policies across the globe remain       calorie and fat focused, recommending foods based on these       reductionist metrics rather than their complex, empirically       determined effects on health. For example, nearly all       guidelines recommend low-fat or nonfat dairy foods to reduce       calories, total fat, and saturated fat in the diet, based on       the theory that this will help maintain a healthy weight and       reduce the risk of CVD. This is seen, for example, in the       2015-2020 US Dietary Guidelines; National School Lunch       Program, NIH Dietary Guidelines for Kids; and CDC Diabetes       Prevention Program.        However, foods are not simply a collection of individual       components, such as fat and calories, but complex matrices       that have correspondingly complex effects on health and       disease. Recommendations based on calorie or fat contents       fail to consider the complex effects of different foods,       independent of their calories, on the body's multiple,       redundant mechanisms for weight control, from the brain to       the liver, the microbiome, and hormonal and metabolic       responses. This growing evidence indicates that different       foods, calorie-for-calorie, have different effects on the       risk of long-term weight gain and success of weight       maintenance.                            Dairy Foods and Weight         Although dairy products contribute  cents10       percent of all calories in the US diet, until recently,       little direct research had evaluated the health effects of       different dairy foods. The complex ingredients and matrices       of different dairy foods, from milk to yogurt to cheese,       appear to have varying effects on weight.        Although considerable research has focused on optimal diets       for weight loss among obese individuals (secondary       prevention), fewer studies have evaluated determinants of       gradual weight gain (primary prevention). Among nonobese US       adults, the average weight gain is  centslb (0.45       kg) per year. This represents a very slow, modest increment,       but when sustained over many years, this small annual weight       gain drives the obesity epidemic. This gradual pace also       makes it difficult, if not impossible, for individuals to       identify specific causes or remedies.        To identify specific dietary factors associated with long-      term weight gain, we performed prospective investigations       among 3 separate cohorts that included 120,877 US men and       women who were free of chronic disease and not obese at       baseline. We examined weight gain every 4 y, for up to 24 y       of follow-up, and its association with the increased intake       of individual foods. Within each 4-y period, participants       gained an average of 3.35 lb. On the basis of increased daily       servings of different foods, those strongly linked to weight       gain were generally carbohydrate-rich, including potato chips       (per daily serving, 1.69 lb greater weight gain every 4 y),       other potatoes/fries (1.28 lb), sugar-sweetened beverages       (1.00 lb), sweets (0.65 lb), and refined grains (0.56 lb).       Other foods were not linked to weight gain, even when then       intake was increased, including cheese, low-fat milk, and       whole milk. Other foods were actually related to less weight       gain: the more they were consumed, the less weight was       gained. This included vegetables (-0.22 lb), whole grains       (-0.37 lb), fruits (-0.49 lb), nuts (-0.57 lb), and yogurt       (-0.82 lb) When sweetened vs. plain yogurt were evaluated,       each was associated with relative weight loss, although when       sweetened, about half the benefit was lost.        What could explain these findings? We hypothesize that       different foods have varying effects on multiple redundant       mechanisms for weight gain, including effects on hunger and       fullness, glucose, insulin and other hormonal responses, de       novo fat synthesis by the liver, gut microbiome responses;       and the body's metabolic rate.        Based on these findings, certain foods, when consumed over       the long term can have relatively neutral effects on weight,       others promote weight gain, whereas still others promote       weight loss.        Interestingly, although we found that cheese, low-fat milk,       and whole-fat milk were each unassociated with weight change,  [[Page H6897]]       there is evidence that dairy foods may promote healthier body       composition. Consistent with our findings, a systematic       review and meta-analysts of 37 randomized clinical trials       with 184,802 participants, which assessed the effect of dairy       consumption on weight and body composition, found that       overall, dairy consumption had little effect on BMI. Body       composition, however, changed significantly. Dairy       consumption led to a reduction in fat mass (0.23 kg) and an       increase in lean body mass (0.37 kg). Overall, high-dairy       intervention increased body weight (0.01, 95 percent CI:       -0.25, 0.26), and lean mass (0.37, 95 percent CI: 0.11,       0.62); decreased body fat (-0.23, 95 percent CI: -0.48, 0.02)       and waist circumference (-1.37 95 percent CI: -2.28, -0.46).        In subgroup analyses, such effects appeared larger in       trials also having energy restriction, but such subgroup       findings should be interpreted cautiously The types and       frequency of dairy products consumed varied among these       trials, making it difficult to make distinctions in this       meta-analysis about the effects of different types of dairy       products such as low-fat or whole fat, or milk, yogurt, or       cheese. When viewed in combination with our long-term       observational findings, the joint results suggest that dairy       foods do not promote weight gain, that dairy consumption may       reduce body fat and augment muscle mass, and that the type of       dairy product (milk compared with cheese compared with       yogurt) may be more important for preventing long-term weight       gain than the dairy fat content.                 Dairy Foods, Probiotics, and the Microbiome         Many pathways appear relevant to the concept that foods       cannot be judged on calorie content alone for risk of       obesity. Among these, the gut microbiome is particularly       interesting. Substantial evidence demonstrates that the       quality of the diet strongly influences the gut microbiome.       Among different factors, probiotics have been studied for       their effect on the microbiome; as well as potential benefits       of fermented foods, which may be greater than the sum of       their individual microbial, nutritive, or bioactive       components.        For example, in an experimental model, mice genetically       predisposed to obesity were provided control diets or a       ``fast-food'' chow with and without probiotic-containing       yogurt or a single probiotic (Lactobacillus reuteri) in       water. Without probiotics, mice on the fast-food chow gained       significant weight. However, the addition of either       probiotic-containing yogurt or water prevented this weight       gain. Crucially, the probiotics did not appear to reduce the       amount of calories consumed; rather, the benefits appeared       related to changes in microbiome function and inflammatory       pathways. The results support weight benefits of probiotics       and, more importantly, provide empiric evidence that       challenges the widely accepted conventional wisdom that       the effects of different foods on obesity depend largely       on their calories.        Consistent with this animal experiment, a recent systematic       review and meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials       examined the effects of probiotics, either in foods or as       supplements, on body weight and composition in overweight and       obese subjects. Administration of probiotics significantly       reduced body weight percent (-0.60 kg), BMI (-0.27 kg/m\2\),       and fat percentage (0.60 percent), compared with placebo. A       separate meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials       demonstrated that consumption of probiotics in foods or       supplements significantly improves blood glucose, insulin,       and insulin resistance. The trials in these two meta-analyses       were neither long-term nor large--in all, a total of about       1,000 subjects were included in each meta-analysis, with       trial durations ranging from 3 to 24 wk and with varying       designs in terms of controls, disease conditions, and       composition of probiotic preparations evaluated. Nonetheless,       together with observational and experimental evidence, these       studies provide compelling evidence to support weight and       metabolic benefits of foods rich in probiotics.                        Dairy Foods, CVD, and Diabetes         Although an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes and       CVD, growing research suggests that specific foods may also       directly alter disease risk. In a meta-analysis of 29       prospective cohort studies including 938,465 participants who       experienced 93,158 deaths, 28,419 incident CAD events, and       25,416 incident CVD events, neither total dairy nor milk       consumption was significantly associated with total       mortality, CAD, or CVD. Notably, findings were similar when       total whole-fat dairy, or low-fat dairy were separately       evaluated. In contrast, the intake of fermented dairy       products (predominantly cheese, plus yogurt and fermented       milk) was associated with modestly lower risk of total       mortality and CVD, with about 5 percent lower risk of each       per 50 g daily serving. In addition, the consumption of       cheese alone, the dairy product with the highest amount of       dairy fat, was associated with a significantly lower risk of       both CAD and stroke.        In the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cohort,       including 5209US adults with Caucasian, Asian, black, and       Hispanic backgrounds, different food sources of saturated fat       were analyzed for their relation with subsequent CVD risk,       adjusted for sociodemographics, medical history, and other       dietary and lifestyle factors. A higher intake of saturated       fat from dairy sources was associated with significantly       lower CVD risk (per each 5 g/d, RR = 0.79, 95 percent CI =       0.68, 0.92), whereas a higher intake of saturated fat from       meat sources was associated with higher CVD risk (per each 5       g/d, RR = 1.26, 95 percent CI = 1.02, 1.54). Intakes of       saturated fat from other sources, such as butter and plant       oils/foods, were too low to identify any associations.        These findings suggest that saturated fat from different       food sources may have varying effects on CVD risk. This may       partly relate, for example, to differences in the types of       saturated fatty acids in meat compared with dairy. Compared       with meat, dairy has a greater proportion of short-chain and       medium-chain saturated fatty acids, with correspondingly less       palmitic and stearic acids. Compared with their longer chain       fatty acids, growing evidence suggests that shorter and       medium-chain triglycerides have different physiology,       including potential benefits on metabolic risk, weight gain,       obesity, and the gut microbiome.        In addition, cardiometabolic effects of different dairy       foods appear to vary depending on other characteristics, such       as fermentation or the presence of probiotics. The large       European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)       cohort across 8 European countries evaluated the consumption       of different dairy foods and risk of diabetes among 340,234       participants with 12,403 new cases of diabetes during follow-      up. In the fully adjusted model including adjustment for       estimated dietary calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D, the       consumption of milk (low-fat and whole-fat) was not       significantly associated with type 2 diabetes. Individuals       who consumed more yogurt or thick fermented milk experienced       a nonsignificant tend toward lower risk (across quintiles: RR       = 0.89, 95 percent CI = 0.77, 1.03; P-trend = 0.11), whereas       individuals who consumed more cheese had significantly lower       risk of diabetes (RR = 0.83, 95 percent CI = 0.70, 0.98, P-      trend = 0.003). A higher combined intake of fermented dairy       products (cheese, yogurt, and thick fermented milk) was also       associated with a lower risk of diabetes (RR = 0.85, 95       percent CI = 0.73, 0.99, P-trend = 0.02).        Similarly, in the Malmo Diet and Cancer Cohort following       26,930 participants over 14 y, different food sources of fat       and saturated fat had very different associations with       incidence of diabetes. Overall, low-fat dairy consumption was       associated with a higher risk of diabetes (across quintiles:       RR = 1.14, 95 percent CI = 1.01, 1.28; P-trend = 0.01),       whereas whole-fat dairy consumption was associated with a       substantially lower risk RR = 0.77, 95 percent CI = 0.68,       0.87, P-trend < 0.001). However, relations varied further by       subtype. For example, nonfermented, low-fat milk was       associated with higher risk; nonfermented, whole-fat milk was       not associated with risk; and fermented, whole-fat milk was       associated with lower risk. Cheese intake showed a       nonsignificant trend toward lower risk (RR = 0.92, 95 percent       CI = 0.81, 1.04; P-trend = 0.21), whereas red meat intake was       associated with significantly higher risk (RR = 1.36, 95       percent CI = 1.20, 1.55; P-trend < 0.001). When estimated       intakes of individual fatty acids were evaluated, intakes of       saturated fatty acids with 4-10 carbons, lauric acid (12:0),       and myristic acid (14:0) were associated with decreased risk       (P-trend = 0.01).        In addition to the consumption of whole foods such as milk,       cheese, or yogurt, significant amounts of dairy fat can be       consumed as relatively ``hidden'' ingredients in creams,       sauces, cooking fats, bakery desserts, and mixed dishes such       as casseroles containing butter, milk, or cheese. Self-      reported questionnaires may miss many of these sources,       leading to inaccurate measurement of true dairy fat       consumption in individuals. Biomarkers can partly reduce this       mismeasurement. In a global consortium combining de novo       individual-level analyses across 63,602 participants in 16       separate cohort studies, higher blood concentrations of odd-      chain saturated fatty acids (15:0, 17:0) and a natural       ruminant trans fatty acid (trans-16:1n-7), objective       circulating biomarkers of dairy fat consumption, were       evaluated in relation to onset of diabetes. Each fatty acid       was associated with lower incidence of diabetes, with 20-35%       lower risk across the interquintile range of blood       concentrations. It is unclear whether such lower risk is       related to direct health benefits of specific dairy fatty       acids, or to other aspects of foods rich in dairy fat. For       example, the major source of dairy fat in most diets is       cheese, a fermented food rich in vitamin K2 (menoquinone)       which is converted from vitamin K by the action of bacteria.       Menoquinone, which cannot be separately synthesized by       humans, is linked to lower risk of type 2 diabetes in       prospective observational studies, with supportive       experimental evidence for potential benefits on glucose       control and insulin sensitivity. The biologic mechanisms that       could explain metabolic and diabetes benefits of dairy foods       and dairy fat have been recently reviewed.        Based on all the evidence, the relation of dairy foods to       obesity, CVD, and diabetes does not consistently differ by       fat content, but rather appears to be more specific to food       type. In particular, neither low-fat nor whole milk appear       strongly related to either risks or benefits, whereas cheese       and yogurt (as well as other fermented dairy such as       fermented milk) may each be beneficial. These findings       suggest that health effects of dairy may depend on multiple       complex characteristics, such as probiotics, fermentation,       and processing, including homogenization and the presence or       absence of milk fat globule membrane.  [[Page H6898]]                            Holistic Dietary Recommendations         Conventional dietary guidelines generally recommend 2-3       daily servings of low-fat or nonfat dairy foods, without       regard of type (yogurt, cheese, milk); largely based on       theorized benefits of isolated nutrients for bone health       (e.g., calcium, vitamin D) and theorized harms of isolated       nutrients for obesity and CAD (e.g., total fat, saturated       fat, total calories). Advances in science indicate that       updated dietary guidelines must incorporate the empirical       evidence on health effects of different dairy products on       weight, body composition, CVDs, and diabetes. These findings       suggest that recommendations for milk, cheese, and yogurt       should be considered separately, based on their differing       relations with clinical outcomes. These findings further       suggest that whole-fat dairy foods do not cause weight gain;       that overall dairy consumption increases lean body mass and       reduces body fat; that yogurt consumption and probiotics       reduce weight gain; that fermented dairy consumption       including cheese is linked to lower CVD risk; and that       yogurt, cheese, and even dairy fat may protect against type 2       diabetes.        Based on the current science, dairy consumption is part of       a healthy diet, and intakes of probiotic-containing yogurt       and fermented dairy products such as cheese should be       especially encouraged. Based on little empiric evidence that       low-fat dairy products are better for health, and at least       emerging research suggesting potential benefits of foods rich       in dairy fat, the choice between low-fat compared with whole-      fat dairy should be left to personal preference, pending       further research. Such recommendations are consistent with a       growing focus on and understanding of the importance of foods       and overall diet patterns, rather than single isolated       nutrients.                                   ____       [From the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Dec. 11, 2017]  Effect of Whole Milk Compared With Skimmed Milk on Fasting Blood Lipids           in Healthy Adults: a 3-Week Randomized Crossover Study              (By Sara Engel, Mie Elhauge, and Tine Tholstrup)                                 Introduction         Dairy is a source of saturated fat (SFA) and dietary       recommendations for choosing low-fat dairy products are       mainly based on predicted effects of macronutrients, such as       SFA, which are known to increase LDL cholesterol       concentration in the blood. However, there is disagreement       between dietary guidelines and results from meta-analysis of       prospective cohort studies reporting no association between       dairy and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and an inverse       association with type 2 diabetes (T2D). A meta-analysis       including studies comparing diets of equal SFA content from       cheese and butter reported a beneficial effect of cheese on       LDL cholesterol. Moreover, a comparison between regular and       reduced fat cheese found no difference in effect on LDL       cholesterol and risk markers of the metabolic syndrome,       although a significantly higher SFA content in the regular       fat cheese diet. This could suggest that the expected effect       on LDL cholesterol was mediated by a combination of nutrients       or bioactive components in the cheese matrix. Every day,       people make a choice between whole milk and skimmed milk in       the super market. Thus, a comparison between these high and       low-fat dairy products is a real-life practical issue for the       consumer that makes it possible to further examine the effect       of milk fat on health. Two studies compared milk with       different fat content and found no difference in changes in       LDL and HDL cholesterol; one between two control diets with       semi-skimmed and skimmed milk (1.9 vs. 0.3%) and another       between whole milk and skimmed milk (3.4 vs. 0.2%) but with       only eight participants and therefore underpowered. Current       evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicate       that milk consumption has no effect on risk of T2D in terms       of fasting insulin and glucose concentrations, although not       consistently. The aim of this study was to investigate the       effects of whole milk compared with skimmed milk on serum       total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, and triacylglycerol       concentration and secondarily on glucose and insulin       concentrations in healthy subjects. We hypothesized that       whole milk would increase fasting blood cholesterol       concentration moderately compared to skimmed milk.                                   Methods       Subjects        Subjects were recruited through postings on the Internet       and around university campus area in Copenhagen. A total of       25 subjects were screened through telephone calls, 19 were       assessed for eligibility, 18 were enrolled in the study, and       1 subject dropped out after randomization. Exclusion criteria       were: previous or current CVD, diabetes, or other severe       chronic disease: BMI (in kg/m\2\) <18.5 and >30; age <20       years and >70 years; pregnancy or planning of pregnancy       during study period; excessive physical activity (>10 h/wk);       milk allergy or lactose intolerance; blood donation <1 mo       prior to and during study period; use of supplements, lipid-      lowering medication, as well as medicine that might affect       study outcomes; known or suspected abuse of alcohol,       medication, or drugs; blood pressure >140/90 mmHg; and       inability to follow study protocol. After receiving oral and       written information about the study all subjects gave their       informed consent in writing and completed a lifestyle       questionnaire including questions about current and previous       disease.                                 Study design         The study was a crossover RCT. The two intervention periods       of whole milk and skimmed milk (in random order) were 3 weeks       long with no wash-out period, as the lipids in the blood are       known to adjust after 2 weeks. The study was not blinded as       the appearance of the test beverages could not be concealed.       However, analyses of blood samples as well as statistics were       done blinded. Sample size was based on a previous study on       dairy fat in which butter significantly increased LDL       cholesterol compared with olive oil (control) (difference in       concentration 0.17 mmol/L). Thus with a standard deviation       (SD) of 0.19 mmol/L, a total of 12 subjects had to be       included in order to detect a similar difference (assuming a       significance level of 5 and 80% power). The study was carried       out at the Department of Nutrition, Exercise, and Sports,       Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg,       Denmark from 3 October to 17 December 2015. The study was       approved by the Municipal Ethical Committee of Copenhagen       (Report H-15011908) and conducted according to the Helsinki       Declaration.                                 Intervention         The test foods were provided to the study subjects,       consisting of 0.5 L conventional skimmed milk (0.1%, Arla       Foods, Denmark) and whole milk (3.5%, Arla Foods, Denmark)       from cows and from the same season. The energy content and       macronutrient composition of the milks are shown in Table 1.       Subjects were instructed not to consume yogurt, ice-cream, or       milk besides the test milk. For other dairy products such as       cheese and butter and for cooking oils subjects were       instructed to keep the same dietary pattern throughout the       intervention. Apart from the test foods and restrictions in       dairy intake the remaining diet was self-selected and       study subjects were asked to maintain their usual diets       and their regular level of physical activity throughout       the intervention periods. Subjects were instructed in how       to substitute the test foods for food items from their       habitual diets (usually the milk they normally drank).       Weekly subjects visited the department to collect the milk       and for weighing and follow-up making sure they adhered to       the test diet and kept a stable body weight during       intervention periods. Compliance was measured as a       percentage of milk consumed according to a diary kept       throughout the intervention compared with the milk handed       out. Subjects completed 3-d dietary records the last week       of each period and were instructed to include 1 weekend       day and 2 weekdays to take account of differences in       nutrient intake. Dietary intake was assessed using Dankost       Pro dietary assessment software (Dankost).                           Clinical investigations         Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline, after 3 weeks       and after 6 weeks. Prior to the blood sampling subjects       fasted (12 h) and were asked to refrain from smoking (12 h),       extreme sports (36 h), alcohol or medicine (24 h). Blood       samples were drawn for assessment of following: serum lipids       (total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol),       insulin, and plasma glucose. Samples for assessment of blood       lipids and insulin were collected into dry tubes, and samples       for glucose were collected into tubes with a 1 3 mL-fluoride       citrate mixture. To coagulate blood samples were stored at       room temperature for 30 min. Further, blood samples for       assessment of blood lipid and insulin concentrations were       centrifuged at 2754 g for 10 min at 4  deg.C and stored at       -80  deg.C until the concentration was analyzed. For glucose,       samples were centrifuged at 2754 g for 10 min at 20  deg.C       and stored at -80  deg.C until the concentration was       analyzed. LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations were       assessed by enzymatic colorimetric procedure (ABX Pentra LDL       Direct CP and ABX Pentra HDL Direct CP, respectively; Horiba       ABX). Concentration of total cholesterol was assessed by       enzymatic photometric test (CHOD-PAP from ABX Pentra       Cholesterol CP). Triacylglycerol and glucose concentrations       were assessed by enzymatic colorimetric procedure (ABX Pentra       Triglycerides CP and ABX Pentra Glucose HK CP; Horiba ABX,       respectively). Blood lipid concentration was analyzed on an       ABX Pentra 400 Chemistry Analyzer (Horiba ABX). Interassay       CVs for total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and       glucose were 2.2, 2.7, 2.0, 2.6, and 2.5%, respectively.       Intra-assay CVs for total, LDL and HDL cholesterol,       triacylglycerol, and glucose were 0.9, 0.7, 1.2, 3.8, and       1.1%, respectively. Insulin concentrations were assessed by       the solid-phase enzyme-labeled chemiluminescent immunometric       assay with an Immunlite 2000 XPi (Siemens Medical Solutions       Diagnostics). Interassay and intra-assay CVs for insulin were       3.5 and 4.2%, respectively.        Insulin resistance was evaluated by using homeostasis model       assessment--insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) with the following       formula: HOMA-IR = Fasting serum insulin (U/mL)       fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)/22.5.        Fasting body weight was measured at baseline, 3 and 6 weeks       to the nearest 0.1 kg wearing light clothing and having       emptied their bladder in advance. Height, body weight for BMI       calculation, and waist circumference were also measured at       screening. Height was measured without shoes to the nearest       0.5 cm with a wall-mounted  [[Page H6899]]       stadiometer (Seca) and waist circumference was measured       horizontally at the midpoint between the bottom rib and the       top of the hip bone.                             Statistical analysis         Statistical differences for outcome measures were analyzed       with linear mixed models that incorporated systematic effects       of period and treatment and their interaction. Approximate F-      tests were used to evaluate the interaction between time and       treatment and if non-significant to evaluate a time-      independent treatment effect. Baseline values and relevant       covariates: sex, age, waist circumference, and baseline-BMI       were included. Subject-specific random effects were included       to account for inter-subject variability and to adjust for       non-specific differences that could not be explained by the       explanatory variables included. For dietary records       statistical differences were based on paired t-test or       Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for non-parametric variables.       Treatment differences were reported in terms of unadjusted       mean levels with corresponding standard errors. All models       were validated by graphical assessment of normal quantile       plots and residual vs. fitted plots. When departure was       detected logarithmic transformation of the variables were       made. Variance homogeneity was visually inspected and showed       similar variance. Concentration of glucose and insulin were       correlated to blood lipid responses using Pearson correlation       test or Spearman correlation test for non-parametric       variables. A two-tailed P-value < 0.05 was considered       significant. The statistical software R version 3.1.3 2015       was used for all statistical evaluations.                                   Results       Subjects        Of the 18 recruited subjects, 1 dropped out in the first       period because of inability to follow study protocol.       Baseline characteristics of the 17 subjects who completed the       study are outlined in Table 2. No difference was observed in       body weight during the intervention between whole milk and       skimmed milk periods (P = 0.59). The compliance for intake of       milk during the first and second period was 99.7 and 98.5%,       respectively.                                 Blood lipids         Results from fasting blood lipid measurements at the end of       each period are listed in Table 3. HDL cholesterol was       significantly higher with whole milk than with skimmed milk       (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the       periods for any of the other blood lipids. For total       cholesterol there was a tendency for a higher concentration       with whole milk than with skimmed milk (P = 0.06).                             Insulin and glucose         Results of glucose and insulin concentrations measured at       the end of each period as well as calculated HOMA values are       listed in Table 3. There were no significant differences       between the periods for any of these outcomes. However,       correlation analysis with skimmed milk showed that insulin       and LDL cholesterol were moderately positively correlated (r       = 0.54, P < 0.05) and with whole milk that glucose and HDL       cholesterol were moderately negatively correlated (r = 0.52,       P < 0.05).                                Dietary intake         Total energy intake was significantly higher with whole       milk than with skimmed milk (P < 0.05). Fat intake (in grams       and percentage of energy) was significantly higher with whole       milk than with skimmed milk (P < 0.001). Also, the intake of       saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fat       was significantly higher with whole milk than with skimmed       milk (P<0.001, P<0.05, and P<0.05, respectively). Intake       of carbohydrate was significantly higher with skimmed milk       than with whole milk (P<0.01). There were no differences       between the periods for intake of protein, calcium,       alcohol, and dietary fiber.                                  Discussion         In the present study we showed that a daily intake of 0.5 L       whole milk for 3 weeks did not increase LDL cholesterol       compared to an equal intake of skimmed milk in healthy       subjects. Moreover, although small, a significant increase in       HDL cholesterol concentration was shown with whole milk       compared to skimmed milk, which was significantly,       moderately, and negatively correlated with glucose       concentration. None of the other outcome measurements showed       a difference between the periods. The increase in HDL       cholesterol following intake of whole milk was expected due       to the higher content of SPAs known to increase HDL and LDL       cholesterol concentrations. The Nordic Nutrition       Recommendations as well as the American Dietary Guidelines       advice that SFA should be limited to less than 10E%, due to       the predicted effect on LDL cholesterol. In comparison, the       amount of SFAs in the whole milk diet was almost 5 E% above       and in the skimmed milk diet close to recommendation (14.4       and 11.3 E%, respectively), according to the dietary records.       Thus, the result of no difference in LDL cholesterol was       unexpected and opposite to the dietary guidelines and our       hypothesis, despite of the dominating macronutrient content       of SFA with whole milk. Studies of the association between       HDL cholesterol concentration and CVD has shown that HDL is       protective. However, it is necessary to be cautious when       interpreting low concentration of HDL cholesterol as a CVD       risk factor. Mendelian randomization studies have shown that       genetically decreased HDL cholesterol was not associated with       increased risk of myocardial infarction, questioning the       causality of an association between low HDL concentration and       CVD. Still, HDL cholesterol concentration, as a marker of       cardiovascular health, should be taken into consideration       when interpreting the effect of dairy or SFAs in the diet.        Our results are in line with two previous intervention       studies from 2009 and 1994 comparing milk of different fat       content that also showed no effect on total and LDL       cholesterol concentration after 12 months and 6 weeks with       similar milk intake (500 and 660 ml/d, respectively);       however, contrary to our results also no effect on HDL       cholesterol. Fonolla et al. compared semi-skimmed milk and       skimmed milk and therefore a smaller difference in milk fat       (1.9 vs. 0.3%), which could explain the lack of difference in       HDL cholesterol compared to the present study. Steinmetz et       al., the more comparable study and of good quality, also       compared skimmed milk with whole milk in a crossover design,       but in a background diet designed to meet the AHA       recommendations. Steinmetz et al. reported a significantly       higher concentration of total and LDL cholesterol with whole       milk compared to skimmed milk. However, the statistical       analysis was not adjusted for baseline measurements, and thus       not adjusted for differences between periods, and in addition       the sample size was small (n = 8). Still, the analysis of       difference in change from baseline between the two diets was       also reported which showed no difference between total and       LDL cholesterol, in line with our results. Nevertheless, the       study reported higher Apolipoprotein B concentrations with       whole milk compared to skimmed milk known to be a predictor       of cardio metabolic risk.        Although the dietary records showed a significantly higher       energy intake with whole milk compared to skimmed milk, it       seems that the study subjects compensated for the extra       energy with whole milk by lowering their intake of       carbohydrate which was significantly lower compared to       skimmed milk. The content of calcium and protein were similar       in the two milk types, but whole milk has a higher content of       milk fat globule membranes (MFGM), which encloses the fat. A       possible matrix effect of MFGMs was suggested in a recent       study showing an impaired lipoprotein profile after a butter       oil diet, low in MFGMs, compared with a whipping cream diet,       high in MFGMs. One proposed mechanism, based on a mice study,       is through lowering of cholesterol absorption by inhibition       of cholesterol micellar solubility possibly due to presence       of sphingomyelin in MFGM fragments. Thus, one could speculate       that an expected higher LDL cholesterol concentration after       whole milk may be modified by a dairy matrix effect of MFGM.        The strength of the present RCT was the imitation of real-      life settings by not matching the diets for energy content or       macronutrient composition, which made it possible to directly       compare whole milk and skimmed milk as whole foods. The free-      living design of the study was a limitation, thus allowing       the presence of potential confounding by other lifestyle and       dietary factors. However, the crossover design minimizes this       potential confounding as study subjects were their own       control,        In conclusion, the results indicate that intake of 0.5 L/d       of whole milk does not adversely affect fasting blood lipids,       glucose, or insulin compared to skimmed milk in healthy       adults. Moreover, intake of whole milk increased HDL       cholesterol concentration compared to skimmed milk. These       findings suggest that if the higher energy content is taken       into account, whole milk can be considered as part of a       healthy diet among the normocholesterolemic population.     Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Van Orden).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Molinaro).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa), who is my classmate.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman  from California.    Mr. Chair, we are waiting for one more speaker to come, so  I will yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, I want to reiterate some points that were made before.  We are not being driven by any special interest group lobby. We are  being driven by the special interest group of children. We want  children in school to have access to whole milk, which, as my  colleagues have pointed out, is 96.75 percent fat-free, but it provides  one of the most nutritious meals that children can have.   We are seeing tremendous waste in the schools. We are not excluding  soy drink. The policy that we are trying to overcome here by providing  whole milk to children was a policy passed under the Obama  administration. We are not trying to harm minorities in any way  whatsoever. We want everybody to have the choice to drink a soy drink,  whole milk, skim milk, 1 percent milk, whatever.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to myself.    Mr. Chairman, this bill has been terribly mischaracterized  by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It is about healthy  choices for children.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I have seen a lot of bills mischaracterized on this floor  in my time here, but I think this is one of the worst.   Passing the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act would be a critical step  toward empowering parents and securing our children's well-being. Whole  milk isn't just a beverage; it is a vital source of nutrients essential  for children's growth. Denying access to its calcium, vitamin D, and  protein threatens to inhibit their development.   To the anti-milk advocates, I have one thing to ask of you: What do  you have against milk?   If you scrutinize them closely, you might be convinced that Democrats  are waging a war on dairy. The Democrat administration has presided  over a 15 percent milk price increase in the grocery store.   A Democrat proposal, the Green New Deal, calls for the elimination of  cows for their so-called greenhouse gas emissions.   A Democrat policy is slashing the milk available to newborns through  the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for women, infants, and  children by four quarts.   A Democrat interest group, PETA, has called milk a so-called white  supremacist symbol. How patently absurd.   Let's end the war on milk and pass the bill.   Together, we can ensure that our children have access to the  nutritional foundation they need to thrive and become the healthy,  vibrant leaders of tomorrow.   Mr. Chair, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 927) condemning antisemitism on University campuses  and the testimony of University Presidents in the House Committee on  Education and the Workforce.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 927         Whereas, on October 7, 2023, the world witnessed Hamas       terrorists perpetrate the deadliest attack against the Jewish       people since the Holocaust;  [[Page H6908]]         Whereas, in the months since, the Anti-Defamation League       has recorded 2,031 antisemitic incidents, 400 of which       occurred on college campuses, a more than 330-percent       increase from the year prior;        Whereas Jewish and Israeli students have faced physical       violence, hate-filled disruptions in the classroom, calls       from students and faculty advocating for the elimination and       destruction of Israel, and other forms of persistent       harassment;        Whereas, according to a recent study from the Anti-      Defamation League and Hillel International, 73 percent of       Jewish college students surveyed have experienced or       witnessed some form of antisemitism on campus since the       beginning of the school year, up from 32 percent the prior       year;        Whereas many university administrations have failed to       address the rise of antisemitism;        Whereas to hold universities accountable, the House       Committee on Education and the Workforce held a hearing on       December 5, 2023;        Whereas, when the Presidents of the University of       Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and Massachusetts Institute       of Technology were asked if calling for the genocide of Jews       violates university policies on bullying and harassment,       Presidents Elizabeth Magill, Claudine Gay, and Sally       Kornbluth were evasive and dismissive, failing to simply       condemn such action;        Whereas President Magill stated, ``It is a context-      dependent decision'';        Whereas President Gay insisted that it ``depends on the       context'';        Whereas President Kornbluth responded it would only       constitute harassment if it were ``targeted at individuals'';        Whereas President Magill has resigned, and the other       Presidents should follow suit; and        Whereas acts of hate, intimidation, discrimination, and       violence-based on ethnicity or religion have no place in our       country or in the global community: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) strongly condemns the rise of antisemitism on       university campuses around the country; and        (2) strongly condemns the testimony of University of       Pennsylvania President Elizabeth Magill, Harvard University       President Claudine Gay, and Massachusetts Institute of       Technology President Sally Kornbluth and their failure to       clearly state that calls for the genocide of Jews constitute       harassment and violate their institutions' codes of conduct       in front of the House Committee on Education and the       Workforce on December 5, 2023.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 927.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   ``It depends on the context.'' This was the testimony delivered by  so-called prestigious university presidents when presented with the  question: Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your campus  bullying and harassment policies?   The context. What a disgraceful, legalistic answer from academia's  supposed top minds.   As chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce,  I will tell you what never depends on the context: defending the rights  of Jewish students to feel safe on campus.   Condemning calls to incite violence against the world's most  persecuted ethnic group is always appropriate and never depends on the  context. Holding smug university elites accountable never depends on  the context.   That is why I rise today in support of this resolution, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Stefanik), the Conference chairwoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), a member of the Committee on Education and  the Workforce.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Kiley), a member of the Committee on Education and the  Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bean), chairman of the Early Childhood, Elementary, and  Secondary Education Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg), a member of the Committee on Education and the  Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, ``Anti-Semitism on College Campuses: Incident Tracking  from 2019 to 2023; 659 total reported anti-Semitic incidents on college  campuses since October 7--a 700 percent increase compared to last  year.''

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle think that Republicans need a lecture on free speech or  freedom of religion. We do not need such a lecture on that. We  understand those concepts. Those are our first freedoms, and we are  very keenly aware of those.   Mr. Speaker, there are massive problems in postsecondary education in  our country, and our committee is doing its best to address some of  those problems and to do something about them.   What we knew before the hearing, and what we know even more strongly  after the hearing that we held last week, is that Jewish students are  facing a massive rise in violence on our college and university  campuses.   According to the Anti-Defamation League and Hillel International, 73  percent of Jewish students surveyed said they experienced anti-Semitism  on campus this year. That number is up from 32 percent in 2021. Yet,  college administrators, like the ones who testified before the  committee last week, are not acting to protect students.   Now is not the time for campus leaders to sit on their hands. The  only way to salvage American academia and restore a safe learning  environment for its students is by rooting out anti-Semitism and  standing up against hate.   I thank God that the Committee on Education and the Workforce is up  to the task.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
