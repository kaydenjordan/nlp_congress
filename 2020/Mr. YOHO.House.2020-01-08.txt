 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3763, the  Promoting United States International Leadership in 5G Act of 2019.   I want to thank my colleague, the ranking member, Mr. McCaul, for his  work on this piece of important legislation.   Chinese state-run companies are investing in the fifth generation, or  5G, network development, and are seeking to dominate the global market  in this space. This is an issue because the future of business,  government services, medical services, consumer services, and much more  will rely on 5G networks.   In fact, by 2035, it is expected that the 5G technologies will create  $12.3 trillion in sales activity and support 22 million jobs around the  globe.   Having Chinese state-run 5G networks powering our lives puts America  and our allies' security at risk and will give China access to the  daily data on people around the world. This should alarm all of us and  cannot be accepted.   Our daily lives rely on networks now more than ever, and the demands  for advanced networks will only continue to increase, especially as the  things that we use every day, even refrigerators, continue to be  modified to need network connection. By full development, 5G should be  able to power every network need in life.    Further, 5G, by design, is meant to help power business equipment,  from things like farm equipment that do not need constant connections  but will need 5G data transmitted frequently. This is why it is so  essential and this piece of legislation is so important.   I hope this is a starting point and a point we can jump from, not  just to rely on 5G, but to jump forward and leapfrog to 10G. I applaud  this legislation because it is a great start.
