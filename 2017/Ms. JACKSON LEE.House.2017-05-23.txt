 Will the gentlewoman yield?    I want to add my support for this legislation, and I  thank the gentlewoman from California and the gentlewoman from Arizona  for their longstanding service.   We have been dealing with bills dealing with sexual assault in the  Judiciary Committee. Having listened to the young female soldiers who  were impacted by Marines United, I know that this legislation that  gives the military leadership additional tools to ensure that the  depiction of women and others in the United States military, against  their will, on social media, will not be tolerated and will not be  viewed as an honorable act under the U.S. Military Code. Giving these  tools will show that you will be punished and that men and women will  be respected in the United States military. I ask colleagues to support  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2473, the Put  Trafficking Victims First Act of 2017.   I congratulate the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner) and the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass) for the introduction of this  legislation.   This bill is intended to improve the implementation of the Justice  for Victims Trafficking Act of 2015. The 2015 act expanded the Federal  response to trafficking concerning services and benefits for victims,  criminal justice, domestic sex trafficking of children, and interagency  coordination and training.   I support H.R. 2473 for several reasons. To begin with, this measure  will strengthen the effectiveness of the 2015 act in various ways. For  example, H.R. 2473 requires that training be provided for prosecutions  of traffickers. When children fall prey to the sex trade and  [[Page H4487]]  then are treated as criminals rather than victims, their injuries are  compounded.   We had the first human trafficking hearing of any committee in  Houston, Texas, just a few years ago under the auspices of the Homeland  Security Committee. Our committee determined this very point: that  children fall prey and then become victims of the criminal justice  system.   That is not the way to deal with our children who are victims,  innocent children who have been turned into human traffic products by  the heinous traffickers. As such, this training is critical to ensure  that human trafficking victims are treated as victims and afforded  justice, respect, and dignity.   Second, H.R. 2473 establishes a working group to develop best  practices or best methods to assess the prevalence of human  trafficking. We know that there is a growing epidemic of abhorrent  practices of sex trafficking, and we must consider all methods to help  law enforcement stop these crimes.   The working group will identify barriers that hamper human  trafficking data collection and identify what information should be  collected, as well as ascertain current practices being used by  different agencies and organizations that can be standardized into best  practices. As a result, H.R. 2473 will help ensure the most effective  prevention practices are standardized so that perpetrators of sex  trafficking are ultimately brought to justice.   Lastly, the legislation encourages States to adopt protections for  sex trafficking victims. These victims are often very afraid to seek  help, particularly from law enforcement because of the risk that they  will be treated as criminals again rather than victims. H.R. 2473  recognizes the critical fact that children involved in sex trafficking  are victims and not criminals. They absolutely should not be treated as  criminals.   In acknowledgement of this fact, the bill identifies a broad range of  important initiatives that States should undertake that would provide  meaningful assistance to these victims: upholding basic rights,  facilitating ways to identify child trafficking, providing emergency  long-term housing. Each of these initiatives should help ensure that  these victims are not revictimized and help enable them to be guided  back to a normalized life.   Mr. Speaker, for all of these reasons, I am pleased to support this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), the original cosponsor of this  legislation and one of the champions of protecting children and a  leader of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   What an appropriate time so that I can add my appreciation to the  chairman and the ranking member, Mr. Conyers, the ranking member of the  subcommittee that I am on, and to the chairman of the subcommittee. We  have enjoyed working together on this legislation. To the cosponsors of  this legislation, Mrs. Wagner and Ms. Bass. And then to the potent  statement of my friend and fellow Texan, Congressman Ted Poe, who  modestly indicated that we, as women, helped drive this, frankly, he  beat us to the finish line riding his horse, but I want to thank him  very much for his great leadership and interest in this very important  area.                                time  1745    This bill is a wonderful complement to the igniting of understanding  about the vileness of human trafficking.   I think it is important to take note that the Homeland Security  Department has trained airline stewards to recognize human trafficking  victims on airplanes. Many of them are children, camouflaged as an  adult and their special child--niece or nephew--traveling together.   This legislation is all about pointing out, finding, saving the  victims, making sure they get treatment, and making sure that human  trafficking is identified.   So I am also pleased that this measure, as amended, requires a report  on State safe harbor laws. As we all know, safe harbors play a critical  role in preventing youth, forced into the sex trade, from being  revictimized again and stigmatized a second time by the criminal  justice system, almost similar to the little girl who was looking for  love. Instead, she got victimized and turned into a human trafficking  product.   H.R. 2473 also fosters better collaboration among the Federal, State,  and local law enforcement in the fight against sex trafficking and  encourages States to adopt protections for trafficking victims by  providing rehabilitation and recovery services for victims of human  trafficking.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this measure and, as  well, to be reminded of all those children who will be helped and  saved.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
