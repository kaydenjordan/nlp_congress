 Madam Speaker, I rise to direct the House's attention to  H. Res. 3281, the RPM Act.   The RPM Act is necessary because of a gross abuse of the  Administrative Procedures Act by unelected, unaccountable, unrecallable  bureaucrats.   Madam Speaker, most people aren't aware that the chances are better  than a thousand to one if you are ever hauled into Federal court under  charges, it is more than likely you will be subject to a violation of  rules, administrative rules, that are enforceable as laws.   Most Members of Congress seem oftentimes to forget that, and we have  allowed the rule-makers, the unelected, unaccountable people, to make  an incredible amount of laws that become a heavy burden on our society.   So we are hoping, with the RPM Act, H. Res. 3281, we can right some  of those wrongs.                            ____________________
