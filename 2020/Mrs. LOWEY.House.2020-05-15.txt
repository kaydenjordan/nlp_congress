 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 967, I call up  the bill (H.R. 6800) making emergency supplemental appropriations for  the fiscal year ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Speaker, nearly 86,000 Americans have died, more than 1.4 million  have become sick, and more than 36 million have lost their jobs because  of coronavirus.   While Congress has taken significant action, we must do more.   On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell urged Congress to  think big to address this crisis. The HEROES Act is a bold step to  provide that support and ensure our Nation meets the challenge of the  pandemic and the ensuing economic recession.   Within the Appropriations division, this bill deploys more than $1.5  trillion in Federal funds to address this health and economic crisis.   First, the bill delivers nearly $1 trillion to States and local  governments so that they can keep our heroes--first responders, health  workers, teachers, and other public servants--paid and working for the  American people.   I am proud that this bill will provide $67 billion to my home State  of New York, which has been hit so hard by this crisis.   Second, we will only beat this disease with a robust national  strategy for testing, tracing, and treatment.   Yesterday, Dr. Rick Bright, one of the Federal Government's top  scientists, warned us: ``If we fail to develop a national coordinated  response, based in science, I fear the pandemic will get far worse and  be prolonged, causing unprecedented illness and fatalities.''   To that end, the bill builds on the CARES Act, with $75 billion for a  nationwide testing and contact tracing strategy, and an additional $100  billion for the Health Provider Relief Fund.   Third, we must meet the challenge that the economic effects of  lockdowns and stay-at-home orders are having on families.   As a mother and a grandmother, I am deeply concerned about the  effects of coronavirus on children and their education. We are  including $100 billion to support K-12 and higher education systems as  they respond to this crisis.   To address rising hunger, this bill funds an expansion of SNAP  benefits and other nutrition programs so that children and families  have enough to eat.   To prevent a housing crisis, we are deploying new funds worth nearly  $200 billion to help struggling families make rent or pay their  mortgages.   Finally, to stop this crisis from weakening our democracy, we have  included funding to hold safe elections, to carry out a fair and  accurate Census, and to ensure that the Postal Service can continue  safely delivering mail to American households.   I am so proud of the hard work of so many to ensure this bill  provides the help that families, businesses, and communities need.   Mr. Speaker, the HEROES Act will meet the challenges this pandemic  poses to our Nation. I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance  of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the outstanding Speaker of the House.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Mfume).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to say that my friend on the other  side of the aisle is my friend. We have worked together. We have faced  many challenges. And I do hope that we can face this challenge with  direct assistance now because, in my judgment, we cannot wait.   As we close debate, the American people really have heard two  visions:   Democrats want to send additional aid to people, to the healthcare  system, to students and our heroes. People are suffering. I see it in  my district, and I am sure my friends have seen it in their districts.  [[Page H2245]]    The Republican vision, which is wait and see, we will do something.  The difference, to my friends, I want to make it clear: That is not an  option.   Mr. Speaker, 86,000 Americans have died; 36 million have lost their  jobs. I see it every day. Just the other day I spoke to friends at a  nursing home. Too many people are losing their lives.   Mr. Speaker, today is the day. We have an opportunity to act now.  Let's vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, as of this morning, nearly 86,000 people in  the United States have died from this virus. More than 1.4 million  people have been infected, and those are just the cases we know about  because of the frontline workers who are risking their lives to test as  many people as possible.   Unemployment is at its highest level since the Great Depression. Tens  of millions of families are struggling to put food on the table and pay  the rent.   If you don't understand the suffering, you haven't been paying  attention. Just turn on the TV--or better yet, listen to your  constituents. They are demanding two things: facts and action.   No matter what the President tweets, the facts of this pandemic are  clear. And no matter whether Senator McConnell sees urgency or not, the  time for action is now.   The American people have unprecedented needs, and the Federal  Government must step up to the plate, provide the necessary assistance  to meet those needs. However, the Republicans are yet again standing in  the way of helping people. They are in the same denial that led to the  Trump administration's bungling of this virus.   Against the weight of economic expertise, they are saying we need to  slow down on spending money. Against the clear desperation of families,  they are saying we need to wait and see what happens.   Well, we know what is going to happen. We have seen what is going to  happen. We have seen what has happened. There will be more cases  tomorrow, more deaths this weekend, more economic hardship next week.   But instead of worrying about these concerns, the only thing  Republicans can offer is regurgitated talking points about immigration.   Right now, the American people are focused on their own survival and  that of their families.   I want to make it very clear: COVID-19 does not discriminate or  differentiate on immigration status. Our country doesn't have time for  Republicans to relitigate the culture wars.   Regardless of background or country of origin, we need action today.  People are suffering. Every day there are more cases. We need action  now without further delay. I strongly oppose the motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.                                time  1815
