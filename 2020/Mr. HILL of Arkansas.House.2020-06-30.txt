 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Independent Community Bankers Association and Little Rock's Venture  Center. Together, they have renewed their partnership and commitment to  the ThinkTECH Accelerator program for an additional 3 years.   The ThinkTECH Accelerator brings community banks and fintech  innovators together to develop new technologies specifically for  community banks and the customers they serve. Not only has it received  high praise from local government and top business leaders, but this  renewal will keep tech entrepreneurs coming back to Arkansas for  mentorship and much-needed capital.   I look forward to working alongside the ICBA, the Venture Center,  State leaders, and our entrepreneurs to continuously aid our small  banks and enhance our economy here at home.                          Recognizing Kayle Browning     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.  Kayle Browning's great achievement of representing Arkansas and the  United States of America at the Tokyo Olympics as a part of Team USA's  Olympic trap team.   Kayle is from Wooster, Arkansas, and graduated from Greenbrier High  School. She went on to attend the University of Central Arkansas.   Kayle started shooting at the young age of 8 in the yard with her  dad, who is also an avid sporting clay shooter.   She began her target shooting career in sporting clay and then made  the All-America Team at the age of 12. Kayle also represented Arkansas  and Team USA as an alternate in the 2012 Olympics in London.   Kayle has shown dedication and determination over the years, and I am  proud to have her represent our State on the national stage as an  Olympian.   I congratulate her on her achievement of joining Team USA's Olympic  trap team.                        Recognizing Coach Marcus Davis     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Coach  Marcus Davis on his recent retirement from the Little Rock School  District.   Coach Davis has been an integral member of the Little Rock School  District for 36 years, 33 of which were spent at Cloverdale Middle  School.   In his tenure in the Little Rock District, Coach Davis has served as  the head boys basketball coach, head girls volleyball coach, and the  head girls track coach. In addition, Coach Davis taught both physical  education and health education.   The lasting connections Coach Davis made with his athletes and  students over the course of nearly four decades is truly inspirational.   On behalf of all Arkansans, I thank Coach Davis for his devotion to  educating and coaching our youth, and I congratulate him on a terrific  career and a well-deserved retirement.             Congratulating Little Rock on Bicycle Friendly Award     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate the city of Little Rock, Arkansas, for being awarded the  Bronze-level Bicycle Friendly Community Award from the League of  American Bicyclists.   As a biker and former board member of Bicycle Advocacy for Central  Arkansas, I am pleased that my hometown was honored for its commitment  to improving biking and safer streets for everyone.   The Bronze-level Bicycle Friendly Community Award recognizes the city  of Little Rock for creating transportation and recreational resources  that benefit its residents of all ages and abilities while encouraging  healthier and more sustainable transportation choices.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the League of American Bicyclists for  highlighting Little Rock's efforts to make biking a safe, accessible  option for people whether they are commuting to essential jobs or  simply enjoying our growing, amazing network of trails.                            ____________________
