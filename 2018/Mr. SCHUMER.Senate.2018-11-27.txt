 Mr. President, first, I would like to talk about the  unfortunate news we heard from General Motors.   Yesterday, General Motors announced it was closing five factories and  laying off 15,000 workers. The news is a gut punch to workers in Ohio,  Michigan, and Maryland. Our hearts go out to them and their families.  Many of these people have labored for decades, and many in their  families have worked at GM. I know this from our GM plants in New York.  To lose your job when you have put so much into it, only to wake up in  the morning and say, ``my job is to make the best car possible,'' is a  gut punch and worse.   We need to do more--a lot more--to encourage investments in American  jobs, in American infrastructure, and to bring back manufacturing. What  we don't need is more rhetoric from the President, who has made a whole  lot of promises but who has, unfortunately, failed to deliver for these  workers.   Here is what President Trump said last year about manufacturing jobs  in Ohio:         They're all coming back. . . . Don't move. Don't sell your       house. . . . We're going to fill those factories up or rip       them down and build new ones.    Here is what else he said:         If I am elected, you won't lose one plant. . . . You're       going to have jobs again. You won't lose one plant. I promise       you that.    President Trump promised people in the campaign that we would not  lose one plant. A lot of people voted for him for that reason. Guess  where he said we would not lose one plant. Guess where President Trump  promised the people we would not lose one auto plant--in Warren, MI. It  is one of the plants that is now slated to close. The words are a  painful reminder of just how bankrupt many of President Trump's  promises turn out to be.   Do you remember Carrier? The President swept into office and promised  that Carrier would stay open, thanks to him. He had done a big rally,  and 6 months later, Carrier had laid off hundreds of workers in Indiana  and had moved its positions to Mexico.   This is what the President does. He makes big, bold, impossible  promises without having much care for the results. Instead of  overpromising, the President should roll up his sleeves and work with  GM to prevent it from cutting jobs.   The American taxpayer has supported GM through tough times. Last  year, the Republicans handed GM a windfall of $150 million in its tax  bill so GM could bring back money from overseas. It said it would do it  and employ people. Well, it is bringing back money from overseas, but  it is not employing people. That is what American companies are doing.  GM pocketed the tax break we gave it and is closing up shop anyway-- with nary a word from the President until after the fact.   I see my friend from Illinois here. We Democrats believe you don't  give tax breaks to big companies unless they do something for their  workers--not stock buybacks, but employ people, train people, pay them  good wages, give family leave. The President gives corporate America-- wealthy, big corporations--just what they wish but does nothing to  protect workers, except to talk a lot.   So I would ask my friends in New York State and throughout the  Midwest and throughout America--working families, the kind of people I  came from: When are you going to understand that this man sells you a  bill of goods? that this President talks a good game but never delivers  on his promises? That is what Americans and working Americans, in  particular, should understand about President Trump.   The awful closings from yesterday are terrible. They are a sad symbol  of a President who has failed the American working people and given  them a  [[Page S7108]]  lot of hot air and no real gains. Corporate America--the wealthy--are  doing great. Working people--average Americans, people who sweat--get  nothing. They are losing jobs.   We need more from this Congress than another tax cut for the wealthy,  and the American worker needs more from President Trump than empty  rhetoric. Just yesterday, he said: Well, there will be new plants. How  many people are going to believe that? He has been saying that for 2  years.
