 Madam Speaker, I appreciate your leadership on  this.   Madam Speaker, I rise today alarmed by the unprecedented wasteful  spending from Washington that is fueling inflation and risking the  future of our Republic.   Last week, this Congress passed a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill.  Despite the bill's characterization, less than 10 percent went to  traditional--what us southerners and commonsense people call roads and  bridges. But $200 million went back to a park in Speaker Pelosi's own  backyard.   According to The New York Times, certainly not an ally of the  Republicans, the Democrats' reconciliation bill before us this week  includes a $4.1 billion tax break for people who buy electric bicycles;  $2.5 billion for tree equity--I am not sure what that is; and another  $2.5 billion to help contingency fee lawyers recoup expenses.   Madam Speaker, this captures exactly what is wrong with Washington.  Too many politicians up here will gladly endorse trillions in new  spending for a few pennies of pork to come back to their district. They  put their political futures above our own Nation.   Well, I am sick of it, and the American people are, too. Congress is  bleeding the American people dry with waste and pet projects it claims  is being spent in their own best interests.   Sure, I would love for the Federal Government to build a new road in  my district, but I refuse to sacrifice the health and viability of this  Nation to get it. Most patriotic Americans would agree with me.   Roads and bridges come and go, but if we foolishly squander the  Nation our forefathers fought so hard to create, we will selfishly  allow this great American experiment to die because of our own greed.  Shame on us because we will have ultimately failed those who elected us  and sent us here to protect their best interests.
