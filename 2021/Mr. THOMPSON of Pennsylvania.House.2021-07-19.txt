 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the  storied career of Mr. Don Parrish as he celebrates his retirement as  Senior Director of Regulatory Affairs at the American Farm Bureau  Federation.   Don is a champion and friend of the U.S. agriculture industry through  and through.   Don's legacy spans a variety of topics, but namely, he is renowned  for his incredible work on the Clean Water Act and the waters of the  U.S.   Don's role as an integral leader on this topic lead to his placement  as chair of the Waters Advisory Coalition and to be named as a ``Top 5  Player'' on WOTUS in Politico.   Anyone who knows Don knows his deep love for both his work and his  family, whom he frequently brags about.   The U.S. agriculture industry is better today because of Don's fierce  dedication and advocacy.   Madam Speaker, I thank Don for his partnership and for the  outstanding work he has done to improve the livelihood of America's  farmers and ranchers.   I wish Don a fulfilling retirement. He has earned every bit of it.                            ____________________
