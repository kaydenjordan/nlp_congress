 Mr. President, this week marks National Police Week,  an annual celebration in honor of the men and women who serve in local,  State, and Federal law enforcement all across our country. We are all  safer because of their efforts, and this week is an important reminder  of their continuing service and sacrifice on our behalf--each and every  day.   Traveling across the country, thousands of law enforcement officers  gather in our Nation's Capital each year to mark this occasion. They  come here to recommit themselves to the peace and safety of our  communities and to show respect for their fallen brothers and sisters  in uniform who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We are honored to have  them in Washington and to join them in recognizing these officers.   I wish to pay a special tribute to the brave men and women who  protect and serve my home State of Kentucky. These officers put  themselves in harm's way to defend our communities every day, and we  owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude.   Today, we also remember those officers from the Bluegrass State who  tragically fell in the line of duty.   First, I want to pay tribute to Officer Nick Rodman of the Louisville  Metro Police Department. Officer Rodman unfortunately passed away after  a car crash in Louisville while responding to calls of shots fired. He  was 30 years old and had served in the department for 3 years.   The Rodman family maintains a strong tradition in law enforcement,  and he proudly continued that legacy. The many individuals Officer  Rodman touched over the course of his life will remember his  compassion, patience, and dedication to family.   I wish to also pay tribute to Officer Charles Howley of the Oldham  County Police Department. The day before his death, Officer Howley  responded to a call reporting smoke in a daycare center. While ensuring  all of the children and employees had evacuated, Officer Howley was  exposed to a refrigerant. The next day, he suffered a fatal heart  attack. Officer Howley was 51 years old and dedicated 20 years of  service to his department and his community.   Officers Nick Rodman and Charles Howley displayed courage and  heroism, and their service will not soon be forgotten.   I wish to also take a moment to thank the men and women of the U.S.  Capitol Police, who stand guard at the heart of our democracy. They  protect the Nation's legislature, the people who work here, and the  millions of visitors who travel here to see our government in action.  We are grateful for their diligence and for their service.   I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing the Senate family's  gratitude to law enforcement officers all across our country as we  welcome so many of them to the Capital this week. I wish to reiterate  our admiration for their honorable and dangerous work. We live in a  safer society because of their brave efforts, and I am glad that we are  able to take this opportunity today to thank them for their service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote to  advance another well-qualified nominee,  [[Page S2924]]  Jeffrey Rosen, to be Deputy Secretary of the Department of  Transportation. Mr. Rosen has extensive experience serving at both the  Office of Management and Budget and at the Department of  Transportation. When he last came before the Senate to be the Chief  Legal Officer of the Department of Transportation, he was confirmed by  voice vote. It is disappointing that we had to file cloture on this  bipartisan choice this time around.   Mr. Rosen's work in both the private and public sectors has given him  a unique insight into the budgetary and regulatory challenges that  infrastructure projects face. I look forward to the Senate advancing  his nomination later this afternoon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 55, Terry Branstad to be Ambassador to the  People's Republic of China.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call with respect to the cloture motion be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume consideration of the Rosen nomination.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  May 16; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; further, that following leader remarks,  the Senate proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the  Rosen nomination, with the time until 12:30 p.m. equally divided in the  usual form; further, that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15  p.m. to allow for the weekly conference meetings; finally, that all  time during recess, adjournment, morning business, and leader remarks  count postcloture on the Rosen nomination.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come  [[Page S2935]]  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:12 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, May 16, 2017, at 10 a.m.
