 Mr. Chairman, I rise to shed light on a very deceptive  practice and the reason the American people refer to politics in  Washington as ``the swamp.'' That is giving bills names that, not only  have nothing to do with the legislation, but actually mislead the  American people to believe it is something that it is not.   This Democrat bill being considered today, entitled the Protecting  Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act, has absolutely nothing to do  with preexisting conditions and protecting people with preexisting  conditions.   This bill actually prevents a policy that allows States to have the  freedom and flexibility to provide for their citizens' healthcare  needs. Where they have exercised that flexibility, we have seen an  average of 20 percent in the reduction of healthcare costs.   There are laws on the books, Mr. Chairman, passed by Democrats and  Republicans alike, that prevent and punish people and companies who  participate in such false advertising. In fact, there is a good reason  the FTC has strong truth in advertising laws and strictly enforces them  against misleading and deceptive practices, because it hurts people, it  hurts consumers, and it actually, in this case, compromises the  American people's trust.   Mr. Chairman, the American people are sick and tired of political  games, they are tired of politicians and their duplicity, and they are  tired of their elected representatives deceiving them. That is what  this is.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to not vote for this bill  that takes the American people as fools and  [[Page H3523]]  preys on their fears, and I encourage both sides to stand in opposition  of this bill.
