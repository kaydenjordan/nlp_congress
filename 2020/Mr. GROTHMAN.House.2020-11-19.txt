 Mr. Speaker, I would like to, with the other people,  say it was very enjoyable working with Congresswoman Davis. I wish she  would have given me a chance before she made a decision to try to  convince her to stay here because we are going to miss her.   Apprenticeships are very important. We have a good apprenticeship  program in Wisconsin. We are told that, right now, people who complete  both the work and classroom requirements of the apprenticeship program  have a median income of $80,000. That shows the importance of having a  bill like this brought to the floor. And I will tell you, it is not  only an $80,000 salary but, I am sure, a much lower debt load than many  people who use a 4-year degree.   I think it is important for everybody in this Chamber to continue to  emphasize to young people the pathway to a career through  apprenticeships, which probably results in more job security, more  income, and less debt than other things.   It is with great regret I am going to vote against this bill today.   I do believe that there is such a high demand for what I call skills- based education that it is important we open up alternative avenues to  apprenticeships.   We have talked today about a need to recognize the apprenticeship  programs. That is certainly one way. It is unfortunate that didn't make  it in this bill. I know a lot of effort was made to make this a  bipartisan bill, and maybe we can come back in the appropriations  process or something and somehow make a few tweaks in there to make it  something that would be more bipartisan.   But I am glad the bill is coming this far. It provides us all an  opportunity to go back home in our districts and bring it up to young  people and tell them about the benefits of apprenticeships and that you  are missing something big-time if you don't take advantage of it.    Madam Speaker, this speech is being given kind of on  short notice, a little earlier than I expected. But we don't want to  have the listening audience back home get any dead air, so I am rushing  to give the talk. Hopefully, you will be satisfied, with not an excess  of preparation.   Today, I address something I don't think has been addressed nearly  enough with regard to the crisis of the COVID virus. In the last couple  of weeks, we have gone over 250,000 deaths at least partially  attributed to the coronavirus, and I want to talk about something we  can do to decrease that number of deaths that I think has been far and  away underpublicized, underpublicized despite the fact that we have  appropriated over $3 trillion to fighting this disease, underpublicized  despite the fact that public health professionals are constantly being  interviewed on our news programs and are out and about on  advertisements telling us what we can do to reduce the huge number of  deaths attributed to this disease.   One thing I want to do today is I am going to talk one more time  about vitamin D. I know some of the folks back home are familiar with  vitamin D, but I don't think the huge number of studies that recommend  vitamin D have been publicized anywhere near enough.   Right before I got here, I was talking to one of my constituents back  home, a bright, well-informed person. He was surprised that vitamin D  can be used to reduce the mortality rate from the COVID.   I want to go over some of the things that have been determined about  vitamin D. We have had many universities doing studies. I mentioned all  the way back in April and May, Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, and  Northwestern University down in Illinois have found studies showing a  strong correlation between vitamin D deficiencies in patients leading  to COVID complications and mortality.   Those with adequate vitamin D levels were less likely to experience  hyperinflammation within their lungs and less susceptible to severe  COVID symptoms.   Recently, in September, the University of Chicago Medicine and  University of Boston Medicine, both conducted research studies  substantiating the preliminary evidence between the correlation between  vitamin D deficiencies and even getting COVID-19.   Professors at Harvard have also published articles highlighting  vitamin D's benefits for respiratory health and mentioning the  connection between vitamin D and COVID-19 as quite compelling.   European health professionals and right now the U.K., they have upped  their recommendation for vitamin D among their citizens, something that  it is high time our professionals were more aggressive in doing.   In late October, as part of a study in the Journal of Clinical  Endocrinology and Metabolism, researchers looked at 216 COVID-19  patients in a hospital in Spain. Over 80 percent of the patients were  deficient in vitamin D if they had severe COVID. Only 40 percent of the  population as a whole had longer hospital stays and higher inflammatory  markers within their lungs.   If you look at this, again and again and again, the researchers are  talking about the correlation between adequate levels of vitamin D and  not having as much mortality or serious things happening, and you  wonder why our public health professionals and the CDC are not talking  about this more, as they should.   I know a couple of months ago, finally, Dr. Fauci talked about  evidence of vitamin D's benefits, after waiting months and months for  it. He finally talked about it, but he only talked about it in some  interview with a Hollywood personality. He shouldn't wait  [[Page H5987]]  for a Hollywood personality asking questions to point out that he  himself, as the most prominent member of our public health community,  takes vitamin D.    How much vitamin D should you take? I have talked to different  doctors.   By the way, I come to this conclusion not just by looking at the  plethora of research studies done by colleges and universities around  the world, but by talking to individual doctors. Right before coming up  here, I talked to a doctor from my district who routinely, every day,  takes 5,000 international units of vitamin D.   I will point out that is not the only way you can get vitamin D. You  can get vitamin D from wonderful, healthy milk, and you can get vitamin  D as well from interaction with the Sun.   Sadly, during a lot of this coronavirus, people have been encouraged  to stay inside rather than outside and getting the Sun, which would  actually increase your vitamin D levels.   I would ask Dr. Fauci, the CDC, the NIH, and public health  professionals across the country: When you begin to tell people what  you can do to save yourself or save your loved ones, make sure they are  taking their vitamin D.                                time  1730    There are obviously some communities more than other communities who  are susceptible to vitamin D deficiencies. People with darker skin are  much more likely to be vitamin D deficient; and, therefore, if you have  darker skin, pay special attention to the necessity of taking vitamin  D.   Again, it is not just for yourself. Make sure if you have any loved  ones with cardiovascular problems, loved ones who may be a little  overweight--I am a little overweight here, so I am not signaling  anybody out, but if you are a little bit overweight, make sure you are  taking that vitamin D. If you have got any diabetes, make sure you are  taking that vitamin D.   Actually, earlier today, I found out another acquaintance of mine  from back in the district passed away from COVID, and it kind of bugs  me that the vitamin D is not being stressed.   A little while ago, I had the Surgeon General in my district. He  rattled off five things to do. And they always talk about social  distances. Fine. They always talk about masks. Fine. They always talk  about wash your hands. Fine. But they don't talk about vitamin D,  despite all of these studies.   I don't have an exact figure, but I would bet, if the entire American  public had adequate levels of vitamin D--and right now, about 40  percent of the American population does not have adequate levels--I  would bet that the number of fatalities in this country would be  decreased by at least a third.   Like I said, none of these studies have an exact amount, but I think  that could be that high. And if that is true, you are talking about  maybe 80,000 deaths if only the public health professionals would put  taking vitamin D in the same talks they give you about a mask or social  distancing or whatever.   I am going to point out that it is more important than ever because  we are going into the winter, and in winter you get what? At least in  Wisconsin, you go outside less and you get less sun. And going outside  less and getting less sun are both things that are going to accelerate  the number of people who get the COVID, and get the COVID seriously.   So now I will say it one more time to emphasize: It is a good time to  make a list of all the older people or people with preexisting  conditions and make sure they get vitamin D.   Actually, as I am giving the talk up here, I would suggest for  Thanksgiving--or for Christmas, even--stopping by one of our fine  chains of drugstores and getting some vitamin D.   You can, on your own, look on the internet and hear what they say  about zinc. A lot of people say some zinc is good as well,  supplementing it. It is something else you don't hear the professionals  talk about a lot, but when I talk to doctors in their own right, talk  to nurses in their own right, yes, grab some zinc as well. They talk  about patients who are taking both vitamin D and zinc and how they have  almost no patients who have had to be hospitalized for the COVID.   So, in summary, I want to emphasize for the political geeks who tune  in and watch this show: Make sure you are taking your vitamin D. Make  sure you give vitamin D to older people who you know or people with  preexisting conditions.   I especially emphasize to any public health professionals who are  watching this little speech: Next time you are giving a talk on the  radio station or if anybody is out there preparing the next set of  commercials on how to deal with the COVID, emphasize the vitamin D and  familiarize yourself with the studies from Trinity College in Ireland,  the Spanish studies, what has been said at Harvard, the studies at  Northwestern, and the studies at the University of Chicago and you will  learn a little bit more about things your occupation ought to be  talking about.   So that is all the time I have today, and thank you for allowing me  to give this little speech.   I yield back the balance of my time.
