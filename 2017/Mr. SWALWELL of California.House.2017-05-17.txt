 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Florida for yielding.   I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and allow an  amendment to come forward so that we can debate having an independent  commission on Russia's interference in our past election.   The events over the past few weeks have demonstrated that there is a  high cost--a cost that is too high to bear with regard to the White  House and its ties with Russia.   What is the cost exactly?   What is the cost of alleged abuses and the President's firing of  Acting Attorney General Sally Yates and Director James Comey?   What is the cost of the question swirling around the President's ties  to Russia?   Well, the cost, clearly, with the leaking that occurred in the Oval  Office, is now our national security.   The cost is our democracy has been left in ruins. It is a mess right  now here in Washington.   The cost is that this House is unable to bring forward legislation to  do anything to help people put food on the table, to seek to put a roof  over their home, and to provide opportunity to their children.    It is a high cost that we are paying right now for all these  questions. It is too much for us to bear.   The best thing we can do is to charter an independent commission to  take this outside of Congress so that they can follow the facts and the  evidence and report back to the American people just exactly how we  were so vulnerable this last election.   What was our response?   Were any U.S. persons involved?   And, most importantly, what are we going to do?   What reforms can we make?   What awareness should we all have so that we never find ourselves in  a mess like this again?   It is not disputed, Russia attacked our democracy. It was ordered by  Vladimir Putin. They used a multifaceted campaign of social media  trolls, the dissemination of fake news, the hacking of Democratic  emails, and the breaking into State voter registration systems. They  had a preferred candidate in mind in Donald Trump. And they didn't do  it because they were bored. They didn't do it because they were testing  software. They did it because they wanted something in return. They saw  a candidate who admired their President, they wanted sanctions rolled  back, and they wanted to reduce the role of NATO.   But the most disturbing and the most bone-chilling finding that the  intelligence community made was that Russia intends to do it again. And  by the looks of things, they will be more successful next time because,  since this past attack, we have done nothing to improve the structural  integrity of our elections. We have done nothing to have a frank  conversation with the American people about how we all need to be more  aware about what a foreign adversary's intent is when they hack emails  and then disseminate fake news.   This is a time for Republicans and Democrats to unite. Democrats may  have been the victim of this most recent attack. If history has its  way, another adversary perhaps could attack us and Republicans may be  the victim.                                time  1300    But the constant should always be that both parties say we will never  tolerate foreign interference. The first step to doing that is to  defeat this previous question, allow an amendment to take place so we  can debate having an independent commission, a commission that would be  bipartisan appointed, have a wide mandate to follow the evidence,  explore all the facts, and then report to the American people  recommendations so that this never happens again. We have a discharge  petition right now to also do that. There are a number of names on it.    I saw how our country responded after the  last serious attack that occurred on September 11. Outside, on the  Capitol steps, Republicans and Democrats joined hands. They sang ``God  Bless America.'' But more importantly were the reforms that they  undertook over the next few years to understand the vulnerability, to  put policies in place to make sure we were never vulnerable again, and  report to the American people what they had done.   We have an opportunity again to unite. Our constituents are counting  on us to show that unity, to wear the same uniform, and make sure that  this democracy is still one we protect.
