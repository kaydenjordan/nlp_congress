 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear at the outset of this debate that  this legislation does nothing to make our communities safer, and it  does nothing to improve our immigration system. Instead, H.R. 3003 will  trample the rights of States and localities to determine what is in the  best interest of their public safety, and it will conscript law  enforcement to enforce Federal immigration law.   The ultimate experts on community safety are communities themselves,  and hundreds of them have determined that, as community trust  increases, crime decreases. This is because immigrants will come out of  the shadows and report crimes to local law enforcement when they are  not threatened with deportation. In fact, a recent study found that  community trust jurisdictions are actually safer than their  counterparts.   Against this considered judgment, H.R. 3003 forces localities to  abandon community trust principles and mandates the conscription of  local offices into Federal immigration enforcement. Some localities, of  course, would rightfully resist this conscription. As punishment, H.R.  3003 would rob them of vital law enforcement funding that they depend  on to prevent crime, prosecute criminals, and boost community policing  ranks.   Localities, therefore, would face a losing choice: they can abandon  community trust policies and leave their communities in danger, or they  can leave community trust policies in place but forgo law enforcement  funding, leaving their community in danger.   It is important that we consider that this is more than just bad  policy. It is also likely unconstitutional for multiple reasons. First,  H.R. 3003 likely violates the 10th Amendment by commandeering States to  comply with detainer requests that drain their resources.   In addition, the bill's changes to the Department of Homeland  Security's detainer authority exacerbate the current Fourth Amendment  concerns associated with immigration detainers. The bill does not  require any particularized finding about the individual that may form  the basis of a probable cause determination and fails to provide for a  prompt judicial determination of probable cause.   The bill further compounds constitutional concerns by eliminating the  ability for a detained individual to obtain an independent,  individualized review of his or her bond determination by a neutral  decisionmaker.   For these reasons--and there are others--I urge my colleagues to  please oppose this dangerous, mean-spirited, and constitutionally  suspect legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), who is a senior member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez), a gentleman on the committee who has worked  tirelessly with myself and Ms. Lofgren to make this measure more  understandable.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler), the ranking member of the Intellectual Properties  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member of the Crime,  Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations Subcommittee of the  House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Crowley), our Democratic Caucus chair.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), a former justice to the Texas Supreme Court.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a dedicated civil rights leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. LOFGREN asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), a senior member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3003 is not making our communities safer. If it  was, the bill's sponsors would have heeded the strong opposition of  organizations like the National Fraternal Order of Police, who stated  that, ``withholding needed assistance to law enforcement agencies-- which have no policymaking role--hurts public safety efforts;'' and the  U.S. Conference of Mayors, who cautioned, ``H.R. 3003 is a bad bill for  our cities and their residents and for our Nation. It would jeopardize  public safety, preempt local authority, and expose local governments to  litigation and potential findings of damage.''   Instead, this legislation is a down payment on the President's and  the Republican majority's mass deportation plan.   This bill, and the one that we will debate later today, is a portion  of the mass deportation bill known as the ``Davis-Oliver Act,'' which  has been cited as a priority for the Trump administration, and is  supported by anti-immigrant groups, such as NumbersUSA and the Center  for Immigration Studies.   I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3004 is an anti-immigrant enforcement-only proposal  that represents yet another step in President Trump's mass deportation  plan.   This legislation significantly expands the Federal Government's  ability to prosecute individuals for illegal entry and attempted  reentry into the United States.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say this bill is about  protecting us from criminals. But don't be fooled about the ultimate  effect of this bill. It does far more than target immigrants with  criminal histories.   For the first time, this legislation would make it a felony for an  individual who has been previously removed or merely denied admission  to come to an official port of entry to ask for reentry into the  country legally. This is true even if the individual has no criminal  history whatsoever.   For instance, the expanded offense would apply to persecuted asylum  seekers voluntarily presenting themselves at a port of entry to request  asylum under our own immigration laws.   It would reach desperate victims of sex trafficking who approach the  Customs and Border Protection officer to seek protection.   It would even extend to persons asking to enter on humanitarian  parole to donate lifesaving organs to United States citizen relatives.   Under H.R. 3004, all of these individuals could face up to 2 years in  prison simply for coming to an official port of entry to request  immigration benefits provided under our immigration laws.   Finally, this bill perpetuates the fiction that immigrants are  somehow inherently criminal. Nothing could be further from the truth.  Numerous studies examining this issue conclude that immigrants actually  commit crimes at a significantly lower rate than native-born Americans.   Given this legislation's defects, it comes to us as no surprise that  organizations across the Nation join with me in opposition. They  include:   The conservative Cato Institute, which called H.R. 3004, ``a waste of  Federal resources'' that fails to safeguard ``Americans against serious  criminals.''   Cities For Action, representing over 150 mayors and municipal  leaders, warned the bill would place asylum seekers at further risk.   And the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence,  which described how this measure, H.R. 3004, will punish victims of  domestic and sexual violence merely for requesting protection.   H.R. 3004 is not what its sponsors would like us to believe. In  truth, it is a mean-spirited bill that would have far-reaching  consequences by making it a crime to ask for benefits that our  immigration laws provide.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this dangerous  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), our senior Representative on the Judiciary  Committee.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler), a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of  opposition to H.R. 3004, namely, the Federal Defenders of New York and  407 local, State, national immigrant civil rights, faith, and labor  organizations.                                                   Federal Defenders                                                of New York, Inc.                                        New York, NY, June 29, 2017.      Re H.R. 3004, Kate's Law       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chair, House Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. John Conyers, Jr.,      Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Ryan, Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Goodlatte, and Mr. Conyers:       We write on behalf of the Federal Public and Community       Defenders in response to inquiries for our views on H.R.       3004. We oppose the bill for the following reasons.        H.R. 3004 would make it a crime to openly and directly       present oneself to immigration officials seeking asylum,       temporary protection, or for other innocent reasons. In doing       so, the bill would incentivize people with genuine claims of       fear to enter the country surreptitiously.        Even while criminalizing essentially innocent conduct and       drastically increasing potential penalties, the bill would       purport to deprive defendants of the right to challenge the       validity of fundamentally unfair or unlawful removal orders.        The bill would transform a basic element of the criminal       offense into an affirmative defense and would thereby       unfairly place the burden on the alien to produce records in       the government's control.        The bill would unjustifiably increase potential penalties,       including for those with truly petty criminal records, and       create a significant risk that defendants, in mass guilty       plea proceedings on the border as occur now, would be       pressured to admit prior convictions that they do not have.        Finally, H.R. 3004 raises serious federalism issues and       would impinge on States' sovereign interests by ordering them       to impose certain state prison sentences thereby impeding       States' ability to manage their own criminal justice systems       and prison populations.        The bill would harm individuals, families and communities       not just on the border but across the nation. Nearly 21       percent of reentry prosecutions in fiscal year 2016 were in       districts other than those on the southwest border, in every       state and district in the country. And though there may be a       perception that illegal reentry offenders are dangerous       criminals, the motive for most people returning to the United       States after being removed is to reunite with family, return       to the only place they know as home, seek work to support       their families, or flee violence or persecution in their home       countries. Further, according to a recent Sentencing       Commission study, one quarter of reentry offenders had no       prior conviction described in Sec. 1326(b), and the most       common prior offense was driving under the influence,       followed by minor non-violent misdemeanors and felonies,       illegal entry, illegal reentry, and simple possession of       drugs. Nearly half (49.5%) had children in the United States,       and over two thirds (67.1%) had relatives in this country.       Over half (53.5%) were under the age of 18 when they first       entered the United States,  [[Page H5338]]       and almost three quarters (74.5%) had worked here for more       than a year at some point before their arrest. These are not       hardened criminals.      I. The Bill Would Make It a Crime To Openly and Directly Present  Oneself to Immigration Officials, Seeking Asylum, Temporary Protection,  or for Other Innocent Reasons, and Would Thus Incentivize Surreptitious                                   Entry         The bill would add as criminal acts in violation of 8       U.S.C. Sec. 1326, ``crosses the border'' or ``attempts to       cross the border,'' and would define ``crosses the border''       as the ``physical act of crossing the border, regardless of       whether the alien is free from official restraint.'' This       would mean that people previously denied admission or removed       who present themselves at a designated port of entry seeking       asylum or for other innocent reasons, and who intend to be       and are in fact under official restraint, would for the first       time be guilty of violating Sec. 1326.        Freedom from official restraint is an essential part of the       definition of entering, attempting to enter, and being found       in the United States under the law of most circuits. Entering       has long required both ``physical presence'' in the country       and ``freedom from official restraint.'' Attempting to enter       requires proof of specific intent to commit the completed       offense of entry, and so requires intent to enter ``free of       official restraint.'' Similarly, an alien cannot be ``found       in'' the United States unless he has been free from official       restraint. An alien is under official restraint whenever he       ``lacks the freedom to go at large and mix with the       population,'' including when he directly and voluntarily       surrenders himself to immigration officials at a port of       entry to seek asylum, protection, or imprisonment.        Thus, an alien who walked directly across the border to a       marked border patrol car and asked to be taken into custody       did not attempt to re-enter the United States because he       intended to be, and was, under official restraint. Likewise,       an alien who crossed the border after being beaten by gang       members in Mexico, in a delusional belief that they were       chasing him, with the sole intent of placing himself in the       protective custody of U.S. officials, could not be guilty of       attempting to enter. In a similar case, the government       dismissed the charges after the border patrol agent's report       confirmed that the defendant had crossed the border and asked       the agent for protection from people he feared were trying to       kill him. Similarly, an alien who went directly to the border       station and presented himself for entry was not ``found in''       the United States because he was never free from official       restraint.        Thus, under current law, an alien who directly and overtly       presents herself to immigration officials at a port of entry,       as opposed to evading official restraint, has not violated       Sec. 1326; even one who crosses the border outside a port of       entry but in sight of immigration officials, and who presents       herself directly to such officials, has not done so. But       absent the ``freedom from official restraint'' requirement,       the law would ``make criminals out of persons who, for any       number of innocent reasons, approach immigration officials at       the border.'' Argueta-Rosales, 819 F.3d at 1160. ``For       example, [an alien] might approach a port of entry to seek       asylum, or he might be under the mistaken assumption that he       has been granted permission to reenter. Under those       circumstances, the alien would not have committed the       gravamen of the offense of attempted illegal entry in       violation of Sec. 1326(a).'' United States v. Valdez-Novoa,       780 F.3d 906, 923 (9th Cir. 2015) (Bybee, J.). Because ``in a       literal and physical sense a person coming from abroad enters       the United States whenever he reaches any land, water or air       space within the territorial limits of this nation,''       ``freedom from official restraint must be added to physical       presence.'' Vavilatos, 209 F.2d at 197.        Permitting arrest and prosecution regardless of whether the       person was free from official restraint is particularly       troubling because although border patrol agents are required       by law to refer an alien for a ``credible fear'' or       ``reasonable fear'' interview with an asylum officer upon       indication that she fears persecution or has suffered or may       suffer torture, people are increasingly being turned away at       the border without the required protection screening. Under       H.R. 3004, agents would now be empowered to arrest them       rather than turn them away.        By eliminating the ``freedom from official restraint''       requirement, the bill would cast aside well-settled century-      old law from the civil immigration context that for nearly as       long has functioned well in the criminal immigration context       to distinguish illicit or clandestine entries from legitimate       attempts to bring oneself to the attention of U.S.       authorities at the border.        Since it would now be a crime to openly seek help, H.R.       3004 would have the perverse effect of incentivizing people       with genuine claims of fear to ``jump the fence'' in the hope       of not being caught and returned to a country where the       danger is real. Faced with a choice between being killed or       risking being caught and removed, the logical, life-      sustaining choice is obvious.       II. The Bill Would Perversely Criminalize Repeated Unsuccessful  Attempts to Gain Asylum, Even As Border Patrol Agents Increasingly Turn                  Away Asylum Seekers in Violation of Law         The bill would create a new crime for an alien who has been       denied admission, excluded, deported or removed three or more       times who subsequently enters, attempts to enter, crosses the       border, attempts to cross the border, or is found in the       United States, subject to punishment for up to ten years.       This would criminalize, for the first time, repeated efforts       to seek asylum that are genuine but unsuccessful, as each       attempt counts as a denial of admission or removal.        As noted above, border patrol agents are increasingly       turning away asylum seekers without referring them for       appropriate screening as required by law. Human rights       organizations have documented at least 125 cases of asylum       seekers being turned away without proper safeguards to       protect their right to seek protection between November 2016       and April 2017, often repeatedly. For example, a Honduran       family whose son was murdered by a gang after he was denied       asylum, another Honduran family whose son showed the agent a       bullet hole wound in his chest, and a Mexican woman whose       father, son, grandfather and uncle were all killed within       seven days, were repeatedly turned away without referral for       protection screening or asylum adjudication. Agents informed       people seeking refuge that the United States no longer gives       asylum, threatened them with force, or threatened to call       Mexican immigration authorities to deport them to the country       they were fleeing.        A person who presents himself at a port of entry without a       valid visa is subject to denial of admission or expedited       removal. But if such a person expresses fear of return, he is       entitled by law not to be expelled but to be interviewed by       an asylum officer. When border patrol agents simply expel       people who express fear without allowing them a chance to be       interviewed and to press their claims, the agents are       breaking the law and giving these people a removal order or a       denial of admission that they should not have. Thus, bona       fide asylum-seekers--those most likely to accumulate ``three       strikes''--would face criminal prosecution rather than what       they are entitled to--a non-adversarial interview with an       asylum officer that could ultimately lead to persecution-      based relief.    III. The Bill Would Purport to Unconstitutionally Prohibit Challenges                     to the Validity of Removal Orders         The bill would state that ``an alien may not challenge the       validity of any prior removal order concerning the alien.''       This provision, perhaps more than any other, demonstrates the       overreaching and unduly harsh nature of these proposed       changes to existing law. The bill seeks to visit criminal       convictions and drastic penalties on noncitizens who reenter       even when the administrative process that led to their       original deportation or removal was fundamentally unfair or       achieved an unlawful result, and even when they were deprived       of judicial review of that fundamental injustice. The Supreme       Court long ago held, in United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481       U.S. 828 (1987), that a defendant cannot be convicted and       punished under Sec. 1326 when the deportation order was       issued in an agency proceeding bereft of due process that no       court ever reviewed. But this bill seeks to do precisely       that, and at the same time to criminalize attempts to enter       the country legally and in most cases to increase the       penalties that may be imposed.      IV. The Affirmative Defenses Would Be Unavailable To Most, Do Not   Address Any Existing Problem, and Would Unfairly Place the Burden on         Defendants to Produce Records In the Government's Control         The bill would purport to create two affirmative defenses:       (1) ``prior to the alleged violation,'' the alien ``sought       and received express consent of [DHS] to reapply for       admission,'' or (2) ``with respect to an alien previously       denied admission and removed,'' the alien ``was not required       to obtain such advance consent under the [INA] or any prior       Act,'' and ``had complied with all other laws and regulations       governing his or her admission into the United States.'' The       first defense would be unavailable to anyone who did not have       the wherewithal, resources and time to file the proper form       and get it approved before arriving in the United States. The       second defense is not available to anyone whose period of       inadmissibility has not expired, usually ten years. These       requirements are simply unrealistic for those with little or       no education or money or who are fleeing violence.        Moreover, this is a solution in search of a problem, and it       would undermine due process. Because the absence of most of       these conditions is currently an element, see 8 U.S.C.       Sec. 1326(a)(2), the government routinely provides the       defense with the relevant records, which are in the       individual's ``A file,'' maintained in government custody and       otherwise available to the individual only through a FOIA       request. Placing the burden on the defendant to prove an       affirmative defense would illogically and unfairly require       him to produce records that are in the government's control.   V. The Bill Would Unjustifiably Increase Potential Penalties, Including                for Those With Truly Petty Criminal Records         While it appears that the statutory maxima would increase       for most defendants under the bill, there is no evidence that       any increase is needed to reflect the seriousness of these       offenses, or that such increases would be effective in       deterring illegal immigration. At the same time, the cost of       additional incarceration would be steep--approximately  [[Page H5339]]       $32,000 per prisoner per year. If each of the 16,000 persons       convicted of illegal reentry in 2016 received one additional       year, it would cost the taxpayers an extra half a billion       dollars.        Increasing sentences for these offenders is also       unnecessary and unfair because noncitizens suffer much       harsher conditions of confinement than other federal       prisoners. BOP contracts with private prison companies to       detain noncitizens convicted of immigration offenses and       other federal crimes. A recent analysis shows that many       persons incarcerated in ``immigrant only contract prisons''       suffer serious medical neglect, in some cases leading to       death. An investigation done by the American Civil Liberties       Union found that ``the men held in these private prisons are       subjected to shocking abuse and mistreatment, and       discriminated against by BOP policies that impede family       contact and exclude them from rehabilitative programs.''        Two of the penalty increases are particularly unwarranted.       The bill would increase a defendant's statutory maximum from       two to 10 years if he was removed subsequent to conviction of       any three misdemeanors, whereas the 10-year maximum currently       applies only if the three misdemeanors involved drugs, crimes       against the person, or both. This would apply to a re-entrant       with a truly petty criminal record. If the defendant had       three misdemeanor convictions for driving without a license,       a common scenario for undocumented immigrants and other       impoverished people, his maximum sentence would more than       triple. And because the bill does not require that the three       misdemeanors stem from three separate occasions, a 10-year       statutory maximum would apply to a re-entrant with       convictions from a single incident for disorderly conduct,       public intoxication and public urination.        Likewise, the 25-year maximum for any three felonies would       increase the maximum sentence by 15 years for garden variety       felonies, such as felony possession of a small quantity of       drugs. Worse, if the definition of ``felony'' means any       offense ``punishable by a term of more than 1 year under the       laws of'' the convicting jurisdiction, it would punish       defendants who were never convicted of a felony by up to 25       years, because the maximum punishment is more than one year       for misdemeanors in many states, including Colorado, Iowa,       Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, South       Carolina, and Vermont. We are also concerned that definition       of ``felony,'' by mistake or by design, indicates that if a       particular kind of offense is punishable by more than one       year in any jurisdiction, it is a felony; it states that       ``any offense'' is a felony if it is punishable by more than       one year ``under the laws of the United States, any State, or       a foreign government.''    VI. The Bill Would Create A Significant Risk That Defendants Would Be      Pressured Into Admitting Prior Convictions That They Do Not Have         The bill would require that prior convictions upon which       increased statutory maxima are based be alleged in an       indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt at trial or       admitted by the defendant. Records of prior convictions are       notoriously unreliable and national criminal databases that       generate ``rap sheets'' frequently contain purported       convictions that have been misrecorded, expunged, or even       belong to other individuals. In border districts where the       great majority of illegal re-entry prosecutions take place,       re-entry cases have often been rapidly ``processed'' in       batches of up to eighty defendants at once, with 99% of cases       ending in guilty pleas. Given the way these cases are handled       on the border, and the fact that many if not most of the       defendants speak little or no English and have little or no       education, this provision carries a significant risk that       defendants will be pressured to admit to convictions they do       not have and thus significantly raise their sentencing       exposure.   VII. The Bill Would Impinge on States' Sovereign Interests in Managing                        Their Own Prison Populations         The bill would mandate that any alien removed pursuant to 8       U.S.C. Sec. 1231(a)(4) who enters or attempts to enter,       crosses or attempts to cross the border, or is found in the       United States, ``shall be incarcerated for the remainder of       the sentence that was pending at the time of deportation       without any reduction for parole or supervised release''       unless the alien affirmatively demonstrates express consent.       Section 1231(a)(4)(B) provides that the Attorney General may       remove an alien convicted of a non-violent offense before he       has completed a sentence of imprisonment (i) of an alien in       in federal custody and the Attorney General determines that       removal is appropriate and in the best interest of the United       States, (ii) of an alien in State custody if the chief state       official determines that removal is appropriate and in the       best interest of the State and submits a written request for       removal. Thus, for example, an alien sentenced to 8 years who       is eligible for parole in 6 years may apply for early       conditional release and be removed after 5 years. Under H.R.       3004, if he illegally re-entered thereafter, he would be       required to serve all three years that were pending when he       was removed.        As far as we are aware, Sec. 1231(a)(4)(B)(i) has never       been systematically implemented for federal inmates. Some       states, however, have implemented some sort of program to       avail themselves of Sec. 1231(a)(4)(B)(ii). A handful have       entered into an MOU with ICE in which they agree that a       person removed pursuant to Sec. 1231(a)(4)(B)(ii) who returns       illegally will serve the remainder of the original sentence.       Other states release prisoners to ICE under       Sec. 1231(a)(4)(B)(ii) through state legislation or parole       board policy under which they do not agree to that condition.        HR 3004 would require any State that releases a prisoner to       ICE under Sec. 1231(a)(4)(B)(ii) to incarcerate such a person       for the remainder of the sentence should they return       unlawfully. It would thus impinge on States' sovereign       interests in managing their own prison populations according       to their own priorities and resources. The bill would remove       the flexibility that States currently have to treat       unlawfully returned prisoners as they see fit, and would       ossify the ICE MOU into law.

Re Vote NO on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003,           and Kate's Law, H.R. 3004       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 407 undersigned       local, state, and national immigrant, civil rights, faith-      based, and labor organizations, we urge you to oppose the No       Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate's Law, H.R.       3004, and any similar legislation that jeopardizes public       safety, erodes the goodwill forged between local police and       its residents, and perpetuates the criminalization and       incarceration of immigrants. H.R. 3003 would strip badly       needed law enforcement funding for state and local       jurisdictions, runs afoul of the Tenth and Fourth Amendment,       and unnecessarily expands the government's detention       apparatus. H.R. 3004 unwisely expands the federal       government's ability to criminally prosecute immigrants for       immigration-based offenses, excludes critical humanitarian       protections for those fleeing violence, and doubles down on       the failed experiment of incarceration for immigration       violations.        Over 600 state and local jurisdictions have policies or       ordinances that disentangle their state and local law       enforcement agencies from enforcing federal immigration law.       The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, H.R. 3003, seeks to       attack so-called ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions (many of whom do       not consider themselves as such) by penalizing state and       local jurisdictions that follow the Fourth Amendment of the       U.S. Constitution by refusing to honor constitutionally       infirm requests for detainers. H.R. 3003 penalizes       jurisdictions by eliminating various federal grants,       including funding through the Cops on the Beat program, the       Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, and       any other federal grant related to law enforcement or       immigration. Importantly, using the threat of withholding       federal grants to coerce state and local jurisdictions likely       runs afoul of the Tenth Amendment's prohibition on       commandeering, a position supported by over 300 law       professors.        ``Sanctuary'' policies are critical to promote public       safety for local communities. Fearing referral to U.S.       Immigration and Customs Enforcement, victims and witnesses of       crime are significantly less likely to communicate with local       law enforcement. Local law enforcement authorities have       repeatedly echoed this sentiment, acknowledging that       community policing policies are paramount to enhancing public       safety. Indeed, ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions have less crime       and more economic development than similarly situated non-      ``sanctuary'' jurisdictions. Withholding critically-needed       federal funding would, paradoxically, severely cripple the       ability of state and local jurisdictions to satisfy the       public safety needs of their communities.        Kate's Law, H.R. 3004, would further criminalize the       immigrant community by drastically increasing penalties for       immigrants convicted of unlawful reentry. Operation       Streamline encapsulates our nation's failed experiment with       employing criminal penalties to deter migration. Under       Operation Streamline, the federal government prosecutes       immigrants for reentry at significant rates. By all practical       measures, Operation Streamline has failed to deter migration,       wasted billions of taxpayer dollars, and unfairly punished       thousands of immigrants who try to enter or reenter the       United States to reunite with their children and loved ones.       We fear that H.R. 3004's increased penalties for reentry       would double down on this failed strategy, explode the prison       population, and cost billions of dollars.  [[Page H5340]]         Instead of passing discredited enforcement-only       legislation, Congress should move forward on enacting just       immigration reform legislation that provides a roadmap to       citizenship for the nation's eleven million aspiring       Americans and eliminates mass detention and deportation       programs that undermine fundamental human rights. Legislation       that erodes public safety, disrespects local democratic       processes, and raises serious constitutional concerns       represents an abdication of the Congress' responsibility to       enact fair, humane, and just immigration policy. In light of       the above, we urge you to vote NO on the No Sanctuary for       Criminals Act, H.R. 3003 and Kate's Law, H.R. 3004.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. LOFGREN asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu), a former member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains?    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), and I ask unanimous consent  that she may control that time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
