 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  pro-life Hyde amendment. Typically,  [[Page H3824]]  during appropriation season, of course, Democrats and Republicans  debate our differences, but we have always historically rallied  together in opposition to taxpayer-funded abortions, and we have  adopted the bipartisan Hyde amendment.   However, for some inexplicable reason, this year is different. In  1994, then-Senator Joe Biden famously stated: ``Those of us who are  opposed to abortion should not be compelled to pay for them.'' Of  course, he was right. But the President's position has changed now,  giving fuel to the fire of Democrat leadership here in this House to  follow suit in their own funding bills.   It is time to make these Hyde amendment protections permanent. It is  true: Hyde saves lives. And today I am asking my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to recognize the inherent dignity of every single  human life, rejecting this blatant attack on pro-life amendments like  the Hyde amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in this House.
