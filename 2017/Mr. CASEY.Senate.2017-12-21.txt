 Thank you, Mr. President.   I ask to speak in morning business.    Mr. President, I rise this morning to outline some ideas  about our national security as we approach the end of the year.   Many Americans are heading into the holiday season with some very  reasonable fears about the threats facing our Nation. In 2017, we saw  an emboldened North Korean regime testing missiles and nuclear weapons.  Terrorist groups continue to execute attacks across the globe. Violent  state and nonstate actors continue to destabilize Syria, Afghanistan,  Ukraine, Yemen, Nigeria, and others. We saw Russia continue meddling in  elections, just as they did in ours last year.   This is a year of great volatility and uncertainty. However, we also  saw the U.S. military leading an international coalition that is  loosening the stranglehold ISIS had on parts of Iraq and Syria. We saw  the recovery of American hostages, including constituents of mine, held  captive for years by terrorists. In Europe, U.S. and NATO forces  partnered to counter Russian aggression and dispel propaganda. U.S.  development assistance projects helped hundreds of millions of people  across the world, including 11 million farmers and 27\1/2\ million  children under the Feed the Future Program.   Even when it seemed like there were many reasons to be afraid, the  U.S. military, diplomats, and development professionals were  responsible for a lot of good progress this year.   On Monday of this week, President Trump laid out his administration's  national security strategy. I commend the work of the national security  professionals who crafted the document which warrants a thorough  review. It is a substantial body of work, but it paints a very dark  picture of the world and our role in it.   A little more than 2 years ago, I stood on this floor and invoked the  words of Senator Vandenberg--the Senator from Michigan back in the  World War II era--for ``maximum united effort'' and Senator  Vandenberg's admonition that politics should stop at the water's edge.  When I spoke these words, this was at a time when it seemed the only  response my Republican colleagues had to the Obama administration's  foreign policy moves was categorical condemnation.   I will not categorically condemn the administration's new strategy,  but I will pose a challenge to reject the false choice between  investing at home and engaging abroad; utilize our diplomatic and  development toolkit as much, if not more, than we exercise our defense  capabilities; lead by example. The world will indeed become a dark  place if we hide America's light under a bushel basket, to use words  from Scripture.   In the face of our adversaries' aggression, we can choose between  competition and cooperation. The new strategy outlined by the  administration references competition nearly three times more than  cooperation. I suggest to the administration the words of President  Franklin D. Roosevelt, who said: ``Competition has been shown to be  useful up to a certain point and no further, but cooperation, which is  a thing we must strive for today, begins where competition leaves  off.''   Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Democratic leader.  [[Page S8191]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, I want to thank the Democratic leader for  his remarks.   When I was speaking a few moments ago about national security, I had  made a suggestion to the administration that there is a national  security strategy that has been outlined and that the administration  reject the false choice between investing at home and engaging abroad  and make sure that they utilize our diplomatic and development toolkits  as much as if not more than they exercise our defense capabilities.   We have major challenges, and that is why I think it is important to  outline this morning some of those challenges and some of our responses  as we head into the new year.   Just for discussion purposes, I wanted to paint the picture of a  nation that--it doesn't describe one nation, but I think we can imagine  a country that fits this description or at least a number of countries  that might. Imagine a sovereign state, a member of the United Nations,  a nation whose leaders are singularly focused on staying in power and  who will do anything to remain in power, including undermining their  colleagues and erstwhile friends. In this country I am describing,  those who speak truth to power are dismissed, ridiculed, or, at worst,  treated as criminals. This particular country or profile of a country  looks inward, putting its domestic troubles first as its reputation in  the world declines. Out of fear of its near-peer competitors, the  country retreats from diplomatic engagement and doubles down on  military capabilities. Does this sound familiar? It might to some. It  may describe a number of countries in whole or in part.   Of course, there are a number of countries that fit this description.  Certainly, the dictatorial regimes that rule North Korea, Syria, and  Iran prioritize self-preservation over the welfare of their citizens.  In Russia and China, journalists and opposition leaders are regularly  silenced, jailed, or worse.   Here in the United States, we are going through an especially  turbulent chapter in the American story. As we celebrate the holidays,  we might be dreading the inevitable political debates with family  members or friends whose views differ from ours. However, in that  fictitious, oppressive country that I described earlier, you can't have  these debates, or you can try, but you won't last too long because the  authorities will come knocking.   That is what is great about our country. The United States is the  land of the free and the home of the brave, and I am reminded of that  every time I meet with servicemembers and veterans who are willing to  put their lives on the line every day to defend our inalienable rights  to criticize and to disagree with our leaders.   So what about this new strategy that the administration just outlined  this week? This new strategy states, in pertinent part, that ``America  possesses unmatched political, economic, military, and technological  advantages.'' That is what the strategy says, and that is certainly  true. But I think we should add a few other advantages, even  attributes, that are part of the American story, part of the American  advantage.   Certainly, our history of generosity sets us apart from the world, a  tradition of pluralism as well, the freedom to debate and dissent  without fear, the respect for the rule of law, and finally a culture of  innovation unmatched anywhere in the world. As I have said before,  Americans don't wait for the future; we invent the future.   Through the execution of its strategy, the administration has an  opportunity to invent the future of our Nation, as well as its role in  the world--a future where the American economy is firing on all  cylinders, where investments here at home lift up everyone, where our  researchers and manufacturers lead the world in the production of  cutting-edge technologies.   For the last 11 months, this administration has sent the world mixed  signals about what ``America first'' really means, from pulling out of  the Paris climate agreement, to threatening to walk away from NATO, to  hollowing out the State Department. I believe the strategy  implementation presents an opportunity to reverse that course. We  cannot turn away from the world and try to go it alone. We should ask  our allies, certainly, to pull their weight and pay their fair share.  Whether it is NATO or the counter-ISIS coalition, the United States can  always press our partners to do more, but not by threatening that we  will abandon these alliances or by creating any uncertainty about these  alliances. Simply put, we need partners to tackle some of the greatest  threats facing our Nation and the world.    Let's go through a couple of them.   North Korea is first on the list. The North Korean regime is  unpredictable and armed with nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons  and the means to deliver them. Just across the demilitarized zone are  tens of thousands of U.S. forces and our South Korean allies. Just  across the water are more  [[Page S8193]]  U.S. military personnel and our Japanese allies. This regime is a  significant threat--the North Korean regime. It is a threat exacerbated  by reckless ridicule, bombastic statements, and ill-considered tweets.  One miscalculation can be disastrous. The administration should  accelerate serious, sober diplomacy in lockstep with our allies. For  the New Year, let's agree to a new rule for all of us--both branches of  government: Leave the tweets for domestic policy only. Sound foreign  policy and security policy cannot be done in 280 characters.   Congress has offered the administration powerful leverage in this  circumstance in the form of several pieces of legislation. First, the  Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act passed this  summer, and the Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea Act is  pending before the Senate now. I support these tough, bipartisan  sanctions measures because I believe turning the economic screws,  coupled with genuine diplomacy, can yield results. In the New Year, I  urge the President to tone down the rhetoric and to empower the  Secretary of State and our senior diplomats to find a diplomatic path  toward a stable North Korea that doesn't threaten the United States or  our allies.   How about terrorist groups around the world? Over the last 16 years,  the U.S. military, the intelligence community, and our homeland  security professionals have worked hand in hand to meet the rise of  terrorist groups head on. We owe the men and women in uniform a debt of  gratitude for tirelessly leading the coalition fight that has rolled  back ISIS's territorial gains. Implementing the administration's new  strategy and its call to fight terrorism at its source is not just  about the military fight. The United States should also lead the  international community in addressing the underlying issues that drive  terrorist recruitment and help to rebuild communities newly liberated  from terrorist control.   Think about this. More than 65 million people around the world are  displaced from their homes right now. There is no purely military  solution for this refugee crisis. A successful counterterrorism  strategy requires us to work with our partners for information sharing  and for contributions of development assistance.   Another trouble spot in the world is Syria. In Syria, the connection  between instability, displacement, and terrorism is clear. This  conflict has been raging for nearly 7 years. In the absence of U.S.  engagement on a political solution to this crisis, regional powers-- namely, Russia, Iran, and Turkey--have run the table, to the benefit of  the murderous Assad regime and at the expense of the Syrian people. The  United States has abdicated its leadership role and ceded control of  the outcomes to nations with interests often in direct conflict with  our own.   Recently, we learned that the administration will endorse a political  transition plan that leaves Bashar al-Assad in power for at least  another 4 years. This is unacceptable and dangerous. Assad is  responsible for terrible war crimes that led to the deaths of hundreds  of thousands of Syrians and the displacement of millions more. The  strategy outlined by the administration says: ``We will seek a  settlement to the Syrian civil war that sets the conditions for  refugees to return home and rebuild their lives and safety.''   I agree with that goal. Most people would agree with that goal, but  the administration has missed the bigger picture. We need a strategy  that pushes back on Russian and Iranian influence in Syria and  addresses the underlying grievances that led to the conflict in the  first place.   Let me move to Iran. The Iranian regime remains a powerful force for  instability in the Middle East, especially through its support of  terrorist proxies and militias. We know that the Iranians want to  maintain control of territory linking Tehran with Beirut. So they will  continue to act against U.S. interests in Iraq and Syria. Here, again,  Congress has offered powerful tools to the administration in the form  of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.   The nuclear deal with Iran is giving us an unprecedented visibility  on the Iranian nuclear program, but the multilateral diplomatic  channels built alongside that agreement have atrophied under this  administration. Every time the President threatens to walk away from  the Iran nuclear deal, he sends a clear signal to our allies and  adversaries alike: U.S. commitments are written in disappearing ink.   If the administration wants to get tough on Iran's nonnuclear bad  behavior, there are concrete steps to take today:   No. 1, work with our allies to step up maritime interdictions of any  illicit weapons traffic to or from Iran.   No. 2, push the Europeans to do more to combat the financial networks  that enrich the Iranian terrorist proxy, Hezbollah. My bipartisan Stop  Terrorist Operational Resources and Money Act, or the so-called STORM  Act, which is bipartisan, could help with that.   No. 3, begin diplomatic conversations with our allies about a  multilateral strategy to curtail the Iranian ballistic missile program.   All of these efforts take cooperation with our allies, which the  President makes harder every time he calls into question the future of  the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.   Finally, as to Russia and China, the new strategy by this  administration repeatedly describes Russia and China as our  competitors. Let me be clear. These countries are not our friends. They  actively work against U.S. interests. They are threatened by American  military dominance and economic power, and both are trying to game the  system to undermine our advantages.   China systemically, perniciously games the international trade system  to its advantage. I firmly believe American workers and industry can  outinnovate and outproduce any others in the world when the playing  field is level. Driven by similar motives, Russia has meddled in  elections across the Western world, trying to undermine confidence in  one of our most fundamental institutions of democracy. Again, there are  concrete steps the administration can take to counter these threats  from both China and Russia: No. 1, shore up our electoral systems and  help others do the same; No. 2, counter propaganda; No. 3, fight  corruption; and No. 4, get serious about holding trade cheaters like  China accountable.   Through engagement and cooperation, we can lead the rest of the world  away from the Cold War-era clash of major powers that Russia and China  want to create.   In conclusion, if this outline of some of the threats and challenges  posed seems like a tremendous challenge--a great challenge for our  Nation--it is because it always has been so. It has always been a  challenge.   President Truman once said:         America was not built on fear. America was built on       courage, on imagination and on unbeatable determination to do       the job at hand.    When faced with a challenge, whether it is Pennsylvanians or  Americans, we don't shrink inward. We step up. Our adversaries want us  to be divided and dispirited. These adversaries underestimate the  courage, the imagination, and the determination of the American people.   President Trump might see it differently, but as we close out 2017, I  see a world that needs American leadership more than ever. To  paraphrase President Kennedy, we should seek not a Pax Americana  enforced on the world by American weapons of war but a genuine peace  that makes life on Earth worth living. The American people are ready to  rise to that challenge. I hope the administration is too.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to commend Robert Mueller's  career as a public servant and to condemn partisan, political attacks  on Mr. Mueller's reputation and American democratic systems.   A brief glance at Mr. Mueller's biography reflects his consistent  commitment to serve the American people with honor and courage. As a  young man, Mr. Mueller served with distinction in the Vietnam war. His  list of commendations and military decorations, including a Bronze  Star, two Navy Commendation Medals, the Purple Heart, and the  Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, are emblematic of his leadership and  exemplary service.   Mr. Mueller not only fought courageously on the battlefield, but upon  returning home and earning his law degree, he continued serving his  country throughout his legal career. He cut his teeth working in U.S.  attorney's offices in Boston and San Francisco for over a decade, and  when he later served at the Department of Justice, Mr. Mueller was  nominated by President George H. W. Bush to lead the criminal division,  where he oversaw cases as diverse as the prosecution of Panamanian  dictator Manuel Noriega and the Lockerbie bombing.   In 1995, Mr. Mueller's dedication to public service led him to leave  a high-paying position at a private firm to join the DC U.S. attorney's  office homicide division to hold violent offenders accountable for  their crimes. Three years later, he became a U.S. attorney himself,  serving in San Francisco and earning himself a reputation as a dogged  and fair prosecutor committed to enforcing the rule of law.   In 2001, Mr. Mueller was nominated by a second Republican President,  George W. Bush, as the Director of the FBI, a position to which he was  confirmed unanimously by this body. Whether navigating our response to  the atrocities of 9/11, leading the Bureau's reform in its aftermath,  or trailblazing the Bureau's role in combating cyber crimes, his tenure  has been widely lauded. In fact, in 2011, as his 10-year term was set  to end, we in the Senate voted 100 to 0 to extend his term until 2013.   In an era of increasing political and cultural tribalism, each time  Mr. Mueller has been named or nominated for a new position, he has  received bipartisan and unabashed praise--and rightly so.   Mr. Mueller, as an expert in law enforcement, could not be better  suited for the task at hand: an investigation into Russia's  interference in the U.S. elections. That Russia interfered in our  elections is neither conjecture nor an attempt to rewrite the political  outcomes of 2016. It is a fact that was true for the U.S. and many  European allies in the last year and will remain a serious risk to the  validity of our future elections if we do not take action. Mr.  Mueller's investigation will serve as a necessary step to secure the  ability of Americans to cast their vote in confidence for those who  will represent them in Washington. Nothing could be more sacred or more  American.   Serious, prudent, and thorough congressional oversight is always  appropriate. Reckless, partisan attacks on the integrity of an honest  public servant are not the same as congressional oversight. Attacks  like these embolden our enemies, animate opponents of democracy, and  inspire terrorists. These attacks are nothing short of unpatriotic.   I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for  the integrity of the process that Mr. Mueller is leading. Skepticism of  the outcomes of his investigation triggered by dishonest smears on Mr.  Mueller's reputation by Washington politicians would have lasting  results and would compromise the ability of law enforcement to protect  U.S. from our enemies, foreign and domestic.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak about ``A Beautiful Here,''  a memoir by Linda Phillips that chronicles her struggle to overcome the  extraordinary grief of losing her son, Nuci, to suicide following his  long battle with depression.   Linda writes about an empathetic, caring, and happy child who grows  increasingly distressed through adolescence. Nuci retreated from their  close-knit family and, despite their efforts to support him through  several periods of crisis and treatments, he succumbed to his disease.   Though the family was distraught and heartbroken by Nuci's death,  Linda Phillips was also appalled at the lack of supports for  individuals struggling with suicide and for families who have lost  loved ones to depression.   At multiple points, Nuci failed to receive services or the  compassionate support he needed. Indeed, after calling a crisis hotline  while in college, Nuci was taken into custody by police and placed in  handcuffs. Ultimately, the incident resulted in his expulsion. On  another occasion, he was told to wait over a month for services when  seeking support for his depression while in school.   Linda also saw other families pull their children from much-needed  treatment programs because they could not afford the costly care. She  saw firsthand that survivors of suicide are often relegated to the  shadows, met by uncomfortable silence, or blamed for their loved ones'  deaths.   Linda's personal account sheds light on this tragic and pervasive  problem. Though Nuci Phillips took his own life 20 years ago, his  story, sadly, remains just as relevant today.   The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention reports that nearly  36,000 American's die by suicide each year; that is one American every  15 minutes. According to the Center for Disease Control, CDC, suicide  is the third leading cause of death among young people between the ages  of 10 and 24 and results in approximately 4,600 lives lost each year.   In recent years, a shocking number of young people have attempted or  ended their life through suicide as a result of bullying. Though not  all instances of bullying lead to suicide, bully victims are between  two to nine times more likely to consider suicide than nonvictims,  according to studies by Yale University.   Nearly one in four students aged 12 to 18 are affected by bullying  and harassment, according to recent data from the Department of  Education. Another Department study estimates that 60,000 students in  the U.S. do not attend school each day because they fear being bullied.  Bullying and harassment are a significant problem in our schools.   These are issues that we can begin to address today by confronting  bullying in our schools through strong antibullying policies. In far  too many communities, whether in Pennsylvania or across the Nation, we  are forced to deal with tragic consequences of bullying or harassment  when these policies or organizations do not exist. Other resources  include school counselors and crisis hotlines.   My bill, the Safe Schools Improvement Act, may not prevent all  incidences of bullying, but it is an important step in the direction of  tackling this problem and holding school districts accountable.   Depression and suicide, whether brought on by bullying or not, is a  serious disease with potentially deadly results. More teenagers and  young adults die from suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS,  birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease  combined.  [[Page S8250]]    We must fight against this destructive illness by ensuring all  children and young adults have access to affordable and effective  mental health treatment and services, such as counseling, medication,  and crisis intervention. I would like to thank Linda Phillips for  sharing her story and helping to shine a light on this pervasive  disease.                            ____________________
