 I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself and on  behalf of Senator Lee.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Hawley and Lee is for counsel to the  President:         The U.S. Federal Courts have held, most prominently in the       Blagojevich case, that it is not unlawful for a public       official to condition his official acts on official acts       performed by another public officer. Is there any application       to the allegations against President Trump?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question.   I think an important threshold point to make here is that we are not  even in the realm of exchanging official acts, because there has been  no proof of a quid pro quo here. We are not in the realm of a situation  where there is one official act being traded for another.   I think that we have gone through the evidence that makes it quite  clear that both, with respect to a meeting with the President--a  bilateral meeting--and with respect to the temporary pause of security  assistance, the evidence just doesn't stack up to show that President  Trump linked either of those. Both took place--the meeting and the  release of the aid--without Ukrainians doing anything, announcing or  beginning any investigations. There is nothing in the transcript  linking them to a quid pro quo. The Ukrainians didn't even know that  there had been a temporary pause on the aid, and I could go on with a  list of points on that.    I think if there were any application hypothetically, it would come  in the realm of the fact that in foreign policy there are situations  where there can be situations where one government wants some action  from another and wants that action from another in a way that would  condition other policies of one country.   You can say: We would like you--and this happens. For example, with  the Northern Triangle countries: We want you to do more to stop the  flow of illegal immigration. We are going to be conditioning some of  our policies toward you, unless and until you do a better job stopping  the flow of illegal immigration. It is a real problem on our southern  border.   That happens all the time, and when there is something legitimate to  look into, there could be a situation where the United States would  say: You've got to do better on corruption. You've got to do better on  these specific areas of corruption, or we are not going to be able to  keep the same relationship with you.   One example like that, I believe it was pointed out that aid was held  up to Afghanistan. President Trump held up aid to Afghanistan  specifically because of concerns about corruption. In situations like  that, there would be nothing wrong whatsoever with conditioning one  policy approach on a foreign country modifying their policy to be more  in line, to attune more directly to U.S. foreign interests. That is  what foreign policy is all about. That could arise in situations of  even calling for investigations.   I think it is interesting to point out that in May of 2018, three  Democratic Senators sent a letter to the then-prosecutor in Ukraine  suggesting that we have heard some things that you might not be  cooperating with the Mueller investigation. And there was sort of an  implicit indication behind the letter that there is not going to be as  much support for Ukraine. This is something that is important. You have  got to be helping with that investigation.   There is nothing wrong with encouraging the prosecutor general to  assist with something important to the United States. That is part of  foreign policy. It happens all the time. So to the extent that the  Blagojevich case is relevant, it is in the general concept that were  there some linkage between ``we want your country to pursue these  policies; it is going to affect our policies towards you,'' that is  entirely legitimate. That is not something that is a violation of any  law or is improper. Again, coming back to the point here, there is no  proof of that linkage. There no proof of what we have come to call  ``quid pro quo'' in this case.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Washington.
