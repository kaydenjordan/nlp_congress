Our citizen-soldiers embody a spirit of service and the best of  American patriotism, and this loss is felt deeply throughout Idaho. All  three were soldiers, husbands, and fathers who left an enduring legacy  of service and strength. Chief Warrant Officer 4 Anderson's, Chief  Warrant Officer 3 Laubhan's, and Chief Warrant Officer 3 Peltzer's  service and sacrifices will not be forgotten, and their selflessness  will continue to serve as an example for all of us. We extend our  deepest condolences to the families and friends of these heroic men,  including their fellow guardsmen. Our prayers are with their wives and  children, friends and loved ones, and fellow soldiers in the Idaho  National Guard as they grieve this tragic loss. Each of us owes a deep  debt of gratitude to our Idaho Army National Guardsmen. Their service  on behalf of Idaho and the Nation is second to none, and we thank them  for their countless sacrifices to keep us safe. Our State and our  country mourn the passing of three of our heroes.   In closing, the following poem titled ``Above the Purple Sage'' was  written by Major Andrew Whipple, retired, an Idaho veteran, to pay  tribute to the pilots and help lift the hearts of those mourning their  loss:         ``From field and farm,        From small town and large;        Their dreams all the same,        To answer the charge.        They dreamed of the feel of wind in their faces,        To roam the places of old story book Aces.        Leaving the ground the Flying Knights rose,        The city lights behind them,        Their nerves so composed.        Above the Purple Sage they soared;        Their friendships and bonds not easily forged.        While many lay dreaming and safe in their beds,        The three Knights rose higher,        From the ground they had shed.        The Purple Sage below them,        They flew higher and higher;        The night sky around them,        There was nothing so finer.        These three Knights of the Air,        Together they flew;        But alas all was quiet,        Except the coming of the dawning dew.        Their journey to soar,        To protect those behind;        It came to an end,        But forever entwined.        Their journey continues,        Their flight it goes on;        With Aces and others dreamers,        Fly on--Fly on!''                            ____________________
