 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, if you know anything about Michigan, you  know we love our cars. We put the world on wheels, and we have been  keeping Michigan moving ever since. But recently this love affair has  hit a rough patch.   Nearly everyone in Michigan drives--to work, to school, and to the  lake on the weekends, and it is getting warmer and warmer to be able to  do that. And high gas prices have made this Michigan way of life a lot  more expensive.   I am thinking of the driver who uses his own car to deliver meals and  other essentials to families in Detroit. Gas prices have gone up so  much, he is barely breaking even. I am thinking of the student who  drives 40 minutes every day to attend classes at Michigan Tech in  Houghton. She is training for a great career, but the price at the pump  is cutting into the money she needs to pay her tuition and her rent.  And I am thinking about farmers. Fuel is absolutely essential to power  our tractors and produce fertilizer and keep the world fed.   But income is tight even in the good times, and in the tight times,  the folks who grow our food can struggle to fill their own  refrigerators.   High fuel prices hurt Michigan families, our businesses, and our  economy. And that is why it is so frustrating when oil and gas  companies make choices that keep prices high to boost their own bottom  lines.   It is true that part of the reason gas prices are so high is because  demand is so high. Thanks to President Biden and Democrats in Congress,  our economy came roaring back from COVID-19. Now, with all the  challenges of the supply chains and the cost issues we are dealing  with--but the foundation of our economy is strong, and that is a good  thing.   But a roaring economy requires energy, and production isn't keeping  pace. It is not that we don't have enough oil. In fact, the United  States is the world's largest oil-producing country. And we could be  producing more. There are currently 9,000 approved oil leases that the  oil companies aren't even using. Yet the oil companies have made a  conscious decision to hold back production, to raise prices, and pad  the pockets of their shareholders. One CEO even admitted as much last  month when he said that his company is ``capturing value from higher  prices for gas.''   Let me translate that. ``Capturing value from high prices for gas''  really means taking money out of your pocket and my pocket and putting  it into the pockets of their shareholders.   It is working for them. His company's revenue nearly tripled during  the fourth quarter, and they are not alone. In fact, the 25 largest oil  and gas companies raked in $205 billion in profits last year--$205  billion in profits last year--while price-gouging now at the pump.   And they used that money to buy back $40 billion of their own stock  and pay their shareholders and top executives $50 billion in dividends.  And they are not particularly eager to pass on any savings to anybody  else, unfortunately.   It is interesting. The last time a barrel of oil was $96, gas was  $3.62 a gallon. Last week, a barrel of oil was again $96, but this time  gas was $4.31 a gallon.   What is the difference?   Well, the truth is, they set the price based on what they can get  away with,  [[Page S1726]]  arguing a global economy and supply and so on, a supply which they  determine, and they set the price with what they think they can get.  And that is called price-gouging right now; taking advantage of  situations around the world, our willingness to sacrifice to be part of  supporting the Ukrainians and what is happening.   And instead of doing their part to maybe say: OK, $205 billion in  profits last year, pretty good. OK. Maybe we can, like, do our part  here--instead, the prices at the pump go up and up and up, and it has  got to stop.   A single mom of three in Michigan is standing at a gas pump right now  with a knot in her stomach, watching her bill go up and up and her  monthly budget for everything else go down.   So that is the problem. What is the solution?   First of all, the Senate Commerce Committee is calling for the CEOs  of the major oil companies to testify before the committee, and I am  really looking forward to that hearing and what they have to say for  themselves on why. I want to thank the chairwoman, Chairwoman Cantwell,  and the committee for their leadership.   Secondly, I introduced the Gas Prices Relief Act with a number of my  Democratic colleagues. This gas tax holiday is immediate relief--yes,  short term, but it would save Michigan drivers nearly $650 million at  the pump this year.   I also think it is about time to stop subsidizing these oil companies  that are doing just fine on their own. They don't need our tax dollars  to subsidize them anymore. For more than 100 years, Congress has given  major, permanent tax benefits to the fossil fuel industry. This decade,  they have received $35 billion in fossil fuel-related tax breaks. Do  the American people really need to keep subsidizing an industry whose  pollution is responsible for creating the global climate crisis, all  the while enjoying record profits and picking people's pockets? The  answer is no. Yet our Republican colleagues stand with the oil  companies over and over again.   I just came from an Environmental and Public Works Committee meeting  on this very topic and heard over and over again the rationale for  letting the oil and gas companies keep doing what they are already  doing with no accountability and no real effort for us to move in the  direction of clean energy where we need to move.   Most importantly, it is time to shift to new clean sources of energy.  For more than 100 years, scientists have known that burning fossil  fuels creates carbon pollution that builds up in our atmosphere, and  that traps heat. It just stays there. For more than 100 years, we just  kept on burning fossil fuels anyway. And the industry has spent  billions trying to convince us it is not really happening. We really  aren't seeing the climate change. No, this isn't happening. Don't look  up.   Well, it is time for a change. We can start by using more homegrown  and cleaner burning biofuels to save consumers money. It is time to  allow the year-round sale of E15--a change I have encouraged the  administration to make. According to the Renewable Fuels Association,  E15 is 10 to 15 cents per gallon less than standard gasoline and  cleaner.   There is no time like the present to accelerate our shift to clean  energy production, which I know the Presiding Officer cares deeply  about and has been a leader in, and the use of electric vehicles. We  know that part of that is moving to clean energy electricity--power as  well as electric transportation. Both are very, very important.   Buying an amazing Michigan-made EV means you can drive right on by  the gas station. You don't even have to stop. That is what I am looking  forward to. You don't even have to pay attention to what is on the  sign--won't matter.   The exciting thing is, we can take action to make this happen more  quickly by ensuring that electric vehicles are affordable for more  families and, critically, that they are built right here in America-- not in China, not somewhere else around the world, in America--and I am  laser-focused on making that happen.   The good news is, we will tackle the climate crisis at the same time  because the transportation sector is the single largest source of  carbon pollution.   Shockingly, a few weeks ago, a fossil fuel executive said this about  his industry:         You've made a promise to be more disciplined about getting       cash back to shareholders with these dividends. The question       is, are you going to keep your promise? Or are you going to       be patriotic?    Hmm. It is pretty clear whose side the oil companies are on, and it  isn't the side of the American people. It is time for them to stop  price-gouging and try a little patriotism.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am here today with my great friend,  the senior Senator from Missouri, to talk about an issue we both care  passionately about and that we have partnered on now for a number of  years.   I ask unanimous consent to proceed in a colloquy with Senator Blunt.    Mr. President, on October 31, 2013, Senator Blunt and I  stood here on the Senate floor to mark a very important anniversary. It  was 50 years to the day after President Kennedy signed into law the  Community Mental Health Act. It was the last piece of legislation he  was ever able to sign.   As we know, his life was tragically cut short, and one important part  of his life's work, that of providing full funding for comprehensive  mental health services in the community, never came to happen. Instead,  behavioral health is funded far too often through grants, and while  these grants are important, they are just not enough.   You would never say to somebody who needed heart bypass surgery,  ``Yep, you need surgery, but so sorry; the grant ran out,'' which is  what happens to someone with a mental health crisis or an addiction all  the time. You wouldn't say to somebody with bipolar disorder or  substance abuse--well, we actually would say, ``So sorry; the grant ran  out,'' and we should not be saying that.   Why should healthcare above the neck be funded differently than  healthcare below the neck?   This is something that Senator Blunt and I started to work on. We  know that that should not be true. Healthcare is healthcare. President  Kennedy understood this, and so does my friend Senator Blunt.   Right, Senator Blunt?    Senator Blunt, I couldn't agree with you more.   I don't know about you, but when we first started and knew this was  going to be a step-by-step process, we weren't able to go nationwide.  We had to prove the concept would work with, really, providing  comprehensive services, not just what is done in most States, like in  Michigan, where there was Medicaid funding for people who were  seriously mentally ill, but if you weren't seriously mentally ill,  there was no support for anybody else.   So doing a concept like federally qualified health centers, which I  have been so proud to be your partner on--where you say, ``OK. If you  meet high standards, we will fully fund your capacity then to provide  services if you meet high standards''--is what the whole point is.  After only 2 years of doing that with the eight States' demonstration  project, I was really blown away, and I think you were, too, in that,  after only 2 years, the kind of results that they were able to get were  so meaningful. HHS--by the way, both Democratic and Republican  Presidents have embraced this and supported this, which has been  wonderful. But, after only 2 years, they found 63 percent fewer  emergency room visits.   I remember being in one of the press conferences we did with a police  chief from Oklahoma, who was talking about how it was so difficult if  they had someone who needed care. They would drive hours and go sit in  the emergency room with them, and an officer would be off of their  regular duties all day, sitting with somebody in the emergency room.   So, with a 63-percent reduction in the number of folks sitting in the  emergency room because they couldn't get help and then to have a 60- percent reduction in the amount of time in jail, I am not surprised  that sheriffs and police chiefs and law enforcement officials across  the country are our biggest supporters in terms of having comprehensive  community behavioral health clinics. They want people to get help. They  don't want them going to jail, just sitting in jail.   The other thing that was so important, I thought, was that there was  about a 41-percent decrease in homelessness. Oftentimes, with the iPad  that you are talking about, there may be someone on the ground, on the  street, and an officer will be asked to respond. The fact that they can  put someone--a social worker or a psychologist or someone--on the iPad,  on FaceTime, basically, to talk to someone and get an initial diagnosis  of what is going on, what kind of help they need, where they should go,  and so on has been so effective and I know, for law enforcement, such a  relief in that they have tools that they can use, and we are seeing  that over and over again.   One of the things we require, of course, is to be able to get this  full funding as healthcare so that you have a 24-hour psychiatric  crisis operation, which I think has been one of the most important  pieces of it.   I don't know about you, but the results, to me, have been amazing,  and we now have 10 States in the demonstration projects, and we are  ready to offer this opportunity to States across the country.    I agree.   You know, when I think about COVID and all the increased stress on  children and young people and, as you said, the increase in number of  suicides--all the pressure is on everyone, from those on the frontlines  who are taking care of patients in the hospitals and the stress of  families and so on.   We know that it is even more important that we eliminate the stigma  of what it means to ask for help--mental health help--or if you have an  addiction to be able to ask for help.   It is not enough just to eliminate the stigma; you have to have the  service. You have to have the service in the community. It has to be  quality services. It has to be funded in a structural way where you are  supporting the staff and, again, modeling this after community health  centers, which are widely supported--every community in the country,  strong bipartisan support.   By our picking up that model and basically saying, We need to do that  for mental health and addiction as well as physical health, we are just  extending something that has shown such success in the community. And  now, because of what has happened and all the pressures of COVID and so  on, it is even more important that folks who need help can be able to  get that.   You know I think of someone who has struggled with addiction their  whole life and they finally get the courage up; they are going to ask  for help. The ability to walk into a clinic and say, ``I need help''  and to have somebody say, ``Come on in''----    Right.    Right.    Absolutely.   And we invite all of our colleagues to join us. We have a great  bipartisan effort going on with our Excellence in Mental Health and  Addiction Treatment legislation of 2021 that would open the door for  all States. We know that many, many States and certainly local  communities are very interested. We can do this. We can actually get  this done.   When I heard the President speaking about this, I know I had a big  smile on my face--and I think you as well, Senator Blunt. We were like,  All right, this is the next step.    I am so excited to see the President agreeing with this  and speaking about it in his State of the Union. I am looking forward  to his including this in his budget, which will be coming out very  soon, and his supporting and embracing a nationwide program.   I am just so very, very pleased that this is a model that, frankly,  has survived both Democratic and Republican Presidents, Republicans,  Democrats, House Members, Senate Members, local communities, Governors  because it works. Everybody is looking at this. Everybody is looking at  this.    Yes.    It really is about families.   So, Mr. President, I just want to close by saying I am so grateful  for the partnership that Senator Blunt and I have had. He thinks he is  retiring at the end of the year. I am actually going to put him in a  closet and not let him leave because he has been such a champion both  in his role on appropriations as well as partnering for long-term  funding. This is important; this is something real and tangible and  meaningful that we can all do together; and I am excited and hopeful we  are going to take the next step this year together.    Absolutely. Thank you.
