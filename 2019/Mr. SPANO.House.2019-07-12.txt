 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express grave concern with  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.   Every year, Congress is tasked with funding our military. These funds  do everything from feeding our troops to equipping them for combat, to  giving them and their families medical care.   Because this funding is of such vital importance for our troops and  our national security, these bills normally pass through Congress with  wide bipartisan support.   However, despite the President, senior military officials, and a  bipartisan Senate all agreeing on a funding level, House leadership has  proposed a bill $15 billion less than what experts say is required.   This bill represents one of the worst political games I have seen in  this House. It puts our servicemembers at risk and leaves our entire  Nation vulnerable by underfunding personnel accounts, vital  modernization initiatives, and deterrence against foreign aggression.   I call upon this House to follow us in this lead to set aside our  differences and authorize these programs at the levels needed to  protect our troops and our Nation.                            ____________________
