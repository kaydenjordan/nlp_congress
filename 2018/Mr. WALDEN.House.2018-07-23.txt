 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues Mr. Gene Green  and, certainly, Dr. Burgess for their great leadership on this issue.   I rise is support of H.R. 5385, the Dr. Benjy Frances Brooks  Children's HOSPITAL GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2018, and I want  to thank them for their good work on this.   As you have heard, this reauthorizes payments to children's hospitals  that operate graduate medical education programs, and it does so for  the next 5 years, giving these programs great certainty going forward.  This legislation will continue to enable the Nation's freestanding  children's hospitals to provide education to graduates of medical  schools, enhance pediatric research capabilities, and care for these  vulnerable and underserved children.                                time  1500    Representative Green and Chairman Burgess partnered to lead this  bipartisan bill in our committee, and they brought about unanimous  votes in both the Health Subcommittee and in our full committee. I  appreciate their work on this and thank them and their staffs for the  great work they all have done as we work together to reauthorize these  very, very important programs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support us in this legislation  from the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1676) to amend the Public Health Service Act to increase the  number of permanent faculty in palliative care at accredited allopathic  and osteopathic medical schools, nursing schools, social work schools,  and other programs, including physician assistant education programs,  to promote education and research in palliative care and hospice, and  to support the development of faculty careers in academic palliative  medicine, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1676         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Palliative Care and Hospice       Education and Training Act''.       SEC. 2. PALLIATIVE CARE AND HOSPICE EDUCATION AND TRAINING.

SEC. 5. CLARIFICATION.

SEC. 6. ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH IN PALLIATIVE CARE.         (a) In General.--Part B of title IV of the Public Health       Service Act (42 U.S.C. 284 et seq.) is amended by adding at       the end the following new section:       ``SEC. 409K. ENHANCING RESEARCH IN PALLIATIVE CARE.         ``The Secretary, acting through the Director of the       National Institutes of Health, shall develop and implement a       strategy to be applied across the institutes and centers of       the National Institutes of Health to expand and intensify       national research programs in palliative care in order to       address the quality of care and quality of life for the       rapidly growing population of patients in the United States       with serious or life-threatening illnesses, including cancer;       heart, kidney, liver, lung, and infectious diseases; as well       as neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, Parkinson's       disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.''.        (b) Expanding Trans-NIH Research Reporting To Include       Palliative Care Research.--Section 402A(c)(2)(B) of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 282a(c)(2)(B)) is       amended by inserting ``and, beginning January 1, 2019, for       conducting or supporting research with respect to palliative       care'' after ``or national centers''.       SEC. 7. CUT-GO OFFSET.         The total amount authorized to be appropriated to the       Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services for each       of fiscal years 2019 through 2023 is the amount that is       $20,000,000 below the total amount appropriated to such       Office for fiscal year 2018.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1676. As we have heard,  this is the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act, and  it is sponsored by my colleague from New York, Representative Eliot  Engel.   This bipartisan legislation will authorize the Department of Health  and Human Services to award grants or contracts for palliative care and  hospice education centers, promote the career development of nurses and  physicians in palliative care, and promote research and outreach in the  delivery of care for patients with serious or life-threatening  illnesses at the National Institutes of Health.   Now, I have heard about this bill's impact from palliative care  specialists and disease advocates all across Oregon. Dawn Frazier in  Bend, Oregon, told me about her daughter, Rhonda, who tragically passed  away at the age of 34. She suffered from early onset Alzheimer's.   In an opinion piece that Dawn had published in the Bend Bulletin, she  wrote: ``Palliative and hospice care are vital services for people with  Alzheimer's and other dementias. For people with advanced dementia,  team-based care--which focuses on managing and easing symptoms,  reducing pain and stress, and increasing comfort--improves quality of  life, controls costs, and enhances patient and family satisfaction.''   She wrote: ``Here in Oregon, 19 percent of people in hospice have a  primary diagnosis of dementia. Yet, the availability and quality of  palliative and hospice care is a concern.''   Dawn went on to say that this bill will help make critical palliative  care and hospice services available to millions of patients across the  country.   I have long been a supporter of this bipartisan legislation and  programs for palliative and hospice care. My own parents both received  valuable care in this regard, especially hospice care, as their lives  came to a close.   This is all part of why I am a cosponsor, along with 284 of my  colleagues in the House, and why I have worked with Representative  Engel and our subcommittee chair on the Energy and Commerce  Subcommittee for Health, Chairman Burgess, to move this legislation  forward in the Energy and Commerce Committee, where, by the way, it  received unanimous votes in both our Health Subcommittee and in our  full committee.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  important measure. Let's advance our public health.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Reed), who has been a real leader on this issue and several  others related to healthcare, and especially on diabetes.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will close by again thanking my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle. Thanks to the gentleman from New York, the  gentleman from Texas, my colleagues on this side of the aisle. I know  Dr. Phil Roe, who chairs our Veterans' Affairs Committee, a very strong  advocate and supporter of this, could not be here to speak on it  because of a conflict.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say this is really important. It will change  lives. It will improve lives. With that, I hope our colleagues will  join us in supporting this very important measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 959, the Title  VIII Nursing Workforce Reauthorization Act of 2018. I'd like to thank  Representative David Joyce for his work on this important bill. It is  one of four bipartisan public health bills the House will vote on  today, each of which passed through the Energy and Commerce Committee  unanimously at both the Health Subcommittee and our full committee.   H.R. 959 would reauthorize nursing workforce development programs,  which support the recruitment, retention, and advanced education of  skilled nursing professionals. The bill extends advanced education  nursing grants to support clinical nurse specialists and clinical nurse  leaders, defines nurse-managed health clinics, adds clinical nurse  specialists to the National Advisory Council on Nurse Education, and  reauthorizes loan repayments, scholarships, and grants for education,  practice, quality, and retention.   In rural areas of the country, like my district in Oregon, nurses  play an especially critical role in our health care delivery system,  and they've told me about the importance of this legislation. That's  why it's critical we reauthorize these programs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill
