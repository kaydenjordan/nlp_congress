 Madam President, I am honored to recognize Lauren  Caulfield and Ronda Chrystal of Brookline as November's Granite Staters  of the Month. The pair founded Pink Revolution in order to support  cancer patients with chemo care packages and financial support.   When Lauren was being treated for breast cancer, she noticed that not  every patient had the same level of support that she did during this  difficult time. Some were arriving to chemotherapy sessions alone or  had to skip sessions because they couldn't afford it. After her  recovery, Lauren decided she wanted to take action, and alongside her  longtime friend Ronda, she founded Pink Revolution Breast Cancer  Alliance of NH to support patients with all types of cancer.   Lauren and Ronda started by reaching out to friends and family  touched by cancer and ultimately built a network of volunteers to put  together 1,500 chemo care packages a year to deliver to 25 oncology  centers in New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts. The care packages  contain essential items such as blankets, tissues, and lip balm, as  well as some items with personal touches, such as hats knitted by  residents at nursing homes. In addition, the nonprofit fundraises to  provide chemo patients--some of whom struggle with costs during their  treatment--with gas and grocery cards.   After undergoing chemotherapy, Lauren decided to find the silver  lining in her experience by helping others. With their hard work over  the past 4 years, Lauren and Ronda have made a true difference in many  Granite Staters' lives as they face serious medical hardship. Lauren  and Ronda's work leading Pink Revolution exemplifies the Granite State  spirit of generosity, and I commend them and their large network of  volunteers.                            ____________________
